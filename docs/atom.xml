&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PALO ALTO CA, November 1, 2017 –&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; the world’s leading and most secure platform for outsourced research and development (R&amp;amp;D), announced today that company CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., has been selected as an Executive of the Year finalist in the prestigious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripawards.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2017 Scrip Awards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr. Iorns is one of six C-level executives recognized in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Executive of the Year category for private companies or those with a market capitalization of &amp;lt;$1 billion. This awards category acknowledges excellence in the leadership of large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A cancer researcher herself, Iorns co-founded Science Exchange in 2011 to streamline R&amp;amp;D outsourcing and facilitate access to qualified, innovative scientific service providers. Because of the robust platform’s clear benefits to R&amp;amp;D organizations, she has successfully negotiated enterprise-level agreements between Science Exchange and many of the world’s top biopharma companies, as well as with numerous biotech and pharma startup incubators. Over the past year, in addition to expanding the company’s reach into other R&amp;amp;D reliant industries like agrisciences and cosmetics, Iorns led the a successful Series C venture capital funding round, bringing an additional $28 million of investment that will allow Science Exchange to accelerate its impressive growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Iorns is also the co-director of the Reproducibility Initiative, and is a part-time partner at Y Combinator. She has a Ph.D. in Cancer Biology from the Institute of Cancer Research (UK), and before starting Science Exchange was an Assistant Professor at the University of Miami, where she remains an Adjunct Professor. She has been recognized previously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;as one of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nature’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; “Ten People that Mattered” and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;WIRED’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; “50 Women Who Are Changing The World.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In its 13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; year, the Scrip Awards program recognizes the key roles that pharmaceutical, biotech and other related industries play in improving healthcare around the world.

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/01/psychedelics-and-drug-addiction/"/>

		<updated>2017-11-01T15:00:37+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Overindulgence in anything can be intoxicating, even if it is something as essential as water. Though we all try to rationalize these things, sometimes we simply fail. Gone are the days when the word “addiction” was associated with some poorer and less educated parts of society. It is a fact that today substance abuse is equally prevalent among successful and intelligent people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Psychiatric Association defines addiction as something that a person keeps indulging in despite the harmful consequences of overindulgence. The person has a compulsion or focus on taking that particular substance or practicing that particular habit. Addiction results in distorted thinking, it changes behavior and body functions. This addiction leads to changes in wiring of the brain. Addiction is also characterized by building up tolerance, meaning that a person needs higher doses with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two broad reasons for addiction, psychological and physiological. The psychological component is present in every addiction, as a person seeks and gets pleasure from his or her addiction. Some seek enjoyment, others look for stress relief. Some people even believe that addiction improves their performance, mental or physical. Physiological addiction develops when the body becomes dependent on the substance for normal functioning. For example, long time smokers have a problem with bowel movement after quitting the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, addiction can be treated, but only if a person is willing to get rid of it. After all, it has lots to do with the habit forming, pleasure-seeking nature of humans, a part of the physiological dependence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the effectiveness of addiction therapy is very low because few people sincerely wish to give up their addiction. Consciously or not, many addicts look for an excuse to continue.  Statistics show that as few as 10% of people who attempts to quit their addiction actually succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of psychedelic drugs is banned almost universally, even scientific studies on their effects are prohibited in most countries. Nonetheless, it appears that some specific properties of psychedelics can be used to successfully treat a variety of addictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic here is to use one mind-altering agent to overcome dependence on another. The dose makes the poison: a poisonous compound can be an efficient medicine when used at the right dosage. Psychedelic drugs may help to cure addiction when they are used under controlled conditions and at the right dose. This is precisely what many researchers are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychedelic drugs differ from other addictive drugs in their mind alternating properties: they alter thinking processes and perception through their action on serotonin receptors. They are known to change the level of consciousness experienced. People taking these drugs feel as if they are in a kind of trance. Some of the conventional psychedelic drugs include “magic mushroom” hallucinogens (psilocybin), LSD, and mescaline. There has been several trials and observational studies showing that these drugs are capable of altering the brain by resetting thinking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ibogaine&lt;/em&gt; is one such psychedelic drug that is being studied. It is a potent hallucinogen that brings various memories and experiences to the person taking it that has been traditionally used in shamanic rituals in western Africa. Many underground clinics for treatment of severe drug addiction have reported the wonderful effects of even a single dose of this plant-derived drug. But this drug is highly toxic, and many pharmaceutical companies are trying to come up with an analogue that is safe for humans, free from hallucinogenic effect, and still has potency to treat addiction. Very little is known about the mode of action of this drug. Moreover, some people in the scientific community think that only natural ibogaine will have the desired properties. Medical professionals caution against the use of this drug in underground clinics, as ibogaine is known to cause seizures and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another natural compound that shows promising results in the treatment of drug addiction and some psychiatric illnesses is &lt;em&gt;psilocybin&lt;/em&gt;, a compound found in magic mushrooms. A recent small scale proof-of-concept trial done by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, demonstrated that the drug can help lifelong smokers to quit the habit. The therapy with psilocybin worked much better than any other currently known forms of anti-smoking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study, psilocybin was used to treat alcohol addiction. This study was rather specific, as only people with the most extreme cases of alcohol addiction were accepted for the trial. Though this was a small scale study, it had terrific results in overcoming the years of alcohol addiction and completely changing the outlook for the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSD is perhaps one of the best-known psychedelics. It is used as a recreational and addictive drug, although it was banned in the 1960s and 1970s in most countries around the globe. But very few people know that LSD is the most intensively tested in clinical trials for the treatment of addictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the large-scale studies performed in six hospitals across Saskatchewan, Canada, more than 1000 alcoholics were treated for their addiction with LSD. The study enrolled people known to be resistant to other forms of treatment for addiction, people with broken lives, former prisoners, and people with severely damaged health. The majority of those treated with LSD were able to stay away from alcohol for quite a long time. In fact, the researchers reported a success rate of 70%. Considering the statistics and the scale of the study, this is not something to be neglected. However, due to the criminalization of LSD, it could neither be used for treatment of alcohol addiction, nor could further clinical trials could be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind that psychedelic drugs have consistently provided excellent results in the treatment of various addictions, we should probably reconsider the total ban on their use for research and medical purposes. One future direction could be the development of synthetic analogues of psychedelics with lesser side effects but similar mind-altering properties. Taking into account the growing epidemics of opioid addiction in the US, psychedelics should be seriously considered for their potential to contribute positively to the solution for this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Can psychology help us avoid procrastinating and get on with the important things we know we should be doing?&lt;/strong&gt; Our presenter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; hears about what causes procrastination, how to stop it, and whether it has any upsides. Also, we put the psychologists on the spot and ask whether they’ve managed to cure their own procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guests are the world experts in the psychology of procrastination &lt;a href=&quot;https://carleton.ca/psychology/people/timothy-a-pychyl/&quot;&gt;Professor Tim Pychyl&lt;/a&gt; at Carleton University and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academic/fuschia-sirois&quot;&gt;Dr Fuschia Sirois&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

 Our growing awareness of the microbial world’s importance and diversity contrasts starkly with our limited understanding of its fundamental structure. Despite recent advances in DNA sequencing, a lack of standardized protocols and common analytical frameworks impedes comparisons among studies, hindering the development of global inferences about microbial life on Earth. Here we present a meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at an unprecedented scale. The result is both a reference database giving global context to DNA sequence data and a framework for incorporating data from future studies, fostering increasingly complete characterization of Earth’s microbial diversity.

 &lt;p&gt;Copy-number variants of chromosome 16 region 16p11.2 are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders and are among the most prevalent in autism spectrum disorders. Of many 16p11.2 genes, Kctd13 has been implicated as a major driver of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. The function of KCTD13 in the mammalian brain, however, remains unknown. Here we delete the Kctd13 gene in mice and demonstrate reduced synaptic transmission. Reduced synaptic transmission correlates with increased levels of Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), a KCTD13/CUL3 ubiquitin ligase substrate, and is reversed by RhoA inhibition, suggesting increased RhoA as an important mechanism. In contrast to a previous knockdown study, deletion of Kctd13 or kctd13 does not increase brain size or neurogenesis in mice or zebrafish, respectively. These findings implicate Kctd13 in the regulation of neuronal function relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and clarify the role of Kctd13 in neurogenesis and brain size. Our data also reveal a potential role for RhoA as a therapeutic target in disorders associated with KCTD13 deletion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24470&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24470&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/S6y6qGdeZgc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;
             Membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells mediates the biogenesis of organelles, vesicular
                traffic between them, and exo- and endocytosis of important signalling molecules,
                such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Distinct tasks in intracellular membrane
                fusion have been assigned to conserved protein systems. Tethering proteins mediate
                the initial recognition and attachment of membranes, whereas SNARE (soluble
                N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein
                complexes are considered as the core fusion engine. SNARE complexes provide
                mechanical energy to distort membranes and drive them through a hemifusion
                intermediate towards the formation of a fusion pore. This last
                step is highly energy-demanding. Here we combine the in
                    vivo and in vitro fusion of yeast vacuoles with molecular simulations
                to show that tethering proteins are critical for overcoming the final energy barrier
                to fusion pore formation. SNAREs alone drive vacuoles only into the hemifused state.
                Tethering proteins greatly increase the volume of SNARE complexes and deform the
                site of hemifusion, which lowers the energy barrier for pore opening and provides
                the driving force. Thereby, tethering proteins assume a crucial mechanical role in
                the terminal stage of membrane fusion that is likely to be conserved at multiple
                steps of vesicular traffic. We therefore propose that SNAREs and tethering proteins
                should be considered as a single, non-dissociable device that drives fusion. The
                core fusion machinery may then be larger and more complex than previously
                thought.

 Forest edges influence more than half of the world’s forests and contribute to worldwide declines in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, predicting these declines is challenging in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes. Here we assembled a global dataset on species responses to fragmentation and developed a statistical approach for quantifying edge impacts in heterogeneous landscapes to quantify edge-determined changes in abundance of 1,673 vertebrate species. We show that the abundances of 85% of species are affected, either positively or negatively, by forest edges. Species that live in the centre of the forest (forest core), that were more likely to be listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), reached peak abundances only at sites farther than 200–400 m from sharp high-contrast forest edges. Smaller-bodied amphibians, larger reptiles and medium-sized non-volant mammals experienced a larger reduction in suitable habitat than other forest-core species. Our results highlight the pervasive ability of forest edges to restructure ecological communities on a global scale.

 &lt;p&gt;Both language and genes evolve by transmission over generations with opportunity for differential replication of forms. The understanding that gene frequencies change at random by genetic drift, even in the absence of natural selection, was a seminal advance in evolutionary biology. Stochastic drift must also occur in language as a result of randomness in how linguistic forms are copied between speakers. Here we quantify the strength of selection relative to stochastic drift in language evolution. We use time series derived from large corpora of annotated texts dating from the 12th to 21st centuries to analyse three well-known grammatical changes in English: the regularization of past-tense verbs, the introduction of the periphrastic ‘do’, and variation in verbal negation. We reject stochastic drift in favour of selection in some cases but not in others. In particular, we infer selection towards the irregular forms of some past-tense verbs, which is likely driven by changing frequencies of rhyming patterns over time. We show that stochastic drift is stronger for rare words, which may explain why rare forms are more prone to replacement than common ones. This work provides a method for testing selective theories of language change against a null model and reveals an underappreciated role for stochasticity in language evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24455&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24455&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/lETLdRLqdMo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Acquired drug resistance prevents cancer therapies from achieving stable and complete responses. Emerging evidence implicates a key role for non-mutational drug resistance mechanisms underlying the survival of residual cancer ‘persister’ cells. The persister cell pool constitutes a reservoir from which drug-resistant tumours may emerge. Targeting persister cells therefore presents a therapeutic opportunity to impede tumour relapse. We previously found that cancer cells in a high mesenchymal therapy-resistant cell state are dependent on the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 for survival. Here we show that a similar therapy-resistant cell state underlies the behaviour of persister cells derived from a wide range of cancers and drug treatments. Consequently, we demonstrate that persister cells acquire a dependency on GPX4. Loss of GPX4 function results in selective persister cell ferroptotic death in vitro and prevents tumour relapse in mice. These findings suggest that targeting of GPX4 may represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent acquired drug resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24297&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24297&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/g0BHzg5hnKc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;
 For the initiation of transcription, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) assembles with general transcription factors on promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PIC and PIC–core Mediator complex at nominal resolutions of 4.7 Å and 5.8 Å, respectively. The structures reveal transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), and suggest how the core and kinase TFIIH modules function in the opening of promoter DNA and the phosphorylation of Pol II, respectively. The TFIIH core subunit Ssl2 (a homologue of human XPB) is positioned on downstream DNA by the ‘E-bridge’ helix in TFIIE, consistent with TFIIE-stimulated DNA opening. The TFIIH kinase module subunit Tfb3 (MAT1 in human) anchors the kinase Kin28 (CDK7), which is mobile in the PIC but preferentially located between the Mediator hook and shoulder in the PIC–core Mediator complex. Open spaces between the Mediator head and middle modules may allow access of the kinase to its substrate, the C-terminal domain of Pol II.

 &lt;p&gt;Nutrient limitation of oceanic primary production exerts a fundamental control on marine food webs and the flux of carbon into the deep ocean. The extensive boundaries of the oligotrophic sub-tropical gyres collectively define the most extreme transition in ocean productivity, but little is known about nutrient limitation in these zones. Here we present the results of full-factorial nutrient amendment experiments conducted at the eastern boundary of the South Atlantic gyre. We find extensive regions in which the addition of nitrogen or iron individually resulted in no significant phytoplankton growth over 48 hours. However, the addition of both nitrogen and iron increased concentrations of chlorophyll a by up to approximately 40-fold, led to diatom proliferation, and reduced community diversity. Once nitrogen–iron co-limitation had been alleviated, the addition of cobalt or cobalt-containing vitamin B12 could further enhance chlorophyll a yields by up to threefold. Our results suggest that nitrogen–iron co-limitation is pervasive in the ocean, with other micronutrients also approaching co-deficiency. Such multi-nutrient limitations potentially increase phytoplankton community diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24063&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24063&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/WwSqLQQrNLk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/heart-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) varies greatly among individuals in the general population. Clinical variables like LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure do not always tell the whole story regarding an individual’s risk of developing CAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has shown that the level of coronary artery calcium (CAC) of a patient is a strong predictor of CAD, as well as lethal cardiac events, such as heart attacks. Identifying markers predictive of high CAC levels can be very helpful for identifying patients who are at greater risk and preventing accelerated progression of heart disease especially at an early age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent a particularly rich source of genetic variation (about 10 million SNPs are present in the human genome) making them ideal for establishing links between genetic variation and complex diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can one identify such markers that can predict individuals that are at a high risk of advanced CAC? With the recent advances in genomics, one possible route is utilizing genomic information from a pool of patients that include two subgroups representing the two extremes of the phenotypic distribution in the general population (i.e., no disease vs. advanced disease).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent a particularly rich source of genetic variation (about 10 million SNPs are present in the human genome) making them ideal for establishing links between genetic variation and complex diseases. A major challenge in building predictive models of complex diseases is their multifactorial nature that involves interactions between several genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, there has been increasing interest in the application of machine learning tools for disease predictions. These methods provide increased ability for integrating multiple data sources (e.g., clinical, genotypic, and transcriptomic) while utilizing potential linear and non-linear interactions between disease predictors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, we integrated clinical data and SNP genotype data into machine learning models to identify SNPs that are predictive of advanced CAC levels. We found 56 highly predictive SNPs in a discovery cohort, which were then tested in an independent replication cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two cohorts from ClinSeq® and the Framingham Heart Studies were composed of middle-aged Caucasian men due to their higher risk of advanced CAC in comparison with the rest of the population in the United States. The two extremes of the CAC distribution were equally represented in both cohorts (i.e., no CAC vs. extremely high levels of CAC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning tools hold promise for deriving predictive disease models and networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 of the 56 SNPs identified from the discovery cohort generated optimal predictive performance in both cohorts with two machine learning based modeling approaches, namely random forests and neural networks. When we tested these SNPs with patients who had intermediate CAC levels, the predictive performance dropped significantly. Hence, the high performance was specific to advanced CAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we utilized the GeneMANIA database to create a functional interaction network composed of genes on which the optimal subset of 21 SNPs were located, as well as additional genes previously reported to interact with these genes. Several genes involved in the production and inhibition of reactive oxygen species (a major driver of CAC and vascular aging) were present in this network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, our results showed that machine learning tools hold promise for deriving predictive disease models and networks. These tools are likely to play increasing roles in personalized medicine by helping practitioners design optimal treatment strategies and identify potential drug targets using genomic data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read an article about a controversial issue, do you think you’d realise if it had changed your beliefs? No one knows your own mind like you do – it seems obvious that you would know if your beliefs had shifted. And yet a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2017.1363792&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests that we actually have very poor “metacognitive awareness” of our own belief change, meaning that we will tend to underestimate how much we’ve been swayed by a convincing article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers Michael Wolfe and Todd Williams at Grand Valley State University said their findings could have implications for the public communication of science. “People may be less willing to meaningfully consider belief inconsistent material if they feel that their beliefs are unlikely to change as a consequence,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31724&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited over two hundred undergrads across two studies and focused on their beliefs about whether the spanking/smacking of kids is an effective form of discipline. The researchers chose this topic deliberately in the hope the students would be mostly unaware of the relevant research literature, and that they would express a varied range of relatively uncommitted initial beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students reported their initial beliefs about whether spanking is an effective way to discipline a child on a scale from “1” completely disbelieve to “9” completely believe. Several weeks later they were given one of two research-based texts to read: each was several pages long and either presented the arguments and data in favour of spanking or against spanking. After this, the students answered some questions to test their comprehension and memory of the text (these measures varied across the two studies). Then the students again scored their belief in whether spanking is effective or not (using the same 9-point scale as before). Finally, the researchers asked them to recall what their belief had been at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students’ belief about spanking changed when they read a text that argued against their own initial position. Crucially, their memory of their initial belief was shifted in the direction of their new belief – in fact, their memory was closer to their current belief than their original belief. The more their belief had changed, the larger this memory bias tended to be, suggesting the students were relying on their current belief to deduce their initial belief. The memory bias was unrelated to the measures of how well they’d understood or recalled the text, suggesting these factors didn’t play a role in memory of initial belief or awareness of belief change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big caveat is obviously that this research was about changes to mostly moderate beliefs – it’s likely the findings would be different in the context of changes to extreme or deeply held beliefs (this would be tricky to study because it will be more difficult to change these kind of beliefs). However, our beliefs on most topics are in the moderate range, and as we go about our daily lives reading informative material, these intriguing findings suggest we are mostly ignorant of how what we just read has updated and altered our own position.&lt;/p&gt;

Biologists use an enzyme called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase&quot;&gt;luciferase&lt;/a&gt;” — Lucifer has been described as the “light-bearing” fallen angel, hence the bioluminescence — to spot certain proteins by chromogenous reactions (Lodish et al., 2005, p. 92). ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how did the Devil get a foot — of course cloven (!) — into the door of the neurosciences?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demonic possession plays an important role, of course, even in modern day psychiatric nosology (see the debate over &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/possession-trance-disorder-in-dsm-5.html&quot;&gt;Possession Trance Disorder in DSM-5&lt;/a&gt;). Does it make any sense to use DSM-5 (or DSM-IV) criteria to diagnose spirit possession across cultures?

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/Bridging-the-gap-cropped-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you examine the effects of exercise on cancer-related-fatigue in adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer-related-fatigue is a major problem reported by both cancer patients and survivors (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21831025&quot;&gt;please see here for a review&lt;/a&gt;). While one may intuitively believe that exercise might increase cancer-related fatigue, it may be that exercise actually reduces it. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/&quot;&gt;numerous other benefits&lt;/a&gt; may be derived from exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9589&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9589 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/kelley-300x225.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Professor George Kelley, Director of the Meta-Analytic Research Group, at the West Virginia University&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a systematic review of previous systematic reviews with meta-analyses on exercise and cancer-related fatigue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple systematic reviews with meta-analysis on exercise and cancer-related fatigue now exist. As a result, there is a need to systematically review these previous reviews to aid decision-makers with the “state-of-the evidence”, provide researchers with direction for future research, and avoid unnecessary and redundant systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, on the same topic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-11-15&quot;&gt;One of the first articles&lt;/a&gt; written about this approach appeared in BMC Medical Research Methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 systematic reviews with meta-analyses that included as many as 3,245 participants, we concluded that a lack of certainty currently exists regarding the benefits of exercise on cancer-related fatigue in adult cancer patient and survivors. This conclusion was based partially on the fact that slightly more than half (52.7%) of the meta-analyses reported statistically significant improvements in cancer-related fatigue as a result of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While additional research is needed to see what specific subgroups, if any, may possibly benefit, exercise does not appear to increase cancer-related fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While additional research is needed to see what specific subgroups, if any, may possibly benefit, exercise does not appear to increase cancer-related fatigue, something that is probably important given the numerous other benefits that can be derived from exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were some of the challenges associated with conducting this type of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any systematic review of previous systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, one of the major challenges we faced were the subjective decisions that needed to be made with respect to categorizing and interpreting findings. For example, while we talked globally about cancer-related fatigue, different scales consisting of different scoring components and scoring methods were included, thereby potentially confounding findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some suggestions for best practices when conducting this type of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of previous systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, has also been described as an “umbrella review”, guidelines of which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26360830&quot;&gt;have been previously suggested&lt;/a&gt;. However, I prefer to describe this approach as a “systematic review of previous systematic reviews,” conduct analyses above and beyond the aforementioned guidelines, and follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prisma-statement.org/&quot;&gt;PRISMA guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, where applicable, for the conduct and reporting of such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and more broadly, I believe the following stepwise approach to systematically reviewing the literature currently makes sense given the proliferation of information in today’s world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) You have an idea about a systematic review with or without meta-analysis so you develop a protocol to conduct a systematic review of previous systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, and submit it to a trial registry such as PROSPERO (see here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) After you receive a registration number from a trial registry such as PROSPERO, you submit a detailed protocol to conduct a systematic review of previous systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, for publication consideration in a journal such as Systematic Reviews. I think it is also important for journals such as BMC Cancer to consider publishing such protocols in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) After the protocol is published, you conduct a systematic review of previous systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, submit it for publication consideration in a journal such as BMC Cancer, and include a decision on whether or not a new or updated systematic review with or without meta-analysis is needed on the topic you’re interested in. This decision could be based on one’s own subjective assessment based on the review, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048894&quot;&gt;the application of existing formulas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i3507.long&quot;&gt;previous guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, or some combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a decision is made that a new or updated systematic review, with or without meta-analysis, is needed, you would then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Develop a protocol to conduct your own systematic review with or without meta-analysis and submit it to a trial registry such as PROSPERO for a registration number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) After you receive a registration number from a trial registry such as PROSPERO, you submit a detailed protocol to conduct your own systematic review, with or without meta-analysis, for publication consideration in a journal such as Systematic Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) After the protocol is published, you conduct your own systematic review, with or without meta-analysis, and submit it for publication consideration in a journal such as BMC Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of information in today’s world now requires new approaches to synthesizing the literature. I am hopeful that others interested in cancer research will be motivated to utilize this approach in their own research endeavors to help advance their respect field(s) from both a research and applied “real-world” perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. George A. Kelley, DA, FACSM, is a tenured Full Professor and Director of the Meta-Analytic Research Group in the Department of Biostatistics at West Virginia University (WVU).  He came to WVU in 2002 from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Institute of Health Professions in Boston, MA. Dr. Kelley’s research includes, but is not limited to, use of the meta-analytic approach for examining the effects of exercise and physical activity on health-related disease. He has a consistent record of external funding as a Principal Investigator since 1998, including R01 funding. To date, he has authored more than 100 publications in peer-reviewed journals, more than 80% as first author, i.e., person who did the most work. In addition to his research, Dr. Kelley currently teaches a graduate course in Applied Biostatistics as well as an Introduction to Meta-analysis course. He has received the Distinguished Alumni Award from his Alma Mata, Boise State University as well as the Dean’s Award for Excellence in Research from the WVU School of Medicine. Dr. Kelley has also been a nominee for Teacher of the Year on several occasions as well as the WVU Benedum Distinguished Scholar Award and WVU Chancellor’s Award for Outstanding Achievement. He currently serves as a meta-analytic expert on six different journal’s editorial boards and in addition to his 80+ hour work week and with a belief in modeling the behavior of a Public Health professional, runs 3-7 miles per day, 3 times per week, cycles 20-50 miles per day, 3 times per week, resistance trains 3 times per week, and walks 5-7 times per week. He has been tracking his exercise and nutrition intake since 1980.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;My mother’s first fall, at age ninety-two, seemed like an accident. Her rubber-soled sandals caught on the carpet in the activities room of her senior apartment complex and she plunged forward catching her arm on the piano bench. After minor surgery to repair the wound, and a short hospital stay, she began a course of physician therapy; but the falls continued. Injuries were rare and minor. Still the increasing frequency was distressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I suggested a walker, Mom told me, “I don’t need one. I can walk perfectly well. I just lose my balance sometimes.” I puzzled over that response for days. Was it possible she didn’t remember all the falls? Did she really think she could walk safely without assistance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not until after she died that I came upon the concept of anosognosia, from the Greek a-without, nosos-disease, gnosis-knowledge: without (lack of) knowledge of disease. People with anosognosia are unaware of their illness or deficits. It is most often associated with mental illness and is the primary reason for medication non-compliance in psychiatric patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also affects seniors with age-related brain changes, including mild cognitive impairment. Unaware of her weakness and impaired balance, my mother had not understood that she couldn’t walk without falling. And because she did not believe she was impaired, she could not imagine why she should use a walker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anosognosia is often assessed with the Clinical Insight Rating (CIR) scale that identifies lack of knowledge/insight in four domains: understanding the reason for the visit (to the physician); awareness of cognitive deficit; awareness of functional deficit; and/or perception of disease progression. Mom’s lack of insight pertained to her functional deficit. Although her anosognosia resulted from an aging brain and associated (and increasing) cognitive impairment, she was sadly aware of her memory problems and disordered thoughts. People with more severe forms of dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease) are more likely to exhibit anosognosia of cognitive deficit, while those with mental illness, brain tumors, or stroke, often exhibit lack of awareness in multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought my mother’s refusal to accept help stemmed from her fierce independence. I knew she had trouble thinking clearly, but I still tried to reason with her, hoping that in time she would acknowledge her functional decline and her need for assistance. But neuropsychological testing shows that patients with anosognosia score lower on composite indices of both memory and executive function. Facts and evidence are not persuasive to anyone with a pathological lack of insight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I now understand that Mom’s falls probably signaled her progression to “mild cognitive impairment” or MCI. The Mayo Clinic defines MCI as an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more-serious decline of dementia; it is often assessed using the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE). Studies have shown that the rate of falls increases with each unit decrease in the MMSE, and that insight can be equally impaired in persons with MCI or more advanced dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish my mother had received a diagnosis of MCI, but it is not surprising that she didn’t. Most people with MCI can and do live independently, as my mother did, and are able to fulfill basic social roles. They are typically capable of most activities of daily living, although on close observation they take more time to complete them than unimpaired individuals. My mother’s mental decline was almost imperceptible at first, and as it progressed, I did not know enough to ask whether her symptoms were evidence of a specific diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing she had MCI would not have helped my mother, but it would have helped me. I would have done my research and uncovered her anosognosia. I would have realized that her reluctance to use a walker was grounded in her understanding of her abilities, wrong as that understanding was. I would have felt more comfortable taking over some of her decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a physical therapist convinced my mother to use the walker for one week, promising that she could stop if she didn’t like it. Within two days, she began referring to it as her Cadillac. After that, her rate of falling decreased substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experienced sports players aren’t just highly skilled at executing their own actions, they also have what often seems like a supernatural ability to read the game, to watch other players and anticipate what’s going to happen next. A clever &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-016-0804-z&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Research&lt;/em&gt; offers insight into the brain basis of this aspect of sporting ability – the findings suggest that expert basketball players simulate in their minds the actions of other players in something akin to slow-motion, presumably giving them more time to interpret and read the actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31608&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmelo Vicario and his colleagues recruited twenty female basketball players with an average of 12 years playing experience, and they compared their performance on two perceptual tasks with a group of twenty experienced volleyball players and twenty sporting novices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first task involved watching short videos (just over two seconds total duration) depicting a woman basketball player throwing a ball at a basket. Around half a second after starting, each video was blanked for a short duration (between a tenth to half a second), and as it resumed the video either depicted a continuation of the earlier movement, or it showed a continuation of a different throw by the same woman. The participants’ task was to say whether the final video segment showed the same movement as seen at the start of the video or a different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the final segment was either timed appropriately (as if the video had simply continued playing in the background during the blank section), or it began replaying at an earlier time in the movement than it should have done (as if the video had slowed down while it was blank), or at a later time than it should have done (as if the video had sped up during the blank).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this task is that to make the required judgments, the participants have to use their own mental simulation and extrapolation of the throwing movement depicted at the start of the video and compare this against the action depicted in the final segment. They must ask themselves at some level – is this final part of the action what I would expect to see given how the action began?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key finding is that the experienced basketball players were better than volleyball players and novices at judging whether the final action segment was from the same movement as depicted at the start of the video. But they only showed this superior performance when the final segment was timed appropriately or when it showed an earlier stage of the movement than it should have done. In fact, the experienced basketball players’ judgment was especially superior in this latter condition (when it was as if the video had been slowed down during the blank period).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are consistent with the idea that the experienced basketball players’ own mental simulation (and extrapolation) of the throwing action was in slow motion, thus making it easier for them to excel in the condition in which the action had effectively been slowed down in the blank period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the volleyball players performed no better than the sporting novices, which suggests the perceptual advantage shown by the basketball players comes specifically from their experience at basketball rather than from playing sport generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing another player’s action unfold in slow motion in their mind’s eye might give experienced basketball players the ability to better anticipate and process what’s going to happen next, or to guess what’s happening after their view of an initial movement gets blocked, the researchers said. It will be interesting to see if similar results are found for experienced players from other sports watching actions by players from their sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some null results too: the experienced basketball players didn’t show the same advantage when the videos depicted a thrown ball in flight rather than a player’s throwing action, perhaps because the flight of the ball doesn’t provide the same useful perceptual cues as an athlete’s throwing action. Basketball players also didn’t excel compared with comparison groups in a follow-up task in which they had to make explicit judgments about whether the final video segment was delayed, timed as expected, or ahead of time. This suggests the experienced players’ superior performance (in the first task) was based on implicit processes that aided their ability to compare actions, rather than on their explicit sense of time passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-016-0804-z&quot;&gt;Do experts see it in slow motion? Altered timing of action simulation uncovers domain-specific perceptual processing in expert athletes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) is caused by mutations in a number of PARK genes, in particular in the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin (PARK2), and in its upstream protein kinase PINK1 (PARK6). PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin and the Parkin ubiquitin-like domain on structurally protected Ser65 to trigger mitophagy. We here report a crystal structure of a nanobody-stabilised complex between Pediculus humanus corporis (Ph)PINK1 with ubiquitin in the ‘C-terminally retracted’ (Ub-CR) conformation. The structure reveals many peculiarities of PINK1, including the architecture of the C-terminal region, and reveals how the PINK1 N-lobe binds ubiquitin via a unique insertion. The flexible Ser65-loop in the Ub-CR conformation reaches the activation segment, facilitating placement of Ser65 in a phosphate accepting position. The structure further explains how autophosphorylation in the N-lobe stabilises structurally and functionally important insertions, and reveals the molecular basis for AR-JP causing mutations, some of which disrupt ubiquitin binding.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;At most synapses in the brain, short-term plasticity dynamically modulates synaptic strength. Rapid frequency-dependent changes in synaptic strength have key roles in sensory adaptation, gain control and many other neural computations. However, some auditory, vestibular and cerebellar synapses maintain constant strength over a wide range of firing frequencies, and as a result efficiently encode firing rates. Despite its apparent simplicity, frequency-invariant transmission is difficult to achieve because of inherent synaptic nonlinearities. Here we study frequency-invariant transmission at synapses from Purkinje cells to deep cerebellar nuclei and at vestibular synapses in mice. Prolonged activation of these synapses leads to initial depression, which is followed by steady-state responses that are frequency invariant for their physiological activity range. We find that synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), a calcium sensor for short-term facilitation, is present at both synapses. It was unclear why a sensor for facilitation would be present at these and other depressing synapses. We find that at Purkinje cell and vestibular synapses, Syt7 supports facilitation that is normally masked by depression, which can be revealed in wild-type mice but is absent in Syt7 knockout mice. In wild-type mice, facilitation increases with firing frequency and counteracts depression to produce frequency-invariant transmission. In Syt7-knockout mice, Purkinje cell and vestibular synapses exhibit conventional use-dependent depression, weakening to a greater extent as the firing frequency is increased. Presynaptic rescue of Syt7 expression restores both facilitation and frequency-invariant transmission. Our results identify a function for Syt7 at synapses that exhibit overall depression, and demonstrate that facilitation has an unexpected and important function in producing frequency-invariant transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24474&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24474&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/LhLL4Zp4yaY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Remember the 'voodoo' fMRI controversy? Well, I just came across a new voodoo-ish paper - just in time for Halloween.

The study, published in Neuropsychopharmacology, comes from Franziska Plessow and colleagues of Boston. The main claim is that a dose of oxytocin reduced the response of &quot;reward-related food motivation brain regions&quot; to pictures of high-calorie foods, suggesting that the hormone might be of use in the treatment of obesity.



However, I have some questions.

 &lt;p&gt;The editors of a new journal resigned earlier this month, claiming that one of the publishers had cold feet about launching the journal. The publishers, however, tell a different story.

		<updated>2017-10-27T15:00:07+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone! I’m Arda Cigin, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://stoic-leaders.com/my-vision-arda-cigin/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoic-Leaders.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in this article, I’m about to change your whole mindset towards all “disadvantages” and “less than stellar situations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be telling you about the battle between David and Goliath as an instructive case study to understand how advantages can actually be the source of our greatest weakness, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, I’ll give you many practical solutions and mindset shifts that you can apply to your life today to turn disadvantages circumstances into your greatest strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we get into the insights, for those who may not know, let’s analyze David and Goliath’s timeless story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– Why even tell a story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to tell a story because the human brain relates through stories, not facts and theories. If you truly want to take away an action plan at the end of this article, pay attention to this timeless story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Instructive Story of David and Goliath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goliath is this giant who is six-foot nine, wearing a bronze helmet and full body armor. He is carrying a javelin, a spear, and a sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because he is about to go into a fierce battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giant, Goliath was about to fight with a fledgling shepherd boy named, David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David, as a fragile young man, inherently knew he was incomparably weak to his opponent, yet he wanted to take the stand and confront the wrath of Goliath nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is David’s confidence misplaced? Maybe there is more to David than meets the eye…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, everyone judged David to have no chance against Goliath. Most people who looked at this combat duo would bet their money on Goliath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And trust me. You would too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to observe Goliath, he was prepared for close combat since he was wearing heavy armor and was armed with various spears and swords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What many didn’t know was that the great and almighty Goliath, who was regarded as the supreme winner of this fight, had one fatal, characteristic flaw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had awful eye-sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the fight started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the battle, Goliath shouted the words “Come to me!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet do not mistake this as an arrogant battle cry. Goliath needed David to be in arm’s-length so that he could see David and defeat him. It was more of a desperate cry than anything else, a definite side effect of his weak eyesight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, Goliath didn’t excel in close combat just because he chose to do so. He had no other option but to excel in close combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember his awful eye-sight? If he were to be a strong warrior, he can not be a long-ranged one like an archer. Combined with his bulky physical nature, a simple fault in eye-sight turned Goliath into a wrathful close-ranged warrior with almost-blind eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goliath was on, what Robert Greene calls, the “death ground”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was trapped and had no other option. Either he was going to master close combat or he’d lead his life as a blind giant. With the help of outside pressures and internal obstacles, he became the best in his niche—ruthless close combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David, the fragile young man, may be a shepherd but he was a smart boy. He was not going to fight with Goliath in close combat. That would be foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, he’d prepared himself for a long-ranged combat—a kind of fight Goliath was not prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Goliath started to get agitated, David took out his trusty slingshot, swiftly positioned a rock, pulled the end of the sling and shot right at the forehead of the giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goliath couldn’t even see the rock because of his faulty eyesight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed at which the rock traveled was more than enough to put Goliath into a deep slumber he’d never wake up from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the shepherd boy won the fight he was predestined to lose. All the cards were stacked against him, or so it appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A supremely disadvantageous fragile man came to be victorious against a supremely advantageous killing machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, everyone was shocked. They told themselves how lucky David was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this has nothing to do with luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the spectators were wrong. There was one thing David was far superior to Goliath in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was neither his size nor his strength, but his ability to think strategically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this exact strategy that David had used to kill Goliath will be the topic of our discussion today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;______&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often in life, strategic thinking is the secret ingredient to turning unfavorable situations into favorable ones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand: Strategic minds will always rise victorious—whatever the circumstance, whoever the enemy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Can We Learn From The Grand Strategist, David?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Adaptation: make it your greatest asset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are making decisions, if it proved successful before, we tend to repeat the same tactics and maneuvers we’ve familiarized ourselves with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are innately lazy creatures and naturally, we cling to what succeeded before and expect it to continue to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move will prove ineffective in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realize: by doing so, you only create rigid pathways, neural-connections, and habits you are better off not adopting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want you to see life as a chess game. As long as you repeat the same moves, you are bound to lose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always have the flexibility to adapt to your ever-changing circumstances. If something doesn’t work (e.g., self-actualization efforts or business and career success), then change your actions and thoughts. Start thinking strategically to find options that you haven’t thought of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make adaptability your greatest asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Darwin pointed out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is neither the survival of the strongest nor smartest, but the most adaptable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Shift the Battlefield &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close combat? That’s what Goliath wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your wits: In this circumstance, always use the slingshot, never the sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand: Never play in a field you are oblivious to. The knowledge of the terrain will give you unimaginable and untold power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realize: no one can force you to play a game you suck at. If they attempt such a thing, just politely decline, as David did, lead them into playing in your arena—a field where no one but you holds the cards. A field where you become the god and they become the puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lure of such power is undeniable, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  3) The Phenomenon of the Masked Opposite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often in life, people tend to mistake appearance for reality. In your interactions with people, always remember the facade of appearances. No one is as they appear to be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are – Nicollo Machiavelli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you confront your enemies, never be intimidated by their appearances. Instead look at the parts that make up the whole. Once you identified the weakness, attack with all your might. They’ll surely fall swiftly just like Goliath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember: The hypocrital nature of appearances always deceives the naive &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see an extreme behavior pattern in someone (e.g., superiority, arrogance, extreme shyness, avoidance) you are most often confronted with the phenomenon of the masked opposite—what you see is actually the exact opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone acts particularly arrogant, realize that they are actually trying to mask their insecurity and lack of confidence. Someone who is already confident wouldn’t need to act superior in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If someone smiles incessantly and laughs at every little thing you say, would you assume they are being natural? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, of course not. They are only using what I’d like to call “the supreme joker mask”. No one can be extremely happy and euphoric all the time. Therefore, they are only happy when you are around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they like you and want you to like them back, maybe they want to get close to you and hurt you or maybe they just want to break the ice, whatever the reason might be, they are wearing a mask that most definitely does not express their actual feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to train yourself to see what is underneath the mask. Everyone you meet will wear some sort of mask. And there is a reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we openly judged people around us, naturally we’d generate unnecessary offense and malice. Therefore, from an early age, most of us have learned to hide our real thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we’d be vulnerable and open to attacks. We’d be left alone and isolated. To prevent such unfavorable situations, we choose to cooperate and hide our less than favorable qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really nothing more than our ancestor survival instincts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if one is actually insecure but masking it with arrogance, you need to get them to drop their guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They need to lose the control. Do something that will make them panic. Anger them on purpose if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger them on purpose if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As final words, I want you to remember David and Goliath’s story every time you find yourself in a less than ideal situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– You financially struggle but want to start your own coaching business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s good, because. it is possible to bootstrap an online business by being creative and resourceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wealthy business owners spend billions of dollars on advertisements—mistaking ad-generated customers for long term customers—you’ll find your unique selling proposition and create loyal customers much faster thanks to your creative product, resourceful marketing, and sheer hustle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a business without capital, especially nowadays, is actually a blessing in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– You want to write a book but you are not native? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s good. As a language learner, your humble determination towards studying grammar, vocabulary, and phrases will enable you to get a better grasp of the nuances where most native writers will get over confident and skip the many important stages of becoming a writer—understanding how narratives work, how readers are captivated, how great writers structure stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your humble and hardworking attitude towards writing will enable you to progress at a faster rate than most native writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you see the power of this strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing can be a disadvantage for you if you are equipped with the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we wrap this up, don’t forget to share this article and comment below if you’ve experienced a similar “David and Goliath” situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were you in David’s or Goliath’s position? Do you have any specific stories you would like to ask me about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your story. (I reply to almost all comments)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

From &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-10534-001&quot;&gt;Howe et al, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of clinical research tries its best to find the true effects of a treatment above and beyond the placebo effect – that is, the benefits that can arise purely from a person’s expectations that an intervention will be helpful. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-10534-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt; takes a different approach: instead of always seeing the placebo effect as “a nuisance variable with mysterious impact”, argue Lauren Howe and her colleagues at Stanford University, we should try to find out more about how to enhance it, and how to diminish its harmful twin, the nocebo effect (when negative expectations can lead to harmful effects). To this end, the researchers examined the possible moderating influence of a physician’s demeanour, finding that the placebo effect is enhanced by the impression of warmth and competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howe and her team write: “Among the many demands of a career in medicine, physicians have been increasingly directed to build rapport with their patients (e.g., by exhibiting empathy). This research suggests a compelling reason for why physicians should pay attention to these psychological and social forces: They can impact physiological health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31490&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 164 healthy participants who thought they were taking part in an investigation into food preferences. As part of this, they were told that they would first need to undergo an allergy test. A female doctor gave them an injection of histamine, which reliably induces an allergic reaction in the skin, including swelling and redness. After the injection, the doctor applied some inert cream to the injection site, which she told some participants would reduce any allergic reaction, while she told others it would increase their allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the participants were divided into four further groups, for which the doctor adapted her demeanour and behaviour to be either: highly warm and competent; low on warmth and competence; high competence but low warmth; or low competence but high warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, to appear warm, the doctor might ask the participant’s name and give her own, but in the low warmth condition she would not bother with these introductions. To appear competent, the doctor made eye contact and spoke eloquently (but did the opposite to appear less competent). Environmental cues added to the effect – for instance, in the high competence condition, the doctor’s office was clean and tidy whereas it was messy and disorganised in the low competence condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a histamine injection, the physiological effects appear on the skin rapidly over a course of minutes. The doctor traced the size of the unfolding allergic reaction several times for each participant and these traces were then sent for measuring by a research assistant who was unaware of which participant was in which trial condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the placebo effect was enhanced when the doctor appeared both warm and competent: that is, the allergic reaction was smaller when the doctor said the cream would have this effect, and when she was more likeable and credible (when she was warm or competent, but not both, the placebo effect was of intermediate size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, of course, doctors don’t only raise positive expectations about treatment (which can induce a placebo effect), but they also warn about side-effects and adverse consequences, which may provoke self-fulfilling negative expectations in the patient. The researchers had thought that physician warmth and competence might also amplify this nocebo effect: that is, increase the allergic reaction when the doctor said the cream would have this effect, but there was no evidence for this happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important not to over-generalise these findings: for instance, the participants were all healthy; the observed placebo-enhancing effects occurred over a very short time-scale; and it’s not clear if the findings would be the same with a male doctor. Nonetheless, the study introduces an elegantly simple procedure for investigating factors that may interact with the placebo effect, and the fascinating findings are ripe for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future research could elaborate on the precise mechanisms through which expectations impact physiology,” the researchers said. “For example, the manipulation of positive and negative expectations in this study could have served to decrease or increase patient anxiety, prompted cognitive reappraisals of the treatment, and/or changed where participants directed their attention during the medical procedure. We look forward to studies that explore these and other intriguing possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;From “Fantastic Voyage” (1966) to “A Wind in the Door” (1973), fiction has adored the idea of exploring the body at cellular and molecular levels. Now, virtual reality (VR) software, combined with the computational power afforded by blockchain technology, makes such journeys possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For your next computer-aided drug discovery/development (CADD) project, especially if you are collaborating with researchers across multiple sites, try molecular visualization using VR technology — now available from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/nanome-inc&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nanome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; through Science Exchange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It’s a great day for precision medicine, with the unveiling of the first global directory of patient-derived xenografts (PDX). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Despite the attention given to precision medicine, however, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;less than 5% &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;of cancer patients are participating in clinical trials. In the discovery phases of R&amp;amp;D, obtaining biospecimens of specific genotypes is also a continuing challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Oncologists on Science Exchange can now accelerate their research with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/cancer-genetics-inc&quot;&gt;Cancer Genetics, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a global CRO with a history of thought leadership in precision medicine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Organoids, particularly brain organoids, have enabled breakthrough research in Alzheimer’s disease, glioblastoma, and even ZIKA virus-induced microcephaly. By using pluripotent stem cells as a source of the multiple cell types present in an organoid, preclinical researchers can recapitulate in vivo-like tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many of these discoveries were made by the founders of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/3dnamics-inc&quot;&gt;3Dnamics&lt;/a&gt;, a new service provider on the Science Exchange network. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/3dnamics-inc&quot;&gt;3Dnamics&lt;/a&gt; team was built by stem cell pioneers and neuroscientists at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. If you are in the process of developing a model system for your preclinical or discovery-phase research, take advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/3dnamics-inc&quot;&gt;3Dnamics&lt;/a&gt;’ expertise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Science is retracting a 2014 paper from the lab of a Nobel winner after replication attempts failed to conclusively support the original results. In January, Bruce Beutler, an immunologist at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, emailed Science editor-in-chief Jeremy Berg to report that […]&lt;/p&gt;

An insomniac's paradise, the shop is the only one of its kind in the world, selling items devoted exclusively to wooing comfort in bed and good old sleep. Television comic Wally Cox, who is sometimes troubled with uneasy slumberings (even as you and I), was caught trying out some of the newest bedtime innovations.

&lt;p&gt;“In the dark, in the quiet, in the lonely stillness, the aggrieved struggle to rescue sleep from vigilance.” This arresting sentence introduces a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717301638&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; of insomnia in &lt;i&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy &lt;/i&gt;that addresses a troubling fact observed in sleep labs across the world: poor sleep is not sufficient to make people consider themselves to have the condition… and poor sleep may not even be necessary. The paper, by Kenneth Lichstein at the University of Alabama, explores the implications of “Insomnia Identity”: how it contributes to health problems, and may be an obstacle to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31502&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hallmark of insomnia is regularly having such poor sleep that it affects your daily function. This implies a person with insomnia will have poor sleep, as measured objectively, and that they will complain about their lack of sleep. To get a sense of how poor sleep and reports of insomnia interact, Lichstein reviewed twenty studies that measured each of these aspects separately, with questions like “How long does it typically take you to get to sleep?” on the one hand, and on the other, questions like “Are you dissatisfied with your sleep?” or direct probes into how confident the person was that they struggled with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence shows that poor sleep in itself is not sufficient to produce insomnia. A 1995 study looked at 400 community volunteers (age 55 or more), and found that the majority of people who were technically poor sleepers (in this case, six months where it took 30 minutes or more of struggle to fall asleep on at least three nights per week) did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; experience distress or consider themselves to have insomnia. These “non-complaining poor sleepers” were no more impaired in terms of daily fatigue than those who got good sleep, nor did they have high anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies using polysomnography (which involves brain wave recordings and other physiological measures of sleep state) and sleep diaries – both considered more accurate ways of establishing quality of sleep than simple recall – have reinforced these findings. One replication also showed non-complaining sleepers had levels of anxiety and depression no higher than the general population. And a large data set of 1700 participants found that whereas short sleep was associated with a 350-500 per cent increase in hypertension (correlated with severity of sleep deficit), this wasn’t the case for people who didn’t consider themselves to have insomnia, for whom there was no relationship between sleep duration and blood pressure. So poor sleep doesn’t inevitably cause the experience of insomnia, nor produce the knock-on health effects associated with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, poor sleep isn’t necessary for people to complain that they have insomnia. Polysomnography and sleep diary studies show clearly that people whose sleeping patterns do not meet clinical criteria for poor sleep can nonetheless believe that they suffer insomnia. What’s more, these “complaining good sleepers” can have as high impairment in terms of daily fatigue, anxiety and depression as those suffering under a clinical deficit of sleep. Recent work &lt;a href=&quot;http://refhub.elsevier.com/S0005-7967(17)30163-8/sref113&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that quality of the sleep you experience has, in itself, no relationship to suicidal thoughts. Suicidal thoughts are instead, related to whether you feel you have sleep problems, regardless of whether or not you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing across the major studies that separate out sleep quality from insomnia complaint, Lichtstein reports that 37 per cent of individuals complaining of insomnia “do not have poor sleep by conventional standards”. This is not to say that their sleep was flawless, or that it wasn’t worse than average in some way, but it certainly falls in the normal range. On the other hand, many individuals with non-normal levels of sleep problems are able to exist as if free from insomnia. What is going on?&lt;/p&gt;

Temperaments drawn to hypochondria, or liable to catastrophic thinking (believed to contribute to some chronic pain conditions) may symptomise minor events or exaggerate their implications. If symptoms are in remission, insomniacs may be hypervigilant for even a single night’s poor sleep as evidence that “it’s back”. Such anxieties make sleep harder, and also colour the edges of sleeping existence with the dread that Lichstein alludes to in his opening sentence. In principle, bed-time can become a living hell even if the actual sleeping difficulties are not remarkable, or scarcely different from a poor sleeper who doesn’t attend to it as an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be especially difficult for therapists to help people with an insomnia identity – even when a therapist succeeds in helping such a client improve their sleep, it’s likely their belief they have a problem will endure. Research on insomnia stigma suggests that it’s common for sufferers to have their problem doubted: this could produce perverse incentives for hypervigilance among those with an insomnia identity and a resolute sense that their problem is real and severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the diagnosis of insomnia usually begins with a person’s complaint about their sleep, and most medical practices offer at most a token sleep assessment before providing that diagnosis, there may be many people out there suffering because of their insomnia identity rather than an actual lack of sleep. Lichtstein recommends that in addition to CBT, we explore practices like mindfulness and dialectical practices that get the sufferer to question assumptions through questions like: what is normal sleep? Does sleep need to be perfect? Do I need to see myself as an insomniac? In these ways, psychology can conquer an affliction that keeps many in unnecessary misery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;by Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., CEO and Co-Founder, Science Exchange | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;www.scienceexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Yesterday, we hosted a group of procurement executives from multiple industries for the 2017 Science Exchange Outsourced R&amp;amp;D Leadership Summit. During the informative and interactive sessions, we discussed both the challenges and opportunities that organizations are facing as they seek to effectively manage outsourced R&amp;amp;D services. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;From presentations by procurement leaders from major pharmaceutical companies on how they’re structuring procurement to enable innovation, to insights on how Science Exchange is pioneering new ways to make it easier to access innovation from our service providers, one of the key themes of the day was the potential for the procurement function to empower scientists to achieve breakthrough discovery. Here are some of my notes around the theme of innovation: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Procurement leaders can drive innovation, with the right tools. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A pharmaceutical company procurement leader responsible for driving innovation shared that, in less than six months of working with Science Exchange, they had been able to increase their use of new, niche service providers by 11%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Innovation can be hampered by complex processes. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Natalie Foote, our Director of Service Provider Operations, presented with two of our service providers — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/ispecimen&quot;&gt;iSpecimen&lt;/a&gt; and LabNetwork, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/wuxi-apptec-research-service-division&quot;&gt;WuXi AppTec &lt;/a&gt;company– about new technology integrations with our platform. These integrations allow Science Exchange users to access the iSpecimen and LabNetwork marketplaces through a seamless access point on our platform — no barriers to innovation!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible, agile procurement support helps drive innovation. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;During a panel discussion that I moderated, procurement leaders from three global pharmaceutical companies examined the need to more flexible and agile when it comes to managing R&amp;amp;D requests, and supporting the R&amp;amp;D business through an end-to-end process. They also discussed how their organizations must strategically examine the best mix of internal and external capabilities, core strengths and capacity when it comes to maximizing R&amp;amp;D innovation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Another theme that surfaced during the Summit was risk mitigation, including the need to better manage confidentiality, data security and intellectual property (IP), and how to prepare for business continuity — whether caused by security breaches or natural disasters. My notes on the theme of risk mitigation: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proactively mitigate risk. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;During the panel discussion, procurement leaders talked about the need to move beyond a “paper exercise” for managing risk, to a more proactive and rigorous approach to protecting their companies from data and security breaches and business continuity issues. One panelist discussed the drive for holding the business accountable for third-party risk oversight on a global scale, to move beyond that “check the box” mentality.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Balance risk and innovation opportunity. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Another panelist emphasized how important it is to strike the delicate balance between managing risk and enabling innovation, to ensure that businesses are protected without slowing down or blocking important scientific discoveries.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask the right questions to assess risk. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our Director of Contracts &amp;amp; Compliance, Andrew Gutierrez, highlighted the need to ask the right questions in developing contracts and programs that will protect a company’s confidentiality and IP. He also talked about the need to verify how your data is being protected by your partners to ensure compliance with global regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Science Exchange Summit gave our entire team an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the needs of global procurement leaders, and our attendees gained insights to bring back to their own organizations, and a network of experts to collaborate with in the future. I look forward to continuing these discussions with our customers so we can continue to learn from one another and accelerate scientific discovery!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/25/antidepressants-during-pregnancy-dangerous-for-the-child/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Depression is sometimes described as a disease of modernity, as sharp changes in lifestyle during the last century or so have given rise to many chronic disorders including or linked to depression. Depression is a state of low mood: the person affected tends to lose interest in previously enjoyable activities. In severe cases, self-harm is also possible. Fortunately, there are many options available today to help treat this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research studies and statistics show that although pregnant women are less prone to major depression, they are more inclined to minor depressive episodes. The prevalence of depression can be anywhere between 8–16% among pregnant women. There are also higher chances that diagnosis of depression is overlooked in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment of depression is quite challenging in pregnancy, as medical specialists have to weigh the benefits of treatment against the risks for the mother and the health of her unborn baby. Furthermore, the health professional has to take into consideration the risks and benefits of any such therapy to the long-term health of the child. New research seems to indicate that treatment of pregnant women with antidepressant drugs may increase the risk of autism, disturbances in motor function, and mental health problem in children. Some of these issues may become clear later in the life, thus studying this subject remains a challenge for researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why treat depression in pregnancy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a widespread misconception that depression is not as threatening as other medical illnesses. Thus, treating depression is viewed as a matter of choice or even a luxury. Moreover, many patients that are on antidepressant drugs before pregnancy are in the remissive stage. Therefore, their doctors may think of discontinuing the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if a pregnant woman that is vulnerable to depression is not provided with antidepressant therapy, there is a higher risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, substance abuse in pregnancy (e.g., smoking and drinking alcohol), and a significantly higher risk of postpartum depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that if antidepressants are discontinued for the period of the pregnancy, the relapse rate of major depression is as high as 60–70%. This can have severe consequences for the patient, family, and child. In addition, children born to mothers with untreated depression have higher levels of cortisol, which may have adverse impacts on their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Risks of antidepressants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned, the use of antidepressants in pregnancy is a complicated issue due to possible dangers. Below are some of the common problems associated with the use of antidepressants during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persistent pulmonary hypertension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a failure of lungs blood vessels to dilate in a child post-birth. Thus, a new-born may have breathing difficulties, a deficit of oxygen in the blood, leading to intubation. In many cases, outcomes may be fatal. This condition is also found to be related to maternal smoking, diabetes, and sepsis. Though the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in new-born increases up to six times with the use of antidepressants, at the same time there is a consensus among the medical community that non-use of antidepressants may be even more harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Withdrawal symptoms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also called “poor neonatal adaptation.” These symptoms are common when a mother has been exposed to antidepressants during the third trimester of pregnancy. Some of the symptoms characteristic of this syndrome include difficulties in breathing, unstable body temperature, hypo- or hypertonia, irritability, constant crying, and seizures. Therefore, some specialists recommend tapering the dose of antidepressants in the third trimester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motor development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By motor development, we mean child’s ability to move around and handle the environment. There are clinical studies that indicate that the use of antidepressants during pregnancy may slow the motor development. A child may start walking later than other kids, or may have other problems related to movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autism spectrum disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a neurodevelopmental disorder of children. Studies seem to show the modest increase in the risk of autism if a mother is exposed to antidepressants during the first trimester.  However, no link has been found if such treatment has been given before the pregnancy, nor much relationship has been demonstrated if the therapy was initiated in a later phase of pregnancy. Thus, researchers caution that decision of prescribing antidepressants should be taken on a case by case basis by analysing the risks and potential benefits for maternal and child health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychiatric disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the large-scale studies, scientists analysed the data of almost one million births, and they found that the use of antidepressants in pregnancy was related to higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders later in life. Nonetheless, at the same time, researchers cautioned against jumping to the quick conclusions because it is a well-known fact that mental disorders have relation to genetics. It means that women prescribed antidepressants during the pregnancy have higher chances of passing to children the genes that may result in psychiatric diseases later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although antidepressants may increase the risk of specific disorders in the new-born babies or may even have a negative impact later in the life, it does not mean that antidepressants should not be taken during the pregnancy. It is essential that women should not feel guilty about taking such drugs. The medical specialists must be aware of the risks and weigh them against the benefits before they prescribe antidepressants to pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/cigs-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic cigarettes will very soon be banned from public indoor spaces in New York State, making it the 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; state in line with World Health Organization guidance, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/gb/fctc/PDF/cop6/FCTC_COP6_10-en.pdf&quot;&gt;called for bans on indoor vaping&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. This comes after a bill signed on Monday by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo who stated that “These products are marketed as a healthier alternative to cigarettes but the reality is they also carry long-term risks to the health of users and those around them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-cigarettes, electronic devices which mimic smoking tobacco, contain a nicotine-based liquid that is vaporized and inhaled. Since first coming to the US market in 2006, they have grown significantly in popularity among adolescents and never smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controversy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the health consequences of this product are not well understood, the CDC says there are still reasons for concern, with nicotine addiction being one of them. The New York State ban brings to the forefront a major public health divide between researchers in the US and UK; while US research into the smoking substitutes has focused on the potential for children to get hooked on fruity vaping flavors, the potential that children could move on to cigarettes and the detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system, public health messages in England have focused on the potential for e-cigarettes and vaping products to be used to help people quit smoking regular cigarettes. However, amid rapid adoption of the devices in the UK, it has also just been announced that a parliamentary panel will hold an inquiry to establish the health and economic impact of e-cigarettes which about 3 million people in the country use. The inquiry will also set out to examine whether e-cigarettes are effective at promoting quitting regular smoking or whether they instead play a role in normalizing smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smokers vs Non-smokers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4671-3&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-9575&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/ccigs.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; investigated behaviors, perceptions, and motivations underlying the use of e-cigarettes in three Baltimore vape shops. The survey respondents were predominantly young, Caucasian males (which is the most common demographic among current e-cigarette users) and authors found that current smokers were more recent initiators of e-cigarette use compared to former smokers. They also found that the motivations for e-cigarette use did not significantly differ between former and current smokers. The most frequently cited primary motivation for initiation of e-cigarette use among both former and current smokers was to quit smoking tobacco, followed by the belief that they were healthier than tobacco cigarettes. The prevalence of never smokers identified in the study is consistent with several studies from the US suggesting that an increasing number of electronic cigarette users are never-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; published an&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1618-4&quot;&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; which showed that one in five teenagers in a large survey in the north west of England has accessed e-cigarettes, and of these, 16% have never otherwise smoked. The highest number of e-cigarette users though, were teenage smokers – of whom 75% admitted using them.  In this study, researchers from Liverpool John Moores University surveyed 16,193 secondary school students in the region aged from 14 to 17 years. The team also found that there was an association between alcohol and e-cigarette access. Students who drank alcohol were significantly more likely to have accessed e-cigarettes than non-drinkers. It was found that those who regularly drank alcohol but didn’t smoke were four times more likely to access e-cigarettes than those who didn’t drink. The findings suggest that teenagers who access e-cigarettes are those that are most susceptible to other forms of substance use and risk-taking behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first longitudinal &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3770-x&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; to use a nationally representative sample of U.S. smokers to provide evidence regarding the impact of e-cigarettes on smoking behavior at the U.S. population level, Karen Messer &lt;em&gt;et.al.&lt;/em&gt; tested whether ever-use of e-cigarettes among early adopters was associated with: 1) increased cigarette smoking cessation; and 2) reduced cigarette consumption. They found that, among early adopters, ever-use of first generation e-cigarettes to aid quitting cigarette smoking was not associated with improved cessation or with reduced consumption, even among heavier smokers. The study advised that it was premature to conclude that e-cigarettes will be helpful to smokers who make a quit attempt; that it also seemed premature to conclude that e-cigarettes will be an effective way for smokers, especially heavy smokers, to reduce the number of cigarettes that they smoke each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-cigarette companies are aggressively marketing their products in a manner akin to how tobacco was marketed in the 50s and 60s. Flavored e-liquids in particular are seen as a means to enticing young people to smoke who are also increasingly being exposed to e-cigarette adverts through TV, billboards, print media and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1028&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; published in 2014 indicated that the vast majority of information on YouTube about e-cigarettes promoted their use and depicted their use as socially acceptable. The researchers found that one of the most prevalent topics in the “pro” e-cigarette videos was a claim that e-cigarettes are safer and healthier alternatives to conventional cigarettes through delivering the experience of smoking while eliminating health risks associated with tobacco smoke. They also promoted that e-cigarettes could help smokers quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9576 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/cigsales.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;With the rapid increase in the retail availability of e-cigarettes in the UK and elsewhere and the increasing concern about the rising prevalence of e-cigarette use among children and young people in particular, it is important to understand what factors predispose adolescents to initiate e-cigarette use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Scottish &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-2968-2&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; examined the relationship between the recall of e-cigarette point-of-sale displays and children’s use and future intention to use e-cigarettes. Researchers found that adolescents who recalled seeing e-cigarettes in small shops were more likely to have tried an e-cigarette and adolescents who recalled seeing e-cigarettes for sale in small shops or supermarkets were more likely to intend to try them in the next 6 months. Further longitudinal data is required to confirm a causal relationship between e-cigarette point of sale exposure and their use and future use by young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact e-cigarettes have on health remains uncertain. The US National Institute on Drug Abuse has warned that these could contain potentially toxic metal nanoparticles and research has also found that the vapor from some e-cigarette products contains known carcinogens and toxic chemicals. More research is needed on the health consequences of repeated exposure to these chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you carrying out research on electronic cigarettes? &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;would love to consider your work!

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/25/ten-year-study-finds-loneliness-and-self-centeredness-appear-to-be-mutually-reinforcing/"/>
		<id>http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=31441</id>
		<updated>2017-10-25T08:43:53+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually think of loneliness as a condition with no redeeming features. Certainly, chronic loneliness is linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/&quot;&gt;poorer physical and psychological health&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/21/your-personality-can-invite-loneliness-and-loneliness-can-shape-your-personality/&quot;&gt;unfavourable effects on personality&lt;/a&gt;. But an evolutionary model of loneliness, pioneered by John Cacioppo at the University of Chicago, US, proposes that it has an adaptive function, in that it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes people want to &lt;i&gt;do something &lt;/i&gt;about absent or unsatisfactory social relationships, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourages people to focus on their own interests and welfare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second proposed motivational force is the focus of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217705120&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, led John Cacioppo, and published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers predicted that feelings of loneliness would make people more self-centred – and this is exactly what they found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31441&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cacioppo and his colleagues analysed data on 229 people living in Cook County, Illinois, who came into the University of Chicago’s Social Neuroscience Laboratory for evaluation one day a year, for ten years. When the first data was collected, in 2002/3, the participants were aged 50-68, and came from the three largest racial/ethnic groups in the region: non-Hispanic White Americans, Black and African Americans and Hispanic Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, the participants completed a package of questionnaires, including measures of depression and mood, the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (20-items measure general loneliness and feelings of social isolation) and the Chronic Self-Focus scale (designed to measure self-centredness; asks participants to indicate the extent to which they agree with statements like “I think about myself a lot”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that higher levels of loneliness reported in one year were associated with higher levels of self-centredness the following year. Greater self-centredness was also associated with more loneliness the following year, but the correlation was weaker. This was after the influence of all the demographic variables were accounted for statistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest loneliness and self-centredness are mutually reinforcing, although it’s possible the influence of some other factor(s) on both self-centredness and loneliness is responsible for this apparent link. However, current depressed mood, symptoms of depression and overall negative mood were not significantly correlated with self-centredness or loneliness at the next year’s evaluation, supporting the interpretation that loneliness and self-centreness have a direct reciprocal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The small but apparent influence of self-centredness on loneliness is noteworthy because it reveals yet another factor that may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of loneliness in real-world contexts,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of C•G to T•A transitions, which account for half of known human pathogenic point mutations. The ability to efficiently convert target A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. While the deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we report adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a tRNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs (e.g., ABE7.10), that convert target A•T to G•C base pairs efficiently (~50% in human cells) with very high product purity (typically ≥ 99.9%) and very low rates of indels (typically ≤ 0.1%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, induce less off-target genome modification than Cas9, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with our previous base editors, ABEs advance genome editing by enabling the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.

 Modifications on mRNA offer the potential of regulating mRNA fate post-transcriptionally. Recent studies suggested the widespread presence of N1-methyladenosine (m1A), which disrupts Watson–Crick base pairing, at internal sites of mRNAs. These studies lacked the resolution of identifying individual modified bases, and did not identify specific sequence motifs undergoing the modification or an enzymatic machinery catalysing them, rendering it challenging to validate and functionally characterize putative sites. Here we develop an approach that allows the transcriptome-wide mapping of m1A at single-nucleotide resolution. Within the cytosol, m1A is present in a low number of mRNAs, typically at low stoichiometries, and almost invariably in tRNA T-loop-like structures, where it is introduced by the TRMT6/TRMT61A complex. We identify a single m1A site in the mitochondrial ND5 mRNA, catalysed by TRMT10C, with methylation levels that are highly tissue specific and tightly developmentally controlled. m1A leads to translational repression, probably through a mechanism involving ribosomal scanning or translation. Our findings suggest that m1A on mRNA, probably because of its disruptive impact on base pairing, leads to translational repression, and is generally avoided by cells, while revealing one case in mitochondria where tight spatiotemporal control over m1A levels was adopted as a potential means of post-transcriptional regulation.

 Direct lineage conversion offers a new strategy for tissue regeneration and disease modelling. Despite recent success in directly reprogramming fibroblasts into various cell types, the precise changes that occur as fibroblasts progressively convert to the target cell fates remain unclear. The inherent heterogeneity and asynchronous nature of the reprogramming process renders it difficult to study this process using bulk genomic techniques. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to overcome this limitation and analysed global transcriptome changes at early stages during the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Using unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms, we identified molecularly distinct subpopulations of cells during reprogramming. We also constructed routes of iCM formation, and delineated the relationship between cell proliferation and iCM induction. Further analysis of global gene expression changes during reprogramming revealed unexpected downregulation of factors involved in mRNA processing and splicing. Detailed functional analysis of the top candidate splicing factor, Ptbp1, revealed that it is a critical barrier for the acquisition of cardiomyocyte-specific splicing patterns in fibroblasts. Concomitantly, Ptbp1 depletion promoted cardiac transcriptome acquisition and increased iCM reprogramming efficiency. Additional quantitative analysis of our dataset revealed a strong correlation between the expression of each reprogramming factor and the progress of individual cells through the reprogramming process, and led to the discovery of new surface markers for the enrichment of iCMs. In summary, our single-cell transcriptomics approaches enabled us to reconstruct the reprogramming trajectory and to uncover intermediate cell populations, gene pathways and regulators involved in iCM induction.
