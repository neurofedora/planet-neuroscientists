Sounds absurd, doesn't it? But not really. Not any more. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trumps-first-deepfake/610750/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;April 26, 2020, was an especially manic day in the presidency of  Donald Trump.  &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;  something was gnawing at him. Perhaps his  business troubles were weighing on him.  &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;  Or perhaps Trump was still seething at the widespread  ridicule of his press conference of April 23, when he suggested using  disinfectant “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahcpr/status/1253474772702429189&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;you must watch this parody by Sarah Cooper&quot;&gt;by injection&lt;/a&gt;.” Or perhaps something else had shifted his  mood from its usual setting of &lt;i&gt;seething aggrievement&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;frothing fury&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever  the cause, between early afternoon and near 9 o’clock eastern time,  Trump fired off a sequence of crazy-even-for-him tweets and retweets. He  demanded that reporters be stripped of the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Noble prizes”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; they had  supposedly been awarded for their reporting on Trump scandals,  apparently conflating them with the Pulitzers—and then pretended that  his misspelling of &lt;i&gt;Nobel&lt;/i&gt; had been intentional.  &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;  He retweeted an increasingly wild and weird range of  supporters’ Twitter accounts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trump shows no compassion for the suffering around him, no sympathy for the families devastated by the loss of their loved ones, and only hollow praise for the health care workers, the bus drivers, the the home delivery workers, the grocery store clerks, and the sanitation workers who put their lives on the line every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eternal optimists say “we're all in this together” while sitting at home on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/coronavirus-zoom-fatigue-is-taxing-the-brain-here-is-why-that-happens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;oh boo hoo, 'Zoom Fatigue'&quot;&gt;Zoom meetings&lt;/a&gt;, placing endless orders on Amazon, and fretting about their sourdough starter. I'm only marginally better, but I realize I'm privileged. {I've tried to help financially &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e24Kjd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; contributing to homeless organizations, a fund for unemployed hourly workers, bookstores, museums, etc.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And obviously I'm way more pessimistic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this rant honor my cat??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case History &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max was diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma in August 2019 at the age of 16. He also had a murky ailment that made it difficult for him to eat (“his tongue is inflamed” or later, “he has a mass at the base of his tongue”), but the true cause was never confirmed. He was prescribed oral chemotherapy pills three times a week and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/steroid-treatment-long-term-effects-in-cats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oral steroid&lt;/a&gt; (prednisolone syrup) twice daily. I declined the chemo pills, opting for quality of life for both of us. Max's oral steroid became unworkable after four doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not fair, especially after my wife suffered through Stage 4 cancer for a year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another vet started bimonthly / monthly injections of Depo-Medrol (&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/methyl-prednisolone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;methyl prednisolone&lt;/a&gt;) to reduce the inflammation in his mouth, and as a partial treatment for his lymphoma. It worked wonders (for a while). He ran up and down stairs, played with his toys, and jumped over the red chair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He started getting worse in January. His weight was down to 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg), a 2 lb loss in two months. He was prescribed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buprenorphine&lt;/a&gt; as needed for pain and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/mirataz-mirtazapine-transdermal-ointment-veterinarians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Ha! mirtazapine is an antidepressant for humans that causes -- you guessed it -- weight gain&quot;&gt;transdermal mirtazapine&lt;/a&gt; as an appetite stimulant. My quest for palatable foods became more and more challenging. I spent hours walking the aisles of pet superstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfd4NSoAOGw/Xqd-UC6D8oI/AAAAAAAANGU/hvfPRsVtKfYTIHA-ndK_yzVdqOLASeItwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/foods%2Bfor%2BMax.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;405&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfd4NSoAOGw/Xqd-UC6D8oI/AAAAAAAANGU/hvfPRsVtKfYTIHA-ndK_yzVdqOLASeItwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/foods%2Bfor%2BMax.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His last regular appointment was March 9. And then the shelter-in-place orders were issued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pet Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max's condition was getting worse. Depo-Medrol was less and less effective, and he needed injections every two weeks. The veterinary practice enacted stringent measures to protect its essential workers. In-person appointments were reserved for animals showing signs of extreme pain and suffering. Virtual Vet was used for consults and for recommending treatment plans. We had an appointment on March 27. Max was prescribed his usual meds. I picked them up curbside (calling upon arrival) and paid via contactless transaction. I watched a helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS815US815&amp;amp;oq=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.8839j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; and then administered his subcutaneous injection of Depo-Medrol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By April 16, I had grown desperate. The poor fellow was having a severe bout of diarrhea that lasted for days. I tried scheduling a virtual vet appointment and called for a refill of buprenorphine. Finally I got through and picked up more meds the next day. These included oral &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/metronidazole&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;chicken flavor!&quot;&gt;metronidazole&lt;/a&gt;, a hideously bitter and distressing medication that made his mouth foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He improved slightly. I was up for hours in the middle of the night, trying to coax him to eat. Some &quot;meaty morsels&quot; and &quot;flaked' varieties were palatable for their gravy. I got out the food processor and whirled them into a very soft format, which he mostly rejected. “But you were just licking the gravy off these meaty morsels!” I told him. Finally I came up with a winning concoction. But this was only a palliative interlude before the inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized I'd established a Palliative Care Unit for my cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On April 23, I could no longer care for him myself. I brought him to the ER for severe dehydration. He had blood work and an &quot;incidental&quot; ultrasound, neither of which he'd had since his initial diagnosis. The results were devastating. Anemia due to suspected blood loss from his GI tract. Elevated white blood cell count (no surprise). Emerging diabetes mellitus (e,g., glucose in his urine), a known side-effect of steroid treatment. He weighed only 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most concerning was “free fluid in the abdomen and what looks like masses, possibly lymph nodes and fluid distended bowel loops.”  /  “If he does not improve in the next few days to a week, humane euthanasia should be considered given what we know.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked him up and brought him home. He hated car rides much more than actual visits to the vet or treatments of any sort. Veterinary staff all loved him. The report from his ER doc even said, “Max is a very good cat.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was withdrawn for several hours. Then he got over it and sat on my lap in the red chair, purring. Here he is, as beautiful as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;414&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The change in Max from that day to the next was astounding. He couldn't  hold his head up any more. He tried to drink some water but couldn't manage to do it. I don't think  any additional intervention would have improved his condition. I  didn't want to wait any longer and had to act quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate  to find a caring and compassionate vet who made house calls, and wasn't  ridiculously overboard on COVID-19 restrictions. Some said they wouldn't  enter the main living area — it had to take place outside or in the  garage or in their mobile van. But Max was in a comfortable and familiar  environment, at least. And then he didn't have to suffer any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max  was such a sweet, loving, affectionate cat. He sought me out until the  end, until his very last day when he was too weak to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oLOV5eGK4v4/XqeqxIsiKhI/AAAAAAAANGs/tEasqUX33awEoXjSLpeSjRMuJ9XtpaW4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2B04-23-2020_1208am_small.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;212&quot; data-original-width=&quot;432&quot; height=&quot;157&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oLOV5eGK4v4/XqeqxIsiKhI/AAAAAAAANGs/tEasqUX33awEoXjSLpeSjRMuJ9XtpaW4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Max%2B04-23-2020_1208am_small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another story of love, and of loss.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Among
patients who have recovered from COVID-19 in China comes the first evidence
that some may suffer long-term lung damage from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 70
patients who survived COVID-19 pneumonia, 66 had &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020200843&quot;&gt;some level of lung damage&lt;/a&gt; visible in CT scans taken before
hospital discharge, researchers report March 19 in &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt;. The damage ranged from dense clumps of hardened tissue
blocking blood vessels within the tiny air sacs called alveoli, which absorb
oxygen, to tissue lesions around the alveoli, Yuhui Wang, a radiologist at
Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and colleagues
found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tissue lesions can be a sign of chronic lung disease. Similar
damage has been documented in survivors of SARS and MERS, respiratory diseases caused
by coronaviruses similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus behind COVID-19. Long-term
studies of SARS patients have shown that roughly a third of people who
recovered from severe bouts were left with permanent lung damage. In the case
of MERS, one study found about a third of people who recovered from a serious
infection still had signs of lung damage about seven months later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while initial lung images indicate that SARS and MARS
typically set into just one lung, COVID-19 appears to be more likely to afflict
both lungs right away. In 75 of the 90 patients
admitted to Huazhong University Hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia from January
16 to February 17, damage was seen across both lungs, Wang and colleagues
report. CT scans taken before hospital discharge revealed that 42 out of 70 patients
displayed the type of lesions around the alveoli that are more likely to
develop into scars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;COVID-19 patient ct scans damage&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087405&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041720_dc_covid-lungs_inline1_680_desktop.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087405&quot;&gt;These CT scans of a 35-year-old woman with COVID-19 pneumonia illustrate how some lung damage remains even after recovery. When she was admitted to the hospital (day 1, top left), a scan revealed tissue or fluid blocking blood vessels in both lungs, though at this stage it was mainly confined to the bottom right lobe. Some of this subsided by day 15 (bottom right), a couple days before she left the hospital. But fuzzy patches in the bottom of the left lung indicate tissue filled with fluid rather than air, which can cause further damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087405&quot;&gt;Y. Wang &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Wang &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given how widely the pandemic has spread, chronic lung
conditions from COVID-19 could challenge many thousands of people in years to
come. As
of April 27, more than 2.9 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with
the disease. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-new-wuhan-coronavirus-stacks-up-against-sars-mers&quot;&gt;In
comparison&lt;/a&gt;, SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, sickened about
8,000 people during its 2003–2004 outbreak. MERS, or Middle East
respiratory syndrome, has infected more than 2,500 people (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/24/20&lt;/em&gt;). While an estimated 80 percent of COVID-19 cases are
mild, the rest display &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-coronavirus-spread-reach-u-s-communities-cdc&quot;&gt;problems
ranging from breathing difficulties to respiratory failure&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/25/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some lung damage seen in the Wuhan study cases are likely to
gradually heal or disappear, Wang and colleagues suspect. However, in some
patients, lung abnormalities will harden into layers of scar tissue known as
pulmonary fibrosis. That scarring stiffens the lungs, making it hard to get
enough oxygen. People with pulmonary fibrosis typically suffer shortness of
breath, limiting their ability to be physically active. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Certain patients are most at risk of developing this type of
scarring. They include elderly patients who’ve had severe bouts of COVID-19 pneumonia,
patients with other illnesses such as cancer or diabetes and those with other lung
conditions caused by smoking or pollution, says Xiaolong Qi of the First
Hospital of Lanzhou University in China, where another COVID-19 lung damage
study is under way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102583/&quot;&gt;A hyperactive
immune response may be to blame&lt;/a&gt; for scarring.
A sudden storm of molecules called cytokines causes inflammation that can
damage lung tissue and fill the alveoli with pus. In the worst cases, damage
from this inflammation is so severe that it eventually leaves thickened scar
tissue in honeycomb-shaped clusters — something also seen in SARS and MERS.
While it’s unclear whether any of the Wuhan patients had such severe damage,
it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-020-05990-y&quot;&gt;been
described&lt;/a&gt; in other COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breathing with the help of a ventilator can also cause lung
damage, and it may be difficult to tell which patients’ injuries stem from a
dysfunctional immune response to the virus versus being on ventilator, says radiologist
Karuna Das of United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain. Having studied MERS
patients, Das is now investigating the long-term health impact of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“During the MERS outbreak, some patients were on ventilators
for more than 100 days,” he says. “Oxygen is being infused with positive
pressure, and when the lungs get inflated beyond their limits, it causes
trauma.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5644332/&quot;&gt;About
a third of MERS patients&lt;/a&gt; who suffered lung damage had not fully recovered
more than seven months on, Das and colleagues reported in 2017 in the &lt;em&gt;Indian Journal of Radiology and Imaging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Long-term outcomes for SARS survivors also suggest some
COVID-19 patients may face lasting lung problems. Researchers at a Beijing
hospital found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5&quot;&gt;the
percentage of lung lesions&lt;/a&gt; across 71 patients changed little between 2004
and 2018, as reported February 14 in &lt;em&gt;Bone
Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Based on what we have seen from SARS, MERS and H1N1 influenza, we expect that at least some COVID-19 patients will have some residual disease,” says Ali Gholamrezanezhad, a radiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He and coauthors review &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/AJR.20.22969&quot;&gt;lessons from SARS and MERS&lt;/a&gt; in the May &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Roentgenology&lt;/em&gt;. Some survivors, he says, will have “some residual fibrosis, scars and their lung function and their lung anatomy doesn’t go back to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS is part of a group of publishers supporting a rapid review initiative for COVID-19 research. We are also co-signing an Open Letter of Intent: a call for all of us in the community – publishers, editors, reviewers, and authors – to help make the peer review process as efficient as possible during this time. The Open Letter of Intent is available here &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; , but is also reproduced in full below:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;27 April, 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new urgency to openly and rapidly share and review COVID-19 research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We, a group of publishers and scholarly communications organizations, are committing to work together on a cross-publisher rapid review and review transfer initiative. With the endorsement of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) we are making the following calls to reviewers, editors, authors, and publishers in the research community, in order to maximize the efficiency and speed of the triage and peer review process of COVID-19 research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To reviewers and authors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on volunteer reviewers with suitable expertise relevant to COVID-19 from all career stages and disciplines, including those from industry, to sign up to a “rapid reviewer pool” and commit to rapid reviewing times, along with an upfront agreement  that their reviews and identity can be shared among publishers and journals if submissions get rerouted. Please sign up in this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7MILluJtO9xV2QXznWVd66UQU4puow4wSk7iwLz7iYcykfA/viewform&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on volunteer reviewers (whether or not they have signed up for rapid review) to identify and highlight important and crucial COVID-19 preprints (e.g. by using &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), as early as possible, to optimise the limited time of expert reviewers who are subsequently invited to review the most important and promising research by a journal/platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We call on authors to support reviewers and publishers in this endeavour by ensuring the deposition of their submission as a preprint, and by working with publishers to make the peer-reviewed article and associated dataset, software, and model available for reuse as rapidly as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To publishers and editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Women’s reputation as nurturing homebodies who left warfare to men in long-ago societies is under attack. Skeletal evidence from &lt;a href=&quot;https://meeting.physanth.org/program/2020/session42/broehl-2020-women-warriors-among-central-california-hunter-gatherers.html&quot;&gt;hunter-gatherers&lt;/a&gt; in what’s now California and from herders in Mongolia suggests that women warriors once existed in those populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two research teams had planned to present these findings
April 17 at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physical
Anthropologists. That meeting was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The
results have been provided to &lt;em&gt;Science
News&lt;/em&gt; by the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sexual divisions of labor characterized ancient societies,
but were not as rigidly enforced as has often been assumed, the new studies
suggest. “The traditional view [in anthropology] of ‘man the hunter and woman
the gatherer’ is likely flawed and overly simplistic,” says forensic
anthropologist Marin Pilloud of the University of Nevada, Reno.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider hunter-gatherers who lived in central California as
early as around 5,000 years ago as well as more recent Native Americans groups
in that region, such as Coast Miwok and Yana. Some archaeological evidence as
well as historical accounts and 20th century anthropologists’ descriptions
generally portray men in those groups as hunters, fishers and fighters in tribal
feuds and conflicts with outside armies. Women are presented as focused on gathering
and preparing plant foods, weaving and child care.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But skeletons of 128 of those hunter-gatherer women display
damage from arrows and sharp objects such as knives comparable to skeletal
injuries of 289 presumed male warriors, Pilloud and her colleagues found. Whether
those women fought alongside men or carried out other dangerous battle duties,
such as sneaking up on enemies to cut their bow strings, can’t be determined
from their bones. Individuals in this sample came from 19 Native American
groups in central California, and had lived in any of five time periods between
around 5,000 and 200 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence analyzed by Pilloud’s team was part of a database
of excavated skeletal remains from more than 18,000 central California
hunter-gatherers assembled by study coauthor Al Schwitalla of Millennia
Archaeological Consulting in Sacramento. A 2014 study directed by Schwitalla
determined that 10.7 percent of males in the database &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416513000603&quot;&gt;had
suffered injuries from sharp objects and projectile points&lt;/a&gt;, versus 4.5
percent of females. The new study finds similar patterns of those injuries on
the skeletons of men and women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In wars between Native American tribes in California, women
were often killed in surprise raids and other attacks, which may partly explain
female injuries reported in the new study, says biological anthropologist
Patricia Lambert of Utah State University in Logan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some women may have fought in battles, either to defend
their children or village or as warriors, suggests Lambert, who was not part of
Pilloud’s team. But further evidence of female fighters, such as Native
American women in California buried with weapons and other battle artifacts, is
needed, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second skeletal analysis suggests that nomadic herders in
ancient Mongolia, bordering northern China, trained some women to be warriors during
a time of political turbulence and frequent conflicts known as the Xianbei
period, says anthropologist Christine Lee of California State University, Los Angeles.
The Xianbei period ran from 147 to 552.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study of nine individuals buried in a high-status
Mongolian tomb from the Xianbei period, conducted by Lee and Cal State
colleague Yahaira Gonzalez, two of three women and all six men displayed signs
of having ridden horses in combat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That conclusion rests on three lines of evidence: bone
alterations caused by frequent horse riding and damage from falls off horses;
upper-body signatures of having regularly used bows to shoot arrows, including
alterations of spots where shoulder and chest muscles attach to bone; and arrowhead
injuries to the face and head. Because the tomb was previously looted, any
war-related objects that may have been interred with the bodies are gone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In western Asia, archaeologists have uncovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/golden-fleece-myth-was-based-real-events-geologists-contend&quot;&gt;potential
graves of women warriors&lt;/a&gt; that include weapons and war gear (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/25/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By around 900, written documents refer to Mongolian women
who fought in wars, held political power and had diplomatic credentials, Lee
says. Freedom for Mongolian women to pursue a variety of activities goes back
at least to the Xianbei period, she suspects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lee now plans to look for skeletal evidence of female
warriors in more Mongolian tombs dating to as early as around 2,200 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Badass women may go back a long way in northern Asian nomadic groups,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it may vary based on context or mood, most of us have a fairly steady belief in how intelligent we think we are. Whether that belief is in any way accurate or even helpful is a different questio&lt;span&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; — one 2019 study found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/&quot;&gt;people who were happier to admit they don’t know something actually had better general knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, whilst a survey from the year before found that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/&quot;&gt;majority of Americans believed they were smarter than average&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We’re also susceptible to the same foibles when it comes to those close to us, tending to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/&quot;&gt;rate our romantic partners as more intelligent than they actually are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how early do our ideas about our own intelligence start, and how do they relate to other facets of our personality? In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;new research published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Marcin Zajenkowski looks at just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39531&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we perceive our intelligence seems to have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976&quot;&gt;important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976&quot;&gt; effect on both academic achievement and how we feel about ourselves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Though studies have largely focused on adults, Zajenkowski argues that this is also likely to be the case amongst teenagers, too, where some evidence has already suggested that self-perceived ability in Maths and English is correlated with actual achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Zajenkowski asked 428 teenagers aged between 15 and 17 to rate their own intelligence compared to other people on a scale from 1 (very low) to 25 (very high). Next, they completed a test of objective intelligence which measured abstract and non-verbal reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed a measure of the Big Five personality traits, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory was used to assess grandiose narcissism: participants rated themselves on 34 statements such as “I have a natural talent for influencing people” and “I will be a success”. Finally, participants rated their life satisfaction, rating how much they agreed or disagreed with sentiments including “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zajenkowski found that teenagers with higher levels of narcissism and those who scored higher on the “intellect” personality trait tended to make higher assessments of their own intelligence. These participants also showed greater levels of life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender also played a part, with male students scoring significantly higher than female students on self-assessed intelligence, as well as narcissism, extraversion and life satisfaction. But, importantly, there was no gender difference in &lt;em&gt;objective &lt;/em&gt;intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mirrors what had already been found in adult populations (one researcher dubbed it the “male hubris, female humility” effect). It’s not clear when in development self-assessed intelligence starts to become associated with gender, though studies looking at only slightly younger children have found no gendered difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike in studies on adults, there was no correlation between self-assessed intelligence and objective intelligence. Zajenkowski argues that this may be down to the way objective intelligence was measured: the test used in this study looked at abstract thinking, and  previous research has suggested that people may not see this kind of thinking as an aspect of intelligence until they’re of university age. Teenagers, therefore, may not value it or even see it as a facet of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could therefore be useful to include a wider range of IQ tests in future work. Firstly, this could provide a more comprehensive picture of intellect with which to compare self-assessed intelligence; secondly, it may be a better fit when it comes to how teenagers perceive what intelligence actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effort must also be made by educators and families to ensure that girls are just as confident and sure in their abilities and intelligence as boys. Not only might this increase well-being, it could disrupt negative gender stereotypes as it does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;How do teenagers perceive their intelligence? Narcissism, intellect, well-being and gender as correlates of self-assessed intelligence among adolescents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caves-france-dinosaur-prints-paleontology"/>

		<updated>2020-04-27T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Crawling through tight underground passages in
southern France, paleontologist Jean-David Moreau and his colleagues have to descend
500 meters below the surface to reach the only known footprints of long-necked dinosaurs
called sauropods ever found in a
natural cave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team discovered the prints, left by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fossils-are-redefining-what-makes-dinosaur&quot;&gt;behemoths
related to &lt;em&gt;Brachiosaurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;in Castelbouc Cave
in December 2015 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/21/18&lt;/em&gt;). But
getting to the site might make even the most hardened field scientists balk. Wriggling
through such dark, damp and cramped spaces every time they visit is challenging
for elbows and knees, and even trickier when carrying delicate equipment such
as cameras, lights and laser scanners. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s both physically exhausting and “not comfortable
for someone claustrophobic,” with the researchers spending up to 12 hours
underground each time, says Moreau, of the Université
Bourgogne Franche-Comté in Dijon. It can be dangerous too, as some parts of the
cave are periodically flooded, so accessing the deep chambers must be limited
to periods of drought, he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreau has studied fossilized dinosaur footprints and
plants for more than a decade in southern France’s Causses Basin, one of the
richest areas for aboveground dinosaur tracks in Europe. When spelunkers
chanced upon some underground prints in 2013, Moreau and his colleagues realized
there could be lots of dinosaur prints within the region’s many deep, limestone
caves. Footprints left in soft mud or sand hundred million years ago could have
been turned to rock and forced underground over many eons. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And deep caves, being less exposed to wind and rain, “can
occasionally offer larger and better-preserved surfaces [imprinted by dinosaur
steps] than outdoor outcrops,” Moreau says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreau’s team is the only one to have discovered dinosaur footprints in
natural caverns, though prints also have been found around the world in human-made
railway tunnels and mines. “The discovery of dinosaur tracks inside a natural
karstic cave is extremely rare,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first subsurface dinosaur prints that the team found
were 20 kilometers away from Castelbouc at a site called Malaval Cave, reached
via an hour-long clamber through an underground river with several 10-meter
drops. “One of the main difficulties in the Malaval Cave is to walk taking care
to not touch or break any of the delicate and unique [mineral formations],” Moreau
says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those three-toed prints, each up to 30 centimeters long and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/ijs/vol47/iss1/3/&quot;&gt;detailed
in 2018&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Speleology&lt;/em&gt;, were left by carnivorous
dinosaurs walking upright on their hind legs through marshland about 200
million years ago. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Paleontologist examining a dinosaur footprint&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087272&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042020_jp_dinoprint_inline.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087272&quot;&gt;Paleontologist Jean-David Moreau examines a three-toed footprint left behind by a carnivorous dinosaur millions of years ago and now found in Malaval Cave in southern France.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087272&quot;&gt;Vincent Trincal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the five-toed herbivore tracks in Castelbouc Cave are each
up to 1.25 meters long and were left by three enormous herbivorous sauropods
that walked the shoreline of a sea about 168 million years ago. What’s more, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2019.1728286&quot;&gt;these prints
are on the cave’s ceiling&lt;/a&gt; 10 meters above the floor, the team reports in a
study published online March 25 in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, “the tracks we see on the roof are not ‘footprints,’ they are
‘counterprints,’” Moreau explains. “The dinosaurs walked on a surface of clay,
which is nowadays totally eroded to form the cave. Here, we only see the
overlying layer [of sediment that filled in the footprints],” leaving reverse
prints bulging out of the ceiling. It’s similar to what you’d see if you filled
a footprint in mud with plaster and then washed all of the mud away to leave
the cast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tracks are important as they hail from a time in the early to mid-Jurassic
Period from 200 million to 168 million years ago when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/long-necked-monsters-roamed-more-scotlands-lochs&quot;&gt;sauropods
were diversifying and spreading across the world&lt;/a&gt;, but relatively few
fossil bones have been found (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/1/15&lt;/em&gt;).
These prints confirm that sauropods then inhabited coastal or wetland environments
in what is now southern France.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreau is now leading researchers in exploring “another deep and long cave, which has yielded hundreds of dinosaur footprints,” he says. The team has yet to publish those results, which he says may prove to be the most exciting of all.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/balanced-literacy-phonics-teaching-reading-evidence"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;On a chilly Tuesday back in January, my 7-year-old son’s classroom in Minneapolis was humming with reading activities. At their desks, first- and second-graders wrote on worksheets, read independently and did phonics lessons on iPads. In the hallway, students took turns playing a dice game that challenged them to spell out words with a consonant-vowel-consonant structure, like &lt;em&gt;wig&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another part of the classroom, small groups of two or three children, many missing their two front teeth, took turns sitting on a color-block carpet with teacher Patrice Pavek. In one group, Pavek asked students to read out loud from a list of words. “Con-fess,” said a dimpled 7-year-old named Hazel, who sat cross-legged in purple boots and a black fleece. Pavek reminded Hazel that a vowel sound in the middle of a word changes when you put an &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; at the end. Hazel tried again. “Con-fuse,” she said. “Beautiful!” Pavek beamed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Hazel returned to her desk, I asked her what goes through her mind when she gets to a word she doesn’t know. “Sound it out,” she said. “Or go to the next word.” Her classmates offered other tips. Reilly, age 6, said it helps to practice and look at pictures. Seven-year-old Beatrix, who loves books about unicorns and dragons, advocated looking at both pictures and letters. It feels weird when you don’t know a word, she said, because it seems like everyone else knows it. But learning to read is kind of fun, she added. “You can figure out a word you didn’t know before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like the majority of schools in the United States, my son’s district uses an approach to reading instruction called balanced literacy. And that puts him and his classmates in the middle of a long-standing debate about how best to teach children to read.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The debate — often called the “reading wars” — is generally framed as a battle between two distinct views. On one side are those who advocate for an intensive emphasis on phonics: understanding the relationships between sounds and letters, with daily lessons that build on each other in a systematic order. On the other side are proponents of approaches that put a stronger emphasis on understanding meaning, with some sporadic phonics mixed in. Balanced literacy is one such example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issues are less black and white. Teachers and reading advocates argue about how much phonics to fit in, how it should be taught, and what other skills and instructional techniques matter, too. In various forms, the debate about how best to teach reading has stretched on for nearly two centuries, and along the way, it has picked up political, philosophical and emotional baggage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, science has a lot to say about reading and how to teach it. Plenty of evidence shows that children who receive systematic phonics instruction learn to read better and more rapidly than kids who don’t. But pitting phonics against other methods is an oversimplification of a complicated reality. Phonics is not the only kind of instruction that matters, and it is not the panacea that will solve the nation’s reading crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cutting through the confusion over how to teach reading is essential, experts say, because reading is crucial to success, and many people never learn to do it well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to U.S. government data, only one-third of fourth-graders have the reading skills to be considered proficient, which is defined by the National Assessment of Educational Progress as demonstrating competency over challenging subject matter. And a third of fourth-graders and more than a quarter of 12th-graders lack the reading skills to adequately complete grade-level schoolwork, says Timothy Shanahan, a reading researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those struggles tend to persist. As many as 44 million U.S. adults, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93275.pdf&quot;&gt;or 23 percent of the adult population, lack literacy skills&lt;/a&gt;, according to U.S. Department of Education data. Those affected may be able to read movie listings, or the time and place of a meeting, but they can’t synthesize information from long passages of text or decipher the warnings on medication inserts. People who can’t read well are less likely than others to vote, or read the news or secure employment. And today’s technology-based job market means students need to achieve more with reading than in the past, Shanahan says. “We are failing to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Lessons in decoding&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of children need to be taught how to read. Even among those with no learning disabilities, only an estimated 5 percent figure out how to read with virtually no help, says Daniel Willingham, a psychologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and author of &lt;em&gt;Raising Kids Who Read&lt;/em&gt;. Yet educators have not reached consensus on how best to teach reading, and phonics is the part of the equation that people still argue about most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea behind a systematic phonics approach is that children must learn how to translate the secret code of written language into the spoken language they know. This “decoding” begins with the development of phonological awareness, or the ability to distinguish between spoken sounds. Phonological awareness allows children, often beginning in preschool, to say that &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pig&lt;/em&gt; are different because of the sound at the beginning of the words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once children can hear the differences between sounds, phonics comes next, offering explicit instruction in the connections between letters, letter combinations and sounds. To be systematic, these skills need to be taught in an organized order of concepts that build on one another, preferably on a daily basis, says Louisa Moats, a licensed psychologist and literacy expert in Sun Valley, Idaho. Today, phonics proponents often advocate for the simple view of reading, which emphasizes decoding and comprehension, the ability to decipher meaning in sentences and passages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Support for phonics has been around since at least the 1600s, but critics have also long expressed concerns that rote phonics lessons are boring, prevent kids from learning to love reading and distract from the ability to understand meaning in text. In the 1980s, this kind of thinking led to the rise of whole language, an approach aimed at making reading joyful and immersive instead of mindless and full of effort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the 2000s, a more all-around and phonics-inclusive approach called balanced literacy was gaining popularity as the leading theory in competition with phonics-first approaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2019 survey of 674 early-elementary and special education teachers from around the United States, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edweek.org/media/ed%20week%20reading%20instruction%20survey%20report-final%201.24.20.pdf&quot;&gt;72 percent said their schools use a balanced literacy approach&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Education Week Research Center, a nonprofit organization in Bethesda, Md. The implementation of balanced literacy, however, varies widely, especially in how much phonics is included, the survey found. That variation is probably preventing lots of kids from learning to read as well as they could, decades of research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, with the reading wars in full swing, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development brought together a panel of about a dozen reading experts to evaluate the evidence for how best to teach reading. The National Reading Panel’s first task was to figure out which types of teaching tasks to include in the analysis, says Shanahan, a panel member. Ultimately, the group chose eight categories and conducted a meta-analysis of 38 studies involving 66 controlled experiments from 1970 through 2000. The results showed support for five components of reading instruction that helped students the most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Five essentials &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis of 38 studies found five components of reading instruction were most helpful to students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonemic awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that spoken words are made of smaller segments of sound called phonemes&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The knowledge that letters represent phonemes and that these sounds can combine to form words&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to read easily, accurately, quickly and with expression and understanding&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Learning new words&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehension&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ability to show understanding, often through summarization&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: National Reading Panel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two components that rose to the top were an emphasis on phonemic awareness (a part of phonological awareness that involves the ability to identify and manipulate individual sounds in spoken words) and phonics. Studies included in the analysis showed that higher levels of phonemic awareness in kindergarten and first grade were predictors of better reading skills later on. The analysis couldn’t assess the magnitude of benefits, but children who received systematic phonics instruction scored better on word reading, spelling and comprehension, especially when phonics lessons started before first grade. Those children were also better at sounding out words, including nonsense words, Shanahan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary development was another essential component, as was a focus on comprehension. The final important facet was a focus on achieving fluency — the ability to read a text quickly, accurately and with proper expression — by having children read out loud, among other strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even before the panel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pubs/nrp/Documents/report.pdf&quot;&gt;released its results in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies and books from as early as the 1960s had concluded that there was value in explicit phonics instruction. Studies since then have added yet more support for phonics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the National Early Literacy Panel, a government-convened group that included Shanahan, considered dozens of studies on phonological awareness (including phonemic awareness) plus phonics instruction in preschool and kindergarten. &lt;a href=&quot;https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/pdf/NELPReport09.pdf&quot;&gt;Children who got decoding instruction scored substantially bette&lt;/a&gt;r on tests of phonological awareness compared with those who didn’t. The benefit was equivalent to a jump from the 50th percentile to the 79th percentile on standardized tests, suggesting those students were better prepared to learn how to read.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Likewise, a 2007 meta-analysis of 22 studies conducted in urban elementary schools found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013124507304128&quot;&gt;minority children who received phonics instruction&lt;/a&gt; scored the equivalent of several months ahead of their minority peers on several academic measures. Studies have not addressed whether phonics might help close demographic achievement gaps, but research suggests that whole language approaches are less effective in disadvantaged populations than in other groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are several thousand studies at least that converge on this finding,” Moats says. “Phonics instruction has always had the edge in consensus reports.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to quantify how substantial the gains are from explicit phonics instruction, partly because the bulk of published research is full of ambiguities. Randomized trials are rare. Studies tend to be small. And in schools where teachers have autonomy to respond to students at their discretion, control groups are often not well-defined, making it hard to tell what phonics-focused programs are really being compared with, or how much phonics the control groups are getting. The reality of instruction can differ from classroom to classroom, even within the same school. And students who aren’t getting intensive phonics at school may have the blanks filled in at home, where parents might sound out words and talk about letters while reading bedtime stories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data that are available suggest that kids who get systematic phonics lessons score the equivalent of about half a grade level ahead of kids in other groups on standardized tests, Shanahan says. That’s not a giant leap, but it helps. “Overwhelmingly in studies, both individually and in a meta-analysis where you’re combining results across studies, if you explicitly teach phonics for some amount of time, kids do better than if you don’t pay much attention to that or if you pay a little bit of attention to [phonics],” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Real experiences&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the most compelling evidence to support a phonics-focused approach comes from historical observations: When schools start teaching systematic phonics, test scores tend to go up. As phonics took hold in U.S. schools in the 1970s, fourth–graders began to do better on standardized reading tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, California replaced its phonics curriculum with a whole language approach. In 1994, the state’s fourth-graders tied for last place in the nation: Less than 18 percent had mastered reading. After California re-embraced phonics in the 1990s, test scores rose. By 2019, 32 percent achieved grade-level proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those swings continue today. In 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://msachieves.mdek12.org/mississippi-ranks-no-1-in-nation-for-score-gains-on-national-assessment-of-educational-progress/&quot;&gt;Mississippi reported the nation’s largest improvement in reading scores&lt;/a&gt;; the state had started training teachers in phonics instruction six years earlier. For the first time, Mississippi’s reading scores matched the nation’s average, with 32 percent of students showing proficiency, up from 22 percent in 2009, making it the only state to post significant gains in reading in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;England, too, started seeing dramatic results after government-funded schools were required in 2006 to teach systematic phonics to 5- to 7-year-olds. When the country implemented a test to assess phonics skills in 2012, 58 percent of 5- and 6-year-olds passed. By 2016, 81 percent of students passed. Reading comprehension at age 7 has risen, and gains seem to persist at age 11. These population trends make a strong case for teaching phonics, says Douglas Fuchs, an educational psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A boost with phonics &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After adding explicit phonics instruction statewide in 2013, Mississippi reported the nation’s largest improvement in reading scores among fourth-graders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Mississippi fourth-grade reading proficiency&lt;/h6&gt;

Otwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: National Assessment of Educational Progress 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the evidence that children learn to read best when given systematic phonics along with other key components of a literacy program, many schools and teacher-training programs either ignore the science, apply it inconsistently or mix conflicting approaches that could hinder proficiency. In the 2019 Education Week Research Center survey, 86 percent of teachers who train teachers said they teach phonics. But surveyed elementary school teachers often use strategies that contradict a phonics-first approach: Seventy-five percent said they use a technique called three cuing. This method teaches children to guess words they don’t know by using context and picture clues, and has been criticized for getting in the way of learning to decode. More than half of the teachers said they thought students could understand written passages that contained unfamiliar words, even without a good grasp of phonics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disconnect starts at the top. In a 2013 review of nearly 700 teacher-training institutions, only 29 percent required teachers to take courses on four or five of the five essential facets of reading instruction identified by the National Reading Panel. Almost 60 percent required teachers to complete coursework on two or fewer of the essentials, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and policy group based in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Teacher’s choice &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a random sample of almost 700 U.S. early-elementary and special education teachers, most reported using a method called balanced literacy to teach reading. The simple view of reading, focused on phonics, was a distant second.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced literacy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Instruction includes a bit of everything, usually with some phonics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emphasis is on phonics, with a focus on two skills: decoding and language comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instruction emphasizes whole words and phrases in meaningful contexts, including a strategy called three cuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;How U.S. educators teach reading&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: EdWeek Research Center 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the Education Week Research Center also surveyed 533 postsecondary educators who train teachers on how to teach reading. Only 22 percent of those educators said their philosophy was to teach explicit, systematic phonics. Almost 60 percent said they support balanced literacy. And about 15 percent thought, contrary to evidence, that most students would learn to read if given the right books and enough time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The majority of classrooms in this country continue to embrace instructional practices and programs that do not include systematic instruction in foundational skills like phonemic awareness and phonics and spelling,” Moats says. “They just don’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At my son’s Minneapolis school, reading specialist Karin Emerson told me about her early days teaching kindergarten, first and second grades in the 1990s. She was trained to use a whole language approach that included the three cuing technique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerson described a typical reading lesson: “I’m going to show you a big book, and I’m going to cover up all of the letters of the word except the &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m going to say, ‘Look at this page. It says this is a …’ What do you think it’s going to say?” Then she would point out the butterfly in the picture and ask the students to think about whether the &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; sound could refer to anything in the picture. “What does butterfly start with? A ‘b-uh.’ Do you think it’s going to be butterfly? I think it is going to be butterfly. It is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eight years later, Emerson switched from classroom teacher to reading specialist, helping third-graders who weren’t reading yet. Many were the same students she had taught to read in younger grades. After reviewing the reading research, she implemented systematic phonics. By the end of third grade, students in her groups advanced an average of two grade levels. She now encourages early-grade teachers to add at least 20 minutes of phonics a day into literacy lessons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking back to her classroom-teaching days, Emerson says parents often told her they were concerned that their children weren’t reading yet. “I would say, ‘Oh, they’ll be fine because they’re well spoken, they’re bright and you’re reading to them.’ Well they weren’t fine,” Emerson says. “Some people learn how to read super easy, and that’s great. But most people need to be taught, and there’s a pretty big chunk who need to be taught in a systematic way.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While learning about ongoing battles over reading instruction, I have been marveling at my son’s transformation from nonreader to reader. One recent afternoon, he came home from school and told me that he had learned how to spell the word “A-G-A-I-N.” I asked him how he would spell it if it looked like it sounded. He worked it out, one sound at a time: “U-G-E-N.” We agreed the English language is pretty strange. It’s amazing anyone learns to read it at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This is your brain on reading&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reading is a relatively new activity for the human brain, which hasn’t had time to evolve specialized areas devoted to the task. Instead, our brains enlist areas, such as the visual system, that originated for other reasons, says Guinevere Eden, a neuroscientist at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. An object like a tree or a lion needs to be recognizable from any angle, she says. But when we read, we need to override that kind of pattern recognition to distinguish, say, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;, two letters that look identical to a beginning reader.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To translate squiggles and dots into sounds, several key brain areas, in both the visual and language systems, get involved. And how involved those areas are during reading shifts with increasing mastery, according to brain-imaging studies from the last two decades. When early or experienced readers sound out an unfamiliar word, they tap into the posterior and superior temporal lobes and inferior parietal lobe, which are involved in language and sensory processing. When the brain encounters a familiar word, on the other hand, the visual cortex takes over, suggesting that known words become like any other object that the brain recognizes instantly. As a person’s reading skills improve and the mental menu of familiar words grows, activity is more pronounced in the visual cortex during reading, Eden says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;fMRI brain reading&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087151&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042520_reading_inline3_mobile-674x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087151&quot;&gt;This fMRI scan shows activity (red and orange) in areas known to be involved in reading, including the left inferior frontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe and the inferior temporal cortex, which is part of the visual cortex. In adults with dyslexia, those areas are less active during reading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087151&quot;&gt;G.F. Eden et al/Neuron 2004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eden uses brain scans to understand what goes wrong in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11702896&quot;&gt;children with reading disabilities,&lt;/a&gt; who have trouble sounding out words. One of her goals is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apmreports.org/story/2017/09/11/what-is-dyslexia-guinevere-eden&quot;&gt;evaluate interventions for children with dyslexia&lt;/a&gt; to see if the interventions target the brain processes that are most impaired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite heavy marketing by companies that sell reading products using brain scans as evidence that the companies’ methods help children learn to read, Eden says that imaging studies cannot yet answer questions about which types of reading instruction are best for children, with or without reading disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;The scars of emotional abuse are invisible, deep, and diverse; and unfortunately, emotional abuse likely impacts more students than we think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotionally abusive behavior broadly consists of criticism, degradation, rejection, or threat. Emotional abuse (also known as psychological maltreatment or verbal assault) can happen anywhere, both within and outside of families, and can refer to a single severe incident or a chronic, ongoing pattern. Educators, caregivers, coaches, school mental health professionals, administrators, and peers are all capable of acting emotionally abusive toward school-age youth. That is part of its insidious invisibility; despite emotional abuse being highly involved in childhood abuse cases, it is often forgotten and overlooked. This type of interpersonal trauma is typically chronic and cuts deeply, as it is associated with mental and physical health issues (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress, sleep problems, self-harm) during the school years and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with this existing knowledge, emotional abuse remains misunderstood, minimized, unseen, and unreported by many, including school professionals. We outline three things teachers need to know about emotional abuse and three things they can do to meet the needs of students experiencing emotional abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact on the student determines the occurrence of emotional abuse more than the behavior that caused it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no legal or clinical universal definition of emotional abuse. For example, two students with a parent teasing them about their appearances may react differently, in part based on context and relationship with the parent. Emotional abuse would be determined by the impact on the student, rather than the teasing alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional abuse is detrimental to both a student’s way of thinking and feeling. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children create their sense of self from stories that others construct about them. Students may believe the destructive narratives that are told to them. That is, these harmful words may impact students at their core—shifting how they think about themselves and the world, and how they feel about themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are numerous ways that emotional abuse may manifest. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional abuse is not simply hearing harmful words. The context around the experience of emotional abuse are varied and diverse. A student may internalize or externalize their behaviors, or something in between. If a school-aged youth is repeatedly told that she is worthless, then the student may be meek in class. If a student is threatened repeatedly, then she may act aggressively toward others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of your emotional needs and your emotional health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educators cannot support students if they cannot support themselves. As some students may constantly hear emotionally destructive words in their home environments, teachers certainly do not want to bring any semblance of that into their schools. Nevertheless, working with students can be tiring and frustrating. If their emotional energy is low, teachers may react rather than respond to difficult situations that unexpectedly arise. Rather than taking a breath, teachers might begin to punitively scold or admonish a student. Teachers need to take care of their emotional needs so that they do not parallel any unhealthy at-home behaviors in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster sharing through strong relationships. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to examine the life contexts behind a student’s behaviors. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with students, be curious about the circumstances in students’ lives that may influence how they act in school. To have a firmer understanding, teachers need to create brave spaces in our schools and classrooms so that students may feel comfortable sharing with adults. Students often regard educators as more effective guardians in violence protection than police or security, which speaks to the importance of continuing to cultivate this trust. When students share feelings, provide positive reinforcement by expressing your gratitude or by giving a thoughtful, affirming response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the laws around mandated reporting, and communicate with transparency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/manda/&quot;&gt;Check state regulations&lt;/a&gt; and learn to whom to report and how to report within your district or county. If and when suspicion or reports of abuse arise, reach out to your school mental health professionals. Encourage your administrators to grow emotional abuse awareness, prevention, and intervention initiatives so that others feel willing to report even in instances of suspected abuse. Openly discuss what happens after a report is made, as this transparency allows for students to feel more comfortable with the idea of reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Words are powerful, and as such, can be weaponized and wounding. Words can also be healing, spoken with gentleness and justice. Teachers should listen wholly to their students and their unstated needs; let teachers use their minds and words wisely and act knowingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Image by Okan AKGÜL on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/apple-gift-teacher-book-classroom-4958609/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixabay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/&quot;&gt;Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622374312/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622374312/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/earth-day-at-50-episode-54-the-oxford-comment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Earth Day at 50: conservation, spirituality, and climate change [podcast]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/lessons-learnt-from-coronavirus-and-global-environmental-challenges/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lessons learnt from Coronavirus and global environmental challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In the
most comprehensive lunar map yet, the moon looks like it’s been playing
paintball. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each splash of color identifies a discrete rock or sediment formation, including craters, basins and ancient lava fields. For instance, “the darker, more earth tones are these highland-type terrains, and the reds and the purples tend to be more of these volcanic and lava flow materials,” says geologist James Skinner, who oversees the production of standardized maps for solar system bodies at the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz. (For more details on exactly what those colors mean, check out the map in all its glory &lt;a href=&quot;https://astropedia.astrogeology.usgs.gov/download/Moon/Geology/thumbs/Unified_Geologic_Map_of_The_Moon_200dpi.jpg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/2760.pdf&quot;&gt;Unified Geologic Map of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, released April 20 by the USGS, as it’s called, combines information from six regional lunar maps created during the Apollo era, as well as recent spacecraft observations. The modern data include views of the north and south lunar poles made by NASA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/see-how-visualizations-moon-have-changed-over-time&quot;&gt;Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/a&gt;, and observations around the equator from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s SELENE lunar orbiter (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/10/19&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This lunar cartography project was trickier than just fitting Apollo-era maps together like puzzle pieces and using new data to tweak the details — in part, because the edges of the regional maps didn’t line up. Many surface features at the boundaries between neighboring maps were labeled with inconsistent names, descriptions and ages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Different colors on a new geologic map of the moon designate different types of rock and sediment formations on the moon. For instance, craters associated with the Eratosthenian period on the moon (about 3.2 billion to 1.1 billion years ago) are typically marked green. Craters from the older Imbrian period (around 3.9 billion to 3.2 billion years ago) are generally painted blue.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those discrepancies
arose because the Apollo-era maps were created by separate research groups, and
two different teams looking at the same parts of the moon could interpret what
they saw differently. For instance, one group might have seen something jagged
on the surface and called it a fault, whereas another team could have read it
as a fragment ejected during the formation of a crater. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Skinner
and colleagues reconciled those discrepancies by analyzing information from all
six regional maps, along with the new lunar orbiter observations, to figure out
the proper identifications for different surface features. That allowed the
team to draw up a comprehensive geologic map of the whole moon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detailed
observations from the lunar orbiters were especially helpful for clearing up
uncertainties in how different craters overlapped with each other, which
revealed the craters’ relative ages. Hammering out crater formation timelines gives
insight into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinning-moon-map-debris-giant-impact-craters&quot;&gt;the moon’s history&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/26/18&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new map could also inform &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-landed-moon-missions-apollo-top-science-stories-2019-yir&quot;&gt;future human missions to the moon&lt;/a&gt; by revealing regions that may be rich in useful resources or areas that need more detailed mapping to land a spacecraft there safely (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/16/19&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Damien Drix will talk about the paper &quot;The control of plastic inhibition over excitatory synaptic plasticity leads to the joint emergence of sensory coding and contrast invariance&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex,
but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding
efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity,
and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of
coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory
plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network
of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results
show that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate
input encoding. Additionally, inhibitory feedback increases the metabolic efficiency by
implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous
emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight the role of
interneuron plasticity during the development of receptive fields and in shaping sensory
representations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The master chemists known as
&lt;em&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/em&gt; bacteria have turned a compound
rich with the tangy odor of moist soil into a hitchhiking scam.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This group of bacteria, the inspiration
for streptomycin and other antibiotics, can release a strong, earthy whiff of what’s
called geosmin. It’s not just an everyday scent for them. Some bacterial genes that
regulate spore-making also can trigger geosmin production, an international
research team reports April 6 in &lt;em&gt;Nature
Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;. When bacteria start making spores, geosmin wafts into the
soil and attracts hungry little arthropods called springtails. They feast on
the bacteria, inadvertently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0697-x&quot;&gt;picking up spores that hitchhike&lt;/a&gt; to new territory, says Klas Flärdh, a microbiologist at
Lund University in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geosmin floats off many
environmental microbes, including virtually all &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/em&gt;. People as well as many other animals can detect low
concentrations of it. For instance, the common &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; lab fruit fly dedicates a circuit in its sensory wiring
just to detecting geosmin, which the flies find repellant. That kind of disgust
might help animals avoid microbially contaminated food. Various springtails,
however, flock to the smell. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sperm-stick-springtails&quot;&gt;Springtails&lt;/a&gt; abound
in soil (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/19/14&lt;/em&gt;). The “spring”
part of their name comes from a prong latched against the body that snaps loose
to smack the ground in a crisis, bouncing the springtail up and away from
danger.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scuttling specks of
springtails showed up in unusual numbers when coauthor Paul Becher set out bits
of &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces &lt;/em&gt;bacteria forming
spores under shrubbery at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in
Alnarp. A springtail can smell the bacterial geosmin, Becher, Flärdh and
colleagues say after testing the antenna sensitivity of a pale, all-female kind
popular in labs, &lt;em&gt;Folsomia candida&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genetics linked the alluring
geosmin odor to the bacterial phase of making spores. During that phase, a &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/em&gt;’ usual thready network
starts pushing up spore-making structures. “Like skyscrapers,” says Flärdh with
a microbiologist’s sense of “tall.” Lab &lt;em&gt;F.
candida&lt;/em&gt; springtails readily grazed on these micro skyscrapers, and tests confirmed
that spores from the bacteria stuck to the springtail bodies. Spores can also
spread from fecal pellets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Streptomyces bacteria&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087045&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040320_SM_soil-bacteria_inline-680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087045&quot;&gt;The microscopic doilies of &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/em&gt; bacteria release a strong “wet soil” odor that lures small arthropods to feast on them and end up dispersing bacterial spores.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087045&quot;&gt;John Innes Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea of feasting springtails
that disperse bacterial spores echoes what scientists already know about the
little arthropods eating fungi and giving a lift to their spores, even some that
are dangerous to other arthropods, says microbiologist Valeria Agamennone, who
wasn’t involved in the new research. (She did her dissertation on springtails
before joining the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research in
Zeist.) Springtails, she says, may share a long and intimate history with
bacteria. She and colleagues have even found some penicillin-making genes that could
have originated in bacteria but now mingle with springtail genes.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new work on bacterial lures
makes “a delightful paper,” says Keith Chater, who worked extensively on &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces &lt;/em&gt;at the John Innes Center in
Norwich, England, before retiring.  In a
long-ago chat with a journalist, Chater off-handedly mused that geosmin from
moisture-loving bacteria might let camels sniff their way to water in a desert.
“The idea took on a life of its own,” he laments after seeing it repeated more
definitively than he meant it. As a bacterial geneticist, he never tested
camels. At least now, a somewhat similar geosmin-sniffing tale has turned up
with actual data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Counting
universes ought to be easy. By definition, you can stop at 1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trouble
is, definitions change. A century ago, the “universe” was defined as the Milky
Way galaxy. Heretics who disagreed had long been ridiculed— until science
staged what became known as the Great Debate, on April 26, 100 years ago. On
that date, American astronomers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/shapley-harlow.pdf&quot;&gt;Harlow
Shapley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/curtis-heber.pdf&quot;&gt;Heber
Curtis&lt;/a&gt; articulated opposing views on the scope of the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today
astronomers know that the Milky Way, huge as it is, is a mere drop in the
cosmic bucket. Just as the sun is only one of 100 billion or so stars swirling
within the Milky Way’s pinwheel disk, the Milky Way is only one of hundreds of
billions of such galaxies inhabiting a vast, expanding bubble of space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But
in 1920, conventional wisdom dictated that the Milky Way was alone. Most
experts insisted that the fuzzy patches of light known as nebulae resided
within the Milky Way. Nebulae with a spiral structure might be solar systems in
the making, some astronomers suggested.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Others
insisted that the nebulae were far, far away, well beyond the Milky Way’s
borders. In fact, the heretics argued, the nebulae (at least some) contained
stars in quantities comparable to our galaxy, and deserved recognition as
“island universes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Actually,
the island universe idea had been a popular explanation for the nebulae in the
mid-19th century. (American astronomer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/ormsby-macknight-mitchel-island-universe&quot;&gt;Ormsby
MacKnight Mitchel&lt;/a&gt; coined the “island universe” label in
the 1840s, a translation from a German article referring to the nebulae as &lt;em&gt;Weltinseln&lt;/em&gt;.)
But by century’s end, the astronomical consensus had affirmed the Milky Way as
the sole and rightful universe. Irish astronomer and author Agnes Clerke
declared in 1890 that “no competent thinker” believed the nebulae to be galaxies
comparable to the Milky Way. She later wrote that the island universe theory
had passed into the realm of “discarded and half-forgotten speculations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But
during the first two decades of the 20th century, new astronomical observations
raised doubts. Curtis, for one, maintained that the evidence favored island
universes. But Shapley insisted that the nebulae could not be far enough away
to be outside the Milky Way. He cited measurements (by Adriaan van Maanen) of
motion of the spiral arms within some nebulae; such motion would be
undetectable if the nebulae were actually distant galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In
1919, leaders of the National Academy of Sciences decided it would be fun to hold
a debate on the dispute at the academy’s meeting the following April. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technically,
the topic of the debate was to be on “the distance scale of the universe.” On
that issue, Curtis was the conservative and Shapley was the heretic. Curtis
maintained the more traditional view that the visible Milky Way stretched only
about 30,000 light-years across at most, and was possibly much smaller. Shapley
thought that the Milky Way had a diameter of 300,000 light-years (much bigger even
than today’s estimate of roughly 100,000 light-years or so). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although
Shapley’s view of the Milky Way’s size was radical, it did support the
consensus view opposing island universes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If, as Shapley maintained,
the Galaxy was much larger than had previously been thought, it would be more
difficult for Curtis to sustain the claim that the spiral nebulae were
independent island universes,” historian Michael Hoskin observed &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/cs_real.html&quot;&gt;in a 1976 paper&lt;/a&gt; analyzing the debate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As
it turned out, the “debate” was nothing that CNN would had televised. Each
astronomer just presented a 40-minute talk. Shapley, who went first, read from
a typewritten script. Curtis, the better speaker, showed slides, a more powerful
way to make his point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shapley
recounted a potpourri of recent astronomical observations, barely mentioning
the island universe theory. He insisted that Curtis’ interpretation of the observations
required abandoning “the very foundations of modern astrophysics.”
But he acknowledged that if the Milky Way was really small, the island universe
idea just maybe could be right.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If
the galactic system is as large as I maintain, the spiral nebulae can hardly be
comparable galactic systems,” Shapley declared. “If it is but one-tenth as
large, there &lt;em&gt;might &lt;/em&gt;be a good opportunity for the hypothesis
that our galactic system is a spiral nebula, comparable in size with the other
spiral nebulae, all of which would then be ‘island’ universes of stars.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Andromeda&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087266&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042220_ts_great-debate_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087266&quot;&gt;Until 1924, astronomers did not know whether Andromeda (shown in an 1888 image) and other nebulae were a part of the Milky Way or separate “island universes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087266&quot;&gt;From the book Astronomy of To-Day, 1909&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Curtis
presented data supporting his view of a smaller Milky Way, citing various
estimates of its diameter ranging from 10,000 light-years to 30,000
light-years. He argued that the analysis of light from spiral nebulae indicated
that they were clusters of stars (with similar features to the spectrum of
light from the Milky Way itself). “The spectrum of the spiral nebulae offers no
difficulties in the island universe theory of the spirals,” Curtis stated.
Subsequent slides further built the case for the spirals as island universes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More
detailed arguments (deviating considerably from the original talks) appeared
the next year &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/cs_nrc.html&quot;&gt;in
papers by Shapley and Curtis&lt;/a&gt; published jointly under the title “The
Scale of the Universe” in the &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of the National Research Council&lt;/em&gt;.
Resolution of the debate came two years later: Astronomer Edwin Hubble
demonstrated that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sky-pinwheels-are-stellar-universes-6000000000000000000-miles-away&quot;&gt;Andromeda
nebula was truly an island universe&lt;/a&gt; — full of stars at a distance far
exceeding even Shapley’s generous estimate of the Milky Way’s girth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Faced
with new findings, Shapley had to concede. When a letter arrived from Hubble
reporting the Andromeda results, Shapley remarked: “Here is the letter that
destroyed my universe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shapley
had been misled by van Maanen’s measurements — they simply turned out to be
wrong. “Shapley …
said later that van Maanen was his friend, so of course he believed him,”
astronomer Virginia Trimble commented in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/papers/trimble.html&quot;&gt;1995 discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But
Shapley had not been entirely defeated. For on another important point, he was
right, and Curtis was wrong. In his smaller Milky Way, Curtis placed the sun
very near the center, as astronomical consensus dictated. Around the turn of
the century, astronomer Simon Newcomb had wondered about that consensus, though,
pointing out that ancient astronomers believed with equal confidence that the
Earth sat at the center of the universe. Shapley declared that Newcomb was
right to be skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have
been victimized by the chance position of the sun near the center of a
subordinate system, and misled by the consequent phenomena, to think that we
are God’s own appointed, right in the thick of things,” Shapley said at the
1920 debate — “in much the same way ancient man was misled, by the rotation of
the earth … to believe that even his little planet was the center of the
universe.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today astronomers all know that Shapley was right about the sun; it is substantially displaced from the galactic center. And everybody knows that Curtis was also right: The Milky Way — home to sun, Earth and humankind — is not a single universe unto itself, but one of a myriad upon myriad of other galaxies — no longer known as island universes, as the definition of “universe” had to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This episode of &lt;em&gt;Brain Science&lt;/em&gt; is an interview with neuroscientist Matthew Cobb author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3avdYDa&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cobb approaches the history of neuroscience from a different perspective than previous writers. He writes from the perspective of a working scientist with a deep interest in the history of ideas and the interaction between science and culture. This approach makes for a fascinating discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through out history assumptions about the brain have been influenced by both culture and contemporary science. For example, before the discovery of electricity it was impossible to image that the brain uses both chemical and electrical signals to communicate. Similarly, our current understanding is heavily influenced by the computer metaphor, which actually misses much about how real brains function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another aspect of our discussion involves several ongoing debates with neuroscience such as the importance of localization versus network properties. We also touch on the tendency toward neuromythology, which is the tendency to think that understanding the brain is the only tool for understanding what it means to be human. Dr. Cobb reminds of the importance of being aware of the work in a wide varieties of fields include science and the humanities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Links and References:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3avdYDa&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Amazon link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Matthew Cobb &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Complete Bibliography at &lt;a href=&quot;https://theideaofthebrain.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/bibliography.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theideaofthebrain.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainsciencepodcast.com/&quot;&gt;http://brainsciencepodcast.com&lt;/a&gt; for additional references and episode transcripts.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please Visit Our Sponsors:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The Great Courses Plus at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/GINGER&quot;&gt;thegreatcoursesplus.com/GINGER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;TextExpander at &lt;a href=&quot;https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&amp;amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;amp;utm_campaign=textexpander-Apr-2020&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Textexpander link&quot;&gt;textexpander.com/podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Announcements:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainsciencepodcast.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comes out on 4th Friday each month.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The new expanded edition of &lt;em&gt;Are You Sure?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have received a lot of hype in recent years — but many scientists are worried that the claims about what these devices can achieve don’t match the reality&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://undark.org/2020/04/22/brain-technology-interface/&quot;&gt;reports Benjamin Powers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Undark&lt;/em&gt;. Often these devices also fall into a regulatory grey area, potentially leaving consumers, or their data, at risk.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39523&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the medical side, however, BCIs are showing promise in helping paralysed people to move again. &lt;/strong&gt;This week researchers report giving a patient an implant that not only restored movement to his hand, but also allowed him to detect objects by touch. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2241576-brain-implant-lets-man-with-paralysis-move-and-feel-with-his-hand/&quot;&gt;Donna Lu has the story&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve probably all had the experience in recent weeks of cringing when a character on TV shakes hands with someone or touches their face. &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks to the pandemic, we have a conditioned aversion to these kinds of behaviours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-cringe/610180/&quot;&gt;writes Marina Koren&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; — but once this is all over, how long will it take for us to “unlearn” these associations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March saw a huge number of people watching and reading news, particularly news about coronavirus — but now those figures are dropping back down. &lt;/strong&gt;Although research is still ongoing,&lt;strong&gt; t&lt;/strong&gt;here could be psychological reasons for this drop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-news-fatigue&quot;&gt;writes Will Bedingfield&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;: it could reflect reduced anxiety in the general population, or, more worryingly, a kind of “desensitisation” to coronavirus-related news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conspiracy theories about coronavirus abound — so what can we do to stop them spreading? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;At&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-are-dangerous-heres-how-to-stop-them-spreading-136564&quot;&gt;Stephan Lewandowsky and John Cook suggest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;some strategies for “inoculating” the public against misinformation, such as explaining the faulty logic behind conspiracy theories and highlighting the dubious sources from which they originate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, there’s lots more in the media this week on how the pandemic is affecting our sleep and dreams&lt;/strong&gt;.  At &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1840728/how-to-tackle-insomnia-and-nightmares-during-covid-19/&quot;&gt;Amanat Khullar looks at&lt;/a&gt; how the trauma of the crisis may be causing sleep disturbances, and gets some advice on how to get a better night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Drugs widely used to treat
high blood pressure do not appear to make COVID-19 dangerously worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two new studies from China
offer the first observational evidence that the drugs do not increase the risk
that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 will develop severe complications or
die. One study looked at 362 patients with high blood pressure treated at
Central Hospital of Wuhan, the city where the initial outbreak occurred. It
found &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2765049&quot;&gt;no difference between those on the drugs and those not&lt;/a&gt; in terms of the severity of the disease and whether a
patient survived or died, researchers from the hospital report online April 23 in
&lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other study followed 1,128
COVID-19 patients with hypertension from nine hospitals in Hubei Provence, where
Wuhan is located. It found that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317134&quot;&gt;mortality rate was lower&lt;/a&gt; for the 188 on the drugs, an international research
team reports online April 17 in &lt;em&gt;Circulation
Research&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
new studies provide reassurance that the drugs “are not associated with harm in
patients with COVID-19, as some had suspected,” says cardiologist Scott Solomon
of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. But
without randomized controlled trials, in which patients are randomly chosen to
take a drug or a placebo, “it will be very difficult to get at the truth” of exactly
what impact the drugs have, he says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drugs — angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors, or ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, or
ARBs — have been in the spotlight since data emerged that COVID-19 takes a
harder toll on people with hypertension, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable&quot;&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and diabetes (&lt;em&gt;SN:
3/20/20&lt;/em&gt;). Many with these conditions take the drugs, which work to stop a
hormone called angiotensin II from increasing blood pressure in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers wondered if
the drugs themselves helped to explain why these patients are more likely to
have severe complications or die from COVID-19. Animal data show that the drugs
can increase the amount of a protein called angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or
ACE2. That’s the protein that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sars-new-coronavirus-target-same-cellular-lock-infect-cells&quot;&gt;grabs onto to enter a cell&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/3/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the speculation,
the major heart health organizations have recommended that patients on the
drugs continue to take them, until there’s evidence of harm. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there’s more to the
story than just the potential for unwanted effects. “ACE2 is sort of a
double-edged sword,” says Erin Michos, a preventive cardiologist at Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine. Although it’s the entry point for the
coronavirus, “it’s thought to be potentially protective in the lungs,” she
says. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;ACE2 inactivates angiotensin
II, regulating the hormone. A study published in the aftermath of the SARS
epidemic reported that ACE2, which is found on lung cells, protected mice from
an acute lung injury similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome — a severe
complication of SARS and COVID-19. In contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03712&quot;&gt;angiotensin
II led to excess fluid in the lungs&lt;/a&gt;
and impaired their function, researchers reported in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in theory, it’s plausible
that the drugs might help patients with COVID-19, Michos says. Blocking
angiotensin II might mean it can’t contribute to fluid buildup in the lungs.
Along with clinical trials to investigate this, it will be useful to learn
whether the drugs “make a difference in whether you need hospitalization or
not,” she says, since the new studies looked at people who were already
hospitalized with COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-US">The ‘insect apocalypse’ is more complicated than it sounds</title>
		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-apocalypse-declines-biodiversity"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3087343</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Taking a
big view of the so-called Insect Apocalypse finds some possible winners among
the losers, plus a lot of things we don’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overheated end-times terms
have popped up during the last few years conveying fear that the bounty of
Earth’s butterflies, beetles, bees and many other insects has started slipping
away. The worry is not just about species likely to go extinct. Even species that
will probably survive might be shrinking in population so much that their
skimpy numbers no can longer fill their current roles in ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a new look at insect abundance,
slanted toward North America and Europe, hints that freshwater residents are overall
increasing.  Data mostly gathered since
the 1960s suggests that beetles, mayflies, dragonflies and other creatures that
spend a good part of their lives in water &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax9931&quot;&gt;have increased about 11 percent per decade&lt;/a&gt;, says a study in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;
April 24. In contrast, land-dwelling insects shrank in abundance by about 9
percent per decade, the study says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insects will not disappear,”
says coauthor Roel van Klink, an entomologist at the German Center for Integrative
Biodiversity Research in Leipzig. He and colleagues found, however, “a lot of
reason for concern” overall, he says. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Van Klink first started
thinking about the project in 2017, when careful, long-term monitoring of the
biomass of insects flying in 63 protected nature preserves in Germany &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809&quot;&gt;had dropped more than 75 percent&lt;/a&gt; over 27 years. “I doubt that’s a general phenomenon,”
van Klink remembers thinking. After two months without hearing about anybody
else starting a worldwide search for data, he says he realized, “&lt;em&gt;I’ve&lt;/em&gt; got do it.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Van Klink and colleagues found
166 surveys of abundance (numbers of individuals and/or the absolute mass of
insects and occasionally spiders mixed in) that ran for at least 10 years at 1,676
sites around the world. The oldest data went back to 1928, but data are most
abundant from the 1980s. Researchers compared how steeply or gently the
populations were falling and rising. Many of the sites already were affected heavily
by humans when surveys began. For instance, he speculates that the rise in
freshwater arthropod abundance may reflect some recovery as environmental laws
improved water quality in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The rise and fall of insect abundance worldwide&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surveys (dots) lasting at least 10 years show a range of abundance trends (redder for steeper declines, blue for steeper increases). Overall, freshwater insects have been increasing, and terrestrial ones declining, but both trends are distorted by disproportionate amounts of data from North America.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087346&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042320_sm_insects_inline-map_desktop.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087346&quot;&gt;R. van Klink et al/&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;map of insect increases and decreases&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087345&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042320_sm_insects_inline-map_mobile-342x450.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087345&quot;&gt;R. van Klink et al/&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Van Klink warns against a search
for one big threat to explain the trends. Even if humans stopped using pesticides
tomorrow, “there’s no evidence that insects would suddenly be alright,” he
says. He reels off a list of other threats — habitat destruction or fragmentation,
climate change, pesticides, urbanization, light pollution and so on — that may
be important in some places.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new paper’s search for
studies and its strategies for mixing data from diverse sites seems “much more
thorough and analytically thoughtful” than those of previous papers on insect
decline, says Alison Johnston, a quantitative ecologist at the Cornell Lab of
Ornithology. Still she cautions that the trends this paper sees are driven
largely by the outsized share of data from North America. Pulling the continent
out of the data cuts the decline about in half.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Van Klink agrees this kind
of analysis needs data from more places. “In all of Africa, we have two datasets,”
he says. There’s nothing from India, and Australia “is shockingly
underrepresented.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper bristles with other
cautions about conclusions drawn from such geographically skewed and relatively
recent information. The news that freshwater organisms have been thriving may cheer
you up, but such waters represent only 2.49 percent of Earth’s land area. In
another caveat, researchers point out that datasets from protected areas are
more abundant in this new study than protected areas are on the ground, so surveys
of life in those cushy conditions may have weakened any signals of decline in
the overall study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even with all the caveats, van Klink sees a looming problem in the apparently mild decline the paper detected of around 1 percent a year. “This is not even something you would notice from year to year, because the insect population varies so much,” he says. “But after 30 years you will have lost a quarter of your insects.” Despite the need for clearer data on insect decline, “we definitely need to do something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heavy-rain-kilauea-eruption"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3087312</id>
		<updated>2020-04-23T20:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;When it rains heavily in Hawaii, lava pours
from the volcano Kilauea, according to a new study facing strong scrutiny by
some volcanologists. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting in May 2018, the volcano dramatically
ramped up its 35-year-long eruption, opening 24 new fissures and shooting fountains
of lava 80 meters into the air. Within three months, the volcano had unleashed as
much lava as it normally produces in 10 or 20 years, according to rates of average
lava flow going back decades. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study, published April 22 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2172-5&quot;&gt;the
volcanic episode was triggered by heavy rainfall&lt;/a&gt;
in the months preceding. The idea is that large amounts of rain seeping into
the ground increased the pressure within the rocks, creating zones of weakness
that then fractured. Those fractures presented “new pathways for molten magma
to make its way to the surface,” says study coauthor Jamie
Farquharson, a volcanologist at the University of Miami in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Precipitation data from satellites indicate
that Kilauea received more than double the average amount of rainfall for the
first quarter of 2018. Kilauea’s rocks are highly permeable, which allows water
to percolate several kilometers deep, close to the magma chamber. Farquharson and
geophysicist Falk Amelung, also at the University of Miami, used computer
simulations of how pressure exerted by that water on the walls of pores
in the rocks would have increased as more rain fell. Though those
pressure increases were less than the pressure exerted by daily tides, they
were significant enough to have caused the rocks — already weakened by years of
volcanic and seismic activity — to break and allow lava to flow, the team
found.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The “most compelling” evidence for
the rain-trigger theory, Farquharson says,
came
from archived records going back to 1790 that show that “eruptions seem to be
approximately twice as likely to begin during the wettest parts of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also say that the data
they looked at showed a lack of substantial ground uplift at Kilauea’s summit and
throughout the volcano’s plumbing system. Significant uplift would be expected if
the eruption were caused by new magma pumping to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That finding, however, directly
contradicts observations by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano
Observatory. Those data showed significant ground deformation, indicating an
increase in belowground pressure, at Kilauea’s summit before the fissure
eruption, says Michael Poland, a USGS volcanologist based in Vancouver, Wash. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re skeptical of the [new] findings,”
Poland says. He and his colleagues are preparing a response “that argues for a
different mechanism for the eruption, and highlights the data that the authors
might have missed.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kilauea lava flow&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087314&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042220_ms_kilaueau_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087314&quot;&gt;For about three months in 2018, Kilauea released as much lava as it normally produces in 10 to 20 years. Here, a lava river flows on May 19, 2018, from a newly opened fissure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087314&quot;&gt;USGS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, at the volcano’s Puu
Oo cone, where most of the volcanic activity had occurred from 1983 to 2018, scientists observed ground
motion caused by underground pressure changes beginning in mid-March. “We attribute this to a backup in the
plumbing system — basically the amount of lava that was being erupted [at the
surface] started to decrease, a bit like kinking the hose,” Poland says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pressure built up at Puu Oo and then backed up through the
magmatic system to Kilauea’s summit, 19 kilometers away, increasing overall pressure
within the system. Earthquake activity also increased, likely because of increased
pressure on the rocks, Poland says. The level of the lava lake within the summit’s
caldera also rose — “a direct
measure of pressure,” he says. For the new
study to be correct, scientists would have had to see a “whole system
that did not pressurize beforehand.” And
they didn’t, Poland says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poland also sees problems with the team’s other evidence. For example, Farquharson and Amelung report that 60 percent of Kilauea’s eruptions since 1790 have occurred during wet periods, but then “even they equivocated,” Poland says, implying that statistically “it could be by chance.” And the plumbing system beneath Kilauea is so complex that most computer simulations are too simplistic to determine how water is moving and affecting pressure on the rocks at depth, he says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the idea that rain could cause weaknesses
in the ground that lead to volcanic eruptions is “interesting,” and even
plausible, Poland says. It’s the same principle shown in studies to cause &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volume-fracking-fluid-pumped-underground-tied-canada-quakes&quot;&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;
at fracking or wastewater disposal sites, where fluids are injected into the ground
either to increase pressure on the rock and push natural gas out or to store
the wastewater (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/18/18&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This
research is super exciting, especially because it is very interdisciplinary,”
says Thomas Webb, a volcanic meteorologist at the University of Oxford. He
particularly likes the approach linking cycles of pressure inside the volcano with
meteorological conditions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One
interesting question that the study raises, Webb says, is whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fingerprints-climate-change-increasingly-appear-extreme-weather&quot;&gt;rainfall increases due to climate
change&lt;/a&gt; could
affect how volcanoes behave (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/10/19&lt;/em&gt;).
“I would really like to see future work from these authors” addressing those
potential implications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Farquharson says future research also might involve installing pressure sensors deep in the ground around volcanoes to directly measure how rainfall affects pressure changes in the subsurface. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The
first fossil of a frog found in Antarctica gives new insight into the continent’s
ancient climate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Paleontologists
uncovered fragments of the frog’s hip bone and skull in 40-million-year-old
sediment collected from Seymour Island, near the tip of the Antarctic
Peninsula. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists
have previously found evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-monstrous-fish-eating-amphibian-unearthed&quot;&gt;giant amphibians&lt;/a&gt; that walked Antarctica during the
Triassic Period, over 200 million years ago, but no traces on the continent of
amphibians like those around today (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/23/15&lt;/em&gt;). The shape of the newly
discovered bones indicates that this frog belonged to the family of &lt;em&gt;Calyptocephalellidae&lt;/em&gt;,
or helmeted frogs, found today in South America. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
fossilized frog’s modern relatives live exclusively in the warm, humid central
Chilean Andes. This suggests that similar climate conditions existed on Antarctica
around 40 million years ago, researchers report April 23 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific
Reports&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;illustration of ancient Antarctica&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087278&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042120_MT_frog_inline-680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087278&quot;&gt;A new frog fossil suggests that millions of years ago, at least part of Antarctica (shown in this illustration) looked a lot like the Chilean Andes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087278&quot;&gt;Pollyanna von Knorring/Swedish Museum of Natural History, Simon Pierre Barrette, José Grau de Puerto Montt, Mats Wedin/Swedish Museum of Natural History, Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;illustration of ancient Antarctica&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087279&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042120_MT_frog_inline-tall.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087279&quot;&gt;A new frog fossil suggests that millions of years ago, at least part of Antarctica (shown in this illustration) looked a lot like the Chilean Andes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087279&quot;&gt;Pollyanna von Knorring/Swedish Museum of Natural History, Simon Pierre Barrette, José Grau de Puerto Montt, Mats Wedin/Swedish Museum of Natural History, Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That offers a clue about how fast Antarctica &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rainforest-antarctica-south-pole-roughly-90-million-years-ago&quot;&gt;switched from balmy to bitter cold&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/1/20&lt;/em&gt;). Antarctica quickly froze over after splitting from Australia and South America, which were once all part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/1969-antarctic-fossil-pointed-gondwanaland-existence&quot;&gt;the supercontinent Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/10/19&lt;/em&gt;). But some geologic evidence suggests that ice sheets began forming on Antarctica before it fully separated from the other southern continents about 34 million years ago. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The question is now, how cold was it, and what was living on the continent when these ice sheets started to form?” says study coauthor Thomas Mörs, a paleontologist at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm. “This frog is one more indication that in [that] time, at least around the Peninsula, it was still a suitable habitat for cold-blooded animals like reptiles and amphibians.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;With more men than women developing
severe illness and dying from COVID-19, sex differences that influence the
immune system may offer answers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bias in COVID-19 deaths appeared
in the first reports out of China and has also been revealed in countries that
break down their mortality data by sex. Of Italy’s 21,551 deaths recorded as of
April 20, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-decessi-italia&quot;&gt;64 percent were men&lt;/a&gt;. In Spain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/situacionActual.htm&quot;&gt;59 percent of the 12,634 deaths&lt;/a&gt; as of April 21 occurred in men. Germany had recorded 4,598
deaths by April 21, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-04-20-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&quot;&gt;58 percent in men&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The United States does not
separate out national COVID-19 mortality by sex, but some states do. New York has
the highest number COVID-19 deaths in the country, and as of April 21, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page&quot;&gt;60 percent of 15,302 deaths&lt;/a&gt; were in men. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of that discrepancy
could be because men are more likely than women to have other health problems,
such as hypertension and diabetes. These are among the underlying conditions
that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e2.htm&quot;&gt;raise the risk for severe COVID-19 disease&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
reported April 3. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Another possible culprit is
the immune system itself. The many proteins that work together to defend the
body against viruses do not operate exactly the same way in males and females. Those
biological differences, driven by sex hormones and genes, may be guarding some
women from the deadliest complications of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In general, females mount a
stronger immune response than males, studies have found. This makes women
overall less susceptible to viral infections than men, although how each individual
fares is another matter. A stronger immune response also means females are more
likely to develop autoimmune diseases, when the immune system attacks one’s own
tissue; conversely, a toned down immune response makes males more prone to
having a host of malignant cancers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sources of the stronger female
immune response can be found in both the innate and adaptive immune systems,
says Sabra Klein, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School
of Public Health. The innate system provides the first response against a virus,
while the adaptive system’s contribution is slightly delayed by the time needed
to ramp up antibody production against a new intruder. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One component of the innate
immune system is called toll-like receptor 7. This protein can recognize
molecules found on viruses, thereby outing the pathogens as foreign. The gene
for toll-like receptor 7 resides on the X chromosome. Because females have two
copies of the X, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silence-xs&quot;&gt;the body silences one&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/8/03&lt;/em&gt;),
allowing for the right “dose” of X chromosome genes. But some genes escape the shut
down, and there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/3/19/eaap8855&quot;&gt;evidence that this is true for the gene for toll-like
receptor 7&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported in &lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt; in 2018. That can
lead to more of the protein being made, giving females more guards looking out
for intruders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having more toll-like
receptor 7 can help jump start and enhance the next steps of the innate immune system.
“You want fast recognition, you want fast responses,” Klein says. “This is how
you start to activate the army of immune responses that are going to be needed
to clear an infection.” One of those steps is the release of interferons,
proteins that direct major factions of the body’s immune response. In studies
that measure levels of interferons in blood or in cells grown in a dish, researchers
overall see “greater production of these interferons in females as compared
with males,” says Klein. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the adaptive immune
system gears up, women can get a boost over men again. The amount of antibody
produced, as well as the quality of those antibodies, or the strength with
which they bind to the virus, tends to be greater in females compared with
males, Klein says. Female mice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206291/&quot;&gt;produced more neutralizing antibodies&lt;/a&gt; — the type which stop an infection by preventing the
virus from entering cells — and more total antibodies against influenza A virus after infection compared
with males, Klein and colleagues reported in &lt;em&gt;Vaccine&lt;/em&gt; in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The female hormone estrogen
also influences the innate and adaptive immune systems. The hormone can regulate
a variety of different genes for immune system proteins. For example, estrogen can
stimulate the production of interferons, says Klein. And some of the genes that
are associated with directing the response of B cells, which make antibodies,
are regulated by estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of these findings come
from research with other viruses, and haven’t yet been studied in the context
of COVID-19, Klein says, but “they provide us with some clues.” At this point,
some of the best clues as to why there are discrepancies in how men and women
fare with COVID-19 may come from a study of the disease SARS in mice. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sars-new-coronavirus-target-same-cellular-lock-infect-cells&quot;&gt;virus that causes SARS&lt;/a&gt; shares similarities with the culprit behind COVID-19,
SARS-CoV-2 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/3/20&lt;/em&gt;). And there is
evidence that during the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003, which had close to 800
deaths, men had a higher case fatality rate than women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s helpful to study sex
differences in mice because it takes behavioral influences out of the equation,
says Stanley Perlman, a virologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. For
example, as reports from China indicated that more men than women were having
severe cases of COVID-19, some also noted this could be due to the fact that
more Chinese men than women smoke. China was also among the five countries that
SARS cases were concentrated in. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perlman’s team compared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5450662/&quot;&gt;how male and female mice did&lt;/a&gt; when infected with a mouse-adapted version of SARS-CoV,
the virus that causes SARS, and reported the results in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Immunology &lt;/em&gt;in 2017. Among middle-aged
mice, those 8 to 9 months old, all of the males died within eight days of being
infected, but only 10 percent of the females did by day 12. Males had higher
amounts of the virus in their lungs than females did, suggesting the males
weren’t clearing the virus effectively. The males also had a prolonged,
unhelpful inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When the research team
removed the ovaries from 12 female mice to prevent estrogen from being made, about
85 percent of the mice died after infection, compared with close to 20 percent
of 12 females with their ovaries. Without estrogen, “the female mice were now
as sensitive to the infection as male mice,” Perlman says. “While I wouldn’t
claim it’s the whole story, estrogen is a big part of the story.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Klein and Perlman both have
plans to study differences in the male and female response to COVID-19. In cases
when the body’s own immune response contributes to a viral disease, it might be
expected women would fare worse, Klein says, because a strong immune response
can lead to too much damaging inflammation. And with COVID-19, there’s a lot of
concern about the detrimental effect of increased inflammation in the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what happens during COVID-19
might be different. “This aberrant inflammation might be higher in males than
females,” Klein says. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Tomasz Witkowski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the philharmonic orchestra to begin in the concert hall, you observe the people around you and wonder, “What made them come to this place?” The love of music? Snobbery? Conformism — because other friends do this? Or, maybe there are other, deeper motives? Similar questions arise when we think about what drives people to participate in pop culture and consume its products. Do they simply enjoy it? Scientists’ answers to this question can be surprising. For example, one study suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/01/even-those-participants-who-claimed-pop-culture-is-unimportant-suffered-psychological-ill-effects-from-feeling-out-of-the-loop/&quot;&gt;we consume pop culture because we suffer psychological ill effects from feeling out of the loop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what drives people to become cultural omnivores, those who consume both “highbrow” &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; “lowbrow” culture? Hanna Shin and Nara Youn from Hongik University in Seoul recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Faca0000303&quot;&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; this question in a paper in &lt;em&gt;Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39517&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural omnivorousness is a relatively new phenomenon. Until the first half of the 20th century, participation in highbrow or lowbrow culture was clearly associated with social and economic status. Opera, symphony orchestra, and painting exhibitions are places traditionally included in highbrow culture. Street performances and graffiti are considered to be products of lowbrow culture. The former are usually credited with greater intellectual sophistication and artistic values, while the latter are often considered to be more authentic and of higher intrinsic motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shin and Youn wondered whether personality factors such as narcissism, self-esteem, and feelings of authenticity could explain how likely someone is to be a cultural omnivore. To find out, they conducted two studies. In the first, they tested 178 undergraduate students, asking them to complete the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and a measure of self-esteem, as well as a scale that measured their distinction-seeking drive: that is, the desire to stand out. Participants were also asked to indicate their intentions to participate in highbrow and lowbrow cultural activities (e.g. “visiting art galleries” and “going to pop concerts”, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants who scored high in narcissism and &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; had low self-esteem tended to be cultural omnivores. These “insecure narcissists” seemed to be driven to consume both high- and lowbrow culture because of their desire to distinguish themselves from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second study, Shin and Youn explored more specific motivations for insecure narcissists’ cultural omnivorousness. The researchers created two biographies of a fictional artist: in the highbrow condition, the biography stated that the artist’s paintings had been displayed in major museums around the world, while in the lowbrow condition it stated the paintings were kept by family and later discovered by a collector. One hundred and forty-four undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions and completed scales of personality. After they had reviewed the applicable biography and viewed two examples of the artist’s paintings, they rated the paintings as highbrow or lowbrow, and indicated how likely they would be to visit or recommend an exhibition of the artist’s work. Finally, they completed scales of status-seeking motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested that insecure narcissists had different reasons for consuming highbrow and lowbrow art. When they believed the paintings were highbrow, their intention to visit or recommend the exhibition seemed to be driven by a desire to consume status-seeking products . But when they believed the paintings were lowbrow, their intention to consume the art was fuelled instead by a desire to signal self-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research adds much to the understanding of the motives for one’s participation in culture, going beyond the narrow focus on economic status. The results suggest at least one psychological mechanism underlying cultural omnivorousness: a combination of narcissism and psychological insecurity, which is related to a drive to signal both status and self-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also leaves many questions to be answered. How valid is the division between highbrow and lowbrow contemporary culture: is the appearance of cultural omnivores not the result of blurring the boundaries between these two types of cultures? Does a laboratory experiment reflect the complexity of motives that push us to participate in culture? Finally, are the examined motives and personality traits the most important? There is certainly still much to be done in this research area, and studies that include more psychological variables and factors could definitely enrich our understanding of this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Faca0000303&quot;&gt;How insecure narcissists become cultural omnivores: Consuming highbrow culture for status seeking and lowbrow culture for integrity signaling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;To picture this farm,
imagine some dark blobs dangling high up in a tree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each blob can reach “about
soccer ball size,” says evolutionary biologist Guillaume Chomicki of Durham
University in England. From this bulbous base, a &lt;em&gt;Squamellaria&lt;/em&gt; plant
eventually sprouts leafy shoots and hangs, slumping sideways or upside down,
from its host tree’s branches. In Fiji, one of the local names for the plant
translates as “testicle of the trees.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some&lt;em&gt;
Squamellaria&lt;/em&gt; species grow in clusters and teem with fiercely protective
ants. As a young seedling blob plumps up, jelly bean–shaped bubbles form
inside, reachable only through ant-sized doorways. As soon as a young plant
cracks open its first door to daylight, “ant workers start to enter and
defecate inside the seedling to fertilize it,” Chomicki says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that ants tend these plants as farmers gave Chomicki one of those surprise-left-turn moments in science. In a string of papers published since 2016, he and colleagues share evidence for the idea that the &lt;em&gt;Philidris nagasau&lt;/em&gt; ants may be the first known animals other than humans to farm plants. (The other known insect farmers cultivate fungi.) Chomicki’s latest paper, in the Feb. 4 &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, reports that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/5/2535.short&quot;&gt;ants planting seeds of their blobby crop make trade-offs&lt;/a&gt;, going for full sun and maximizing the rewarding, sweet flowers rather than planting in the shade, where plants would have higher nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Until
Chomicki’s work, biologists accepted only three groups of fungus-farming
insects as achieving the essentials of full agriculture and so rivaling human
efforts. Select types of beetles, termites and ants each tamed different fungi,
tending their much-needed food crop from sowing to harvest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans
didn’t farm any food before roughly 12,000 years ago as far as we know. Insects
started much earlier. Even leaf-cutter ants, relative newcomers to farming,
have been growing their specialized crops for about 15 million years. &lt;/p&gt;

Chomicki&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Chomicki&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To
compare agriculture in insects and humans, entomologists, archaeologists and
other specialists have held three gatherings in the last six years searching
for principles and perhaps some practical advice. (A press fellowship from the
Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research paid for me to
attend the 2019 symposium in Klosterneuburg, Austria.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fungus farms of leaf-cutter &lt;em&gt;Atta&lt;/em&gt; ants and their close relatives invite comparisons with human farms. Both kinds of farmers do things that look unsustainable, such as growing single crops at a vast scale and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/farmer-ants-have-bacterial-farmhands&quot;&gt;applying pesticides&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the ants have managed to persist for millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biologists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/old-macdonald-was-ant&quot;&gt;have long mused&lt;/a&gt; about whether we humans can make our farms more robust by imitating the practices of ants and other small farmers. That question sounds especially pertinent when human agriculture is heading for big challenges, such as predicted population growth and climate change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How to learn from ancient farmers isn’t an easy question though. Evolution hones by competition, not design, so there are some goofy tactics out there among the insect marvels. Now is a great era for such discussions, because researchers are paying more attention to smaller, odder insect farms. Scientists have barely begun to explore the ways beetles grow fungi, or the quirks of the ants that grow their own plants.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Farmers vs. not-quites&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just what counts as true
farming makes a fine starter for impassioned conversations among scientists.
(Perhaps the fungi are farming the ants, one longtime expert argues.) In this
article, true agriculturists are defined as those who habitually plant a crop,
tend it, harvest it and depend on its success. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plenty
of other creatures — social amoebas, a marsh snail, a damselfish, for instance —
have evolved ways to encourage food to appear where and when they want it.
Impressive as those feats are, plenty of scientists don’t consider those
lifestyles full-on agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ambrosia beetles&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087145&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0425_sm_ants_inline7_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087145&quot;&gt;Ambrosia beetles dig tunnels into trees for their fungus farms. The fungi take in nutrients from the tree, and become beetle chow. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087145&quot;&gt;J. Hulcr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several thousand species of the group called ambrosia beetles make up the biggest of the three insect groups that humans deign to call true farmers. Florida’s avocado growers have become urgently interested in the invading redbay ambrosia beetle (&lt;em&gt;Xyleborus glabratus&lt;/em&gt;) because it raises a fungus that can &lt;a href=&quot;http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/trees/beetles/redbay_ambrosia_beetle.htm#:~:text=Buss%2C%20University%20of%20Florida.,their%20symbiotic%20fungi%2C%20Raffaelea%20lauricola.&quot;&gt;destroy the innards of avocado trees&lt;/a&gt;. Fungus farming has evolved independently at least 11 times among these beetles, says forest entomologist Jiri Hulcr of the University of Florida in Gainesville. A few ambrosia species tunneling into trees bring along a fungus that can digest wood’s tougher molecules. Most ambrosia fungal farms, though, are just scavenging nutrients in the dying tree. Still, the fungus gets nutrients, then the beetles eat the fungus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A similar outsourcing of digestion feeds a second group of true farmers, around 330 species of termites in the subfamily Macrotermitinae. The termites collect bits and scraps of dead plant material and feed it to a fungus coddled in cozy caves dug out by the termites. Then the tiny farmers feast on the fungus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Euwallacea beetles in a tunnel&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087146&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0425_sm_ants_inline8_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087146&quot;&gt;Within a tunnel, &lt;em&gt;Euwallacea&lt;/em&gt; beetles raise daughters that mate with their lone, blind brother (light brown), then set off to create more tunnel farms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087146&quot;&gt;J. Hulcr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The showiest of these termites are the African &lt;em&gt;Macrotermes&lt;/em&gt;, which are master builders as well as farmers. Above ground they create mounds of hard, red-orange mud several meters high and as jagged as the Alps. The mini-­mountains are porous, able to channel airflow and manage temperatures for the fungus caves within. The farm feeds the offspring of a king and outsize queen, which, in one species, is reported to produce some 20,000 eggs a day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Atta girls&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/105/14/5287.long&quot;&gt;most famous big-scale insect farmers&lt;/a&gt; invented their own Kansas. Fungus-farming ants started out modestly in agriculture as long as 60 million years ago. But around 15 million years ago, the &lt;em&gt;Atta&lt;/em&gt; leaf-cutter ants and some close relatives went big. Today, each nest grows a single genetic strain of fungus at an industrial scale. A farm is a vast monoculture, a one-crop wonder like some corporate expanse of wheat rippling to the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One
&lt;em&gt;Atta&lt;/em&gt; nest can grow big enough to feed 7 million residents. Imagine
Chicago with more than twice as many people, all growing their food inside city
limits — and the ant city still would have more residents and more food. Of
course every citizen of this double-Chicago spends a lifetime dining on mostly
one food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atta&lt;/em&gt;
leaf cutters are the ants that trek through so many nature documentaries.
Nothing says tropical forest like a few seconds of a tiny &lt;em&gt;Atta&lt;/em&gt; forager
dwarfed under her huge leaf shard. Those leaf haulers even got a close-up in
the 1994 animated&lt;em&gt; Lion King&lt;/em&gt; movie, never mind that no real-life leaf
cutters live in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some
&lt;em&gt;Atta&lt;/em&gt; ants live in the southern United States, however. So when I took a
trip to Austin in January, Ulrich Mueller, a researcher who has spent decades
studying fungus farmers at the University of Texas, offered to lead a
mini-expedition to search for local leaf cutters. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I
get my first glimpse of &lt;em&gt;Atta texana&lt;/em&gt; about 10 steps into the main
research building of the Brackenridge Field Laboratory. On a wall hangs a
see-through teaching aid that resembles a two-story hamster palace with a tiny
moving ant here and there. In one of the clear plastic boxes connected by
walkway tubes lies what looks like an old gray bath sponge that really ought to
be thrown out. Up close it seems more alien: irregular, micro-pocked, with
zones of swampy dark brown fading to something close to pale flesh. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This
fungal heap is why all those leaf haulers truck their green snippets in long
lines on ant highways. The ants don’t eat the greenery. They poop on it, a
pretreatment that encourages the fungal digestive enzymes. Then the ants
deposit their little leaf confetti on the fungus heap to wait for lunch to
grow. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This
is their stomach,” Mueller says. The fungal heap digests the greenery that the
ants’ guts can’t. Feeding an ant nest full of fungus takes so much greenery
that one nest of a South American&lt;em&gt; Atta &lt;/em&gt;ant can become one of the
neighborhood’s major plant eaters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Leaf-cutter ants&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087143&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0425_sm_ants_inline5_1030.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087143&quot;&gt;Leaf-cutter ants may be the most famous insect farmers. &lt;em&gt;Atta texana&lt;/em&gt; ants (shown on their fungus) can provide most of the food for a colony with millions of ants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087143&quot;&gt;Alex Wild/Univ. of Texas at Austin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Protecting the crop&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To a human, this great
grazing fungal stomach appears too uniform for the ants’ own good. Each nest
grows just one fungus clone, says Mueller, who has dug up bits, sampled,
compared and resampled over the course of years. A human farm that grows only
one or even two crop varieties invites disaster. If a pest or disease can crack
the defenses of those few varieties, the whole crop is gone. Think Irish potato
famine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These
ant species, however, have cultivated monocultures for millions of years. Some
even use pesticides to fight a pest, swiping an invading fungus with a toxin
secreted by &lt;em&gt;Pseudonocardia&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, which thrive in an ant’s
specialized pocket or body crease. Humans struggle with pests evolving
resistance. For example, some Colorado potato beetles have evolved some
resistance to 56 pest-killer ingredients. So how do ants keep their crops
going?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For
one thing, ants keep a close eye on their crops, catching and treating problems
early. Mueller estimates that a farmer ant passes each bit of fungus in a
garden multiple times a day. Humans call this micro-monitoring of crops
“precision agriculture” and see its value for human farms too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also,
ants may be ahead of humans in fostering beneficial microbiomes. The way ants
transplant bits of garden to start a new patch could be one of the big
differences between ant and human agriculture, Mueller says. Humans plant just
the seed or the cutting. But when ants need to get some fungus going in a new
spot, they nip out a chunk of the whole garden and move it — fungus plus
whatever bazillion microbes are entangled. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
ants are replicating an entire microbial community, Mueller says. The ant
farmers don’t need to know microbiology or anything except that a tuft of
fungus tastes healthy. That way a microbial ensemble gets passed along that’s
compatible with the crop and is a good mix against current menaces. “The ants
figured out 60 million years ago … how important these interstitial microbes
are,” Mueller says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Questionable practices&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While&lt;em&gt; Atta&lt;/em&gt; ants may
manage their external gut’s microbiome admirably, some other ant farming
practices look wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
fungus that&lt;em&gt; Atta&lt;/em&gt; and some close relatives grow as their only crop is not
super-efficient at breaking down compounds in the leaves. “It just takes the
easy-to-digest stuff,” Mueller says. In turn, when the ants eat this fungus,
they treat it more like an apple tree than like a window box of salad greens.
Ants nip off the plump, pickable tidbits called gongylidia that fatten at the
ends of strands of this particular fungus. Plenty of the rest of the fungus is
wasted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There
are seemingly more efficient options. One ant species found at the Brackenridge
Field Lab, in the &lt;em&gt;Cyphomyrmex&lt;/em&gt; genus, tends pale yellow to amber chunks
of yeast that the ants eat like grapes, without even seeds to spit into the
trash. Plus these farmers don’t have to cut fresh leaves to feed the farm.
Instead, the ants fertilize by bringing in an available waste product: caterpillar
droppings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;em&gt;
Atta&lt;/em&gt; ants’ efforts to collect so much greenery look inefficient by
comparison. To explain the process up close, Mueller and grad student Tristan
Kubik lead me out of the lab into the Brackenridge woods. This balmy, blue-sky
January afternoon ought to be perfect for ants hauling leaves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To
find some foragers, Kubik, a third-generation insect enthusiast, stalks with
the intensity of a cat. It takes me a minute to realize what he’s pointing at:
little shreds of green that give the smallest irregular twitches. It’s like
looking down at a few cupcake sprinkles on the floor, each giving just the
tiniest jiggle per ant step, and all barely out of sync. These are leaf cutters
carrying home their greenery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
bitty jiggles are micro-steps, and the home nest is not even within human sight
yet. Just one foraging trip that’s a middling distance from the nest, say 75
meters, could take about two hours round trip on smooth ground. These &lt;em&gt;A.
texana&lt;/em&gt; ants, however, venture twice as far. All that for just one
sliver, maybe the size of a fingernail paring, of some leaf. The word that pops
to mind is “ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ants carrying leaf snippets&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087144&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0425_sm_ants_inline6_1030.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087144&quot;&gt;A lot of leaf snippets need to be cut off greenery and hauled home and then snipped some more to feed a giant fungal garden. &lt;em&gt;Atta cephalotes&lt;/em&gt; ants will often clear a path to bring supplies to the nest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087144&quot;&gt;Alex Wild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In
human steps, the nest is just a several minutes’ stroll away. Nests look
strangely undramatic viewed from above. The biggest one we see that afternoon
lies on a gentle bank with a minor reddish splotch or two of soil erosion among
gnarled winter trees. With coaching, I see several modest finger-poke–sized
holes in the ground. I wonder how many thousands of ants might be toiling
beneath our boots. Mueller debates with himself: “three million … maybe five?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cutting leaves into bits is a lot of work. To make tiny confetti out of one square meter of leaf surface means &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.150111&quot;&gt;cutting back and forth and around a distance of 2.9 kilometers&lt;/a&gt;, researchers estimated in 2016 in &lt;em&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/em&gt;, after observing a lab colony of &lt;em&gt;A. cephalotes&lt;/em&gt;. The energy that goes into feeding the farm sounds all too familiar. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fungi
as a crop don’t photosynthesize as plants do and so can’t make lunch out of
sunlight. It might be more fair to compare a fungus farm not to a wheat field,
but to cattle or pigs in human-run feedlots. Each calorie of food, be it
slivers of leaf clippings or railroad cars of soy beans, needs to be grown or
collected and then hauled in by farmers. Giant feedlots run by ants have the
same relentless supply challenges that human ones do. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Look natural&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t surprise Ford Denison that some people see drawbacks in viewing ant farms as agricultural role models. Denison is author of the 2012 book &lt;em&gt;Darwinian Agriculture&lt;/em&gt;, and he participated in the 2019 Konrad Lorenz symposium. At the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, Denison studies agricultural sustainability and thinks about how to strategically copy from nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just
because we see a farmlike marvel of an ant nest or a sustainable mixed-species
forest doesn’t mean mimicking its full form would be a great idea. The thing to
do, he says, is to look for the details that evolution has tested for millions
of years against other options. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evolution
certainly did not test the monoculture form of ant nests through competition.
The ants can’t grow their fungus any other way. If there’s more than one strain
of fungus in a farm, “there’s chemical warfare,” he says. One strain typically
kills its rival, even if they’re growing in separate chambers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Their
long-term use of monoculture may be evidence that monoculture can be
sustainable,” Denison says. Humans looking for natural models, however, should
probably aim for a higher bar. Monoculture farming among these ants “certainly
doesn’t mean that it’s better than polyculture,” he says. Cultivating more
diverse farms might have eased pest problems. But who knows? Ants with one crop
never competed against ants with more than one. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ants plant seeds on Squamellaria&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087137&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0425_sm_ants_feat1-800x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087137&quot;&gt;Small ants plant seeds and cultivate the flowery &lt;em&gt;Squamellaria&lt;/em&gt; species for shelter plus sweet floral feasts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087137&quot;&gt;G. Chomicki&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Back to the trees&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other insect farms
certainly have quirks that look as if they evolved under intense competition.
Consider the treetop &lt;em&gt;Squamellaria &lt;/em&gt;blobs, which face challenges in
recycling nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen
is often a precious commodity for plants like &lt;em&gt;Squamellaria&lt;/em&gt; that don’t
live in soil. For these plants, which have forged a space station lifestyle
clinging to tree branches high above the ground, the &lt;em&gt;P. nagasau&lt;/em&gt; ants may
be cherished deliverers of nitrogen or other nutrients. The ants also offer
vital defense, rushing to attack intruders that try to nibble a seed or a leaf
from their bulbous farms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As
payback, the plant offers absolutely necessary shelter for the ants and food
that’s convenient but replaceable in a pinch. The flowers of &lt;em&gt;Squamellaria &lt;/em&gt;plants
hold a sweet appeal for ants. When the petals fall off, the flower pauses in
development for days, and ants visit to feed on a sugary rim with a shot of
amino acids at the flower base. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In
six &lt;em&gt;Squamellaria&lt;/em&gt; species, as the plants grow and open more entrances to
their inner cavities, the ants move in through tiny doorways and raise young. A
large plant can host around 10,000 ants, and a whole ant colony can expand its
boundaries to embrace multiple plants, even a mix of lumpy species. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In
the plants’ bases, some chambers form smooth inner walls while other cavities
sprout widely spaced little knobs. Ants tend eggs and larvae in the
smooth-sided chambers. The knobby-walled cavities, Chomicki thinks, serve as
ant latrines and garbage dumps. From the plant point of view, these chambers
serve as donation centers for nitrogen-rich ant excretions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
knobby walls’ uptake of nitrogen is “very, very efficient,” Chomicki says. He
has injected different concentrations and tracked plants keeping up with
massive influxes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ants
check all the boxes for truly farming in the six species, Chomicki argues. He
has videotaped ants planting &lt;em&gt;Squamellaria&lt;/em&gt; seeds by tucking them under
tree bark. Ants then defend the seeds from leaf beetles and other predators,
even attacking inquisitive scientists. This vigorous defense in the treetop
world could count as yet another chore in tending the farm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “The ants are directly consuming food they
fertilize with their feces,” says one of Chomicki’s coauthors, ecologist Toby
Kiers of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Fertilizer pollution is a hot topic in
the Netherlands. In Kiers’ vision of a more sustainable future, field crops get
their fertilizer from the manure in neighboring pastures, so a former waste
product circles back into something useful. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take inspiration from the ants, she urges. A blob farm is “like the ultimate circular economy.” &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/Syrian-Doctor-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Syrian war refugees are currently being trapped between Turkey and Greece or interned in deplorable and dramatic conditions on Greek islands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/world/europe/greece-lesbos-moria-refugees.html&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. This drama painfully reminds us that the conflict in Syria continues to be the biggest driver of migration. Since 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian migrants have crossed into Europe. Syrians are now the third-largest group of people with a foreign nationality in Germany, and among Syrian immigrants, there are comparatively many well-educated and trained health care professionals, e.g. some 3,000-4,000 medical doctors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/ueber-uns/aerztestatistik/aerztestatistik-2018&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Not all of them have fled their country as refugees; many have been granted visas, as Germany is principally welcoming Syrian doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11845&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wire fence &quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11845&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/Fence-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Tens of thousands of Syrian war refugees are currently being trapped between Turkey and Greece.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Germany needs Syrian doctors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is simple: In Germany, a relative shortage of physicians has developed over the recent years. A change in working time regulations and a growing demand for part-time jobs, has increased the need for additional doctors. Like many other developed countries, Germany relies on international medical graduates or doctors to supplement its locally trained staff so as to maintain their health care system. Further, as the number of Syrian migrants increases, so does the number of Syrian patients being treated in hospitals and doctors’ offices, resulting in a novel need for Arabic-speaking medical staff. Therefore, Syrian doctors are able to fulfill a double function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this background, it may seem paramount to make the licensure process for Syrian immigrant doctors as straightforward and as swift as possible, actively supporting and advising applicants through the relevant processes. But in fact, the act of obtaining a permanent license to be allowed to practice medicine in Germany is onerous, lengthy, and can bring about many negative experiences. These can include feelings of humiliation, lack of transparency, arbitrariness, and helplessness. This is what many of the 20 Syrian doctors told us in an interview study we performed from 2016-2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syrian doctors in Germany and their stories: the basis of our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05209-2&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; arose when a recently immigrated Syrian dentist, began working with us while waiting for his German dental license to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told our team about his experiences with a “bureaucratic”, slow and confusing application procedure to secure his license. We were intrigued by his experiences and wanted to seek out other Syrian health care professionals’ experiences of the system. A qualitative study was designed and we received an overwhelming response to our call for interviewees on a Facebook page for Syrian Doctors in Germany. Within a few days, twenty Syrian health professionals were prepared to share their stories through face-to-face interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being lost in an opaque and arbitrary bureaucratic process: that’s what it feels like being a Syrian doctor applying for a medical license in Germany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that upon arrival in Germany, Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One physician explained: “&lt;em&gt;When I started applying for the temporary license … some rules changed and the authorities were now requiring a C1 course in medical German to obtain the temporary license! After I started the C1 language course, they required the exam for medical terms. When we completed one step, they asked for another step…nothing is stable here.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewees describe a Kafkaesque system where they feel at the mercy of Government employees and reviewers who ask for absurd and impossible accomplishments, refuse to give information and act at random. This is shown in the quote of another interview partner: “&lt;em&gt;There are no clear steps. You can have two [Syrian] doctors who studied at the same university, finished their studies in the same year, – and then one of them can obtain the approbation without any exam, and the other one will need to take another exam. At the end of the day, only one person makes the decision about you. …And of course, we cannot meet this person or talk with them. We don’t even know their name.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11846&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Admin work&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11846&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/pexels-photo-52608-300x201.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair with the medical license application process.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair. As informational and practical support from official institutions was scarce, the Syrian doctors relied on personal networks and peers to understand the requirements and find a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain a balanced view of the licensure process and the interactions involved, future research should explore the perspective of the administrative staff in the German Chamber of Physicians or job centers as well. Naturally, these regulative bodies were not prepared for the large number of migrant doctors applying for a license and were surprised by the abrupt rise in the number of licensure procedures. Journalists have reported that ratifying Syrian diplomas may be difficult because in some cases, fraudulent documents have been provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/innenministerium-warnt-falsche-zeugnisse-und-diplome-fluechtlinge-koennen-im-libanon-antragspakete-kaufen_id_5066196.html&quot;&gt;[3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/europe/germany-refugees-doctors.html&quot;&gt;4]&lt;/a&gt;. For the medical profession, in particular, credentials and certificates should be checked thoroughly and carefully. Nevertheless, Germany may learn from other countries such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, which have harmonized and simplified assessment procedures for overseas-trained doctors, and implemented specific resources guiding and supporting foreign health professionals in different stages of their application process &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2008/188/8/nationally-consistent-assessment-international-medical-graduates&quot;&gt;[5&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-016-0135-6&quot;&gt;6]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming Syrian doctors in Germany is more important than ever – especially as the current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dire need for skilled medical staff in hospitals. While German authorities claim to be making an effort to find as many helping hands as possible to cope with the impending shortage of health care professionals, there are no signs that the accreditation process of foreign doctors – Syrian doctors among them – may be accelerated, or handled in a more pragmatic way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/despite-coronavirus-foreign-doctors-struggle-to-get-degrees-recognized-in-germany/a-52966674&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3087256</id>
		<updated>2020-04-22T20:40:42+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Satellite data show that
more than twice as much methane is leaking from a vast U.S. oil- and natural
gas-producing region than previously estimated. From May 2018 to March 2019, a
European Space Agency satellite measured an average of 2.7 teragrams of methane
emitted each year from the Permian Basin, which spans more than 160,000 square
kilometers in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Previously, ground-based
estimates of the methane leaked from the region’s oil and gas activities were
about 1.2 teragrams per year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new estimate represents
3.7 percent of the total volume of natural gas being extracted from the Permian
Basin, say Yuzhong Zhang, an atmospheric scientist at Harvard University, and
colleagues. Such a leakage rate is &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/17/eaaz5120&quot;&gt;60 percent higher&lt;/a&gt; than the national average, and is also the highest rate ever measured
from a U.S. oil- and gas-producing region, the team reports April 22 in &lt;em&gt;Science
Advances&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Production in the Permian
Basin has skyrocketed in the last decade; the region now accounts for about 30
percent of U.S. oil production, and about 10 percent of its natural gas. This
growth may be exceeding the ability of the existing infrastructure in the
region to contain and transport the gas, leading to extensive venting and
flaring. That could be to blame for the high leakage rate, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gas leak&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Methane measurements over the United States, taken by the European Space Agency’s Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, showed high amounts of the greenhouse gas emitted from the Permian Basin (outlined by purple box), a vast oil- and gas-producing region that spans parts of Texas and New Mexico. Red dots represent relatively high values of methane, averaged from May 2018 to March 2019, while blue are relatively low. The team measured 2.7 teragrams of leaked methane per year, which represents 3.7 percent of the volume of total natural gas extracted from the region. That’s the highest methane leak rate ever measured in the United States, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Methane is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-fuel-use-may-emit-more-methane-than-thought&quot;&gt;a powerful greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;although it
lingers in the atmosphere only for a decade or two (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/19/20&lt;/em&gt;). During that time period, it has about 80
times the atmosphere-warming potential of longer-lived carbon dioxide.
Identifying and accurately quantifying very large methane emissions from human
activities, such as the fossil fuel industry and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-landfills-are-belching-high-levels-climate-warming-methane&quot;&gt;landfills&lt;/a&gt;, is
crucial to curbing climate change (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/14/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the ability of a new satellite sensor, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, or TROPOMI, to map atmospheric methane emissions from a region; in the future, satellites could help quantify methane leaked from many source regions around the globe, the researchers say. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-may-have-started-earlier-than-we-thought"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3087240</id>
		<updated>2020-04-22T18:39:25+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Modern plate tectonics may
have gotten under way as early as 3.2 billion years ago, about 400 million
years earlier than scientists thought. That, in turn, suggests that the
movement of large pieces of Earth’s crust could have played a role in making the
planet more hospitable to life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geologist Alec Brenner of
Harvard University and his colleagues measured the magnetic orientations of
iron-bearing minerals in the Honeyeater Basalt, a layer of rock that formed
between 3.19 billion and 3.18 billion years ago. The basalt is part of the East
Pilbara Craton, an ancient bit of continent in Western Australia that includes
rocks as old as 3.5 billion years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This craton, the researchers
found, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/17/eaaz8670&quot;&gt;was on the move&lt;/a&gt;
between 3.35 billion and 3.18 billion years ago, drifting around the planet at
a rate of at least 2.5 centimeters per year. That’s a speed comparable to
modern plate motions, the team reports April 22 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The basalt layer, which
burbled up as lava and hardened during the journey, contains iron-bearing
minerals that can act as tiny signposts pointing the way toward Earth’s
magnetic poles. While the lava was still molten, the minerals rotated,
orienting themselves to align with either the north or south magnetic pole. By
tracking the changes in orientation within the lava as more basalt formed
during the journey, the researchers were able to determine how quickly the
craton was moving.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long used
such preserved magnetic signposts to reconstruct plate motions, retracing the
steps of drifting bits of continent. But the constant grinding and shifting of
Earth’s tectonic plates over the last few billion years have reworked Earth’s
surface many times over, leaving few outcrops that are older than 3 billion
years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Honeyeater Basalt,
however, is a rare site, both ancient and relatively unworked by metamorphism, the
heat and pressure from which could have altered the minerals and reset their magnetic
orientation. The team examined 235 samples of the basalt using an instrument
called a quantum diamond microscope that can detect traces of magnetism at the
micrometer scale. From these analyses, the researchers created a
high-resolution map of magnetic orientations within the rock. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the map, the team
estimates that about 3.2 billion years ago, the East Pilbara Craton was at a
latitude of about 45°,
but whether north or south isn’t certain, Brenner said April 21 in a video news
conference. That’s because researchers aren’t sure whether Earth’s magnetic poles
at the time were in their current orientation or reversed. Either way, this bit
of ancient crust moved in a gradual, steady motion — a hallmark of modern plate
tectonics, the researchers say. Today, the craton is located at about 21° S, just north of the Tropic of Capricorn.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plate tectonics is generally
thought to have become a well-established global process on Earth no earlier
than around 2.8 billion years ago. Before that, Earth’s interior was considered
to be too hot for cold, rigid plates to form at the surface, or for deep
subduction to occur, in which one crustal plate dives beneath another. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An earlier start to plate
tectonics would have implications for the evolution of life on Earth, Brenner
told reporters. Whether the process was in operation when the first
single-celled organisms emerged, currently thought to be at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-life-ancient-fossils-stromatolites-microbes-debate&quot;&gt;3.45 billion years ago&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t clear, he said (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/17/18&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it is clear that plate
tectonics is currently closely tied to the biosphere, he added. It promotes
chemical reactions between once-buried rocks and the atmosphere that can
modulate the planet’s climate over millions to billions of years. “So if [plate
tectonics] happened on the early Earth, these processes were likely playing a
part in the evolution of life,” Brenner said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Active, modern-style plate
tectonics is the most likely explanation for the data, the researchers say. But
they acknowledge other possible explanations can’t yet be ruled out, including
an early, episodic, fit-and-start style of plate tectonics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have
proposed that, during the Archean Eon that lasted from about 4 billion to about
2.5 billion years ago, there was a proto-plate tectonics process in which bits
of crust &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stop-and-go-plate-tectonics&quot;&gt;moved in fits and starts&lt;/a&gt; as the planet began to cool after its formation (&lt;em&gt;SN:
4/9/12&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-eroded-glaciers-may-have-kick-started-plate-tectonics&quot;&gt;Sediment eroded from Earth’s earliest continents&lt;/a&gt; may also have helped grease the wheels, setting the
stage for modern plate tectonics (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/5/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ data could
support episodic rather than gradual plate motion, perhaps as a precursor to
modern plate tectonics, says Michael Brown,
a geologist at the University of Maryland in College Park. Those data suggest
that after its initial burst of speed, the Honeyeater Basalt’s progress slowed
considerably, from 2.5 centimeters per year to 0.37 centimeters per year, he
says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s still unclear how
similar proto-plate tectonics may have been to the modern process. “We know too
little to answer this question with confidence,” says geophysicist Stephan
Sobolev of the University of Potsdam in Germany.
Sobolev has suggested previously that, for about a billion years during the
Archean, plate tectonics occurred regionally: Plates could have been broken
apart by large meteorite impacts or powerful plumes rising from the mantle,
generating regional cells in which ancient continents formed and small blocks
of crust subducted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a regional cell may
have formed the East Pilbara Craton in Australia, Sobolev suggests. But for that
bit of ancient continent to have traveled so far so quickly, he says, “large-scale
subduction must have been involved” — a surprising possibility for early
Earth’s history.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As part of the
COVID-19 response team at O’Connor Hospital in San Jose, Calif., Nivedita
Lakhera wasn’t prepared to see her intensive care unit filled with so many
young patients. Many of those patients had no medical condition other than
obesity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They are young
and coming to the ER and just dropping dead,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Age,
particularly those over 65, as well as having a compromised immune system are still
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm&quot;&gt;major risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for being hospitalized with, and dying
from, COVID-19. But some doctors say that some of their sickest patients are
those under 60 who are obese. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of high-risk individuals includes the
severely obese, defined as people with a body mass index, or BMI, over 40. While
studies on coronavirus often focus on demographic breakdowns such as age, sex
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race&quot;&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/10/20&lt;/em&gt;), some
now are starting to track COVID-19 patient BMIs.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For instance,
of 180 patients hospitalized from March 1 to March 30, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm&quot;&gt;most prevalent underlying condition&lt;/a&gt; for adults ages 18 to 49 was obesity.
Of 39 patients in that age range, 23, or 59 percent, were obese, researchers
report in the April 17 &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“BMI is the
Achilles’ heel for American patients,” says Jennifer Lighter, an epidemiologist
at New York University’s Langone School of Medicine. That could be a crucial
factor in the death toll, particularly for those under 60, she says. “In China
it was smoking and pollution, and Italy had a larger older population, and many
grandparents lived with extended families. Here, it’s BMI that’s the
issue.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the United
States, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm?deliveryName=USCDC_171-DM21134&quot;&gt;42 percent of adults &lt;/a&gt;have a BMI over 30, the threshold for
obesity, and more than 9 percent are classified as severely obese with a BMI
over 40, according to the CDC. People with obesity can have other high-risk health
conditions, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable&quot;&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt; or diabetes (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/20/20&lt;/em&gt;). But some doctors suggest a high BMI should be a risk
factor in itself. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lighter and her
colleagues found that patients under 60 with a BMI over 35 were at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa415/5818333&quot;&gt;twice as likely to be admitted to the ICU&lt;/a&gt; for coronavirus than patients with healthy
BMIs, the researchers report April 9 in &lt;em&gt;Clinical
Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;. Those same patients were three times more likely to
die from the infection than those with a lower BMI, she says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team tracked 3,615 people who tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at a New York City
hospital from March 4 to April 4. Of those, 1,370, or 38 percent, were obese. In
patients over 60, weight did not appear to be a factor in hospital admission or
the need for intensive care, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A hospital in Lille, France, also found that the higher the BMI, the more likely a patient needed to be ventilated. Of 124 patients admitted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/oby.22831&quot;&gt;intensive care for COVID-19, almost half were obese&lt;/a&gt; or severely obese, researchers report April 9 in &lt;em&gt;Obesity&lt;/em&gt;. Of the 85 patients who were intubated, nearly 90 percent had a BMI over 35, the data show.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The need for invasive mechanical ventilation was associated with
severe obesity and [was] independent of age, sex, diabetes and hypertension,”
the study says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanjum
Sethi, a cardiologist at Columbia University Medical Center, says his hospital is
seeing a surprising number of younger patients with obesity, but no other
conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. On April 12, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sanjum/status/1249374582110408712&quot;&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that, for obese patients, “the
prognosis is extremely grim. They are NOT dying from comorbidities. They are
dying from COVID-19.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with
a high BMI already tend to have problems breathing; they carry more weight on
their chest, which compresses the lungs. Because COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory
disease, that may put heavier patients at a disadvantage, doctors say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obese
people “already have lower oxygen levels, they are predisposed to pulmonary
dysfunction, and they have decreased chest function because of the weight on
their chest. And many have sleep apnea. So they’re at pulmonary risk
already,” says Samuel
Klein, a gastroenterologist and
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials say
people with obesity shouldn’t feel stigmatized or avoid seeking medical care;
it’s important to be aware of threat COVID-19 poses. People with high BMIs might want to practice extra caution,
wear a mask outside and have groceries delivered instead of going out into
public, Sethi says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I worry this
is going to have even more impact where obesity is more endemic, like in the
South,” he says.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data should
be a wake-up call for people with obesity, agrees Donna Ryan, president of the London-based
World Obesity Federation. “If they do develop fever or shortness of breath,
they should not hesitate, call their doctor and get tested.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors might take specific measures when treating obese patients for COVID-19, says Rekha Kumar, an obesity specialist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. That might include giving them oxygen early or keeping them in the hospital longer. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, running a marathon is seen as the ultimate amateur athletic achievement; for others, it’s just the start. Ultramarathon runners often take on courses of incredibly impressive length, running 50 or 100 kilometres at one time or over several days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this is physically demanding, and only those in seriously good shape will be able to take on such challenges — ultramarathon running involves stress on muscles and bones, blisters, dehydration, sleep deprivation and mental and physical fatigue, so it’s really not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the psychological traits that make someone suitable for long-distance running? What kind of person can withstand this kind of physical stress, and how? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://aps.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajpy.12287?af=R&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Australian Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt; takes a look.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39510&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory Roebuck from Monash University and colleagues recruited 20 ultrarunners and 20 control participants aged between 18 and 70; runners were matched with non-runners by gender and age. Participants were asked about their exercise behaviours and running experiences before completing a number of questionnaires. These included a 25-item scale designed to measure resilience (with participants rating how much they agreed with statements such as “I am able to adapt when changes occur”), and two questionnaires that looked at emotion regulation — the ways a person moderates or expresses their emotion. Finally, a 155-item questionnaire looked at a range of personality traits across domains like well-being, achievement, stress reaction, and, aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, participants took part in an emotion regulation task, viewing 36 neutral images (e.g. a sofa or chair) and 36 negative images (e.g. a bloody medical scene). Before viewing each image, participants were asked to either respond naturally to it (a “look” trial) or attempt to not have a negative reaction to it (a “decrease” trial), before rating the strength of their emotional response. Heart rate and skin conductance were measured during this section of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrarunners scored significantly higher on the resilience questionnaire than non-runners, and were more likely to indicate they used positive reappraisal when regulating their emotions — in other words, they were better able to reframe a situation with a positive angle. This may be down to the need to maintain high levels of motivation during races, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/29/a-mental-technique-calledcognitive-reappraisal-makes-long-distance-running-feel-easier&quot;&gt;attaching positive meaning to negative events in order to keep running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a physiological difference between ultrarunners and non-runners in the emotion regulation task, with ultrarunners showing reduced skin conductance and heart rate even when viewing unpleasant images. However, they didn’t show any differences in their ability to decrease their response to negative images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one measure on which ultrarunners scored lower, however — affiliative extraversion, which measures how socially warm people are, which the team puts down to the high levels of solitude involved in long-distance running.  There was no significant difference in any of the other measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results suggest that ultrarunners are pretty similar to the rest of us — with some important differences. While it’s clear that ultrarunners are indeed more resilient than non-runners, and use different emotion regulation strategies, the direction of those relationships is not yet clear. It could be that training for ultramarathons makes people more resilient, or, on the other hand, it could be that people with higher levels of resilience are more likely to be attracted to the pastime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It would be interesting to further explore how ultrarunners motivate themselves through many hours of pain and effort. Because even though most of us will never run 100 kilometres in one go (and may have no desire to, either), understanding how to tolerate pain, and cope with physical and mental fatigue, is a lesson we all could benefit from.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aps.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajpy.12287?af=R&quot;&gt;Psychological characteristics associated with ultra‐marathon running: An exploratory self‐report and psychophysiological study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-04-22T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;For millions of years, giants
graced the murky depths of China’s Yangtze River. The Chinese Paddlefish (&lt;em&gt;Psephurus gladius&lt;/em&gt;), which could reach 7
meters in length, used its swordlike snout to sense the electrical
perturbations made by smaller prey, snatching them in the dark. But no more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fish was declared extinct in
2019, a victim of overfishing and habitat loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its story is being played out
across the world. From winding rivers to the windswept tundra to the dense
tropical forests of Borneo, nature is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plants and animals are increasingly
threatened by human activities and habitat encroachment. One study estimates a million
species &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/1-million-species-under-threat-humans-speed-extinction&quot;&gt;face
extinction within decades&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/8/19&lt;/em&gt;). That’s 1 million
distinct, idiosyncratic answers to the basic question of how to make a living
on planet Earth, gone. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The scale of this potential loss
has many countries worried. Aside from its inherent value, the natural world
makes the planet livable through processes like cleaning the air, filtering
water, cycling carbon dioxide and pollinating crops. So to stem this biodiversity
loss, governments are now working to draft ambitious plans to set aside more
space for natural habitats. Nature, after all, needs room to flourish. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A global plan under negotiation
envisions designating 30 percent of land and sea as protected by 2030 — and 50
percent by 2050 — in order to revive ecosystems and safeguard the diversity of
species on Earth, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/article/2020-01-10-19-02-38&quot;&gt;draft text of the agreement&lt;/a&gt; under the U.N.
Convention on Biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But is 30 percent, or even 50
percent, enough? And enough for what exactly — to slow extinction rates, or to
protect everything that’s possible to protect, or something else entirely? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One basic goal is to preserve
what’s left. Humans have altered more than three-fourths of Earth’s surface,
and of the 14 terrestrial biomes — such as tropical rainforest, tundra or
desert — eight have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216309939&quot;&gt;less than 10 percent of
undeveloped wilderness remaining&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in a 2016
study in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;. Many
species have already vanished, such as the Chinese Paddlefish and the
brilliantly blue Spix’s Macaw, not seen in Brazil’s forests since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Spix’s Macaw&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087197&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041720_jl_extinction-crisis_inline1_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087197&quot;&gt;Spix’s Macaw, pictured here in a German zoo, is considered extinct in the wild by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The brilliant blue birds once thrived in the forests of northeastern Brazil, but vanished because of habitat loss and poaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087197&quot;&gt;dpa picture alliance/Alamy Stock Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;a href=&quot;https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12247&quot;&gt;for marine ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;, there’s
research to support the 30 percent target as a starting point. There’s less firm evidence for
land. But “the scientific consensus is telling us that we need [even] more
ambitious targets,” says Oscar Venter, a conservation scientist at the
University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George. Targeting 30 percent
of Earth’s terrestrial regions for protection by 2030, he says, is “more a
reflection of what’s politically feasible, rather than what the best science
says.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Eyeing ambitious targets&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An idea like this is not
unprecedented. In 2011, more than 190 countries agreed to 20 conservation goals,
collectively referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/&quot;&gt;Aichi Biodiversity
Targets&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the U.N. Convention on
Biological Diversity. Those targets include efforts such as increasing awareness of
biodiversity and incorporating the traditional knowledge of indigenous groups
into conservation plans. More directly, governments agreed under the convention
to each set aside 17 percent of their land and, for coastal countries, 10
percent of their seas, as protected areas by 2020. (The United States is the
only country that has not ratified the agreement.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Aichi Targets acknowledged two
key reasons for preserving the planet. “We have a responsibility to be stewards
of the planet, because nature is important in and of itself,” says Jane Lubchenco,
a marine ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis and a former
director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “But also
because people benefit directly from healthy, productive and resilient
ecosystems and abundant biodiversity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The targets, while useful in motivating conservation efforts, still
were “not sufficient,” Lubchenco says. Setting targets “often doesn’t translate
into actually achieving those targets,” she says, thanks to uneven coordination
between scientists, government officials and other key actors like farms or the
fishing industry. And while the agreement required that countries publish
action plans, it did not demand reports on actual progress toward achieving the Aichi Targets.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the decade draws to a close, many targets remain unmet. Currently, about 15 percent of land and 7.4 percent of seas are in some way protected, or in line for protection, according to the U.N. Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre. Even so, current extinction rates are estimated to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6187/1246752.abstract&quot;&gt;1,000 times higher than historical levels&lt;/a&gt;. Even common animals, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3-billion-birds-lost-since-1970-north-america&quot;&gt;American sparrows, have seen their numbers drop&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/19/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s led scientists and
governments to conclude that the 2011 targets didn’t go far enough.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Safe spaces&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of April 2020, nearly 15 percent of land (green) and about 7 percent of the seas (blue) were under some level of protection, according to the U.N. Environment Program World Conservation Monitoring Centre and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Areas under some form of protection in 2020&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Areas under some form of protection in 2020&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087203&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041720_jl_extinction-crisis_inline2_680_desktop.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087203&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;www.protectedplanet.net&lt;/a&gt;/UNEP-WCMC, 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Areas under some form of protection in 2020&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087204&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041720_jl_extinction-crisis_inline2_680_mobile.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087204&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;www.protectedplanet.net&lt;/a&gt;/UNEP-WCMC, 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;How much is enough?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deciding how much of nature should
be protected depends on the goal, whether that’s keeping a specific animal from going
extinct, preserving a unique ecosystem or ensuring the future of commercial
fishing stocks. Different goals necessitate different kinds of protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The size of a protected area “is
important, but it’s not the only thing that matters,” says Samantha Murray, an
ocean law and policy expert at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the
University of California, San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When trying to prevent a specific animal from going extinct,
biologists first try to figure out the minimum amount of habitat the species needs to
persist. Wide-ranging species like North American caribou need about 10 percent
of their natural range to be protected. Rarer species in microhabitats like a single
valley or a specific island “typically need much more,” Venter says, “potentially
all the way up to 100” percent of their range. Figuring out those numbers is
tricky, especially for understudied species. Additionally, it can be difficult
to design a protected area that meets the diverse range requirements of all the
species within it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another conservation approach focuses
on protecting the rare slices of land and sea brimming with exceptional numbers
of species. These so-called biodiversity hot spots include Australia’s Great
Barrier Reef, the Amazon River Basin and parts of the U.S. Great Smoky
Mountains. Protecting these areas means protecting many different animals and
plants all at once. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Finally, some conservation
biologists argue for preserving vast tracts of wilderness not yet altered by human
activity. The expansive boreal forests of Canada and Russia don’t harbor as
many species as the Amazon, but they do hold up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6045/988&quot;&gt;a third
of the globe’s terrestrial carbon&lt;/a&gt; and so are a key part of the Earth
process of pulling climate-warming carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
Protecting these areas, along with other large tracts of wild land, are crucial
for solving both the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis, says Eric
Dinerstein, a conservation biologist at RESOLVE, a conservation nonprofit based
in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dinerstein and others argue that the
situation is now so dire that all approaches are needed to save what’s left.
“There are no immutable laws of conservation biology, nothing that says this
paradigm for saving nature is better than that paradigm. We need to do it all.”
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That same urgency is reflected in the
recent flurry proposals and analyses by scientists. Biologist E.O. Wilson says
in his 2016 book &lt;em&gt;Half-Earth&lt;/em&gt; that 80
percent of the planet’s biodiversity can be saved by protecting half of the
planet. Dinerstein and colleagues also laid out a plan in the June 2017 &lt;em&gt;BioScience&lt;/em&gt; for preserving half the
planet &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/6/534/3102935&quot;&gt;in a way that covers a
diversity of ecosystems.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Venter and colleagues estimate targeting
a little less than that — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/839977v1.abstract&quot;&gt;about 44
percent&lt;/a&gt; — can safeguard biodiversity. The team arrived at that number, in
a study posted at bioRxiv.org in November 2019, by tweaking boundaries around
existing protected areas. The result is a global patchwork of protected areas
with enough space for the 28,594 species of mammals, birds, amphibians,
reptiles, dragonflies and crustaceans the researchers had data for, and includes
some of the world’s richest areas of biodiversity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mapping a way forward&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One recent analysis by a team of conservation biologists finds that 44 percent of land must be protected or soundly managed to stem the biodiversity crisis. This map shows existing protected areas (light blue), key biodiversity areas (purple) and wilderness (dark blue), while new conservation priorities identified by the researchers’ analysis are in green. The Venn Diagram shows the degree of overlap between each category.&lt;/p&gt;

Allen et al/bioRxiv.org 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Broad and ambitious goals, like
preserving 30 percent by 2030, are important for galvanizing international
action. “But ambitious targets are only good if countries are strategic in
where they place protected areas,” Venter says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Problems with big targets&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, not all biologists agree that setting such targets is the
best strategy. “A big single number [alone] isn’t going to help, and it misses
what we need to do to protect biodiversity,” says conservation biologist Stuart
Pimm at Duke University. He says it’s more important to focus on the most
threatened biodiversity hot spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of Pimm’s work focuses on
connecting forest fragments with natural corridors, which can functionally increase
an animal’s habitat even when protecting more land area isn’t feasible. Recent
research shows that connecting fragmented habitats can boost biodiversity, for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643828/&quot;&gt; both
animals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/connecting-our-dwindling-natural-habitats-could-help-preserve-plant-diversity&quot;&gt;plants &lt;/a&gt;(&lt;em&gt;SN:
9/26/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biodiversity also is not evenly
distributed around the globe; coral reefs, for example, account for less than 1
percent of the ocean floor, but house more than 25 percent of marine life. So having
all countries aiming for the same targets might be counterproductive. Some countries
may need to protect more than 30 percent of their territory, others less. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re looking at the Amazon,
for instance, recent research has shown that we probably need 80 to 90 percent
of the Amazon intact,” Pimm says. Otherwise, the rainforest &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/12/eaba2949&quot;&gt;may begin
a rapid transformation into drier savannah&lt;/a&gt;, compromising the water
cycle for whole continent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, countries rushing to meet their goals might only go
for the low-hanging fruit. “Areas that are too cold, too hot or too remote” to hold any
agricultural or commercial promise are easy targets, but not necessarily the
areas most in need of protection, Pimm says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The United States could get to 30 percent relatively quickly by
preserving sparsely populated Western tracts of desert or high plains. Most of
the country’s biodiversity, however, is in the southeast. For instance, more endemic salamander species are crawling around &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012189&quot;&gt;Appalachian streams and lakes&lt;/a&gt; than anywhere else in the
world, yet much of their range remains unprotected. Similarly, protecting
most of icy Greenland would effectively meet the European Union’s 30 percent
obligation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Appalachia stream&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087202&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041720_jl_extinction-crisis_inline3_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087202&quot;&gt;The mountain streams and forests of Appalachia along the East Coast are one of the United States’ most biodiverse regions, though the bulk of protected areas are in the West. Here, a stream runs through the Great Smoky Mountains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087202&quot;&gt;Betty4240/iStock/Getty Images Plus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Large area targets may just encourage countries to protect areas
that aren’t going to do much for biodiversity,” Pimm says. “Do we need to
protect more of the planet? Of course, but we should do so in a smart, targeted
way.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;What does protection mean, anyway?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Designating a protected area is just the beginning. Protections need to be enforced through policing and prosecuting for illegal fishing, tree felling, hunting or pollution. Otherwise, protections don’t work — and conservation efforts fall flat. A  2010 analysis published in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Management&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20859627/&quot;&gt;only 24 percent of protected areas were being soundly managed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Places designated only on paper as protected “can give the
illusion of protection where none really exists,” says Murray, the Scripps ocean
law and policy expert. “We could create the largest marine protected area in the world,
but if we just walk away, it doesn’t do anyone any good.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having fully protected national
parks across 30 percent of the globe is probably not feasible, conservationists
say. But there are other ways of managing land and sea to meet conservation
goals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Indigenous lands in Canada are a
great example,” Venter says. These lands allow for hunting and gathering activities,
but not large-scale habitat clearing. And there is evidence that such an
approach works. Indigenous lands in Canada, Brazil and Australia &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2019.07.002&quot;&gt;had similar, or slightly higher, levels
of vertebrate diversity&lt;/a&gt; than non-indigenous protected areas in the
same countries, researchers reported in November 2019 in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Policy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The quarter of Earth’s land now
owned, used or occupied by indigenous communities &lt;a href=&quot;https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTBIODIVERSITY/Resources/RoleofIndigenousPeoplesinBiodiversityConservation.pdf&quot;&gt;holds
about 80 percent of Earth’s biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;, according to a 2008 World Bank
report. So empowering these groups to manage their lands could help countries
achieve their targets, Venter suggests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Moving toward consensus&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, many biologists say that percentage
targets, even if clumsy, do play an important role. Some “countries have taken
great pride in getting close or meeting [Aichi] goals,” and that can be a sign
of how well countries are preserving nature, says Hugh Possingham, chief
scientist at The Nature Conservancy in Brisbane, Australia. But it’s not the
whole story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Relying solely on targets is a bit
like relying only on blood pressure to indicate health,” Possingham says. He
hopes that the eventual agreement incorporates more simple but meaningful
metrics, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12853&quot;&gt;an estimate of how much
a country’s biodiversity is captured by existing protected areas&lt;/a&gt;. “That
would give a fuller picture of how well we’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ofjord mountains in Greenland&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087198&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041720_jl_extinction-crisis_inline5_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087198&quot;&gt;Greenland hosts the world’s largest national park, protecting nearly 1,000,000 square kilometers of its mountainous coast and icy interior (the mountains at Ofjord in Northeast Greenland National Park shown here).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087198&quot;&gt;GRID Arendal/Flickr (&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-NC-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Countries are still months away from
finalizing a new agreement. A broad outline of the framework was released in January
for months of discussions before the next U.N. Convention on Biodiversity. The
timeline for those discussions has been extended due to the ongoing coronavirus
pandemic. The meeting, originally scheduled for October 15 to 29 in Kunming,
China, has been delayed to sometime in 2021&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parts of the outline suggest it will
address some of the failings of the Aichi Targets, says Aleksandar Rankovic, a
senior research fellow at the Institute for Sustainable Development and
International Relations in Paris. “There has been a strong cooperative spirit,”
he says. “Most delegations seem intent on improving the agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the outline stipulates
that whatever land and sea each country designates as protected, 60 percent of that
should be “of particular importance for biodiversity.” What counts as a site of
particular importance remains to be determined, but Rankovic says baking this
kind of language into the document is a key step towards ensuring countries
protect what needs protecting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rankovic hopes the COVID-19
pandemic serves as a wake-up call about the importance of keeping wild
environments intact, as recent research &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00923-8&quot;&gt;links deforestation to
the emergence of zoonotic diseases&lt;/a&gt;, like COVID-19, in humans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we have a biodiversity-related global pandemic that started where we’re supposed to gather to propose ways to solve the biodiversity crisis is quite powerful as a symbol,” he says. Reaching a deal “could be a big moment” in preventing a global extinction crisis. “But if we come out more divided, it will be harder to lay the groundwork for solving this crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/chaos-485491_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early 2000’s there has been growing interest in the phenomenon of household chaos and how it impacts on the well-being and development of children. Yet despite this interest, no review has been conducted that comprehensively brings the existing literature together. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08587-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;systematic scoping review&lt;/a&gt; we have published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aims to address this gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What we found&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With remarkable consistency, increased chaos in a child’s home, defined as high levels of background noise (e.g. from TV), constant rushing, and environmental commotion and confusion, negatively impacted on almost every child outcome investigated, from cognitive and academic performance, to stress physiology, and socio-emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chaos and parenting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how could household chaos have such far-ranging implications for the well-being of children? An important clue lies in the relationship between chaos and parenting behaviors. We found that, yet again with remarkable consistency, greater chaos was associated with increased parent-child conflict, reduced closeness in the parent-child relationship, less supportive parenting practices, and less responsive parenting. And as research has confirmed, the quality of the parent-child relationship is intricately linked to the well-being of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Slowing down childhood&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11837 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/children-403583_640-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Improving child well-being by slowing down the lives of children is not a new concept. Outside academia a number of groups and social movements advocate for the realignment of family time with the ‘pace of childhood’ – a pace that is much slower than the pace of the hurried, modern world children find themselves in. These approaches encourage simplification of a child’s life, through the paring back of unnecessary activities, toys, and digital media, in addition to the promotion of daily rhythms and routines known to support well-being. In short, the focus shifts away from activities that disrupt the flow of family life, and instead focuses on activities that promote parent-child communication and free play (but not computer games!), and support development of warm relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Research gaps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite a push from outside academia to simplify the lives of children, and evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies linking chaos with poor child outcomes, we still don’t know whether reducing household chaos will have a positive impact. We also don’t know how to reduce chaos, as no studies have attempted to do this. And importantly, it still remains to be seen whether we can go too far in the other direction, resulting in a home environment that is overly structured and controlled, to the point that it lacks warmth and the opportunity for supportive and caring parent-child relationships to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Household chaos in the time of COVID-19&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of undertaking the review, we could not have predicted the situation we currently find &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11838&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/table-3281047_640-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;ourselves in. Children around the world are spending an unprecedented amount of time at home. While we don’t know whether children living in low-chaos households will fare better, intuitively, we might expect they will. These children will likely have greater opportunities to complete their home-schooling tasks in a less distracting environment. They will also likely have more time dedicated to free, non-screen based play – the kind of play that supports their emotional well-being and development. And perhaps most importantly, there is the chance that they will have greater exposure to supportive and positive parenting practices. As such, lower household chaos in the time of COVID-19 may provide an environment more conducive to the promotion of resilience and child well-being. A unique opportunity has thus presented itself to investigate not only how low levels of chaos protect children from exposure to adversity, but also whether we can effectively reduce household chaos levels to promote better outcomes across the board for our children.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-evidence-hydroxychloroquine-does-not-help-treat-covid-19"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3087218</id>
		<updated>2020-04-21T22:13:40+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has
been touted by some, including President Trump, as nearly a miracle cure for
COVID-19. But new preliminary evidence suggests that coronavirus patients fare no
better on the drug than they do with standard care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Iran examined six studies, including small studies from France and China, that had suggested the drug might slightly shorten recovery time. All six studies compared hydroxychloroquine with standard care, which may include monitoring, fluids, oxygen and other supportive care as needed. Across all studies, there were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065276v1&quot;&gt;no statistically relevant differences in the outcomes&lt;/a&gt; of patients who took hydroxychloroquine and those who didn’t, the scientists report April 20 at medRxiv.org. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slightly more people taking the drug showed clearer lungs compared with those on standard treatment. And after taking the drug, the virus’s genetic material was also detectable in slightly fewer people than those who didn’t take the drug. But there were also more mild side effects, such as rashes and headaches, in the group taking hydroxychloroquine. The researchers caution that there were too few patients in the studies to make a definitive conclusion about whether the drug works. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, researchers in South Carolina
and Virginia examined records from 368 male patients with COVID-19 admitted to U.S.
Veterans Health Administration medical centers from March 9 through April 11.
That retrospective study also showed&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v1&quot;&gt; no
benefit to taking hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt; alone or in combination with
azithromycin to treat the disease versus standard care, the team reports April
21 at medRxiv.org. Azithromycin is antibiotic that also works to dampen
inflammation. Some studies are testing it in combination with
hydroxychloroquine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That team also found there were more
deaths among men taking hydroxychloroquine relative to those not taking the
drug. Hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin was not associated with a higher
death rate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hydroxychloroquine did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-hiv-drugs-do-not-work-treatment-clinical-trial&quot;&gt;stop the coronavirus from infecting monkey cells in lab tests&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/19/20&lt;/em&gt;). The drug is used to treat people with autoimmune diseases, so researchers have hoped that it might also calm overactive immune reactions that damage lungs and other organs in severely ill COVID-19 patients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hydroxychloroquine is known to interfere with heart rhythms and can lead to sudden heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists
love a good metaphor. Through the years, plumbing, telegraph wires and computers
have all been enlisted to help explain how the brain operates, neurobiologist
and historian Matthew Cobb writes in &lt;em&gt;The Idea of the Brain&lt;/em&gt;. And like any
metaphor, those approximations all fall short.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cobb leads a
fascinating tour of how concepts of the brain have morphed over time. His
writing is clear, thoughtful and, when called for, funny. He describes
experiments by neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, who zapped awake patients’ brains
with electricity to provoke reactions. Zapping certain places consistently
dredged up memories, which Cobb calls “oneiric experiences.” His footnote on
the term: “Look it up. It’s exactly the
right word.” I did, and it was. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Cobb runs though the history of certain concepts used to explain how the brain works, including electricity, evolution and
neurons. Next comes a section on the present, which includes discussions of
memory, circuits and consciousness. Cobb offers tastes of the latest research, and
a heavy dose of realism. Memory studies
have made progress, but “we are still far from understanding what is
happening when we remember,” Cobb writes. Despite big efforts, “we still only
dimly understand what is going on when we see.”
Our understanding of how antidepressants work? “Virtually non-existent.”
&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This real talk is
refreshing, and Cobb uses it to great effect to
argue that neuroscience is stymied. “There have been many similar
moments in the past, when brain researchers became uncertain about how to
proceed,” he writes. Scientists have amassed an impressive stockpile of brain facts,
but a true understanding of how the brain works eludes us. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect a computer metaphor to help. Like a computer, the brain’s
main job is to process information. But some experts argue that because brains are biological — they evolved within the vagaries of a body — they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-donkey-kong-can-tell-us-about-how-study-brain&quot;&gt;operate in ways that a machine doesn’t&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/23/16&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cobb reckons
that, among other reasons, the mere existence
of such objections is a harbinger of the end of the computer metaphor.
But that doesn’t mean the comparison was a
waste. Metaphors clarify thoughts, he writes, and scientists would do well to
ponder what might replace the concept. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He ends the book with a creative exercise in
looking ahead to what the future might hold. The possibilities include the creation of conscious machines, or even having to
accept that there is no brain theory to be found. Still, “our current
ignorance should not be viewed as a sign of defeat,” Cobb writes, “but as a
challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Megan Peters, Konrad Kording and the people behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuromatch.io/&quot;&gt;neuromatch&lt;/a&gt; are building an online summer school for computational neuroscience (July 13 – 31st). If you’re reading this blog – chances are you should be a student in this class or a TA. It’s going to be awesome! 3 straight weeks of computational neuro education. Designed for PhD student or postdoc experimentalists in mind, what sets it apart is matching, the same technology behind neuromatch. Become part of small tight-knit group of trainees with similar interests – bond, share, learn. But wait, there’s more:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low TA to student ratio (6-10)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lectures with world-class computational neuroscientists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tutorials in Python, cloud-based in Google Colab: take your theoretical knowledge and apply to your own data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inclusive: 100$ tuition (waivable)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I loved summer school (CSHL computational neuroscience: vision). I made some life-long friends and have memories to last a lifetime. We want it to be better than a real-life summer school. Better by being more inclusive, matching you with more diverse people, offering multiple levels of support, and being accessible to people at different stages in their career.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15HQC_UMT8BZBpPwbkID5l8pNOVKaSMzzz0xP2_xd0No/&quot;&gt;Syllabus is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen1oyFWIQ38vlBSxUdlWU4AwQ_UYGqQZcGAS_cEmMdN6cdNw/viewform&quot;&gt;Student form is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4aL49WV_dnt7WlXjEwsY8Mb30I2E0VHa8LROYPcmmwkzLdw/viewform&quot;&gt;TA form is here&lt;/a&gt;. YOU HAVE UNTIL APRIL 27 TO SIGN UP, DO IT NOW.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Teaching at scale&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most real-life elite education is expensive and exclusive. In online education, it’s possible to scale to huge audiences for a fraction of the cost, and let everybody in – including people of disadvantaged backgrounds. MOOCs can have excellent learning materials – better production values, materials that resist the test of time, scannable lectures. Training educators in the latest methods can be done at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest disadvantage of MOOCs is high attrition – up to 95% of people that sign up for MOOCs drop out. New models are appearing that have the accessibility of online learning and the critical social component of real-life learning. At Stanford, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami started Code in Place, an effort to bring CS education to people at home during covid19 times. It’s a massive effort – 8,000 students from all over the world accompanied by 800 section leaders (including me!). Several factors have kept dropout to a minimum (&amp;lt; 20% after 2 weeks):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A low TA-to-student ratio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;matching TAs to students based on learner characteristic (age, location)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;engaging materials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a very high standard for TAs (Top affiliations are Stanford, Google and MIT)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a tough preparatory assignment to make sure the students entering class were motivated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was very excited when Konrad announced that they were working on a summer school, fresh off my Code in Place experience, so I contacted him and have joined the team to help (in a small way) organize this thing. There are a handful of experiments in teaching computational neuroscience at scale, the most successful in my opinion being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/&quot;&gt;Neuronal Dynamics online book, tutorials, and lectures&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine that, plus TAs, your own wolf pack, live Q&amp;amp;A – community. That’s what we’re aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-speed-gas-collisions-prevent-star-birth-galaxies-bars"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3086995</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The
barred spiral galaxy NGC 1300 is one of the most spectacular galaxies in the
heavens, but the dramatic bar that pierces its heart produces few if any stars
— even though the bar abounds with the raw material for creating them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New
computer simulations may explain the paradox in this and other galaxies with
prominent bars. Galaxies form stars from clouds of interstellar gas and dust.
But within the bar of NGC 1300, gas clouds smash together so fast they &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/staa840/5815434&quot;&gt;stir each other up and don’t collapse
into stars&lt;/a&gt;,
researchers say April 3 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
Society. The finding
suggests that high-speed collisions between gas clouds also helped suppress
star formation shortly after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
brightest and most massive stars begin their lives with a blue hue, but they
quickly die. If no new stars take their place, the population of stars as a
whole eventually turns yellow-orange as less massive stars expand and become
yellow, orange and red giants. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Located
about 68 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Eridanus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hubble-views-bar-galaxy&quot;&gt;NGC 1300 resembles&lt;/a&gt; a backward letter S, with outwardly
spiraling blue arms and a straight bar through the galaxy’s center that is yellow-orange
(&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/5/05)&lt;/em&gt;. That color scheme means gas and dust are spawning new stars
in the arms, but few if any stars are arising in the 50,000 light-year-long bar.
The Milky Way is also a barred spiral, but its bar is about two-thirds as long.
&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To
understand why NGC 1300’s bar doesn’t sparkle with new stars, despite
containing the gas and dust needed for the job, the researchers simulated the orbit
of gas clouds around the galaxy’s center. In most of the galaxy, the clouds
follow fairly circular paths. But the gravitational attraction of all the stars
in the bar yank on the clouds, making them swerve into the wrong lane and
collide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We
find that the cloud-cloud collision speed is very high, very fast, in the bar,”
says Yusuke Fujimoto, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science
in Washington, D.C. There the clouds hit each other some 10 kilometers per
second faster than elsewhere. Although a low-speed collision can mint new stars
by making gas collapse, Fujimoto says a high-speed collision induces so much
turbulence in the clouds that it ends their star-making careers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
new results may also pertain to a galaxy closer to home. No one knows whether the
Milky Way’s bar has newborn stars, because astronomers can’t see our own galaxy
from the outside. Still, if no new stars are arising in the galactic bar,
Fujimoto says the likely culprit is the high speed at which gas clouds there collide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This
group has done a wonderful job,” says Bruce Elmegreen, an astronomer at IBM’s Thomas
J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., who was not involved in
the new work. “It’s a very reasonable result.” But he says other factors likely
thwart star formation in NGC 1300’s bar, too. For example, the gravitational
pull of the bar’s many stars can tear apart individual gas clouds before they
are able to make new stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fujimoto and his colleagues also speculate that high-speed collisions between gas clouds helped to impede the creation of stars shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was smaller and more crowded. From observations of distant galaxies, astronomers know that star formation didn’t peak until several billion years after the universe’s birth.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture the scene: you’re attending a regular medical checkup, fielding questions about your health and lifestyle, when your doctor tells you they can accurately estimate your life expectancy from your answers. Would you want to hear the truth, no matter how brutal it might be? Or would you prefer to live in ignorance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you belong to the latter category, you’re not alone. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3543&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Management Science &lt;/em&gt;has found that many of us would rather avoid stressful or uncomfortable truths — even if they might benefit us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39504&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To find out who is most likely to avoid information and why, Emily Ho from Fordham University and colleagues first presented 380 participants with a series of scenarios designed to test their desire for knowledge about a situation that could have a favourable or unfavourable outcome for them. The scenarios replicated situations that participants were likely to have encountered in the past and fell into three broad categories: personal health, finances, and other people’s perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked whether they would want to look at how well a missed investment opportunity was performing, for example, whether or not they’d want to know their risk for a particular medical condition, or if they’d want to know the truth about how well a speech had gone. (If you’re interested in finding out your own tendency to avoid information, you can see all the scenarios and take the test &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0oYP0OROwDv1f2l&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Participants’ personality traits were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information avoidance was incredibly common: on average, participants indicated that they would definitely or probably not want to receive information 32% of the time. Overall, these figures were fairly stable across domains: an average of 24% would prefer not to know if a friend hated a book given as a gift, for instance, whilst 29% would avoid finding out the impact stress had had on their long-term health. Even among those who were more likely to want to hear potentially troubling information, there was often at least one domain in which they opted to remain uninformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ likelihood of avoiding information wasn’t associated with their gender, income, age or education. However, it was related to particular personality traits: those higher in extraversion, conscientiousness and openness to new experiences tended to seek information more, while those with high neuroticism scores showed a higher likelihood of wanting to stay in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study, which saw participants rate the scenarios again, four weeks apart, suggested their responses remain stable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study looked at participants’ real-world behaviour. In this case, two weeks after completing the initial survey on information avoidance, participants were given the option to be sent to a website containing potentially valuable information that they might be motivated to avoid: for instance, an occupational website that compared average salaries between men and women, or a health site informing people about their individual risk of burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggested that participants’ tendency to avoid information as measured by the survey did have an impact on real-world decisions: avoidant and seeking scores correlated with the decision to avoid or read information respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings may have important uses: understanding in which situations people tend to ignore or avoid information could be vital for organisations or governments sending out public service information, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already knew, to some extent, that there are cases where people avoid information — interventions that seek to improve financial literacy tend to have smaller impacts than hoped, for example, partly because some people feel so anxious about money they’ll go out of their way to avoid thinking about it. Building this knowledge into the design of social interventions may be a useful way to approach such individual differences in information seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3543&quot;&gt;Measuring Information Preferences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how the media discusses suicide is a topic of frequent debate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jech.bmj.com/content/57/4/238&quot;&gt;Plenty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=lpcuDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PT8&amp;amp;dq=.+Media+and+suicide:+international+perspectives+on+research,+theory,+and+policy.Routledge,+2017.&amp;amp;ots=aEVG_TEtWR&amp;amp;sig=d6qWpbd6szrd2vPxJ14J-QU7U4Y&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=.%20Media%20and%20suicide%3A%20international%20perspectives%20on%20research%2C%20theory%2C%20and%20policy.Routledge%2C%202017.&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has linked media reporting  of suicide with an increase in suicidal behaviour, and both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/&quot;&gt;Samaritans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/resource_booklet_2017/en/&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), amongst others, have clear (and frequently promoted) guides for journalists on how to report suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such guidelines are often ignored in favour of insensitivity or sensationalism — especially when the person at hand is a celebrity. Take the recent coverage of the death of Caroline Flack: explicit, deeply intimate details were plastered across tabloids for weeks, with seemingly no thought for how those details would impact readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m575&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt;, has taken a closer look at just how serious the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39492&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis included 20 studies which looked at the rate of suicides amongst the general population before and after the media had reported on suicide in print, online, or on TV. Of these, 14 studies looked at reports specifically on the death of a celebrity by suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the studies found an increase in suicides during the period after the reporting of a death of a celebrity; in cases where the method was detailed, there was also an increase in the number of suicides by that same method. On average, reports of celebrity deaths by suicide were associated with an 8 to 18% increase in suicide rates in the general population, with estimates on the higher end of the scale when the celebrity in question was famous worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern of results is also consistent with previous research which has found that media coverage of suicide can profoundly affect people’s mental health, the authors write. Suicidal thoughts often increase, as do feelings of low mood and low self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why reports about famous people have such a large impact, one factor may be the high level of identification the general public has with celebrities. Reports may also establish suicide as a way to cope with problems, the team says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all media coverage is associated with an increase in suicides, however: overall, reporting on suicide generally, rather than on a specific celebrity’s death, was not linked to an increase in deaths. However, past work has suggested that particular ways of reporting could increase risk: when suicide is depicted as “inevitable”, for instance, or when media outlets reinforced damaging myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other media may also &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; those feeling suicidal, rather than impacting their mental health further. Some coverage features stories of healing or recovery, some offers support or advice, and some simply follow guidelines set by the Samaritans or WHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the results do show that media reports can increase the risk of suicide among the general population, it’s also important not to draw too direct a conclusion from the findings. Suicide is a complex, nuanced thing: not only would it be irresponsible to place the blame at the door of one institution, media outlet or other specific cause, it would also be counter to the very guidelines in place to protect people. The Samaritans guidelines, for example, warn against “over-simplification of the causes or perceived triggers for a suicide”, which are “unlikely to reflect accurately the complexity of suicide”. Drawing a direct and simple line between media coverage and suicide does not adhere to that suggestion itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, limitations aside, the analysis does have important ramifications. Guidelines do already exist, and exist for a reason: following them is hugely important when it comes to protecting mental health. Journalists may already be aware of such guidelines — but making sure they apply them to their own work is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the UK, you can call Samaritans for free any time on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/SciLine-690x320px-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A guest post by Meredith Drosback, Becky Hazen, &amp;amp; Rick Weiss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has vastly increased journalists’ demand for access to scientist-sources, triggering a gold rush of sorts for articulate experts in virology, epidemiology, drug and vaccine development, and the social and psychological impacts of physical isolation, among other topics. The need for scientific expertise is especially acute among newsrooms that—as part of their all-hands-on-deck response to the pandemic—have pulled reporters onto the story who have never covered science or public health, let alone a health crisis of this magnitude. Lacking a ready bench of go-to scientists they can call, these reporters are scrambling to find trusted sources who can help them convey, accurately and clearly, health advice and insights for a nervous and news-ravenous public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this sudden increase in appetite for scientific expertise is in some respects refreshing, it has also resulted in a number of scientists being flooded with media requests, including those with little or no training in best practices for speaking to reporters. And while clear communication with the media is a skill that can most certainly be learned, it requires time and practice if counterproductive results are to be avoided. Given the ever-increasing demands of their day jobs, especially during this crisis, time is something that few scientists with pandemic-relevant expertise today have much of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciline.org/for-scientists&quot;&gt;SciLine&lt;/a&gt;, a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has been connecting journalists to scientists for 2.5 years. Through our facilitation of more than 1,100 such interviews across print, radio, and television, we’ve observed time after time the practices and behaviors that make for an effective interaction between an expert and a reporter. Recognizing that many scientists with limited media training are being called upon to share their expertise or opinions about aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we share here some tips we have found to be most useful for a successful interview, whether you have a few minutes or a few days to get ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEFORE&lt;/em&gt; AN INTERVIEW, WRITE DOWN 3 POINTS YOU WANT TO MAKE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these your “vital takeaways”. If the journalist gets nothing else from the interview, what would you want them to remember and use? If you are not on camera, you can have these notes in front of you during the interview. State your points early in the conversation and repeat them as opportunities arise. Importantly, whenever possible don’t just assert these points but back them up with data and studies. You’re uniquely positioned to inject &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; into the news. In doing so you can do more than simply convey the facts; you can help remind the public there is a difference between research-backed evidence and mere opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; DESCRIBE THE BIG-PICTURE PROBLEM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if not asked, you should step back from the specific questions being asked and briefly describe the overarching issue or challenge in simple terms. Explain why addressing the larger issue demands a methodical, scientific approach, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; get into the details. Reporters often push for quick answers—to get to the point they think they need. But if you explain even briefly why this is a question that science is in the best position to answer, you again speak up not just for the findings of science but also for the scientific process itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USE ANALOGIES, VISUAL EXAMPLES, AND ANECDOTES WHEN POSSIBLE, AND AVOID JARGON.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you plan ahead for the ideas you want to convey, think about how you can make your knowledge more accessible, relatable, and memorable to nonexperts. Avoid using acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon—including terms you might not at first realize are jargon. (You may describe a mounting threat as resulting from a “positive feedback” loop, for example, but some non-scientists think “positive feedback” means “praise” and is generally a good thing!) Remember, even a single acronym or overly technical term in a sentence increases the odds that your otherwise valuable quote will end up on the cutting room floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF A QUESTION, SAY SO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not rude to say to a journalist, &lt;em&gt;“Actually, that’s not quite right. Let me explain …” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“I don’t think your premise is correct. What I see is …” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“That may be one factor, but the bigger issue is …”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW THE ANSWER, IT’S OK TO SAY SO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it can be when asked by a reporter to weigh in on a science-related question outside your area of expertise or to address a topic on which you are not fully up to speed, don’t risk your reputation (or, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health) by doing so. It’s okay to say: &lt;em&gt;“I’m sorry, that’s outside my area of expertise.” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“I don’t have the answer at my fingertips, can I get back to you on that question?” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“That isn’t something I focus on, but [a knowledgeable colleague you know] might be a good person to talk to.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; KEEP IN MIND THAT ANYTHING YOU SAY COULD END UP IN A STORY, AND DON’T TRY TO GO “OFF THE RECORD”. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default status for all journalistic interviews is that the reporter may quote anything you say and is not obligated to share quotes with you ahead of time for review or approval. Anything different from that default necessitates an agreement ahead of time by both parties, the reporter and the interviewee. We recommend you do not attempt to go ‘off the record’ during an interview, as that phrase can mean different things to different reporters and may result in a statement being traceable back to you. Only share remarks that you’re comfortable having attributed to you by name. Similarly, if asked a question you don’t want to answer, avoid responding by saying, &lt;em&gt;“No comment,” &lt;/em&gt;which, in itself, is a comment—and not generally taken positively. A good neutral approach is, &lt;em&gt;“I’m not prepared to talk about that right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONFIRM YOU GOT YOUR MAIN MESSAGES ACROSS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close every interview by asking the reporter to summarize the most important points they gathered from the conversation. If they don’t include your key points in their review, or state something that isn’t quite right, this is your final opportunity clarify any misunderstandings and remind them of your main points. Whenever possible, also offer to be available for follow-up questions or fact checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be gratifying if one result of the COVID-19 pandemic were to be a lasting increase in public and media interest in scientific expertise, and appreciation of the importance of science in decision making at every level—from personal health decisions to state and federal policy making. And it is inspiring to see so many scientists stepping up to the plate to share what they know in this time of need. Handling interactions with journalists skillfully today can pay off personally, professionally, and for society for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bats are apparently able to imitate specific sounds, an ability shown by just a few other mammals and some birds&lt;/strong&gt;. The bats’ calls were recorded, and the sound manipulated before being played back to them. Within a month, the bats had learned to copy the sounds in exchange for a food reward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2240435-bats-can-learn-to-copy-sounds-and-it-may-teach-us-about-human-speech/&quot;&gt;reports Layal Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. Studying vocal production in other animals can help psycholinguists understand the evolution of human speech.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39479&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new drug candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia has shown promising results in a clinical trial. &lt;/strong&gt;The compound SEP-363856, developed by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, reduced symptoms in patients who were early in the course of schizophrenia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/experimental-schizophrenia-drug-could-reduce-long-neglected-symptoms?rss=1&quot;&gt;repots Kelly Servick&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. This appeared to include a decrease in negative symptoms like blunted emotion, which are notoriously difficult to treat, although further research is needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being considered a “weirdo” or outsider clearly has its downsides — but it may also boost your creativity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/04/the-perks-of-being-a-weirdo/606778/&quot;&gt;writes Olga Khazan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic. &lt;/em&gt;Various studies have found that people who do not fit into a particular group tend to show greater creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know that our mental health is influenced by our interactions with family members — so a new programme seeks to treat childhood anxiety indirectly, by providing sessions for parents instead of children themselves&lt;/strong&gt;. Recent trials suggest that Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions may be as effective as CBT at treating children’s anxiety, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4agzvm/giving-parents-therapy-can-help-their-anxious-children?utm_source=reddit.com&quot;&gt;reports Shayla Love&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, there’s one career where regular social isolation is part of the job description: astronaut. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200408-an-astronauts-guide-to-surviving-isolation&quot;&gt;Tiffanie Wen gets some tips&lt;/a&gt; from an astronaut who spent months on the International Space Station and an engineer who lived in a dome in Hawaii to simulate life on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the pandemic, pornography use has increased — perhaps not a huge surprise, given that we know people turn to porn to cope with negative feelings and boredom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/porn-use-is-up-thanks-to-the-pandemic-134972&quot;&gt;writes Joshua B. Grubbs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. “For most users, pornography is probably just another distraction – one that might actually help “flatten the curve” by keeping people safely occupied and socially distanced,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, social media has been ablaze with people reporting experiencing vivid, coronavirus-related dreams.&lt;/strong&gt; But why are so many of us having these dreams? There are a number of causes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-dreams-sleep&quot;&gt;reports Will Pritchard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired: &lt;/em&gt;partly, these kinds of dreams are natural response to stress and trauma, but they may also reflect the simple fact that many of us are getting more sleep (and particularly REM sleep) than before.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/martin-sanchez-ezY6rc65mUE-unsplash-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/04/us-funding-for-world-health-organization-should-not-be-interrupted-during-covid-19-pandemic-say-presidents-of-the-nas-nae-and-nam&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt; warning that interrupting funding for World Health Organization (WHO) would be a critical failure for our global health security. PLOS stands with the assessment of our nation’s top scientists: this is not a time to turn inward, but to collaborate for immediate, robust and concentrated international action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;i&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/i&gt; editors indicate in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2020/04/16/we-need-to-support-the-who-not-stop-its-funding-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt;perspective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt;, the WHO is the only global health organization that has the tools to combat a pandemic of truly global consequences.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;&gt;To halt funding now would risk the lives of many who rely on the WHO’s essential services and debilitate our collective progress towards understanding the virus and curbing the impact of the pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-04-16T16:23:28+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our journals which are selective for novelty — PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Pathogens — have all revised their ‘scooping’ policy to waive the novelty criteria for work submitted within six months of a similar study having been published. If your almost-completed work was ‘scooped’ by a study published today, it will still be considered novel by these journals, giving you the time to rigorously complete it and submit it within the next six months.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What is a better demonstration of the reproducibility of a piece of research than two or more labs independently and rigorously conducting the same work in parallel? Whether they reach similar results or uncover intriguing differences, the studies complement and add value to each other, providing validation or additional insight. Yet, in the current incentives landscape in scientific research, it too often matters most to be first. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The effects of this flawed incentive system are particularly acute in the life and biomedical sciences. Because of it, labs aware of competition race to complete a study and publish it first, researchers are wary of posting results on preprint servers or presenting unpublished results at conferences to avoid tipping off competitors. And yes, in that race to be first the temptation to cut corners can be high. Because if you come second, your study will most likely be rejected from your journal of choice for not being deemed novel. You will likely endure the protracted journey of finding a journal that will consider your work, or find yourself in need of adding more results to provide ‘sufficiently novel insight’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It doesn’t have to be like that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Inspired by a desire to nudge the norms of research assessment, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; pioneered an expanded &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;‘complementary research’ policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in 2018. Under that policy, manuscripts that confirm or extend a recently published study are eligible for consideration at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. The editors’ experience has been exemplary — the ‘scooped’ studies they considered were thorough, of high quality and their comparison with the complementary study provided even more value to the research question. Two of the first researchers who experienced the policy first-hand &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006843&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;wrote about it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; eloquently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Across PLOS, we’ve been watching the reactions to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; policy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of course never considered novelty as a criterion, but until recently the existing policy at all other journals was to protect from ‘scooping’ from the time of submission only. The experience of a highly-selective journal like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; when it expanded this protection period to six months before submission was intriguing to all, and editors started becoming more lenient about scooping. The results from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and the experience across the portfolio convinced the Editors-in-Chief of all PLOS journals of the value of this policy for scientific research in general and all PLOS journals now have adopted the same policy (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/complementary-research&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;see for example PLOS Genetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We hope that for all researchers intent on conducting rigorous research this helps relieve the pressure to submit before others, allowing them to do all proper controls and analyses that make their results more robust. We also hope that other journals and research assessors take note so that ultimately the norms can change across the landscape. As a widely-adopted policy, this would be a game-changer for researchers whose careers hang on the prominence of their publications and revolutionize the way we plan, execute and attribute credit for scientific research.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After all, we should all recognize that being first is not always the most important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you an evening person — an owl? Or a morning person — a lark? No end of studies have reported variations in the functioning of people who like to wake and go to bed late, versus those who are early to bed and early to rise. And now a new study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230169&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has found links between our “chronotype” and the way we handle emotions, reflect on our thoughts and feelings, and assert ourselves. Overall, owls do worse. And this, argues Juan Manuel Antúnez at the University of Malaga, Spain, could help to explain links between being an owl and poorer psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39466&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Antúnez recruited 2,283 healthy Spanish men and women, aged 18-60 years, to complete a series of online questionnaires. First, their chronotype was assessed. This revealed that about 28% were owls, about 23% were larks, and the rest were neither. (This is similar to the estimated spread in the general population, with about 20% of us falling into each of the extreme groups and the remaining 60% in the middle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also completed a questionnaire that explored their use of two different strategies for emotional regulation: “cognitive reappraisal”, which involves reframing a stressful situation to lessen its emotional impact and is related to greater well-being; and emotion suppression, which is maladaptive and is related to psychological problems like depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scale assessed participants’ meta-cognitions — the way they think about their thoughts and feelings. This scale included measures of maladaptive thought processes about feelings (for example, thinking that worry is useful for avoiding future problems) and thoughts (such as: “I should be controlling my thoughts all of the time” and “I am constantly aware of my thinking”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final measure asked the participants to report their own level of assertiveness — their tendency to (non-aggressively) affirm a right or a point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses showed that chronotype was indeed related to these measures. The closer a participant was to the lark extreme, the more likely they were to use (beneficial) cognitive reappraisal to regulate their emotions. Those who were closer to the owl extreme were more likely to use suppression, however. This strategy has been related to all kinds of problems, including depression and decreased well-being, self-esteem, and social functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owls also scored highest for maladaptive ways of thinking about their thoughts and feelings. And they reported the lowest levels of assertiveness, while larks reported the highest. Assertiveness is a core skill for well-being, Antúnez notes, so could protect against psychological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results held even after controlling for gender and age-related differences. And for all the measures, those with an intermediate chronotype — who were neither owl nor lark — scored in the middle zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, biologically-speaking, owls only “wake up” later in the day, after normal school and work start times, they are out of sync with most countries’ daily routines. This “social jetlag” has been linked to greater fatigue. Perhaps that fatigue drives the poorer owl results on the measures in his study, Antúnez suggests. But, as he says, studies that follow people over time will be required to explore this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, “although future longitudinal studies are needed,” he writes, “[the] results emphasize evening-type as a risk factor for the development of psychological disturbances and morning-type as a protective factor against those.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230169&quot;&gt;Circadian typology is related to emotion regulation, metacognitive beliefs and assertiveness in healthy adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Journals have retracted 30 papers, and added expressions of concern to 13 more, because the research likely involved organs from executed prisoners in China. The issue surfaced as early as 2016, and two of the retractions occurred in 2017, but all of the other retractions, and all of the expressions of concern, happened after a … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/15/journals-have-retracted-or-flagged-more-than-40-papers-from-china-that-appear-to-have-used-organ-transplants-from-executed-prisoners/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Journals have retracted or flagged more than 40 papers from China that appear to have used organ transplants from executed prisoners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you often spend time with your friends in order to forget about personal problems? Do you think about your friends even when you’re not with them? Have you even gone as far as ignoring your family to spend time with your friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes to these questions, you might fit the criteria for “offline friend addiction”, according to a new scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/7x85m/&quot;&gt;described in a preprint&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;PsyArxiv. &lt;/em&gt;Except, of course, that this notion is ridiculous. How can we be addicted to socialising, the fulfilment of one of our basic human needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much the point of the new paper, written with tongue firmly in cheek. But behind it is a serious argument: although a scale for offline friend addiction is clearly absurd, there’s another, similar concept for which such scales have already been developed — social media addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39471&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Some psychologists have expressed concern that social media is damaging our mental health or that we’ve become dependent on it, and as much as a third of the population can be classified as “addicted” using measures of social media addiction. But many aspects of social media fulfil our need to connect with others. So could people actually be addicted to socialising more generally, even when that occurs offline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this not-entirely-serious question, Liam Satchell from the University of Winchester and colleagues developed the Offline-Friend Addiction Questionnaire, or O-FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team created the scale by mimicking the process used to develop measures of social media addiction. Many of these were adapted from scales for other problems such as alcohol craving, replacing references to alcohol with references to social media. So the team decided to adapt these social media addiction scales in the same way: for instance, instead of respondents indicating if they “spent more time on Facebook than initially intended”, they were asked if they had “spent more time with friends than I initially intended”. The team ended up with a 37-item questionnaire, which 807 participants completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, researchers have attempted to prove that social media addiction scales are valid by showing that they are associated with related measures, such as scales of problematic behaviour. So again, the authors did the same thing, “validating” the O-FAQ by demonstrating that participants’ scores were associated with risk-taking behaviour and certain personality traits. Some participants also completed the questionnaire again 28 days later, allowing the team to show that participants responded consistently across time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to figure out how many people were friend addicts, the team again used criteria from past work, in which a person is considered “addicted” if they score at the midpoint or above on more than half of the questions. This revealed that 69% of respondents were addicted to their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we be worried about this apparent friendship addiction crisis? Obviously not, say the researchers. “’Offline friend addiction’ is not an issue of concern for public health, but rather it is capturing experiences pertinent to social support, adaptation, and well-being across the lifespan,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the point is that measures of social media addiction &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;capture these experiences. We might use social media to give or receive emotional support, for instance, or to hang out with our friends after a long day. Yet these scales don’t take this context into account. “What we have demonstrated here is that researchers can quickly produce farcical results when conceptualising social media as a distinctive entity that is unrelated to any other social context,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work also highlights how easy — and potentially problematic — it is to claim that a scale is valid and use it to diagnose people when there aren’t actually any recognised diagnostic criteria to compare it against. Neither offline friend addiction nor social media addiction are formal psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in the current crisis the paper has taken on new relevance. Right now we are unable to see our “offline friends”, and for many of us the internet is the main means of communication. So perhaps, as psychologist Amy Orben &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;suggested to us&lt;/a&gt; last month, we will begin to see the emergence of a more nuanced conversation about the benefits and risks of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the team are not the first to develop a tongue-in-cheek measure to make a point about technology use. The term “Internet Addiction Disorder” was reportedly first coined in 1995 by psychiatrist Ivan Goldberg, who posted satirical diagnostic criteria for the new “disorder” to a psychology bulletin board. “To medicalize every behavior by putting it into psychiatric nomenclature is ridiculous”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/01/13/just-click-no&quot;&gt;Goldberg told the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in 1997. More than 20 years later, the authors of the new study conclude with a similar message: “We urge future social media research to focus on testing what components of social media use are distinct to offline social information seeking, especially when attempting to pathologise everyday behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/7x85m/&quot;&gt;Development of an Offline-Friend Addiction Questionnaire (O-FAQ): Are most people really social addicts?&lt;/a&gt; [this paper is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important and durable findings in moral and political psychology is that there is a tail-wags-the-dog aspect to human morality. Most of us like to think we have carefully thought-through, coherent moral systems that guide our behaviour and judgements. In reality our behaviour and judgements often stem from gut-level impulses, and only after the fact do we build elaborate moral rationales to justify what we believe and do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-23351-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; examines this issue through a fascinating lens: free will. Or, more specifically, via people’s judgments about how much free will others had when committing various transgressions. The team, led by Jim A. C. Everett of the University of Kent and Cory J. Clark of Durham University, ran 14 studies geared at evaluating the possibility that at least some of the time the moral tail wags the dog: first people decide whether someone is blameworthy, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; judge how much free will they have, in a way that allows them to justify blaming those they want to blame and excusing those they want to excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39454&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The researchers examined this hypothesis, for which there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660989&quot;&gt;already some evidence&lt;/a&gt;, through the lens of American partisan politics. In the paper they note that previous research has shown that conservatives have a greater belief in free will than liberals, and are more moralising in general (that is, they categorise a larger number of acts as morally problematic, and rely on a greater number of principles — or moral foundations — in making these judgements). The first two of the new studies replicated these findings — this is consistent with the idea, put simply, that conservatives believe in free will more because it allows them to level more moral judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to unpack in the remaining studies, but here are a few of the key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Study 4&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers found that when it came to attribution of free will in instances that were viewed as “equally immoral for liberals and conservatives,” (such as spreading malicious rumours about a co-worker) there was no longer any correlation between participants’ political stance (liberal vs. conservative) and their evaluations of how much free will the transgressor had. This lends support to the idea that “differences in conservatives’ and liberals’ perception of free will may be partially due to differences in moralisation, rather than representing any generalised, abstract belief that human behaviours are freely chosen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Study 5&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers found that when they deliberately presented participants with hypothetical acts designed to be viewed as more immoral by liberals — such as “Robert sends a formal complaint to his child’s school after finding that his child’s kindergarten teacher is transgendered” — the normal pattern reversed itself, and it was now liberals who attributed more free will to the actors in question. (This finding was weaker, and only statistically significant when the researchers bumped up their sample beyond its initial size.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Study 7&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers synthesised the aforementioned findings and randomly assigned online participants recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to situations in which the person committing a bad act was either described as liberal or conservative and as acting in order to achieve liberal or conservative goals. After confirming  that the MTurk respondents viewed moral harms against their own political group more harshly, the researchers also found “tentative — but weak — evidence” in favour of their overall hypothesis: liberal MTurkers viewed conservative bad actors as having more free will than bad-acting liberals, and conservative MTurkers viewed liberal bad actors  as having more free will than bad-acting conservatives. In short, when people take political actions that we morally disapprove of, we’re more inclined to believe they did it of their own volition. This bias afflicts conservatives more often, because they’re more morally disapproving, but can just as easily afflict liberals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the evidence is mixed, but overall the paper suggests that even judgments about free will (a complex philosophical concept that has been the subject of much debate and introspection) can’t escape the gut-impulse nature that underlies so much human moralising. Though preliminary, this is an important finding that could have ramifications for society. For one thing, if we have a tendency to view agents as more free when their bad acts offend us politically, but as less free when they don’t, that’s the sort of psychological tendency that could be echoed in law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-23351-001&quot;&gt;Political differences in free will belief are associated with differences in moralization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;How to spot a neuroscientist in the wild&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MYbi9HRLcuUFVT_ivl83nQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Neuroethologist in the wild. Image credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here report the discovery of a new species of the genus Homo, for which we propose the binomial &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;. Despite dating their last common ancestor with &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; to within a mere hundred years ago, the evolutionary pressure of being forced to reckon with the most complex organ in known existence has driven rapid divergence in &lt;em&gt;Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;. This has given rise to an absurdly overextended obsession with the brain, while atrophying other, normal features of the genus Homo. Indeed, in our field studies we found the sense of social etiquette to be vestigial at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two decades of close observation we have identified a number of sub-species. While we believe these sub-species to be technically capable of interbreeding, they are rarely seen interacting in the wild, and so must be considered distinct. Here we present a field guide to identifying these sub-species from their characteristics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Mimics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of species that attempt to mimic &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;, but are easily distinguished upon close observation. Two in particular are noteworthy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurobollocker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sapiens that append the suffix “neuro-” to any random noun to make it sound smart and brain-y. Particularly egregious examples include neuro-marketing, neuro-law, and neuro-criticism. Frequently confuse neuroscience with psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cranks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sub-species of Sapiens easily identified by their mantra “I’ve got a theory for how the whole brain works”. Scourge of inboxes. Somehow oblivious that the collective efforts of the highly intelligent few hundred thousand members of the below &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt; sub-species have been ultimately aimed at that very same thing, across all scales at which brains work, for about a hundred years — yet have not constructed a working theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sub-species&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Electrophysiologist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recorder of single neurons, lowerer of electrodes. Notable tribes include the patch-clampers, whose cruel initiation rites require attaching a micrometer-scale piece of glass to the body of a neuron ten times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. Some among this tribe, possibly insane, attempt the same in awake, moving animals. They are easily distinguished from other &lt;em&gt;Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt; by the rhythmic beating of their heads against the lab bench when losing yet another neuron after just three trials of behaviour are complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Systems Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinguishable from the electrophysiologist by trying to record from many neurons at the same time, and relate them to something in the outside world. Comes in many tribes, from the sensory obsessives, the memorists and decisionists, to the motor wagglers, through others that identify themselves by blobs of the brain — the corticians, cerebellites, the basal gang, the hippocampites, the amygdalarians — to yet others that identify with the type of brain — the worm-wranglers, the fly-fanciers, the sea-sluggers. To the naive observer these tribes would all seem to be working towards the same goal, but vicious internecine wars frequently erupt within and between tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insufferably smug since members of their subspecies were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2014 (“we’re a real science now”), they are nonetheless handicapped by the crudeness of their tools, which has led to the Humphries Uncertainty Principle: they can either record precisely when neurons send spikes but not know exactly where they are, or know precisely where they are but not know exactly when they send spikes (they call these “multi-electrode recording” and “calcium imaging”, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cognitive Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subspecies is more intensely interested in us Sapiens than any other. We find it useful to distinguish a number of breeds, albeit with some overlap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimager — often referred to by other subspecies as “a psychologist with a magnet”, they adore rainbow colours. A deeply superstitious people, yet highly intelligent. In their writings frequent references are made to “Bonferroni”, possibly a deity, and they will cross themselves and mutter curses to the heavens upon hearing the phrase “dead salmon”. But the complex incantations necessary to turn the magnetic alignment of oxygen-depleted haemoglobin into a measurable signal of brain activity is testament to their ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalp tickler — a “psychologist with a hairnet”, readily identified by their distinctive calls. Anthropologists have transcribed some of these calls (lit. “P100”, “N2”), but have yet to discern their meaning. Some authorities subdivide a further breed, the Magnetiser, a psychologist with a quantum thingy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paddlers — believe that waving a magic wand near the scalp of a Sapiens will variously cause involuntary movement, enhance their mathematical ability, or let them experience the presence of god(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Neuroanatomist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was thought to be going extinct, until the Connectomics Explosion approximately 15YA rapidly diversified the gene pool, with many new, previously unrecorded phenotypes appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the brain to be a feedback loop. Fiddles with amplifier settings until the squealing stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioural Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching a rodent press a lever. Talks almost entirely in capital letters (example transcript: “the US will become the CS, but leave the UR intact”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroethologist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching an animal go about its daily routine. Barely on speaking terms with Behavioural Neuroscientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroendocrinologist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly hormonal. Obsessed with how everything sloshing around the brain that isn’t a neurotransmitter affects brain cells. Believes a “raster plot” is a graph drawn by a Bob Marley fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular neuroscientist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applies the tools of close cousins the molecular biologist to the brain. Loves the stuff floating inside cells, especially proteins and complex chains of chemicals signalling to each other.

 &lt;p&gt;We are so proud and honored to serve the arXiv community who, despite the global turmoil caused by the COVID-19 crisis, are more committed than ever to advancing scientific research. At arXiv our commitment to improving the platform with changes large and small continues as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently held a survey to assess new incremental updates to the mobile-friendly display of the abstract page. First of all, we want to extend a huge &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thank you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to all of the survey participants. Participation levels were high and we really value your time and your insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our survey we asked participants to review the proposed abstract page on their mobile device and then rate its usability against the current live page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Survey comparison of the old and new layouts&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-596 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/04/abs-options-web-1024x917.jpg&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the main changes include reducing the height of the header, adding mobile-friendly navigation and search links, and moving the download button. We also made the citations section (not shown in the screenshots above) more user friendly on touch screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users overwhelmingly found the proposed abstract page style improved their experience on mobile devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, I prefer the new style: &lt;strong&gt;94.81% &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, I prefer the old style: &lt;strong&gt;5.19%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-597 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/04/abs-barchart-web.jpg&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users also provided valuable feedback on other aspects of the UI which we are cataloging to inform future updates. We will push these mobile-friendly edits to the live site this week, so if you access arXiv on your phone you’ll notice some changes on the abstract page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for helping us improve arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The arXiv NG team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to join our next user testing survey? From time to time arXiv sends out surveys, previews to new changes, and other testing opportunities to interested users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/user-testing&quot;&gt;To join our user testing group sign up here&lt;/a&gt;.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;Nearly 20 years of war following the events of September 11 has resulted in advances in military psychology that stand to improve the well-being of all people, military and civilian alike. The symbiotic relationship between psychology and the military traces back to World War I. With the advent of US involvement in the war, the army and navy had to select and train hundreds of thousands of new soldiers and sailors for increasingly technical jobs. Compared to nineteenth-century wars, World War I required military personnel to operate far more advanced and complicated equipment including aircraft, tanks, and communications systems. To match military personnel to jobs in which they would excel, the military turned to psychologists to develop new aptitude tests rapidly. The tests developed for the military vastly improved the reliability and validity of aptitude testing. Such testing became common in civilian institutions after the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, World War II stimulated psychologists to conduct further research on how to diagnose and treat combat stress and psychological injuries of war. With millions of Americans having served in the war, this knowledge provided a significant boost to clinical psychology. World War II also created a new area of psychology, human factors engineering. Engineers needed psychologists to help them understand the limits of human perceptual and cognitive capabilities in order to design ever more complex weapons and communications systems. The Vietnam War saw the emergence of the understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder, first studied among soldiers and veterans, but soon recognized to be a risk for anyone exposed to severe trauma. Our current understanding of PTSD, its causes, and how to treat it are due in no small measure to the efforts of military psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same manner, the war on terrorism has resulted in a renewed effort by military psychologists to better understand factors that enable military personnel to perform at their best, as well as to better understand suboptimal adjustment or pathology. This emerging research promises benefits to civilians as well. A great example is the military’s research on character and its links to individual and team performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive character traits like integrity, determination, and courage have long been identified as essential attributes of military personnel. The emergence of positive psychology in the late 1990s provided a new science-focused perspective on character among military personnel. The results of almost 20 years of research are now providing a clearer picture of the role of positive character in leading others in dangerous contexts. For example, trust — an essential element in leadership in any domain — is heavily dependent on the character traits of integrity, caring for others, and moral courage. Both research and practical leadership experience demonstrate the critical role of character in trust and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadets at the nation’s service academies live under an honor code that dictates they will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. Military affiliation trumps nationality when it comes to the ranking of top character strengths. In comparing US military academy cadets with Royal Norwegian Naval Academy cadets and US civilian college students, military psychologists discovered that US cadets were more similar to their Norwegian cadet counterparts than they were to US civilian college students. The strongest character attributes among the military cadets regardless of nationality were honesty, hope, bravery, persistence, and teamwork. For the US civilian college students, the highest strengths were kindness, sense of humor, honesty, and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army researchers have discovered strong links between individual character and personal adjustment and have developed a program to enhance positive character among its soldiers. Military psychologists have found that positive character traits such as hope and optimism, persistence, self-regulation, social intelligence, and leadership contribute to the emotional and social sense of well-being, and to a sense of meaning and purpose in life. Soldiers high in these and related character strengths are less vulnerable to combat stress, perform better at their jobs, and are more likely to remain in the military compared to those low in these strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on character provides just one of many intriguing examples of how military psychology continues to contribute to our knowledge of general psychology. After all, the challenges and stresses that military personnel face are far too easily found in other walks of life. Military research on both positive individual and organizational character have significant implications for how to optimize individual and team performance in law enforcement agencies, sports teams, schools, and in corporations. Thus, the efforts of military psychologists continue to provide insights into human behavior that stand to help us all to perform at our best and to live our lives to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featured photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@mentorofficial?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Vladislav Nikonov&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/military?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621459582/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/earth-day-at-50-episode-54-the-oxford-comment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Earth Day at 50: conservation, spirituality, and climate change [podcast]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/covid-19-and-employment-law-in-the-uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;COVID-19 and employment law in the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Jim and Kerry Kelly live in a small town in the rural Midwest. Their sons, Ben, six, and Ryan, twelve, attend the local public school. Their school district is always short staffed. The closest town is 40 miles away and the pay for teachers is abysmal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the district’s staffing has hit a critical low: Class size will have to be huge, and there’s limited money for aides who might help with the teaching load, which will further discourage teacher applications. The school board considers accepting underqualified teachers. Parents are up in arms. Teachers and principals are stressed. The situation comes to a head at a school board meeting that drags on past midnight with shouting, frustration, threats, and anger. But, it’s too important to back off. Children’s futures are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next week, the superintendent finds a possible solution. The state has money available to help school boards implement technology in qualified districts. The Kellys’ town qualifies. They can receive funds to buy robots to serve in the classrooms. The robots can assume some of the teaching load, improve teaching quality, and relieve the overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, this would have been unthinkable. Soulless machines educating our children? But, solutions are few, and the superintendent has found reports of success from other schools. He sells his plan well, and against all expectations, the school board agrees. The following fall, the Kelly kids, like all the kids in the district, have a robot in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the half-year mark, the school board reviews their decision. In six-year-old Ben’s class, the results are outstanding. Kids learn fast—pretty much as fast from the robot as from the human teacher. And, the kids like the interactions with the machines. The teacher can accomplish more and is less stressed in the process. Everyone is pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ryan’s class, at age eleven, has a far different experience. The robot used in their class is identical to the one in Ben’s class—very human-like. By January, the kids hate it. They call it names; they hit it; they learn little from it. By midyear, it sits in a corner, scorned by students and teacher alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scenario is fiction, but it reflects the real world. Many school districts are hurting for staff, and robots are entering the classroom. In Japan, Robovie speaks and teaches English with elementary school children, like Robosem does in Korea. In the United States, RUBI teaches children Finnish. Child-like robots are helping autistic children practice social interactions through imitation-teaching games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using robots as teachers makes some sense. Children learn much of their knowledge from others: parents, teachers, peers. Children trust that 8 × 8 = 64, that Earth is round, and that dinosaurs are extinct, not because they have uncovered these facts themselves but because reliable sources have told them so. Research shows that children are adapted to learn general knowledge from human communication. The phenomenon is known as “trust in testimony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, do children trust the testimony of robots? Does it matter if the robot behaves, responds, or even looks like a human? If children learn from a robot, do they learn in the same way they learn from a human teacher? Excellent questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that when children as young as preschool age learn from other people, they monitor their informants’ knowledge, expertise, and confidence. They remember whether a person has given them accurate information in the past. They also monitor an informant’s access to information: Did she see the thing she is telling me about? They attend to the person’s qualifications: Is he a knowledgeable adult or a naïve child?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly little is known about how and if children learn from robots. Because robots are machines, children could see them as infallible, like calculators or electronic dictionaries. If so, they might accept any information from a robot without considering if it is accurate. Or, children might see robots as a more fallible machine: a toaster that burns the toast, a virtual assistant that can give wrong or even outlandish answers or an alarm clock that goes off in the middle of the night. If so, they might resist a robot’s teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young children clearly can and do learn from robots, and they are appropriately choosy about the sort of robot teachers they accept. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190860974.001.0001/oso-9780190860974-chapter-8&quot;&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;also shows that young children are more likely to learn from and accept robot teachers that are older children—just like in Ben Kelly’s first grade classroom—and older children are less likely, even unlikely, to do so—like in Ryan Kelly’s sixth grade classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac Asimov’s book, &lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt;, is primarily about morality and robotics: how robots interact with humans for good or evil. Most of the stories revolve around the efforts of Dr. Susan Calvin, chief roboticist for the fictional U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, Incorporated (USRMM), the primary producer of advanced humanoid robots in the world. She worries about aberrant behavior of advanced robots, and she develops a new field, robopsychology, to help figure out what is going on in their electrical (“positronic”) brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All robots produced by USRMM are meant to be programmed with the “Three Laws of Robotics:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Asimov’s stories, flaws are found in the robots and their prototypes. These lead to robots imploding, harming people, and in one key case, killing a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt; stories have spawned numerous spin-offs, continuations, and commentaries. A 2004 episode of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; (titled “I, D’oh Bot”) featured a robot boxer named Smashius Clay. Smashius, self-defeatingly, follows all of Asimov’s three laws and loses to every human he fights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twentieth Century Fox 2004 film, &lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt;, starred Will Smith as detective Dell Spooner of the 2035 Chicago police department. Dell investigates a murder of the roboticist Dr. Alfred Lanning, which may have been at the hand of a USRMM robot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, robots like Robovie (or NAO or RUBI or other robots designed to interact with adults or with children) don’t have moral codes programmed in. But then, they also don’t have anything like full positronic machine intelligence. Conversely, we don’t have laws or codes about how to treat robots. For example, should a really human-like robot have rights? In November 2017, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sophia-robot-citizen-womens-rights-detriot-become-human-hanson-robotics&quot;&gt;granted a very human-looking robot, Sophia, citizenship&lt;/a&gt;. This set off an uproar about rights among women in Saudi Arabia. For example, Saudi women must veil their faces when they are in public; Sophia appeared in public and on TV without a veil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, robot designers, parents, and teachers have become increasingly concerned that interactions with robots will promote antisocial behaviors. A hitchhiking robot who traveled a bit around Europe, taking pictures and carrying on conversations with other travelers, was vandalized and destroyed after several extended weeks in the United States. And, it’s easy to imagine a world where robots displace humans from jobs and so are attacked and sabotaged by those they’ve displaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that antisocial behaviors toward robots can be reduced by modifying the robots. Preschool children in a classroom comforted a robot with a hug and protected it from aggression when it started to cry after being damaged or played with too roughly. At least &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04837-001&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown that younger children say a robot should be treated fairly and should not be psychologically harmed after having conversed and played with the robot for fifteen minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, robots become a larger part of our lives. You can find robots in malls, hotels, assembly lines, hospitals and, of course, research labs. The National Robotics Initiative &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503641&quot;&gt;foresees a future&lt;/a&gt; in which “robots are as commonplace as today’s automobiles, computers, and cell phones. Robots will be found in homes, offices, hospitals, factories, farms, and mines; and in the air, on land, under water, and in space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And robots are becoming more and more present in the lives of children. They are already teaching children in classrooms and helping them in hospitals. Robovie is just one of many robots that have been manufactured in the last few years designed to be used with children–created to play games, answer questions, read stories, and even watch children unsupervised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unbridled production of hopefully child-friendly robots certainly needs more research. But, it’s clear that in some ways and at some ages children can successfully learn from robot teachers who actively interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image by Andy Kelly from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/0E_vhMVqL9g&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621138918/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/lessons-learnt-from-coronavirus-and-global-environmental-challenges/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lessons learnt from Coronavirus and global environmental challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-a-pandemic-could-save-the-environment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How a pandemic could save the environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/04/will-robots-really-take-our-jobs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Will robots really take our jobs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We know that your daily routines have probably changed due to COVID-19. Whether you’re keeping more distance between yourself and others, working from home more often, or feeling isolated by larger-scale shutdowns, it may take awhile for things to go back to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;During this time of uncertainty, we want you to know: we are here to support you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Without knowing at this point what the long-term impact will be of interrupted research projects, conferences, and teaching schedules, we’re trying to find out more about you and your unique situation so that we can provide you with the information you most want. Last week, we launched a survey for researchers to let us know how their work has changed in recent weeks and we wanted to share some of the preliminary results with you as we dig in deeper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;First, a couple of caveats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This survey data comes from an informal marketing poll surfaced through email and on our site beginning on March 27. The survey links are still available and we’re collecting new responses every day but the summary below is based off of responses received between March 27 and April 3 only.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We also posted a simplified version on our Twitter account to take the pulse from a broader community. Those data are not included in this summary but we saw very similar trends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Survey Structure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While the initial question was the same for each researcher who entered the survey, the second-tier question was tailored to their response from Question 1. Partial responses (results where researchers answered the first question only) are included in the breakdown below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-42953&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3-1024x436.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What’s the scale of the impact?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most researchers said their work was interrupted  in some way, either by restricted access to their labs, or a need to take personal time off. Only 7.2% of respondents reported that their lab was open and operating normally. Another 4.3% reported that their work is directly relevant to the outbreak and are actively investigating. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Of those few whose labs were operating normally, 33.3% were “very” concerned that they would see steeper closures in the next few days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_42952&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42952 size-full&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Response breakdown to Question #1. Total Responses: 54, 749&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In what ways are researchers able to continue their work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For those whose labs or institutions have been closed, many researchers have found a way to continue their work remotely (36.2%). Of those, 58.6% reported that their research, or elements of it, could be done without a lab, although 34.8% said they had to shift to something like protocol design or new analysis that would not require a lab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For the researchers who’ve had to change their focus (26%) or cancel fieldwork entirely (18%), writing and training have become the major focus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_42954&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42954 size-full&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Response breakdown for Question 2 for those who said they needed to cancel or shift the focus of their existing work&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As researchers’ needs change, so should the way we support them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serving authors on the front lines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For those respondents who have told us they are actively investigating research related to the coronavirus, speed matters more than anything else. At PLOS, we are fast-tracking all research related to COVID-19, the first studies of which we have already published and made available in our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/covid-19&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;COVID-19 collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; which surfaces research from across all PLOS Journals along with other relevant content. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redefining priorities for career advancement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A number of organizations have come together to support researchers during this time. For example,  the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) released a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/04/06/dora-statement-on-hiring-promotion-and-funding-decisions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; earlier this week,calling on research institutions and universities to evaluate their hiring, promotion, and funding decisions within the context of the broad-scale interruptions researchers are facing in their daily work. The statement specifically asks institutions to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Redefine their expectations for productivity in the wake of the present pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Communicate clearly to academics and researchers how they will modify research evaluation procedures for hiring, promotion, and tenure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS fully supports this appeal and urges all institutions and funders to join those who have already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5REApf-t-76UXh8TKAGoLlwy8WIMfSSyqCJbb5u9lA/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;taken action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and consider similar policies to let researchers know that their careers will not grind to a halt due to the impact of the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If COVID-19 has impacted your ability to continue reviewing, editing, or revising manuscripts in process at PLOS, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/03/a-message-to-our-community-regarding-covid-19/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;we encourage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; you to reach out to the journal for an extension so that you can take the time you need to focus on other concerns.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If there is another way we can help support the communication and discovery of research as your publishing needs change, please consider sharing your thoughts by emailing us at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:community@pos.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;community@plos.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; or by responding to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surveys.plos.org/s3/covid-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what to say when a friend is upset or stressed out can be a delicate balancing act. Sometimes the best route seems to be to offer advice and give practical suggestions as to how they should proceed; at other times, simply listening to what your friend has to say is by far the better option. But no matter your approach, ensuring that your friend feels validated is key, argue Xi Tian and colleagues in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/70/1/13/5739595?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Communication&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39448&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The study starts with a question many of us have pondered ourselves: why do some well-intentioned attempts at comfort come off as insensitive instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the question, the team asked 325 married adults to think of one person with whom they’d discussed their partner or marriage, and to imagine having a conversation with them about a recent argument they’d had with their spouse. They were then presented with one of six support messages, each of which was more or less person-centred — in other words, more or less willing to acknowledge and elaborate on the feelings of the upset person. Low person-centred messages focused on simply moving past the argument (e.g. “nobody is worth getting so worked up about… having an argument is not the worst thing that could happen to you”), whilst high person-centred messages were more engaged and acknowledged the individuals’ feelings (e.g. “you have every right to feel upset… it’s understandable you are stressed out”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants then rated the support messages on a number of measures, including how controlling and dominant, direct and clear, or logical and well-justified the messages were. They also reported whether they felt pressured by their friend, and indicated the extent to which they experienced psychological “reactance”: that is, how angry they were after reading the message, and how critical they felt of it. Finally, they rated how optimistic they would feel after receiving the message and how much their emotions would improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, low person-centred messages were not successful in helping people feel better about disputes with their partner, nor did they reduce emotional distress. These types of messages angered participants, and were also seen as domineering and lacked argument strength — in other words, they were neither convincing nor comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, high person-centred messages were associated with higher levels of emotional improvement, which the team puts down partly to the fact participants felt little or no threat to their freedom when responding to these messages (i.e. they didn’t feel pressured or controlled by their friend). There was also less emotional reactance to high person-centred messages — participants felt less angry, less critical and less likely to argue with their friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to the study: the messages participants received were, of course, fake, so the way they would feel about them in the context of a real conversation with a friend may differ from the artificial environment of the study. Future studies may also take into consideration the diversity of relationships and their social contexts — as the team notes, the majority of participants were in heterosexual relationships, in their first marriages and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will, of course, be times when you believe a friend really is overreacting — that they’re making a big deal over nothing. At times like these, the results of this study may be useful to keep in mind. If you want to make them feel comforted, acknowledging, not dismissing, what they’re feeling is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/70/1/13/5739595?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;How the Comforting Process Fails: Psychological Reactance to Support Messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/domestic-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an unprecedented global health emergency. At this writing, COVID-19 has affected more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/world-map.html&quot;&gt;173 countries&lt;/a&gt;, causing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200403-sitrep-74-covid-19-mp.pdf?sfvrsn=4e043d03_4&quot;&gt;972,303 infections and 50,322 deaths&lt;/a&gt;. Highly contagious, coronavirus spreads through human-to-human contact, with the number of infections doubling every three days. Neither vaccine nor cure exists for COVID-19, although several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins&quot;&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are underway. Prevention is cure, and physical distancing is the most effective prevention endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandatory quarantines or non-mandatory stay-at-home advisories are in effect in countries around the world, affecting one third of the global population. Homebound, people are physically distant from wider social networks: school-age children are receiving homeschooling; college students are attending online classes from home; non-essential service employees are working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, one in three women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and 4-12% during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11833 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/300px-Purple_ribbon.svg_-191x300.png&quot; width=&quot;191&quot; /&gt;Unfortunately, stay-at-home may not mean safer-at-home for millions of women worldwide. Home is where women experience violence in the hands of their spouses or extended family members. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17027732&quot;&gt;Domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;, including physical, sexual, reproductive, emotional, or economic, is a health and human rights violation, leading to mental and physical health consequences, including death. Globally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/9789241564625/en/&quot;&gt;one in three women&lt;/a&gt; experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70764/WHO_RHR_11.35_eng.pdf?sequence=1&quot;&gt;4-12% &lt;/a&gt;during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic violence can be an unintended consequence of COVID-19 lockdowns, which have been essential for suppressing the spread. Prior evidence makes it a possibility: domestic violence rates went up during &lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrvv/25/5/588&quot;&gt;emergencies&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/44126540?seq=1&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801210377649?casa_token=GjwbzDKcC64AAAAA:3Zy3qOkMZDtbf5AcFxAlmRNIGgvC13FAD6d6bdw9rRFnWYlcXpU6tRFV6Pa9o3sWX_PXclVWK-HC&quot;&gt;globally&lt;/a&gt;. High risk (stuck in home with abuser), low protection (socially distant from family, friends, neighbors, coworkers) makes it a probability. Indeed, frontline workers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns&quot;&gt;from a diverse set of countries&lt;/a&gt; and cultures, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-see-rise-domestic-violence-calls-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-n1176151&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/28/domestic-violence-cases-jump-30-during-lockdown-in-france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-violence/in-italy-support-groups-fear-lockdown-is-silencing-domestic-abuse-victims-idUSKBN21M0PM&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/COVID-19-Fears-of-Domestic-Violence-Rise-as-Millions-Confined-20200328-0009.html&quot;&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/rise-in-family-abuse-cases-in-australia-linked-to-covid-19&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/sharp-rise-in-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-outbreak/&quot;&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/277940&quot;&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://supchina.com/2020/03/24/covid-19-fuels-domestic-violence-in-china/&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/lockdown-and-the-surge-in-domestic-violence/&quot;&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/domestic-abuse-cases-rise-as-covid-19-lockdown-turns-into-captivity-for-many-women-819653.html&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/1652146/middle-east&quot;&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, have reported an increase in the number of calls to domestic-violence hotlines, or of police complaints. In absence of population-based estimates before and after COVID-19 lockdowns, existing reports are invaluable alternatives, indicating, at a minimum, an upswing in violence re-victimization, potentially globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, domestic violence happens in homosexual as well as heterosexual relationships. Violence can be perpetrated by both men and women against their partners of the same or opposite gender. However, men’s perpetration of violence against women is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/gender.pdf&quot;&gt;most common form&lt;/a&gt; of domestic violence worldwide, with consequences more intense, lingering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w24802&quot;&gt;across generations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventing a potential outbreak of domestic violence during an emergency seems plausible. Conceptually, programs found to be effective in preventing conditions triggering men’s perpetration of domestic violence are likely be effective in reducing domestic violence. I discuss three such conditions and programs. Intersecting vulnerabilities (younger age, poverty, lower education levels) increase women’s vulnerability to experiencing multiple violence-triggering conditions, simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-induced economic recession heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, COVID-induced economic recession, and consequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860387/&quot;&gt;livelihood loss&lt;/a&gt; by either or both partners, and subsequent financially stressful times leaving families with resource constraints for life essentials, or the need for rationing, heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration. Conversely, potential COVID-19 exposures through employment in essential services can be traumatic, triggering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-lockdown-domestic-violence.html&quot;&gt;marital conflicts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://behavioralscientist.org/the-cognitive-burden-of-poverty/&quot;&gt;Cognitive burdens&lt;/a&gt; (preoccupation with financial woes impedes &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11831&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/wallet-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;one’s ability to do the right thing; fear of disease exposure) make both partners vulnerable to violence perpetration; the higher social position of men make them more susceptible. The risk is greater for men holding traditional views on gender roles (feeling that they have failed as “the provider of the family,” and at-risk of losing power and control), growing up experiencing or watching violence (getting cues of action from “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Publications/WDR/WDR%202015/WDR-2015-Full-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;mental models&lt;/a&gt;” of conflict resolutions), or are engaged in &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.00994.x&quot;&gt;substance use&lt;/a&gt; (blurring judgement, misplaced priorities), compared to men with comparable levels of vulnerability and susceptibility but without such attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, disruptions in the operation of service-delivery institutions (e.g., schools; day care centers; restaurants; dry cleaners) and subsequent abrupt need for (primarily) women assuming significantly more roles than usual can result in women’s excessive workload, stress, anxiety, maladaptive coping including substance use, increasing their vulnerabilities to domestic violence (re)victimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, homebound for long, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/upshot/gender-roles-housework.html&quot;&gt;couples&lt;/a&gt;, even those more egalitarian, may experience increasing intensification or rebound of traditional gender roles and relations, with women, charged with caregiving among other domestic responsibilities, becoming the default target of blame for discomforts, inconveniences, or unmet needs. A prolonged, 24/7 stay at a proximity increases the use of household space and resources for meeting most daily-living essentials, increasing the frequency of interactions between intimate partners and, thereby, opportunities for marital conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for violence prevention and mitigation, the following three policies or programs seem promising. However, a broader, multisectoral approach to address women’s deprivation in terms of education, nutrition, healthcare, family planning or economic empowerment underlying women’s vulnerability to violence should be integrated into overall emergency preparedness efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a financial safety net (for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;amp;context=carsey&quot;&gt;unemployment insurance in the US&lt;/a&gt;, India’s direct unconditional cash transfers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-launches-mega-cash-transfer-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74975904.cms&quot;&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;, and poor households, etc.) will likely keep household’s overall consumption at a comparable level, enhancing women’s capacity for violence-risks management, and, thereb&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11829 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/domvio-256x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; /&gt;y, enhancing the safety of women and their children. Second, addressing factors that trigger violence during stressful times is key. For example, a ban on alcohol sales, limiting hours of alcohol sales, or limiting the volume sold per person, as appropriate in each context, will curb access to alcoholic beverages, reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms including violence against women and children. Third, easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints (i.e., abuser is nearby) and relocate (i.e., women can still practice physical distancing in shelters), significantly limiting the risk of violence re-victimization. To ensure easy access, countries must ensure: (a) adequate resources for domestic-violence services and shelters as an essential service; and (b) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/02/01/more-than-1-billion-women-lack-legal-protection-against-domestic-sexual-violence-finds-world-bank-study&quot;&gt;legal protection against domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in our common interest, as human beings and social and economic actors, to be serious about integrating domestic violence prevention and mitigation into COVID-19 preparedness and relief efforts. The alternative is unethical, keeping a blind eye to human right violations, and seems suboptimal: needing direct medical and mental health care services, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns&quot;&gt;global surge&lt;/a&gt; in domestic violence could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2013/03/07/putting-a-price-on-violence-against-women-and-girls&quot;&gt;costly&lt;/a&gt;, potentially compromising COVID-19 responses inside and outside the health sector.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein is often used as the ultimate inspirational figure in science: an untamed genius with an abundance of innate brilliance. The proliferation of memes and inspirational quotes about his allegedly underwhelming school performance only serves to highlight exactly how naturally brilliant he really was, succeeding against the odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it turns out, he might not be quite as inspiring as you think: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2020.1734006&quot;&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Basic and Applied Social Psychology, &lt;/em&gt;it may in fact be hard work, not innate genius, that really inspires people to get into STEM.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39443&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first study focused on two specific scientists: Einstein, who is generally viewed as a genius whose success came from his talent, and Edison, whose success is seen to have come from hard work — famously, it took him over one thousand attempts to successfully create the lightbulb. Danfei Hu from Penn State and colleagues gave 176 participants a story about either Einstein or Edison, both of which included details about struggles, challenges and setbacks the scientists had supposedly faced during their career (in fact, the stories for each scientist were exactly the same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants then filled in a survey to measure their views on talent and intelligence, rating how much they agreed with statements including “only geniuses can be good scientists”, “some people just aren’t cut out for science” and “you have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can’t do much to change it”. Participants then completed an apparently unconnected maths task, designed to investigate their approaches to problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the Edison condition were less likely to see exceptional talent as necessary for a scientist’s success, and slightly more likely to believe that intelligence was malleable or changeable. This group also performed better on the mathematical task, suggesting that they’d received a boost in motivation by reading about a scientist known for his work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at the impact of fame on motivation and inspiration, the team recruited 162 participants for a second study. Participants once again read one of two identical stories about a struggling scientist, half reading about Einstein and the other about Mark Johnson, a fictional scientist whom none of them had heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, participants who read about Mark Johnson were less likely to believe that innate genius or talent was necessary for success than those who read about Einstein — and they performed better in the maths test, too. This suggests that a non-famous scientist may in fact make for a more effective role model than a famous, “genius” scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study looked at all three scientists simultaneously: 288 participants read either about the struggles of Edison, Einstein or the non-famous scientist. Those who read about Einstein appeared less motivated than those who read about the non-famous scientist, while those who read about Edison were more motivated, suggesting that the two role models had opposite effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that being exposed to a stereotypically “genius” scientist makes people feel brilliance is a prerequisite to succeed — that it’s essential, rather than an additional benefit. As many people don’t particularly see themselves as innately brilliant, their performance — and their interest and motivation to do well in science — is therefore diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successes of someone like Edison, however, might seem more in reach — his example suggests that scientific successes are related more to effort and self-control than they are to genius, making people feel more inclined to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role models can play an important part in efforts to encourage a wider range of people to pursue STEM both educationally and professionally: female mentors, for example, have been shown to increase female students’ sense of belonging in engineering settings. Understanding what makes certain role models effective could therefore help this process considerably, allowing universities and other institutions to develop mentoring programmes that really help make STEM subjects more diverse and equal places to be.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 Nerd Food: Computational Finance, Part I: Introduction&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first part of what we hope will be a long series of articles exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantlib.org/&quot;&gt;QuantLib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine&quot;&gt;Open Source Risk Engine&lt;/a&gt; (ORE), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system&quot;&gt;libbitcoin&lt;/a&gt;and other interesting finance-related FOSS (Free and Open Source) projects. However, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a dull first post, as we need to clarify our objectives before we can jump into the fray. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I've been a software engineer in the financial sector for over fifteen years, I've always felt I lacked a &lt;i&gt;deep understanding&lt;/i&gt;of the foundational concepts that make up the domain. As a self-confessed reductionist, I find this state of affairs extremely uncomfortable, akin to hearing a continuous loop of David Hilbert's words: &lt;i&gt;wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1&quot; id=&quot;fnr.1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The situation &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2&quot; id=&quot;fnr.2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html&quot;&gt;other complex domains&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So that's that for the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;. But, just &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; exactly are we researching? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org038ff83&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org038ff83&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org038ff83&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain &quot;trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS&quot; - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when we lack competence to do so&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3&quot; id=&quot;fnr.3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours &quot;Computational Finance&quot;. Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/&quot;&gt;Wolfram's writings&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, &lt;i&gt;everything is interconnected with everything else&lt;/i&gt;, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let &lt;i&gt;taste&lt;/i&gt; be my guide&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4&quot; id=&quot;fnr.4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are &quot;intuitive&quot; boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5&quot; id=&quot;fnr.5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org81de0c9&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org81de0c9&quot;&gt;Audience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org81de0c9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target audience for this material is the fabled &lt;i&gt;homo developus&lt;/i&gt;, that non-existent &quot;standard developer&quot; - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the &quot;finance&quot; part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those &lt;i&gt;not in the know&lt;/i&gt;, so slowness is unavoidable&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6&quot; id=&quot;fnr.6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets &quot;plain&quot; software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org04a295b&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org04a295b&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org04a295b&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering &lt;i&gt;application&lt;/i&gt;perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our core belief is that an &lt;i&gt;average reader&lt;/i&gt; (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of &lt;i&gt;how things work&lt;/i&gt; just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/&quot;&gt;Experimental Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codingthematrix.com/&quot;&gt;Coding the Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org3d4740f&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org3d4740f&quot;&gt;Cryptos&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org3d4740f&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of &lt;i&gt;everything else&lt;/i&gt;. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as &lt;i&gt;cryptos&lt;/i&gt;, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the &quot;real&quot; world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs &lt;i&gt;vast amounts of data of the right kind&lt;/i&gt;. Lets elaborate further on this point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7&quot; id=&quot;fnr.7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a &lt;i&gt;simulated world&lt;/i&gt; - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for &quot;immersive&quot; exploration. In fact, the &lt;i&gt;very processes for data generation&lt;/i&gt; will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, generated data is not perfect - &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;realistic&lt;/i&gt; it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can &lt;i&gt;assume&lt;/i&gt; the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos &lt;i&gt;as if they were regular currencies&lt;/i&gt;, except where they are just &lt;i&gt;too different&lt;/i&gt; - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org92cf76f&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org92cf76f&quot;&gt;Non Goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org92cf76f&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you. Even when we discuss trading strategies and other similar topics, our focus is always on trying to understand how the machinery works rather than on how to make money with it. Similarly, if you are a quant or are trying to become one, you are probably better off reading the traditional books such as Hull or Wilmott rather than these posts, as our treatment of mathematics will be far too basic for your requirements. However, if you are an expert in this subject area, or if you find any mistakes please do point them out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orge684ba8&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;orge684ba8&quot;&gt;Legalese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orge684ba8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with anything to do with finance, we need to set out the standard disclaimers. To make sure these are seen, we shall add them to each post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;Legal Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the content, including source code, is either written by the author of the posts, or obtained from freely available sites in the internet, with suitable software licences.

 &lt;p&gt;As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; staff and leadership would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to our community of volunteers, as well as the authors submitting their work to &lt;a href=&quot;http://arXiv.org&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/moderators/&quot;&gt;180 moderators&lt;/a&gt;, representing 22 countries across the globe, have continued to sift through thousands of submissions, ensure quality, and post research on arxiv.org despite significant disruptions to their personal and professional lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” on January 30, 2020, more than 26,000 scholarly works have been announced on the site, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/covid19search&quot;&gt;many related to the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;. March 2020 was the second busiest month in arXiv history, with 14,415 new papers posted. This is a testament to the astounding effectiveness of arXiv’s moderators. It also reflects the incredible vibrancy of the global research community and the fact that the pursuit of knowledge continues despite the pandemic. We’re proud that arXiv is used extensively to share knowledge across disciplines and across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/scientific_ad_board&quot;&gt;Scientific&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board&quot;&gt;Member Advisory Boards&lt;/a&gt; also continue to honor their commitment to arXiv, meeting with the new executive director, corresponding via email, and contributing their perspectives on operations and aspirations for 2020 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at arXiv, our staff has been working remotely for several weeks now, like so many of our colleagues. And so it is from our home offices that, again, we thank our volunteers and share our gratitude for the strong arXiv community that remains connected during this difficult time. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring you’re well-informed before making a choice is, on the whole, a sensible thing to do. This is especially true of big decisions — just pretending you’ve read the terms and conditions of a new website might be okay, but we’re unlikely to be so lax about our health or finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could too &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; information lead us to make worse, not better, decisions? A study published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-0206-z&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that sometimes that might be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39433&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Min Zheng and colleagues were motivated by advances in machine learning that have increased the information available to feed into decision-making, particularly when it comes to models of cause and effect: these algorithms can reveal potential outcomes likely to happen from certain actions or inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to human decision-making, it’s unclear how useful such information is. Simply presenting causal information to people may not actually help them make decisions: as senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevens.edu/news/turns-out-there-such-thing-tmi-more-information-doesnt-necessarily-help-people-make-better&quot;&gt;Samantha Kleinberg says&lt;/a&gt;, “being accurate is not enough for information to be useful”. In particular, we don’t know how this information might interact with the knowledge and beliefs people already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial experiment tested how causal information influences the kinds of decisions we make in everyday life. The team presented 1,718 participants with a real world scenario and asked them to give advice on how they would approach it. Participants were told that Jane, a university fresher, wanted to avoid putting on weight but continue to have fun with her friends, and were asked what one thing she should do to achieve her goal: go for a half hour walk every weekend, maintain a healthy diet, avoid seeing her friends, or watch less TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third of the participants were given no extra information to help them answer the question, another third were given a text-based causal explanation of the impact of diet and regular exercise on weight loss, and the final third were given a simple causal diagram. Those in the latter two categories were also asked whether the causal explanations had been helpful or affected their answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_39435&quot; style=&quot;width: 670px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zheng et al 2020&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-39435&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;39435&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Zheng et al 2020&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zheng-et-al-2020.png?w=670&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zheng-et-al-2020.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zheng-et-al-2020.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;670,431&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/06/having-too-much-information-can-lead-us-to-make-worse-decisions/zheng-et-al-2020/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zheng-et-al-2020.png?w=845&quot; /&gt;Some participants saw causal information in the form of text or a diagram. &lt;em&gt;Via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-0206-z&quot;&gt;Zheng et al (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the no-information condition were highly accurate: 88.8% picked the correct answer (i.e. that Jane should maintain a healthy diet). But those in the two conditions provided with causal information performed &lt;em&gt;worse: &lt;/em&gt;82.7% got the correct answer with the text-based explanation, and 80.1% with the diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second experiment followed a similar method, except in this case the scenario was one that only some participants would have experience dealing with: the management of type 2 diabetes. Participants were asked whether it would be best for someone with diabetes to manage their condition through behaving as normal, through walking more, or by choosing a healthier dinner and going cycling. They were either given no information or a diagram showing the impact of exercise and healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When no causal information was given, participants with and without type 2 diabetes chose the right answer (i.e. choosing a healthy meal and going for a bike ride) at about the same rate. Additional causal information was useful for those without personal experience of diabetes, increasing accuracy to 86.6% — but when the type 2 diabetes group were given causal information, accuracy dropped to just 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, along with the results from the first experiment, suggests that causal diagrams themselves are not inherently useless: rather, their ability to improve our decision-making depends on our personal experience. When a situation is new to us, we can benefit from causal information, but when we are already familiar with it, this information can actually lead us to making worse decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team thinks this has something to do with our existing mental models. We don’t take causal information at face value, but instead our existing beliefs and experience influence our decisions. This can sometimes mean we don’t make the right choice: with extra information we can lose confidence and start second-guessing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final experiment confirmed these findings: when participants had personal experience with a topic, causal information reduced their accuracy, but in made-up scenarios, such as a question on alien mind reading, participants were able to use causal information to make accurate choices. “In situations where people do not have background knowledge, they become more confident with the new information and make better decisions,” says Kleinberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean that information uncovered by machine learning isn’t valuable — quite the contrary. But understanding what people already believe, and tailoring information to that, may be the best way to communicate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-0206-z&quot;&gt;How causal information affects decisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;Emotions seem by their very nature to defy scientific analysis. Private and evanescent, and yet powerful and determining, feelings resist systematic observation and measurement. We are lucky to catch a glimpse in a facial expression or inflection of speech. The emotions of animals are all the more difficult. Without words to communicate what might be in their minds or on their nerves, animals–ranging from the complex to the simple–remain nearly a closed emotional book for even the cleverest experiment. A century ago Robert Yerkes, then at Harvard, registered these frustrations. Little is “of more obvious importance scientifically than affection,” he wrote in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/details/introductiontop03yerkgoog/page/n7/mode/2up&quot;&gt;Introduction to Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, in 1911, but its study lags behind investigation of “cognitive consciousness.” Convenient as it might be to assume animals are machinelike anyway, our behavior in the laboratory, he observed earlier in his &lt;em&gt;Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology&lt;/em&gt; in 1906, betrays our logic. “Even those who claim that animals are automata do not treat them as such.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shrewd as Yerkes was about his specialty of animal behavior, he would have been puzzled by the idea that national loyalty influenced his science. His research ethos was empiricism: Infer conclusions from carefully collected facts. As he succinctly advised in 1904 in the same journal, “experiment much and speculate little.” Other Americans agreed. John B. Watson’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-as-the-behaviorist-views-it.html&quot;&gt;Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It&lt;/a&gt;” of 1913 proposed to make the field “purely objective” by jettisoning the “yoke of consciousness.” That a conscious mind exists at all, in Watson’s view, was mere supposition. It makes sense that it was the German-born émigré ornithologist, Ernst Mayr, who recognized the American devotion to practicality as a national bias. When his Dutch friend, Niko Tinbergen, planned lectures for a US tour in 1946, Mayr wrote to him that “American scientists do not care for too much speculation but like thorough analysis of observed phenomena.” Indeed, deficient experimentation and excessive theorizing became a polemical weapon in international debate. Intellectual precision was–and is–the mark of good science, but American investigators of animal sensibility once claimed it as their special national possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the danger of scientific myopia nurtured by pride is obvious, these Americans’ faith in their superior practice ironically became a path forward toward internationalism. Their zeal for conducting animal behavior experiments produced real insights into affective experience. They had something to contribute abroad. In the process, they traveled the world for fieldwork, made far-flung professional acquaintances, and opened the door to refugee scientists displaced by the twentieth century’s political turmoil. Scientific passion stoked nationalism, but also gradually undermined it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;354&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Racoon-180x105.jpg&quot; width=&quot;607&quot; /&gt;Researcher L.W. Cole works with a raccoon, 1905. Used with permission from Yale Library.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal experiments became one area of American expertise. Nonhuman subjects, by their very lack of language and inability to deceive in self-reports, were a perfect fit for a method based on external observation. The variety of species studied included the proverbial white rat, but many others as well. Although Yerkes spent three decades after World War I focused on primates, he had earlier measured learning in newts, frogs, mice, crows, and pigs. His colleague Edward Thorndike watched chicks, cats, and dogs escape from puzzle boxes, and Yerkes’s student L. W. Cole did the same with raccoons. So much scrutiny of animals expanded the researchers’ appreciation of their personalities. Intelligence, understood as skill acquisition, was the original question. Mood and temperament were annoyances. A tired rat knew where to find the bit of bread, but stopped running for it. It is not surprising that the emotions themselves eventually caught scientific interest. Donald Griffin rattled his field in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.rupress.org/catalog/book/question-animal-awareness&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Question of Animal Awareness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 1976 when he declared, against reigning local wisdom, that animals are conscious. They have “not only images and intentions, but also feelings, desires, hopes, fears.” His revolutionary claim was the endpoint, however, of a typical American career. Three decades before, Griffin discovered how bats maneuver in the dark by echolocation, a kind of intelligence. His wonder at the animal mind deepened over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, American scientists never had a monopoly on insight into animal behavior. The counterexample of Darwin is enough to deflate any sense of supremacy. Their enthusiasm for controlled animal experiments produced so many competent studies, however, that they may have had an outsized influence. One British book of 1915, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~assets.cambridge.org/97811076/26560/excerpt/9781107626560_excerpt.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigation of Mind in Animals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by E. M. Smith, borrowed nearly all of its illustrations from American publications. Although the Americans favored laboratory work for its rigor, they increasingly went into the field to witness the vast number of species in native habitats. Yerkes traveled to Senegal in 1929 in pursuit of great apes, and Griffin to Venezuela in 1952 to observe the nocturnal navigation of oilbirds. Often welcomed as respected authorities, they were also exposed to the world’s problems. Walter Cannon of Harvard celebrated “free intellectual intercourse without respect to national boundaries” in his plenary speech at the International Physiological Congress in Leningrad in 1935, published by the state press as &lt;em&gt;Chemical Transmission of Nerve Impulses&lt;/em&gt;. His trip by train from Vladivostok to reach the meeting, however, was a sobering political lesson. Seeing prisoners laboring at gunpoint along the tracks in Siberia made for “a queer kind of horror that seizes you now and then,” his wife Cornelia wrote of the trip. Cannon may well not have had immediate doubts about the virtues of his own country, but he surely registered the pressures of nationalism at the borders of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Scientist-180x122.jpg&quot; width=&quot;587&quot; /&gt;Scientist C. R. Carpenter setting up equipment in Thailand in 1937 to record gibbon calls. Used with permission from Penn State Library.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;World War II fully exposed the catastrophic cost of national arrogance. International science advanced in its wake. Supported by American colleagues, Mayr achieved US citizenship in 1950 after a decade of government surveillance as a suspect alien. Although the new politics of internationalism was influential, just as crucial was the internal dynamic of science to push its practitioners beyond parochialism. The same high standard that impelled these Americans to apprehend animals in all their complexity–including animal emotions–underwrote growing internationalism. Precisely because the American science of animal behavior was embedded in political life, it had the power to change minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/gorilla-monkey-animal-zoo-furry-3606809/&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/&quot;&gt;The surprising scientific value of national bias&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620767382/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fRacoon-180x105.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/earth-day-at-50-episode-54-the-oxford-comment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Earth Day at 50: conservation, spirituality, and climate change [podcast]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psycholinguists have taken a scientific approach to the creation of new swear words, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/building-the-perfect-profanity&quot;&gt;reports Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers identified the ideal words to pair with profanities in order to come up with colourful new insults. Sticking &lt;em&gt;-pig&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;-mouth&lt;/em&gt; to the end of your favoured swear word will probably have the desired effect, according to the work, while adding &lt;em&gt;-newspaper&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;-fireplace&lt;/em&gt; could leave your insult falling flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39424&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sense of smell is arguably the least appreciated of all our senses&lt;/strong&gt;. But despite this “anti-olfactory prejudice” we have a lot to learn about human perception from studying smell, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/why-might-it-be-easier-to-fool-your-eyes-than-your-nose&quot;&gt;argues Ann-Sophie Barwich&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are two kinds of bird that make their home in cities: big-brained birds that have few offspring, and small-brained ones that breed often. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s according to a recent study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/city-birds-big-brained-with-few-offspring-or-small-brained-with-a-lot/&quot;&gt;covered in a podcast&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Birds with more brain power have an advantage when it comes to finding food and avoiding dangers. But for those with small brains, &lt;span&gt;like pigeons,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; producing plenty of offspring means that the population can still survive even if some individuals die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it about social media that seems to make us so angry? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-social-media-makes-us-so-angry-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/&quot;&gt;Amy Fleming explores the research&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The former chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has called for psychedelic drugs like psilocybin to be rescheduled, to make it easier to conduct scientific research on them&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/ease-rules-on-use-of-psychedelic-drugs-in-research-urges-david-nutt?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&quot;&gt;reports Nicola Davis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. In an article in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30282-8#%20&quot;&gt;David Nutt and colleagues review&lt;/a&gt; recent evidence on the potential benefits of psychedelics for treating mental health disorders. But they also write that classifying the drugs as “Schedule 1” substances — meaning they have no medical value — makes it costly and more difficult to conduct this kind of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, in psychology-related coronavirus coverage this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-why-clapping-for-carers-feels-so-strangely-uplifting-135092&quot;&gt;Catherine Loveday explains why&lt;/a&gt; clapping with our neighbours in support of NHS workers was so uplifting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your life is feeling surreal right now, you’re not alone. Sudden change, a loss of routine, and being thrown into a completely new experience can all contribute to that sense of otherworldliness, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/why-life-during-a-pandemic-feels-so-surreal/&quot;&gt;writes Matt Simon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might the pandemic shift our norms, behaviours and attitudes? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200401-covid-19-how-fear-of-coronavirus-is-changing-our-psychology?ocid=ww.social.link.twitter&quot;&gt;David Robson explores the possibilities&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At &lt;em&gt;UnHerd&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2020/03/dont-trust-the-psychologists-on-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;Stuart Ritchie argues&lt;/a&gt; that in the current crisis, psychologists need to avoid giving unhelpful advice based on the results of small lab studies that may not generalise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<link href="https://xcorr.net/2020/04/02/scraping-webpages-with-developer-tools-and-selenium/"/>

		<updated>2020-04-02T16:41:42+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of interesting statistics you can do by scraping websites, whether it’s reading tables from Wikipedia, grabbing and aggregating climate change tables from government websites, or quantifying the exponential growth of covid-19 articles on Medium. Many of these pages will have easy-to-use methods to download the data in a develop-friendly format, for example CSV or JSON. For others, you’ll have to rely on scraping web pages, an ancient, dark art. In this article, I’ll introduce you to some of the tools of the trade to do so in Python.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Identifying targets with developer tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Chrome and Firefox have developer tools (Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I). These tools allow you:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visualize the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS behind a webpage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See the traffic between your browser and the internet, include late http requests triggered by JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execute custom JavaScript that can read and modify the DOM of a webpage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify where a particular UI element is created in the page’s HTML&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These can help you identify which part of a page you need to scrape. Let’s say, for instance, that we want to find out how the top article of a major news website changes as a function of time during a time of crisis (as of now, covid-19). Perhaps we’ll want to retroactively run an analysis of the sentiment behind the headline, the focus (health, business, etc.), the frequency of updates, or of how these headers co-vary with numbers released by different governments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I’ll use the New York Times as the example webpage. What we’d like is to grab, every half-hour, the title of the biggest headline. With developer tools, I can easily use the Picker tool (Ctrl+Shift+C) to highlight the biggest headline on the page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7487&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7487&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;scraping&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;3070,1752&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/scraping/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I find that the biggest headline is a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; with a class name of &lt;code&gt;balancedHeadline&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s look at how we can grab this information with Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Selenium: remote control browsers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selenium.dev/&quot;&gt;The method I’ll showcase here uses Selenium&lt;/a&gt;: we use a headless browser (that is, an instance of Firefox or Chrome that’s running “invisibly”) that navigates to the website we care about. Once on the webpage, we can inject javascript, simulate clicks or manipulate the DOM to get to the information we need. This is a rather heavyweight solution compared to, say, using &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to grab the data and parsing it with &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However, the big advantage we get is that the headless browser actually runs the javascript on the page and loads all the extra assets – it’s literally like a person navigating to the website. Sometimes, it can be the only solution, especially if the information we need:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is dynamically loaded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is hidden behind authentication layers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;requires emulating clicks and interacting with JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Python, we can easily install Selenium with:`&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;pip install selenium&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we’ll need to install a WebDriver – this will allow your favorite web browser to be manipulated via Python. Here I installed the Firefox webdriver on the Ubuntu platform. &lt;a href=&quot;https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html&quot;&gt;I followed the instructions here on the Selenium website,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases&quot;&gt;downloading the gecko webdriver&lt;/a&gt; and extracting the binary to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;. You can check that you’ve done the installation by running a tiny bit of Python:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')

&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Running this code opens up Firefox and navigates to the website. Notice the unusual appearance of the browser: the url bar is a different color than usual, and there’s a robot icon next to the address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7477&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7477&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;nytimes-robot&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2176,192&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/nytimes-robot/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723&quot; /&gt;A remote-controlled version of Firefox&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can grab the information in at least a couple of ways: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could inject some Javascript into the page and use   &lt;code&gt;document.querySelectorAll(&quot;span.balancedHeadline&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; to grab the headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could read the DOM to find the right span&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the second method:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
print(element.text)
driver.quit()
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Running headless and automating&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the explicit window is useful for debugging, if you want to run this script every half-hour, you’ll want to run this in a headless browser. A headless browser doesn’t display a window, so it won’t pop up over your other windowsand capture your inputs. In addition, we’ll want to save the data to disk, which we can easily accomplish like so:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/top_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('&quot;' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '&quot;,&quot;' + element.text + '&quot;\n')
driver.quit()
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Cron job&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All that’s left now is to set up a cron job to run this script every 15 minutes. First, we’ll need a shell file. We could run python directly, but I installed selenium inside of a special conda environment called &lt;code&gt;headless-browser&lt;/code&gt;, so my shell file activates this environment before, like so:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
source /home/pmin/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
conda activate headless-browser &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
python /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.py
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I saved this file as &lt;code&gt;/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh&lt;/code&gt;. Running  &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;, I added an entry that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;# m h  dom mon dow   command
*/15 * * * * /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 /var/log/grab-headline.log
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crontab.guru/&quot;&gt;You can use this website&lt;/a&gt; to figure out what incantations to give to cron for different schedules. I also captured any output or error into an error log. If you don’t want to have to leave your computer on all the time to do this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating&quot;&gt;you can run cron jobs inside of a cloud service&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final tweak we’ll need to deal with is authenticating. Sometimes the website we’re trying to scrape requires us to be logged in. It’s possible for the headless browser to use the same cookies and credentials as the regular browser you use. To do so, you need to locate the name of the default profile in Firefox. Locate a directory that finished with &lt;code&gt;.default&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In my case, I found a directory called &lt;code&gt;lasd74g9.default&lt;/code&gt;. Putting everything together, here’s my final script:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;import datetime

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

profile = profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(profile_directory='/home/pmin/.mozilla/firefox/lasd74g9.default')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile, options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grim_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('&quot;' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '&quot;,&quot;' + element.text + '&quot;\n')
driver.quit()

&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine going to sit in a room with a violent, imprisoned psychopath and having a chat about what you both like to eat. (It’s impossible not to think of liver, fava beans and Chianti, isn’t it….?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what one researcher did recently in Germany. But the purpose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17706-001&quot;&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, reported in &lt;em&gt;Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t to gather data on criminal psychopaths’ dining preferences, but rather on how they make — or don’t make — eye contact during a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first study to explore psychopaths’ eye movements in a naturalistic setting. And it reveals that prisoners who scored highly on one aspect of psychopathy, in particular, were much less likely to look at the interviewer’s eyes. This finding not only helps with understanding how psychopathy develops, but also suggests that finding ways to encourage at-risk children to make more eye contact might be a useful intervention, argue Nina Gehrer at the University of Tübingen and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39418&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The team studied 30 men who had been convicted of serious crimes (including murder, rape and hostage-taking) and who were incarcerated in two institutions in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One researcher led all the interactions, which were divided into talking and listening stages. For one minute, the participant listened while the researcher talked about one of three neutral topics (eating habits/food, job/work or typical daily routine). Then, after a brief exchange on the topic, the second stage began: the participant talked for about a minute on the same topic. This was then repeated for the other two topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout both stages, the experimenter maintained eye contact (this was later verified by two independent raters). And at all times, the prisoner wore an eye-tracking headset. This allowed the team to monitor where they were looking while they were listening and talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the study, the team divided the face into two sections: the eyes and the philtrum (the nose and mouth region). They then examined whether time spent looking at the eyes or philtrum correlated with the participants’ scores on the PCL-R, a standard psychopathy assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy is generally thought to have four facets, or components: manipulating other people, affective impairments (deficits in feeling emotion and empathy and in showing remorse or guilt), having an erratic lifestyle and demonstrating antisocial behaviour. Each of these is measured within the PCL-R. And the team found that during both listening and talking, prisoners with higher affective psychopathy scores made less eye contact. “These results are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current theories about how psychopathy develops assume that a failure to view important social cues (from the eyes, especially) is a key factor. For children who go on to be diagnosed with psychopathy, there’s evidence that emotion-related impairments emerge early, in the form of callous unemotional traits. There’s some evidence that young children who pay less attention to other people’s eyes are more likely to develop these traits, the researchers note. Now that this link has been found for adult, criminal psychopaths, this suggests that eye contact, or rather a lack of it, could be important for understanding the development of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to the study, however. The number of participants was quite small, and all were men. The researchers themselves call for a replication before any firm conclusions can be drawn. It will also be important to investigate whether it’s possible to fix this particular deficit in eye contact, and, if so, whether that reduces the risk of developing emotion-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To date, evidence for lasting changes in eye gaze through social attention bias modification training is still elusive,” they note. “Thus, these promising approaches and further opportunities that target impaired eye contact need to be further investigated and enhanced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17706-001?CheckAccess=1&quot;&gt;Eye contact during live social interaction in incarcerated psychopathic offenders.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/snack-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health bodies have suggested that tobacco-style HWLs should be considered for application to alcohol and high calorie snack products. However, evidence for their potential usefulness in these contexts &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/jt52m/&quot;&gt;is limited&lt;/a&gt;, with prior research typically focusing on sugary drinks, or using smaller or less representative samples. This led us to run two large-scale studies in general populations to examine the potential effectiveness and acceptability of image-and-text HWLs on alcohol and snack foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our studies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two separate online studies we asked participants to rate different image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks (Alcohol study, with 5,528 participants) and energy-dense snacks (Food study, with 4,618 participants). To take part, participants for the Alcohol study had to consume either beer or wine at least once a week, &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11822 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-157x300.png&quot; width=&quot;157&quot; /&gt;and in the Food study participants consumed biscuits, cake, crisps or chocolate at least once a week, and liked chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants viewed and rated one of 21 image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks or one of 18 image-and-text HWLs on high calorie snacks. Just like on cigarette packs, the HWLs showed an image of a disease relating to excess consumption of alcohol or high calorie snacks, alongside a text warning statement. For Alcohol the diseases depicted were bowel, breast, liver and non-specified cancers, heart disease, liver cirrhosis and liver disease, while for Food, the conditions were bowel and non-specified cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked how afraid, worried, uncomfortable or disgusted the label made them feel, and to rate their desire to consume the labelled product. They were also asked how strongly they supported putting the HWL on alcoholic drinks or high calorie snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11812&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Alcohol study: we found that HWLs on alcoholic drinks depicting bowel cancer were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and the lowest desire to consume the product. They were also considered the least acceptable for use by participants. In general, few of the alcohol HWLs were considered acceptable, with only three out of 21 rated at least somewhat acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food study: HWLs on high-density snacks depicting bowel cancer, followed by those depicting non-specific cancer, were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and lowest desire to consume the product, with those depicting bowel cancer again considered to be the least acceptable. HWLs on energy-dense snacks were judged on average more acceptable than those on alcohol, with 13 out of 18 snack HWLs rated as at least somewhat acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also conducted a content analysis of free-text comments that some participants provided at the end of the study. Two key themes emerged– the acceptability of HWLs on these products, and their perceived effectiveness. Within these themes, comments touched on several pertinent issues, including the believability of the labels, whether people would avoid looking at them or become desensitized to them, whether they were appropriate to use, and whether participants thought they would affect their thoughts or behaviours in relation to these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, while a wide range of views were expressed, the majority of responses expressed negative views of the possible use of such labels. It is plausible, however, that those who chose to leave a comment at the end of the study were those with more extreme opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are our results surprising?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of potential effectiveness, we found that for both alcoholic drinks and high calorie snacks, HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions and resulted in the lowest desire to consume the product they were applied to. This is consistent with previous research on alcohol labeling which has found bowel-cancer HWLs to be particularly effective. It is notable that this is similarly the case in the context of snack foods, where to our knowledge these warnings have not been tested before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11817 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/choc-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The finding that HWLs may be judged to be relatively more acceptable to use on snack foods than on alcohol could appear surprising. This could be due to heightened public awareness of the health consequences of excess energy intake and obesity, particularly in children. The content analysis (albeit based on a small subset of participants) suggested a mainly negative reaction to these labels on these products. Again, this is perhaps not surprising given that the study sample were people who regularly consumed the target products, and interventions which affect us directly are usually less supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that labels depicting bowel cancer may have the greatest potential for reducing alcohol and snack food selection and consumption. However, while bowel cancer HWLs had the greatest impact on people, they were also rated as the least acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study could not, however, demonstrate whether these labels are likely effective in actually changing behavior. The studies did not include a measure of actual behavior, and there was no control group to compare against. The studies were also conducted online and responses may differ when HWLs are applied to physical products in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experimental studies are now needed to directly assess the potential effectiveness of health warning labels to reduce selection and consumption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/rv2p6/&quot;&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/zyca2/&quot;&gt;energy-dense snacks&lt;/a&gt;. Studies in field and naturalistic laboratory settings will enable us to examine whether these labels are likely to be effective in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Anna Dumituru will talk about her project named &quot;Cyberspecies Proximity&quot; on which she is working together with Alex May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberspecies Proximity explores what it will mean to share our sidewalks, elevators and transport systems in close proximity with mobile intelligent robots. The work challenges audiences to confront the technological, ethical, and societal questions raised by the advent of urban socially-aware robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic artwork combines the way-finding technologies of delivery and maintenance robots with an ability to communicate non-verbally, and to manipulate our emotions through body-language. The robot is able to move around an exhibition space using a predefined map created using SLAM technology. It reacts and responds to the body language of audience members through a multi-layered face, skeleton and movement tracking algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small and fragile humanoid form is dressed in the clothes of a worker, its frail and insignificant body reminds us of the social groups that will be most affected by future automation. The robot’s head and hands are made from 3D printed grey PLA and it intentionally avoids categorisations of race and gender. The project forces us to consider issues of ownership of public spaces as well as the broader ethical implications of how we design robots and behave towards them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberspecies Proximity is a project by Anna Dumitriu and Alex May, created in collaboration with the Human Robot Co-Mobility Project of the New Technologies Team at Schindler. The project was supported by a Vertigo STARTS Residency, and the artwork was programmed in C++ and FUGIO, the Open Source Visual Programming System created by Alex May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTICE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to current unusual circumstances, this Journal Club will be held online as a conference on 8COM0108-0000-2019 module. In order to attend, you must be a member of that module. The conference room will be created on Friday and all of the module members will be notified about that with an email. Once the conference is created and started, module members will be able to join it by visiting the module website on Canvas, and then selecting &quot;Conferences&quot; section. Any queries should be directed to Emil Dmitruk via email (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:e.dmitruk@herts.ac.uk&quot;&gt;e.dmitruk@herts.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; 03/04/2020 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 16:00 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: Online conference on 8COM0108-0000-2019 module- more details will be announced on Biocomputation Slack group.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how high your &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/09/more-time-spent-abroad-increases-self-concept-clarity-confidence-in-and-clarity-about-who-you-are/&quot;&gt;self-confidence&lt;/a&gt;, it’s likely that you have certain traits you’d change given the opportunity: maybe you’d turn down your anxiety, feel more outgoing in company, or be a bit less lazy. One 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216637840&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 78% of people wanted to better embody at least one of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, agreeableness, or openness to experience), so the desire to change who you are is not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are we so keen to change how moral we are? That is, how concerned are we really about being a good or bad person? A new study &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that we’d rather spend time improving those parts of us that aren’t morally relevant, with traits like honesty, compassion and fairness taking a back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39410&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jessie Sun from the University of California, Davis, and Geoffrey Goodwin from the University of Pennsylvania asked two groups comprising a total of 800 participants to fill in an online survey, in which they self-reported their personality traits. The first set of questions was based on the Big Five personality domains, while the second looked at moral traits, with questions measuring general morality as well as honesty, fairness, loyalty and purity. Participants also indicated how much they wanted to change on each of these personality and moral traits, responding to statements like “I want to be helpful and unselfish with others”, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also nominated four “informants” who knew them well. These informants rated their friend’s traits and reported what changes they’d like to see in the friend’s personality and moral character. Informants also selected the top three changes they’d like to see in their friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants most wanted to change their non-moral personality traits, particularly those relating to negative emotions: they wanted to reduce anxiety, depression, emotional volatility and anger. Creativity, productivity and sociability were the most desired traits, while moral traits such as honesty, loyalty and fairness took a back seat. And, overall, participants showed a weaker desire to change moral traits than non-morally relevant personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preference was even more striking when the researchers considered the top three desired changes for each participant. In one of the groups, 48% of participants reported that becoming less anxious was one of their top three priorities, with 44% wanting to become less depressed. Desire for increased sociability and productivity, and reduced emotional volatility, also commonly made it to the top. But moral improvements were not prioritised: a desire to become more compassionate made the top three goals of just 9% of participants, and only 3% counted a goal to become more generally moral among their top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern also emerged across the participants’ “informants”, who also expressed very little desire to change their friends’ moral traits and were likely to select goals that closely matched those picked by participants . The informants also wanted their friends to change less than the participants did themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern of results didn’t just come about because participants already saw themselves as particularly moral, the researchers argue. Instead, some of it may be down to self-interest: we’re more motivated to change in ways that improve our own sense of well-being, in other words. Being less depressed has an obvious and immediate impact on our lives; being “more moral” does not come with such straightforward benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although self-interest doesn’t sound like a particularly noble motivator, the fact that friends also seemed to prioritise the participants’ personal well-being is somewhat more cheering. The friends seemed to choose desired changes not by how “good” or “bad” they were likely to make the target, but by how likely they were to make their life better or happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also suggested a supreme confidence in our own moral superiority: we frequently believe we are more honest and trustworthy than others. In some cases, this may be true. But we could also benefit from thinking harder about our possession of these qualities when it’s time for self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;Do People Want to Be More Moral?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Biology_blog-image_1-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;From its launch in 2003, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; quickly established itself as PLOS’ flagship journal in the life sciences–a model of Open Access and a catalyst for change in scholarly publishing as well as a leading publication for the life sciences. Today, we’re announcing the beginning of a new vision for the journal which builds upon its earlier successes and pushes boundaries even further to promote Open Science and excellence in publishing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We had considered holding back this announcement while so many of us are grappling with the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, we view it as our duty as publishers, now and in the long term, to accelerate the path to publication and increase transparent research practices. We believe the changes to the scope and new article types on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;outlined below, will help researchers in the life sciences rapidly share their early findings and preregister their studies, and may prove to be particularly useful in these difficult times.. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To lead this new phase for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, we are also fortunate to welcome a talented and passionate new Editor-in-Chief, Nonia Pariente. Welcome, Nonia! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Nonia_new-Bio-editor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nonia Pariente, PLOS Biology Editor-in-Chief&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-42876 size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Nonia_new-Bio-editor-150x150.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“I’m very excited to take on this new role. PLOS Biology has a very strong reputation and an inspiring vision. I am passionate about broadening its reach to all of the Life Sciences communities and strengthening its position in the publishing landscape. All important advances in every area of biology should feel they have a home in PLOS Biology”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px;&quot;&gt;— Nonia Pariente, PLOS Biology Editor-in-Chief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pushing Boundaries in Service of Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When the journal launched, Open Access was an experimental publishing option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; proved that being highly selective and Open Access were perfectly compatible, aligning all the benefits of immediate and global accessibility with impactful research. Our aim has always been to challenge the status quo in scientific communication in order to better meet researchers’ needs. With our past experience to guide us, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is setting up a framework for assessment and publication that better aligns with the process of scientific inquiry itself, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Redefined selectivity criteria which will emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its execution; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A preregistration option offering peer review of the study design, with guaranteed publication of the final research article–regardless of the results–for accepted protocols;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Introduction of two linked article types, Discovery Reports and Update Articles, which enable researchers to report on ongoing work as their research develops and new information becomes available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Combined with the existing criteria around openness of research data, a preprint deposition workflow, and the option for authors to publish their peer review history, these changes are part of PLOS’ larger goals to transform scientific communication in a way that empowers researchers to choose Open Science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surfacing the importance of the entire research process, not just results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As we’ve reflected on more than fifteen years of experience at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and considered the publishing landscape, we acknowledge that publishing in highly selective journals remains an imperative for many researchers. The typical criteria used to select articles, however, continue to focus on novelty and perceived importance of the research results. As such, they continue to nurture a perverse system of incentives in which it matters to be first and to have an exciting headline–much less to be right and to have results that stand robustly to the test of time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;has already started addressing this challenge by giving a premium to transparency and access to underlying data, methodology and reagents, to enhance reproducibility. By introducing its ‘scooping policy’ through which novelty is not a disqualifying criteria within six months of an initial report. By opening up its peer review process to give context to decisions, as well as publishing valuable studies with clearly stated caveats when the consensus among reviewers is unclear. And even by asking authors to remove speculative results to reduce the hype that they sometimes feel pressured to provide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; will remain a selective journal–don’t take me wrong. But in its selection process, the journal now seeks to more systematically emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its approach and execution, before considering the importance of the results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new preregistration workflow, in addition to all the benefits it offers for reducing bias in experimentation and reporting, is also meant to encourage researchers to undertake important and well-designed studies with uncertain outcomes instead of censoring their research ideas based on the odds of publication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new linked article types will allow researchers to share their work more quickly, and to more effectively separate exploratory research during which they generate hypotheses (to be published as a Discovery Report) from its confirmatory phases, during which the hypothesis is further tested and new insights generated (to be linked as an Update Article). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome, Nonia Pariente!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Of course, none of this would be possible without a strong underlying editorial strategy. Joining our highly experienced team of staff editors, Nonia officially came on board earlier this month as Editor-in-Chief and is eager to get started on these new initiatives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“Since I started editing, and definitely as I have grown throughout my career as Chief Editor of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and now as Editor-in-Chief of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, my goal has been to help science advance and to help scientists communicate their stories… I think what makes PLOS Biology and PLOS in general stand out is that it is an organization that was founded with the goal and drive to innovate the process of scientific publication for the benefit of scientists and scientific advance. Thinking outside the box is almost an obligation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Please take a moment to get to know Nonia through her introduction on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2020/03/31/meet-plos-biologys-new-editor-in-chief-nonia-pariente/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Biologue blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and read more about her vision for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000707&quot;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The scope and importance of this work is really too big for one post, so our team will be providing more details over the next few weeks with updates to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/biologue/&quot;&gt;this space&lt;/a&gt;. These new article types are immediately available to submitting authors and you can find more details on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/journal-information&quot;&gt;Journal Information&lt;/a&gt; page of our site.

 &lt;p&gt;Today &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; added to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 papers since we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;fast-tracking submissions on January 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230405&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by Constantinos Siettos from the Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy and colleagues. The authors used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model with data between January 11 and February 10, 2020 and estimated key epidemiological parameters up until February 29. With these parameters, they forecasted that between 80,000 and 160,000 people would be infected by February 29 – in fact, around 84,000 are known to have become infected in this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Siettos notes, “This is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach that has provided relatively accurate three- week-ahead forecasts. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach suggesting that the actual number of the infections in the total population is of the order of twenty times more than those reported, and that the mortality rate in the total population is about ~0.15% i.e. significantly less than reported 2-3%.Our findings imply that for the case of Hubei (with a 60m population), around 2%-3% of the total population in Hubei has been actually infected by coronavirus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science leaders have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf&quot;&gt;recently requested&lt;/a&gt; that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable&quot;&gt;already supports&lt;/a&gt;, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push &lt;u&gt;all &lt;/u&gt;PLOS content to PubMed Central. We are also forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are  compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/a&gt; as they publish. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks to also consider posting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/a&gt;.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/search/title%3Acoronovirus%2Bwuhan%2B2019-nCoV%20title_flags%3Amatch-any%20jcode%3Amedrxiv%7C%7Cbiorxiv%20numresults%3A10%20sort%3Arelevance-rank%20format_result%3Astandard&quot;&gt;search link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/sweets-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are your kids addicted to sugar? &lt;/em&gt;Children between the ages of 2 and 18 should eat less than six teaspoons of added sugar per day on average. This adds up to around &lt;strong&gt;25 grams&lt;/strong&gt; of sugar. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england&quot;&gt;Public Health England&lt;/a&gt; (PHE) children consume much more sugar than recommended; this equals around eight excess sugar cubes a day or &lt;strong&gt;2,800 excess&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sugar&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cubes&lt;/strong&gt; per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has instigated the ‘sugar smart’ campaign led by PHE which is aimed at raising awareness of the amount of sugars in foods and drinks and to encourage parents to reduce their children’s sugar consumption. ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/change4life&quot;&gt;Change4life&lt;/a&gt;‘ is England’s first national social marketing campaign, promoting the following the slogan “Eat Well, Move More, Live Longer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Change4Life Sugar Smart campaign was launched on January 4th 2016. TV, billboard and digital advertising ran for six weeks to support the campaign. A Sugar Smart app was available for parents to download free of charge. The app enabled users to scan barcodes on food and drink packaging to find out how many grams of total sugars were contained in the product; depicted in sugar cubes, to help consumers visualize the amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8422-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; aimed to determine whether the campaign was effective in altering dietary behavior, by assessing any impact of the campaign on sugar intake among children aged 5-11 years. This included looking into the parental perceptions of the campaign and exploring barriers related to reducing sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents/guardians were asked to report their child’s dietary intake; telephone interviews were also conducted. This covered a range of topics including understanding of the general change4life message, the impact of sugar on health and family and social barriers experienced whilst trying to reduce children’s sugar intake. Findings indicate that parents often feel confused over the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“[The children] thought because they couldn’t have sugar, they couldn’t have fruit and it was saying that sugar was bad, so we had to sort of explain that it’s not all bad; it’s just different types.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the campaign, many parents reported that they tried to switch out unhealthy food for a healthier version and reducing portion sizes, however, the largest barrier included time constraints due to a fast paced life style and the easy availability of sweet treats which led to increased leniency; for example, pudding at school or temptation in the local supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You get tired and sometimes you go, “oh, just eat it then”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was found that the health marketing campaign raised awareness of sugar in food and drinks in both parents and children, impacting food consumption in families. Sugar smart campaigns are likely to have a positive influence on reducing sugar consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Targeting the parents:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concludes that a health marketing campaign aimed at both parents and children has a positive impact in reducing sugar intake, however, reductions in sugars are not always sustained long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents want to reduce their child’s sugar intake, but societal barriers as well as confusion over aspects of the diet to change often hamper efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the campaign was successful in raising awareness amongst both parents and children. The findings suggest that further education is required when it comes to different types of sugar and food labeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future campaigns should continue to target the parents, which in turn will have a knock on effect on reducing sugar consumption in the young. In the future campaigns should focus on combatting long term sugar reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At least since the philosophers of ancient Greece, scholars have pointed out the analogy between madness (psychosis) and dreaming…” So begins a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230212&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt;, that seems to shore up that analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams and psychotic hallucinations do have things in common. They both feature perceptual sensations that seem real, but which are conjured up by our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also differences. While dreams are known to be highly visual, psychotic hallucinations are primarily auditory. They generally involve hearing things that aren’t real rather than seeing things that don’t exist. And this difference is an important reason why “the idea of dreaming as a model for psychosis has remained speculative and controversial,” write Roar Fosse of the Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway, and Frank Larøi of the Norwegian Centre of Excellence for Mental Disorders Research at the University of Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to date, there’s been very little investigation into perceptions of sounds in dreams, the pair reports. And now they have data suggesting that, in fact, auditory perceptions are common. If this is the case, the links between psychotic experiences and dreams may be stronger than has been recently supposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39407&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Fosse and Larøi used social networks and a psychology group on Facebook to recruit 13 people who reported having good dream recall, but no psychiatric disorders or any other condition. Neither did they report taking any medication that might affect their sleep. The group consisted of 12 women and one man (with a mean age of 28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were asked to keep a dream diary: to write down any dreams they could recall that had taken place just prior to awakening from sleep, and to keep doing this until they each had records for 10 dreams. They were told to record the detail of any dream, whether or not it featured sounds. But at the same time, they were asked to focus on any auditory content, and describe this in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that sounds featured often, being reported in 80% to 100% of each participant’s dreams. Most often, the sounds consisted of other people speaking. (There were even five instances described as speech in a foreign language that the dreamer did not understand.) But there were also 122 instances of the dreamer speaking and 59 instances of other types of sound, such as glass breaking, gun shots, people walking or running, and a radio playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Considering that dream reports include experiences from only the last minutes of sleep before awakening, and that dreaming normally takes place throughout REM sleep as well as in light NREM sleep, the available evidence suggests that normal, healthy people usually experience internally generated auditory sensations an array of times every night,” the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly some limitations to the study. This was a small group of almost all women who self-reported having good dream recall and who volunteered for the study — so may not represent the broader population. Also, rather than being regularly woken and asked what they were dreaming about, they only reported dreams when they woke spontaneously. Earlier work has found that such dreams tend to be more dramatic. So the content that they reported may not be typical of dreams experienced throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the findings are intriguing, and hint at all kinds of interesting work to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some parallels between the normal sleep wake cycle and theories about how psychotic hallucinations come about. As someone falls asleep and moves through early sleep stages into REM, there’s a general decrease in reflective, directed thought and a gradual increase in internally-generated perceptions. Theories of psychotic hallucinations, meanwhile, propose that an impairment in higher order, “top-down” regions (typically in the prefrontal cortex) allows for more internally-generated, sensory-like hallucinatory experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also some recent evidence suggesting similarities in the neurophysiological underpinnings of both dreams and psychotic hallucinations. Both states are associated with similar alterations in dopamine functioning and patterns of connectivity between certain regions of the cortex, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could possibly be an “intrinsic property of the brain-mind system” that reduced or compromised higher order cognitive, executive control facilitates both dream hallucinations and psychotic hallucinations, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, though thinking about dreams and psychosis has a long history, it’s early days for this as a scientific field. More research will be needed to explore whether there really are meaningful, common underlying connections between the two states, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230212&quot;&gt;Quantifying auditory impressions in dreams in order to assess the relevance of dreaming as a model for psychosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Graduate education, particularly the training of doctoral students, plays crucial role in the progress of society. Around 1,500 of the country’s 4,500 or so universities award doctoral degrees. In 2018 according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf20301/data-tables/&quot;&gt;Survey of Earned Doctorates &lt;/a&gt;55,185 students were doctorate recipients in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To match potential graduate students and graduate programs needs the interplay among students, college professors as evaluators, and admission committees.  Many academics are involved in the admission process of graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a college professor, it’s my seasonal duty each fall to write letters of recommendation and rate students based on several criteria in order to help them gain acceptance to graduate schools. Students should ask several professors to evaluate them. Occasionally, I have to tell a student that I would not be able to write a strong recommendation, so it would be better not to ask me. We evaluators combine quasi-objective data (say, grades) and subjective impressions to generate a rating score. Despite the subjective nature, these evaluations are far from random, and college professors don’t have better ways of helping students and graduate programs find a good match.   At the individual level, rating and ranking of application to graduate schools dramatically influences the life of students. Admissions committees have a strong interest in ensuring they only accept mature, polite, reliable, and stable people into their program, and my professional duty is to help them achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One company provides software as a service to many universities for admissions and applications evaluations. Its software uses six criteria to rate students:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge in chosen field&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motivation and perseverance toward goals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to work independently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to express thoughts in speech and writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability/potential for college teaching&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to plan and conduct research&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each criterion, the evaluator picks among five options: exceptional (upper 5%), outstanding (nxt 15%), very good (next 15%), good (next 15%), and okay (next 50%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we generate the numbers and check the appropriate rubric? In principle, a micro-rationalist, bottom-up approach would work. Teachers could collect and store data from students throughout decades, and they might have a formal algorithm for calculating the percentages. I believe it is more likely that many of us apply top-down strategies. We ask ourselves:  do I want to grant a set of grades that is all exceptional? Does the applicant have a clear weak point, in which I should check the third or maybe the fourth category? What if I score, say,  four outstanding and two exceptional?  The table below shows an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;288&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; /&gt;Image credit: Peter Érdi&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this student should be supported, because she seemed to be very motivated, independent and clever. However, I have never checked anybody to be “exceptional” in all categories. First, nobody is exceptional in everything, second, it would be suspicious if my scores were unfair and consciously biased, and so it might be counterproductive. In the case shown in the figure the candidate had little experience in her chosen field, so I checked the second column. Probably the third or even the fourth column would have been more appropriate. I did not feel I was cheating, but I knew I was a little biased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good or bad, decision makers calculate the sum of the scores, analyze their distribution, read the recommendations, and adopt some strategies to bring  decisions. (In some version of the ranking game, weights are assigned to the different features, to expressing the relative importance of the different features. University ranking systems  famously assign relative percentage weights to each ranking factors .) While rating with numbers contains subjective elements, we don’t have better ways to approximate objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of objective reality refers to anything that exists as it is independently of any conscious awareness or perceiver. Subjective reality is related to anything that depends upon some conscious awareness or some perceiver. Objectivity is associated with concepts like reality, truth, and reliability. Objectively ranking the tallest buildings in the world is relatively easy, since it is based on verifiable facts, and we have a result that everybody will accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we accept that it is an impossible task to objectively ranking graduate students, what we could and should do? On the one hand, we could improve our ranking methodologies, on the other hand we (all stakeholders of the game from students to professors) should feel that our actions are as fair as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image by Joshua Golde from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/qIu77BsFdds&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/&quot;&gt;How to rate and rank potential doctoral students&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620581304/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fEOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/earth-day-at-50-episode-54-the-oxford-comment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Earth Day at 50: conservation, spirituality, and climate change [podcast]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;“In times like this, we need global collaboration in research and shared knowledge among different disciplines,” says Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “arXiv allows researchers from different backgrounds and geographical locations to quickly share their findings and push forward for the discoveries we need. It is an ideal platform for researchers to communicate with each other when speed is of extreme importance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a free, fast, and open access scholarly research distribution service, arXiv accelerates the pace at which science can advance. And online communication is particularly relevant now, with researchers around the world isolated due to travel restrictions and conference cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the context of a pandemic like the one we’re experiencing, it is crucial to get information to people quickly, and arXiv provides a shared infrastructure and community to get scientific research to those that can make a difference,” says Greg Morrisett, Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.cornell.edu&quot;&gt; Cornell Tech&lt;/a&gt;. “Already, there are preprints on topics ranging from genomic structure of the virus to epidemiological studies to projected economic impacts, and from every corner of the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new quick search link will expedite efficient research discovery, says Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director. “Within arXiv, research on the coronavirus, associated clinical syndromes, and epidemiology is spread across multiple disciplines and tagged with a number of different keywords. In the interest of expediency, we are providing a direct curated link to e-prints with the most commonly used tags.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other preprint servers, arXiv does not facilitate in-depth peer-review and does not specifically endorse the contents of the documents it hosts. Results on &lt;a href=&quot;http://arXiv.org&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt; should be considered preliminary and not used to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior. Likewise, such findings should not be reported in the news media as established information.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking up is never easy, particularly when you’re confronted with memories of happier times. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/18/trouble-sleeping-the-scent-of-your-lover-might-help/&quot;&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt;, an old photograph, a note somebody left you — weeks or even months after a break-up and you can still be reminded of your ex-partner, whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, this can be even worse. If you’re still friends with your ex, you’re likely to still see their posts on your feed; if you’re not, you can still rub salt into the wound by checking their profile anyway. ‘On this Day’ features are also notoriously bad for bringing up unhappy memories at the worst possible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;published in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, &lt;/em&gt;we also see our exes so much because of the so-called “social periphery” — the networks of people we know tangentially through our ex-partners&lt;span&gt;. So why not design an algorithm that causes us less pain? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new work suggests that this could be the answer to our online break-up woes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39396&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The study, conducted by Anthony Pinter and colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder, focused on 19 adult Facebook users based in the US. Semi-structured interviews were held with each of the users on their feelings around break-ups and social media. Each had been in a relationship prior to the interview — either dating, cohabiting, or marriage — and were aged between 19 and 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants described a range of experiences in which they came into contact with their ex-partners online, from anything between six days to five years after the break-up. They were then asked to focus on specific features that could stop them from coming across their ex — unfriending or unfollowing, for example, or changing the way they view their newsfeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, emotions ran high. Participants reported feeling pained by seeing content involving their ex-partners, whether that was new information (such as an ex’s new relationship status) or past memories (such as anniversary posts or photographs). “The most upsetting thing on Facebook is On This Day,” one participant said. “It said I was the best husband ever and she loved me the most… I remember that, and obviously not physically being hurt, but just feeling an emotional wallop of like ‘Fuck, that wasn’t that long ago’”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all fairly unexpected: unwanted contact with an ex-partner is obviously going to be difficult in some regard. But while the problem may be well-established and familiar, there could still be a novel response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, the authors argue, is that machine learning has focused on methods that “fail to capture social nuances, relationships and other human-centred concerns” — in other words, that the algorithms present to us an unnatural or unhelpful model of our social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are workarounds when it comes to existing platforms — unfriending, unfollowing or blocking ex-partners, or opting out of features like ‘On This Day’. But because of the social periphery, distant connections still linger after a break-up: one participant talked of their ex-partner’s mother’s frequent appearance on their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being clear about what will happen when you mute or block someone is a good first step. But such fixes, the authors believe, are far from perfect. It’s the algorithms themselves that need changing, taking into consideration our complex social peripheries as well as our one-to-one connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, algorithms mainly take notice of binary connections — how much or little we choose to see from one particular person. By tweaking these algorithms to take into consideration not only peripheral &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt; but also events, interests, photos and groups could mean our social periphery is both better represented online and easier to evade post-break up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexities of such encounters should also be taken into consideration. It’s unlikely to matter if an ex has clicked ‘attending’ on a large event that spans multiple days or takes place in multiple locations, so seeing that they’ve done so may cause unnecessary pain. Knowing they’re likely to attend a small gathering of friends, however, may be more useful information if you’re keen to avoid an awkward meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, or if, algorithms become more human-focused, we may find ourselves having less stressful interactions with our ex-partners online. Blocking and unfriending might not be perfect, but at the moment may be the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172&quot;&gt;“Am I Never Going to Be Free of All This Crap?”: Upsetting Encounters with Algorithmically Curated Content About Ex-Partners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Large droplets were thought to contaminate the area immediately surrounding an infected individual, because they settle before evaporating. In contrast, small  droplets evaporate quickly and form residual particulates, or aerosols. However, the classification of droplet size (and therefore the mode of transmission) is not based on modern science. Yet this scheme still informs public health policy to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The figure above shows a Multiphase Turbulent Gas Cloud From a Human Sneeze (&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852&quot;&gt;Bourouiba, 2020&lt;/a&gt;). The puff trapped droplets of many sizes and carried them quite a long distance (23-26 feet!) while evading evaporation. Droplets that settle can contaminate surfaces. Aerosols may persist in the air for hours, depending on ambient temperature and humidity, as well as prevailing winds or &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;airflow of indoor ventilation systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18357411&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Watch the educational video&lt;/a&gt; showing Respiratory Pathogen Emission Dynamics and you will be truly horrified!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This newer understanding of respiratory emission dynamics has implications for mask and respiratory design, social distancing recommendations, and other public health interventions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of masks, droplets are visible after sneezing into a surgical mask (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/335/7633/1293&quot;&gt;Granville-Chapman &amp;amp; Dunn, 2007&lt;/a&gt;).

 &quot;No single agency has provided the public with an accurate, up-to-date record of coronavirus cases, tracked to the county level. To fill the gap, The New York Times has launched a round-the-clock effort to tally every known coronavirus case in the United States.

 &lt;p&gt;As school closures and quarantines take place across the globe, the overwhelming anxiety is palpable in the newfound realities of a pandemic. Trips to the grocery store are now strategized, as shoppers face empty shelves and shortages of household staples. This will undoubtably continue as anxiety thrives on uncertainty increasing stress and driving us to seek answers and information in an evolving landscape. Keeping ourselves healthy and safe is a tall order and is further compounded by the challenge of maintaining our values and goals as parents. Still, it is vital that we support ourselves as individuals first, because maintaining our mental and physical health is the foundation from which we support our children during these trying times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost – plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than ever, it is important to follow the warnings and guidelines of trusted resources. This includes the WHO, state and local governments, and public health agencies. For personal advice, turn to your doctor and your child’s pediatrician. Websites, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.healthychildren.org/&quot;&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, are another source of trusted information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconnect to reconnect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After keeping up to date with developments in the pandemic, schedule time to disconnect from the consumption of social media and news outlets. Being bombarded with information fuels panic and inhibits preparedness. Further, media consumption turns you away from face-to-face interactions with your partner/spouse and children leading to missed opportunities for connection and comfort. By imposing limits, we can model how to manage our handling of difficult information, and also limit our child’s exposure to anxiety ridden media and social media content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, take this hibernation as an opportunity to recharge and strengthen bonds as a family. The forced decluttering of our schedules allows us to foster one-on-one interactions, a sense of togetherness, and protects us from anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain your foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtably routines, habits, and daily activities are disrupted by cancellations in schools, activities, and events. These disruptions are unavoidable, unnerving, and trigger negative emotions that may stray us away from essential self-care routines needed to support our health and mental health. Self-care takes many forms including daily mediation practice, home-based hobbies (such as cooking/baking, gardening, redecorating, channeling your inner Marie Kondo), exercise, crafting or sewing, writing, art, collecting, reading, etc. By taking care of yourself first you are fueling your ability to care for others and minimizing your vulnerability to illness, irritability, and anxiety – all of which draw you away from mindful parenting. For example, I have committed to starting each day with a yoga practice and ending many days with a meditation practice. These few quiet moments ensure that no matter how much arguing my kids do (with myself or each other), I reduce my vulnerability to stray from my parenting goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconnect with natural joys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exercise and nature are pillars for maintaining our health and mental health, making them an essential part of our daily routine. Vitamin D, daily exposure to the elements, and physical activity help maintain our health, ensure better sleep, and protect us from negative moods. This is also a great way to pass time with kids or grab a few moments of needed solitude. This can be as simple as doing daily activities outside such as meals, reading, work, and schoolwork or more adventurous such as exploring your neighborhood or local hiking paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice gratitude and altruism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reflecting on the gifts of today is an essential element of happiness and contentment. And while it is easy to ruminate on our loss of freedom and normalcy, focusing on the negative only perpetuates despair. Although it may not be automatic, taking a few minutes each day to mindfully list things you are thankful for will change your perspective and increase your sense of well-being. The practice of gratitude is also great for the whole family, allowing children to focusing on the positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for helping others in a time of need. Can you run errands for your elderly neighbor? Or help organize activities for kids and share them with other parents? Take this opportunity to sort out old toys, books, and clothes and make donations to charity? By helping others, we strengthen our sense of belonging and gain a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when to seek help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as you and your family will undoubtably experience anxiety during the coming days and weeks it is important to know when and where to seek help. Panic will only fuel impulsive behavior, reduce intelligent decision making, and increase our vulnerability. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has compiled &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://adaa.org/finding-help/coronavirus-anxiety-helpful-resources&quot;&gt;a list of trusted resources&lt;/a&gt; and expert tips. Taking care of your mental health is a vital part of ensuring that your kids and teens navigate this time successfully. We know from well-established scientific studies that children’s mental health improves when parents seek mental health care first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-little-son-sitting-windowsill_6632009.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;by prostooleh via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620455710/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/lessons-learnt-from-coronavirus-and-global-environmental-challenges/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lessons learnt from Coronavirus and global environmental challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-a-pandemic-could-save-the-environment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How a pandemic could save the environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/its-time-for-the-government-to-introduce-food-rationing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It’s time for the government to introduce food rationing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation is a tried-and-tested nonlinear systems identification method to understand biological neurons. The idea is to open the black box that is a biological neuron by using random stimuli to probe how the neuron responds. We present a series of random stimuli to a sensory neuron. By averaging those that generated a response, we obtain the spike-triggered average. The spike-triggered average is equal to the weights of a linear filter that approximates the response of a neuron. Under this linearity assumption, it is also a neuron’s preferred stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Reverse correlation in a nutshell. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_diagram_for_the_Spike-triggered_average.pdf&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/sta.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Reverse correlation in a nutshell. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_diagram_for_the_Spike-triggered_average.pdf&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation has fallen out of favour as people have graduated to more complex models (e.g. GLMs and deep nets) with more complex stimuli (natural scenes) to probe brain representations. However, the machinery underlying reverse correlation is making somewhat of an unexpected comeback in different corners of machine learning. This is something that I’m sure will surprise many machine learning people as well as neuroscientists. Digging deeper into these subfields yields some insights on improvements in nonlinear systems identification that we can take back to computational neuroscience. In this article, I discuss two of these ideas:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;evolution strategies, which are black-box optimization methods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;locally interpretable models, which are linearization models to open up black box models like deep neural nets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before I dig into these methods, let’s dig into the theory behind reverse correlation so we can understand its deep structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;The theory behind reverse correlation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation seemed pretty magical when I first encountered it! Put noise into a system, measure responses – out comes the kernel (?!). I ended up &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thesis-superduperfinal.pdf&quot;&gt;writing my PhD thesis on systems identification&lt;/a&gt;, so you’d think that by the time I graduated my thinking on this was solidified. In the years since, I’ve found that reverse correlation is actually pretty darn subtle, and I’ve developed a new appreciation for all the subtle aspects of the technique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a good exposition of the ideas behind reverse correlation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.3097&quot;&gt;Franz &amp;amp; Schölkopf (2006)&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s say that we are trying to characterize a nonlinear system that receives &lt;img alt=&quot;N&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;N&quot; /&gt; real inputs and outputs a noisy scalar &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E+%5By%7Cx%5D+%3D+f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Cnewline+%5Ctext%7Bwhere+%7D+%5Cbold+x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+R%5EN&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, under certain regularity conditions, we can write the mean response function of the system &lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x)&quot; /&gt; as a polynomial expansion, the Volterra expansion:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Capprox+h_0+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+%5Ccdot+h_1+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+h_2+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29+%2B+%5Cldots&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the kernels &lt;img alt=&quot;h_i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_i&quot; /&gt; have increasing order: &lt;img alt=&quot;h_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_0&quot; /&gt; is a scalar, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_1&quot; /&gt; a vector, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_2&quot; /&gt; a matrix, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_3&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_3&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_3&quot; /&gt; a three-index tensor, etc. The form of the expansion is similar to a Taylor expansion, and it’s tempting to identify the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misconception: the Volterra expansion is a Taylor expansion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Volterra expansion is more general than a Taylor expansion: a Taylor expansion requires well-defined derivatives to every order, while a Volterra expansion does not. For example, the function &lt;img alt=&quot;f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28-1%2Fx%5E2%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)&quot; /&gt; has 0 derivatives everywhere. Hence, its Taylor expansion around 0 is exactly 0. However, it has a perfectly good non-null Volterra expansion, which can be found through polynomial regression. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Expansion-Schmexpansion.ipynb&quot;&gt;Here’s a notebook that shows you how it’s done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Approximating a function with zero derivatives with a Volterra expansion&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/volterra2.png&quot; /&gt;Approximating a function with a null Taylor series with polynomials.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This subtle difference might seem like some nit-picking, but in practice, it is very important: discontinuous functions and stochastic functions can both be approximated with Volterra series. Biological Neurons are both stochastic and have potentially very sharp nonlinearities, yet we can still approximate them using a Volterra expansion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wiener expansion is an orthogonalized version of the Volterra expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To estimate the coefficients of the Volterra expansion, conventional reverse correlation first rearranges the Volterra expansion into an equivalent series of functionals, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series&quot;&gt;Wiener expansion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%3D+%5Csum_i+G_i%5B%5Cbold+x%5D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And imposes that these functionals are orthogonal to each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is the data distribution. Orthogonality is imposed via a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the itty-bitty subtle bit: it turns out that the expectations of every order are straightforward to calculate when the data distribution &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is normal. The 0’th order and 1st order functionals are simply the constant and linear Volterra kernels. The 2nd order functional is the quadratic kernel minus a correction for the diagonal terms of the kernel, since the square of a normally-distributed variable distribution has a mean equal to the square of the standard deviation, &lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E%5Bx%5E2%5D+%3D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2&quot; /&gt;. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0+%3D+k_0+%5Cnewline+G_1+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%5Cnewline+G_2+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+-+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D%5Cnewline&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since each functional are orthogonal over the data distribution, we can easily calculate them using an iterative procedure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimate the Wiener kernel &lt;img alt=&quot;k_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_0&quot; /&gt; from the measured response &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Project the 0’th order functional out of &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt; to obtain &lt;img alt=&quot;y_{res}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y_{res}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimate the Wiener kernel &lt;img alt=&quot;k_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_1&quot; /&gt; from the residual &lt;img alt=&quot;y_{res}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y_{res}&quot; /&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating Wiener series with white noise means finding estimates that minimize sum-of-squares between prediction and measurement over the stimulus ensemble. We use a few shortcuts enabled by properties of white noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;estimate&lt;/em&gt; mean in this context? Least-squares! To estimate the zero-order kernel, we have:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_0+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_0%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+k_0%29%5E2+%3D+%5Cbar+y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first-order kernel:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_1+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_1%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%28%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29+%5Cnewline+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN+%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here the approximate sign comes from the fact that with normally distributed data, &lt;img alt=&quot;(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29+%5Capprox+N%5Csigma%5E2+I&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I&quot; /&gt;. The second order kernel is a little more tricky. We first define &lt;img alt=&quot;r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T&quot; /&gt;. Then:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_2+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_2%7D+%5Csum+%5Cleft%28r+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+%2B+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D+%5Cright%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D%28%28D%5ET+D%29%5E%7B-1%7D+D%5ET+r%29+%5Cnewline&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The columns of the matrix &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is composed of all the cross-products &lt;img alt=&quot;x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+x_j+-+%5Cdelta_%7Bij%7D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2&quot; /&gt; for &lt;img alt=&quot;i \ge j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cge+j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;i \ge j&quot; /&gt;. The operator &lt;img alt=&quot;\text{unstack}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\text{unstack}&quot; /&gt; takes this linear representation of the coefficients and transforms them into a matrix. Here again, we find that for normally distributed inputs, the non-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix &lt;img alt=&quot;D^TD&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%5ETD&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D^TD&quot; /&gt; have an expected value of zero. The inverse of the diagonal is a bit more tricky to calculate, but a little bit of grinding shows that we pick up a scalar factor &lt;img alt=&quot;\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%21%5Csigma%5E%7B4%7D%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}&quot; /&gt;. In fact, we can show that the estimate of the kernels can be written as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_i%28j_1%2C+j_2%2C+%5Cldots+j_i%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bi%21%5Csigma%5E%7B2i%7DN%7D+%5By+-+%5Csum_%7Bm%3D0%7D%5E%7Bi-1%7D+G_m%28%5Cmathbf+x%29%5D+x_%7Bj_1%7D+x_%7Bj_2%7D+%5Cldots+x_%7Bj_i%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;img alt=&quot;G_j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_j&quot; /&gt; are the orthogonalized Wiener functionals (equation 2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3382067&quot;&gt;Korenberg et al. 1988&lt;/a&gt;). Notice the &lt;img alt=&quot;i!&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%21&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;i!&quot; /&gt; factors, which look an awful lot like a Taylor expansion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Second-order-estimate.ipynb&quot;&gt;This formula actually works! Here’s a notebook to show you how it’s done for a second order Wiener expansion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is your head spinning yet? Mine sure was! Grinding through the kernels one by one makes a few things clear:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wiener-Volterra analysis isn’t magic. It’s orthogonal polynomial regression estimated through least-squares, with approximations that are enabled by the use of a very special distribution of the inputs, the normal distribution. This means that expectations of different moments can be analytically calculated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Wiener kernel definitions change when you change the distribution of the input. This is because orthogonalization is dependent on the input distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The easy estimation of the kernels via backprojection and simple multiplication with cross-products of the inputs is lost when the input distribution is not normal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The special properties of white noise were very important technically in 1958 when the series was proposed: the kernels could be estimated with very minimal computing resources. A memoryless accumulator is sufficient. Today, we’re no longer bound by these limitations, and we can do Wiener-Volterra analysis in a much wider range of contexts. Casting Wiener-Volterra analysis as polynomial regression fit via least-squares immediately opens up many extensions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding better estimates via the minimum variance unbiased estimator, that is, maximum likelihood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding better estimates by better modeling the noise, for example, taking into account the Poisson nature of neural noise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generalizing to non-normally distributed ensembles of inputs, again using maximum likelihood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using alternative expansions, for example, cascades of linear-nonlinear filters (i.e. deep nets), fit with stochastic gradient descent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, some of the ideas behind Wiener-Volterra theory – local polynomial expansion, probing stimuli at random – have made their way into far-flung machine learning methods. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Evolution strategies (ES)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_strategies&quot;&gt;Evolution strategies&lt;/a&gt; (ES) are a family of black-box, gradient-free optimizers for potentially non-differentiable functions. At the heart of most optimizers over continuous variables is the computation of the gradient. If the gradient is unaccessible because of discontinuities, or because it is very expensive to calculate, we can obtain a &lt;em&gt;smoothed&lt;/em&gt; gradient via the ES method.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The setup is quite clever. We have a function &lt;img alt=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f&quot; /&gt; that we are trying to optimize. Instead of computing its derivative &lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla f(z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla f(z)&quot; /&gt; directly, we compute the derivative of the expectation of the function, &lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%5Bf%28z%29%5D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]&quot; /&gt; in a local neighborhood &lt;img alt=&quot;\pi(\theta, z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28%5Ctheta%2C+z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\pi(\theta, z)&quot; /&gt;. Think of this expectation as a smoothed derivative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To compute the expected value, we expand it via its definition, and obtain:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_%5Ctheta+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%5Bf%28z%29%5D+%3D+%5Cnabla+%5Cint+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last equality, which is also called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/11/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-5-log-derivative-trick/&quot;&gt;log-derivative trick&lt;/a&gt;, is derived from:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D%7B%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A neighbourhood which is often used in practice is the isotropic Gaussian centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation $\sigma$. If we take a Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation, we find an approximation for the gradient as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E%5Bf%5D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cnabla_%5Cmu+%5Clog+N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Csigma%5E2%29+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28z-%5Cmu%29+f%28z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice this remarkable equation: this is exactly the response-triggered average with an isotropic gaussian stimulus ensemble. This reveals an unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization: we can view reverse correlation as estimating an approximate gradient of the response function of a neuron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response-triggered average tells us how we should change a stimulus locally to increase the response of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Taking ES to reverse correlation&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;From the OpenAI blog, https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/es.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/&quot;&gt;From the OpenAI blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization opens up a lot of different avenues. For instance, we could adapt ES to maximize the response of a neuron in a closed-loop fashion. This strategy has the advantage of being trivial to compute and highly intuitive (i.e. no complaints from reviewer 2 about the method being inscrutable).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ES is also embarrassingly parallel, which has been used to good effect in the context of reinforcement learning – OpenAI showcased ES with 1024 parallel evaluations. We could consider evaluating the gradient of a neuron’s response function in parallel with several other neurons – perhaps in a different animal, in a different lab – and optimize for a stimulus that maximizes the sum of the responses. Indeed, we don’t have to focus on maximizing just the mean response of a neuron: we can maximize the diversity of responses, their dimensionality, etc. This works as long as the metric that we’re measuring is a scalar function of the measured responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ES comes in a variety of different flavours that aim to increase the efficiency of the method. Two of the most popular variants are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES&quot;&gt;CMA-ES (Covariance-matrix-adaptation)&lt;/a&gt;. This takes the derivative of the neighborhood with respect to the covariance of the normal distribution, in addition to its mean. Thus, the covariance stimulus ensemble is tweaked to capture the largest dimensions of descent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/wierstra14a.html&quot;&gt;NES (Natural evolution strategies)&lt;/a&gt;. This uses natural gradients rather than gradients, which naturally deals with rescaling of the axes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of these more efficient variants could be applied to find preferred stimuli in a population of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, because the ES objective is a Monte Carlo estimate, we can import many of the tricks from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_reduction&quot;&gt;variance reduction literature&lt;/a&gt; to increase the efficiency of reverse correlation. For example, we can use control variates or use stratified sampling strategies. My favourite trick to increase the efficiency of estimation: pairing every stimulus with its negative. With this trick, the mean of the realized stimulus ensemble is exactly the mean of the distribution. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Paired-sampling.ipynb&quot;&gt;This antithetic sampling can, in some circumstances, increase the efficiency of the estimation of the preferred stimulus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Locally interpretable models&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s another area where the ideas underlying reverse correlation have recently come together: &lt;a href=&quot;https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html&quot;&gt;locally interpretable models&lt;/a&gt;. Suppose that we have a complex black-box model that we are trying to better understand. This black box model can be, for example, a deep neural network. We can locally approximate this complex function with a simpler, local expansion. This local explanation does not capture all the subtleties of the model, but it can reveal insights that are useful for humans that want to understand the model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black-box models are good for predictions by machines. White-box models are good for understanding by humans. LIME transforms black-box models into locally white-box models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Toy example to present intuition for LIME.The black-box model’s complex decision function f(unknown to LIME) is represented by the blue/pinkbackground, which cannot be approximated well bya linear model. The bold red cross is the instancebeing explained. LIME samples instances, gets pre-dictions using f, and weighs them by the proximityto the instance being explained (represented hereby size). The dashed line is the learned explanationthat is locally (but not globally) faithful. From Ribeiro et al. 2016&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/lime-caption.png&quot; /&gt;From the LIME paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938&quot;&gt;Ribeiro et al. 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, we try to find a model &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt; which approximates a complex function &lt;img alt=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f&quot; /&gt; according to a weight window &lt;img alt=&quot;\pi&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\pi&quot; /&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\arg \min_{g\in G} L(f, g, \pi) + \Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bg%5Cin+G%7D+L%28f%2C+g%2C+%5Cpi%29+%2B+%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\arg \min_{g\in G} L(f, g, \pi) + \Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;img alt=&quot;L&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;L&quot; /&gt; is a loss function and &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt; captures the complexity of &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=7315&amp;amp;action=edit&quot;&gt;In LIME, or locally interpretable model explanations&lt;/a&gt;, the authors suggest to use a Gaussian-shaped neighborhood around an anchor &lt;img alt=&quot;a&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;a&quot; /&gt;, and a sum-of-squares loss, leading to the weighted loss:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3D+%5Csum_i+%5Cexp+%5Cleft%28-%5Cfrac%7B%7C%7Cx_i+-+a%7C%7C%5E2%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%5Cright%29+%28f%28x_i%29+-+g%28x_i%29%29+%5E+2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several choices are possible for &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;. For example, we may privilege functions that focus on few input dimensions; we can impose that &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt; is sparse in parameter space using an L1 penalty as &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;. The model class &lt;img alt=&quot;G&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G&quot; /&gt; can be anything that is “easy to interpret” for humans. This could mean:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a GAM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a decision tree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a linear model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we choose no penalty for complexity and choose a linear model class, our model and error function is equivalent to reverse correlation and evolutionary strategies. This highlight something that’s underappreciated about reverse correlation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spike-triggered average is a simplified, locally valid explanation for how a neuron works. While complex models like deep nets can capture more of the variance in the data, the goal in reverse correlation is different: explaining neurons to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Taking LIME to reverse correlation&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An underappreciated fact about reverse correlation is that the size of the neighbourhood around which we’re linearizing is arbitrary and that different neighbourhoods will lead to different estimates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many articles have documented that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6991.short&quot;&gt;receptive fields appear to change with changing stimulus ensembles&lt;/a&gt;, for example natural vs. artificial stimuli. However, this has been explained in terms of a special, adaptive response of neurons to natural image statistics; for instance, that they increase the degree of feedforward inhibition they receive. In fact, the same phenomenon could happen simply because we’re measuring a nonlinear function, so that its locally linear expansion depends on the stimulus ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the parameters of the probing distribution are arbitrary:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the size of the neighborhood (big vs. small)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the shape of the neighborhood (isotropic Gaussian vs. non-isotropic vs. natural stimuli)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the center of the neighborhood (gray image or another reference)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting applications of nonlinear systems identification have manipulated each of these factors. For example, by shifting the center of the neighbourhood to an appropriate anchor point, we can locally linearize quadratic responses (i.e. complex cells) by choosing an appropriate anchor point. This is the idea behind Movshon et al. (1978), where the line weighting function of a complex cell is found by using another line in the center as an anchor:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Local linearization of receptive fields&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/movshon-1978.png&quot; /&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1978.sp012489&quot;&gt;Movshon et al. 1978&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some other excellent nuggets in the LIME paper that could serve us well. For instance, they suggest using a maximally diverse ensemble of examples (SP-LIME) to illustrate the functioning of the models to humans. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10589&quot;&gt;A similar idea was used in Cadena et al. (2018) to visualize diverse features&lt;/a&gt; that triggered large responses in early stages of a deep neural net around an anchor point (invariant or equivariant features).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can have our cake and eat it too: we can fit very complex models of neurons that explain much of the variance in sensory systems using deep nets, and visualize how these models work using locally linear explanations. It sounds a little silly to fit a model to a model, but it’s a technique that has been used fruitfully both to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/E972.short&quot;&gt;explain sensory neurons&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531&quot;&gt;compress neural networks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both ES and LIME use local linearization strategies similar to reverse correlation to explain complex black box function. From ES, we learn that the reverse correlation estimate gives us a local approximation for the gradient, which can be used as a starting point for closed-loop experiments. From LIME, we see that we can perform reverse correlation centered around different neighbourhoods, yielding different results. By following these new research trends in machine learning, we can find innovative ways of opening the black boxes that are biological neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/IS098TI3W-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Cesarean section (CS) &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2689-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;rate has been increasing&lt;/a&gt; with the main reason being a woman’s prior CS history. Trial of labor after Cesarean (TOLAC), with the aim of achieving vaginal birth rather than repeat CS, is considered a safe and reasonable option. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662227&quot;&gt;rate of TOLAC is decreasing&lt;/a&gt;, especially in Japan, and most women who are eligible for TOLAC choose elective repeat Cesarean delivery (ERCD) without receiving detailed information about the merit of TOLAC. Obstetricians who do not offer the option of TOLAC underline for these women that TOLAC is a “dangerous” option even though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1440-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;risk of uterine rupture&lt;/a&gt; is around 0.5% and ERCD has also a variety of complications, in contrast to successful TOLAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been thinking that the patient’s decision, rather than the doctor’s, is the most important to improve success rate of TOLAC. Therefore, we have performed a prospective study based on women’s decisions after receiving a detailed explanation of the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2833-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showed promising results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our TOLAC criteria, which are based on earlier studies, are shown in Table 1.  For pregnant women who met all these TOLAC criteria, we explained the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD with detailed documents, at 32 weeks of gestation. The documents about TOLAC included the risks of uterine rupture which occurs in around 0.5% of women, which is much higher than that of ERCD, and carries a risk of mortality for the fetus and/or the mother. On the other hand, ERCD has higher risks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and complication of subsequent pregnancies. The women in our study could choose their delivery mode after counseling on these risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1. Criteria for TOLAC in this study&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;height: 447px;&quot; width=&quot;573&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;1) only one previous Cesarean delivery&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;2) former Cesarean delivery was a low transverse Cesarean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;3) no obstetric contraindications for vaginal delivery&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;3) singleton pregnancy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;4) vertex presentation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;5) no history of myomectomy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;6) in general, no medical induction of labor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;7) well informed on the risks of TOLAC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 1,086 pregnant women for eligibility and 735 met the above criteria. Of these, 64.1% opted for TOLAC. Earlier studies also showed the same rate, which means that if women receive sufficient education and support, they tend to choose TOLAC as their desirable mode of delivery. Obstetricians should understand this fact and should not underline only the risk of rare complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High success rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study had a rate of successful TOLAC (vaginal birth) of 91.3%, similar to the vaginal birth rate of women who have no history of Cesarean, with the rate of uterine rupture being 0.6%. There were no infant deaths or long-term sequelae among all 471 TOLAC attempts. Apgar scores of &amp;lt;7 at 5 minutes, which is a marker of fetal asphyxia, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Women with history of vaginal birth in addition to a prior CS had a high chance of successful TOLAC (96.4%), and when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate was favorable (97.6%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tried to reveal the reasons for this high success rate and showed that in the successful TOLAC group, 70.5% of women had a previous CS without labor due to non-recurrent indications, including breech presentation, placenta previa, severe preeclampsia, or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion. On the other hand, over 40% of women who chose repeat ERCD had a previous CS that followed unsuccessful labor due to indications such as labor arrest disorders or non-reassuring fetal status (p&amp;lt;0.01). We believe these differences may have positively impacted the TOLAC success rate, partly because unsuitable candidates may have self-excluded from the TOLAC group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors associated with failed TOLAC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study revealed that factors related to failed TOLAC included ≥40 weeks of gestation and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). After 40 weeks of gestation, success rates decreased (from 97.6% to 76.9%). Half of failed TOLAC cases experienced PROM. Until now, there have been limited studies into the impact of PROM on TOLAC. Obstetricians should be encouraged to have ongoing discussions with women about their mode of delivery after the due date or PROM, as these may be indications to change from planned TOLAC to ERCD. Ongoing discussions throughout pregnancy are important for preventing complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth not only for mothers but also for neonates, with over 60% of eligible women choosing TOLAC and over 90% of those achieving successful TOLAC. History of vaginal birth in addition to CS increased odds of successful TOLAC, while PROM or ≥40 weeks of gestation were risk factors for failed TOLAC. Obstetricians have to discuss the planned mode of birth throughout pregnancy in order to prevent complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our results we would recommend that mothers who have elected ERCD choose a date of CS later than 39 weeks of gestation as some studies suggest a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0803267&quot;&gt;risk of increased negative respiratory outcomes&lt;/a&gt; in elective CS before 39 weeks. If spontaneous labor occurs before the planned date of ERCD, these women could be encouraged to attempt TOLAC instead of emergency CS, because when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate of TOLAC was favorable.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closure of schools and offices has wreaked havoc on families. The cancellation of airline flights, public events, social functions, and the disruption of our economy has been exasperating. We have been thrown into an era dominated by uncertainty, anxiety, and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these measures truly necessary to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic? The answer is yes. With the lack of a preventive vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19, the only way to stop spread is by social distancing and “flattening the curve”. This previously unfamiliar expression is now part of the vernacular. Flattening the curve refers to reducing the number of cases to allow doctors, hospitals and government officials to function at their best without being overwhelmed. It is important to recognize that hospitals have only a finite number of rooms, ventilators and healthcare personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The info-graphic below demonstrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it. While shaped differently, the 2 bell-shaped curves below represent the same number of infected patients. The y-axis or peak of the bell indicates the daily number of cases and the x-axis indicates the time since the first case. The dotted line across the center represents the point at which too many cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of people becoming severely ill with COVID-19 over a short period of time as shown in the tall, narrow curve, could result in a shortage of hospital beds, equipment or doctors. On the other hand, as shown in the flatter, longer curve, if the same number of patients presented to the hospital at a slower rate, the likelihood of the hospital to have adequate supplies, beds and health care providers would be higher (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11795 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;343&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-300x166.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to mitigate the impact of this pandemic, we need to keep the number of cases to below the dotted line. By doing so, we let our healthcare system function at its best. This also allows time for scientists and researchers to create drugs, therapies and potentially an efficacious vaccine against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An especially important factor to consider with respect to flattening the curve, is the necessity to keep our healthcare workers–physicians, nurses, and hospital staff–healthy and safe. With an increasing number of cases in the community, the potential for this workforce to get sick is much higher. If healthcare workers become sick, they will need to be excluded from patient care for many weeks. This effect of this is profound, as it will result in less healthcare workers and less qualified individuals available to take care of the sickest COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social distancing may be our only hope to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of disease. Social distancing involves keeping a physical distance between people, at least 6 feet away, to avoid spread of the COVID-19 virus. This decreases the chances of acquisition of the virus and the disease. With the continued acceleration of this pandemic, no measure can be considered too drastic. The horrifying situation in Italy, wherein patients with COVID-19 have inundated the overburdened healthcare system, forcing doctors to make agonizing triage decisions about who should receive lifesaving care, should not be repeated in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School closures for the purpose of social distancing have especially impacted children and young families. Although current data suggests that children do not appear develop severe illness, it is well-documented that children can still spread the virus to their family members and contacts. Prior influenza pandemics have shown that the highest attack rates were seen in school children due to their close contact. Being separated from friends, can be difficult for children and especially teenagers. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. We can continue to interact using different platforms, such as social media and video applications to help them stay connected during this challenging time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an unprecedented time and although social distancing may be thought to be a dramatic measure, in truth, together as a unified society, we can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. By staying home, you are not just protecting yourself but also other people. It’s the responsible thing to do and although challenging, will help us avoid a situation similar to that of Italy wherein war-like triage decisions and death has become a commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-03-26T14:12:15+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is currently in an unprecedented state of upheaval and uncertainty. As countries fight to minimise the spread of COVID-19, everyone is adjusting to the “new normal”, remaining at home and practising social distancing. And the same is true of the psychologists whose work we report on every day at &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;: labs have been shut and experiments have suddenly been put on hold in the wake of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many psychologists have also begun launching new research to understand how the present crisis is affecting us, and to inform our response to it. So this week, I’ve been talking to some of these researchers to find out more about their work.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39388&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring our mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the new routines that we are now following are going to be necessary for quite some time. A new study led by social epidemiologist Daisy Fancourt is asking how people are responding to these changes in lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that our mental health can be affected by isolation, says Fancourt, and there’s never been a situation where so many people have been required to remain physically separated from others. “We’ve not really had something like this in living history,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, the team is examining the trajectories of people’s mental health during the pandemic — and investigating what kinds of activities can help protect against the negative effects of isolation. Any UK resident over 18 can &lt;a href=&quot;https://redcap.idhs.ucl.ac.uk/surveys/?s=TTXKND8JMK&quot;&gt;sign-up online&lt;/a&gt; and fill in an initial, 10 minute survey. Then, once a week, they will automatically get sent a follow-up questionnaire asking about their experiences of COVID-19, how they’ve been spending their time, and their physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tracking a large number of participants over time, the team hopes to figure out what people can do at home to protect their mental health. They will release the findings regularly to the public and to the government and health authorities, beginning from next week. And they’re in it for the long haul, says Fancourt. “As long as this pandemic is going on, and we’re having these isolation measures, we want to make sure that there is a way that we’re tracking the experiences of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancourt emphasises that it is crucial that people stay home — doing so will save lives. And there are activities known to be good for our mental health that we can already be doing, she adds: practising music and arts, for instance, or volunteering and providing support for others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Orben from the University of Cambridge is part of another team planning a large, year-long study tracking the responses of adolescents and adults during the pandemic. The researchers, who are currently in discussion with funders, plan on tracking participants’ mood and mental health through the use of an app, which will send questions to their phones on a regular basis. Importantly, this app will also record behavioural data: what other apps people are using, for instance, and how long they are spending on their phones, as well as their movement and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in Fancourt’s study, the researchers hope the work will untangle how people’s activities relate to their mental health. They also plan on looking at how any events and announcements related to the pandemic affect participants’ responses. Orben says the team is keen to rapidly share data with the research community so that it can be analysed as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Orben, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/&quot;&gt;whose research focuses on the psychological effects of media use&lt;/a&gt;, one of the key questions will be how technology is being utilised in a time where face-to-face interaction is extremely limited. “I think it will allow us to move away from just thinking about time spent online and on screens to having more nuanced conversations about … what activities on screens are people actually engaging in,” she says. “Which ones of those are beneficial and help mitigate the effects of social isolation, and which ones might actually exacerbate stress?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring messaging and behaviour &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have already conducted preliminary research and published the results — as preprints, at least. Many of these studies have attempted to examine the value of different forms of public health messaging, or determine how people are behaving during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/9yqs8&quot;&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; which surveyed more than 1,000 Americans across two days in March. The team, led by Jim Everett at the University of Kent and Molly Crocket at Yale University, looked at how moral messages could promote public health behaviours. Participants read a Facebook post urging people to stay at home, which was either accompanied by a “deontological” argument, telling people it was their duty to protect their community; a “utilitarian” argument, asking people to think of the negative consequences of not making these sacrifices now; an appeal to virtue, reminding people that staying home is what a good person would do; or no moral argument. They then indicated how likely they would be to adopt public health-related behaviours like washing their hands after getting home, or avoiding public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were more likely to indicate they would share the deontological message — the one that appealed to their sense of duty — than a post with no moral argument or a virtue-based one.  And there was some evidence that the deontological argument might increase people’s intentions to engage in health-related behaviours: participants reported a stronger intention to wash their hands after reading this message compared to the virtue-based one, for instance, although this effect did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that messages focused on citizens’ duties and responsibilities to others may be particularly useful. But the work is preliminary and there are important caveats: it only looks at people’s &lt;em&gt;intentions&lt;/em&gt; rather than actual behaviour, and the effects are small and are not always significant. “What we’re very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; suggesting is that framing these judgments in more ‘deontological’ ways is unequivocally going to have huge impacts on behaviour,” acknowledges Everett. But still, the findings are consistent with past work, he says, adding that even interventions that produce small changes could, together, have an impact in the pandemic. The team is now working with other groups to see whether similar effects are found outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also looked at how differences in personalities influence how likely we are to accept constraints to our quality of life (like social isolation) in order to protect ourselves or others from the virus. Ingo Zettler and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/pkm2a/&quot;&gt;have posted a preprint&lt;/a&gt; based on a survey of 799 Danish citizens who completed personality questionnaires. Participants who scored higher on the so-called “Dark Factor” — which relates to people’s willingness to pursue their own interests at the expense of others — were less likely to accept these constraints. In contrast, those who scored higher on the trait of emotionality, who tend to be more anxious and empathetic, were more likely to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other rapid studies have included research into &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/dz428&quot;&gt;Americans’ perceptions of risk and behaviours&lt;/a&gt; early on in the pandemic, how &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/y2cg5/&quot;&gt;empathy relates to social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/epcyb/&quot;&gt;“optimism bias”&lt;/a&gt; when people consider the chance they will contract or pass on the virus. Again, it’s important to point out that most of this research consists of preprints which have not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proceeding quickly… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies represent just a snapshot of the work psychologists are conducting in the midst of the current crisis. J Nathan Matias from Cornell University and Alex Leavitt from Facebook Research have set up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Social Science Research Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, in which researchers can record details of projects they are working on. As of 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March, more than 100 projects are listed, on everything from the spread of conspiracy theories to the effects of remote teaching on education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the list is to help researchers who are planning studies find ways of working together and determine where they should be channelling their efforts, says Matias. The tracker will also ensure people are aware of new results as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other networks are also getting involved in the response. The Psychological Science Accelerator, a network of labs which collaborate on large-scale studies, recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://psysciacc.org/2020/03/21/join-the-psas-rapid-response-covid-19-project/&quot;&gt;put out a call for “rapid and impactful studies”&lt;/a&gt; to understand the psychological side of the pandemic. The group has decided to go ahead with three of the proposals, including a study that will examine the behavioural benefits of framing public health information in terms of gains (e.g. lives saved) rather than losses (e.g. deaths). Several journals have also joined &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurochambers.blogspot.com/2020/03/calling-all-scientists-rapid-evaluation.html&quot;&gt;an initiative calling for submissions of Registered Reports&lt;/a&gt; on research related to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;strong&gt; but with caution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researchers conduct rapid research and stick preprints online, there’s another key effort that scientists can get involved in, says Matias: peer-review. “As we move quickly to organise the production of new knowledge, we absolutely need people who can take the time to look through those preprints … and get us to the point of verified knowledge in time for it to be useful,” he says. Orben echoes these concerns: “Just because things are urgent doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be scrutinised.” That scrutiny itself will need to become more instantaneous, she adds. Many journals, including the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lauragesmith/status/1240712219731558402/photo/1&quot;&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BPSOfficial/status/1242892821629153280?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Journal of Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are already promising expedited peer review of papers related to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some psychologists have stressed that it’s also important this rapid response is informed by past work, whether that consists of studies into outbreaks specifically, or just well-grounded psychological science more generally. “The first rule of preventing harm is learning from what’s been done before,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vaughanbell/status/1241991708436504577?s=20&quot;&gt;tweeted Vaughan Bell recently&lt;/a&gt;. “If it’s urgent, the urgency is to do it right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although many researchers are able to conduct psychological research in the midst of a pandemic, Matias emphasises that not everyone is in a position to do so.  “A lot of people have been impacted themselves in ways that make it difficult to continue research. And that’s okay,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do have the time or means to do so, however, it can be rewarding. “It’s easy to feel quite helpless at the moment,” says Everett. “I’m really glad I’m doing it – it makes me feel like I am perhaps able to contribute in some small part”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psychologist&lt;em&gt; also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/april-2020/coronavirus-psychological-perspectives&quot;&gt;growing collection of resources&lt;/a&gt; relating to COVID-19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2.6 million babies a year are stillborn. Although it’s always devastating to lose a baby,  parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.  There is considerable stigma, social shame and marginalization associated with parental grief for a stillborn child with the result that it has attracted little attention by health care providers, resulting in inadequate support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farrales et al. recently ran a qualitative participatory research study to explore the experiences of bereaved parents when interacting with health care providers during and after the stillbirth of their child.Results showed was that both mothers and fathers needed acknowledgement from their health care provider that the baby was a irreplaceable individual in its own right, recognized that they were parents that were grieving, recognized how traumatic stillbirth is and recognition that the parents will continue to feel bereaved for a time and that they needed support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-0907-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;CoCites: a citation-based search method for scientific literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cocites.com/&quot;&gt;CoCites&lt;/a&gt; was developed by Janssens et al. at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html&quot;&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many other tools for searching though the scientific literature, CoCites uses citations rather than keywords. It has been designed to be more efficient than the traditional keyword-based methods and works on the assumption that the user knows at least one highly relevant article within their chosen research area, pulling out all articles that have previously been cited together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11776 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/student-849822_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article describes the results of using CoCites to reproduce the literature searches of a number of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses; these showed that CoCites retrieved a median of 75% of the articles that were included in the original reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who play sports are often faced  with a dilemma when they are injured. Should they continue playing or stop. Until now, the implications of playing sport when injured on both joint health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been investigated. With this in mind, Bullock et al. performed research on the relationship between playing while injured, HRQoL, osteoarthritis and persistent joint pain, comparing findings across both elite and recreational cricket players. The study involved asking participates to fill in a questionnaire describing their history &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11777&quot; height=&quot;255&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/cricket-724617_1920-300x255.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;of playing sport while injured and details on any diagnosed osteoarthritis and/or persistent joint pain. It was found that, indeed, cricketers who played injured had their HRQoL adversely affected and were at increased risk of osteoarthritis and joint pain. The authors conclude that the long-term impact of playing while injured should be considered when advising athletes on their ability to compete following an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-020-1946-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;How many words are Australian children hearing in their first year of life?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence to suggest that parents from more socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds interact verbally with their children less than parents from more advantaged background, resulting in what has been coined “the 30 million-word gap”. Brushe et al. decided to explore this further, investigating the number of worlds children hear in their first year of life and whether this is influenced by the level of education attained by the mother. The five year study involved grouping the mothers into high or low education groups and then collecting data from audio-recordings when the children were 6 months old and again when they were a year old.  The number of words spoken by the mothers when they were talking to their children were counted using the Language Environment Analysis software. Results showed that there was a large variation of words spoken by the mother within each education group, but no meaningful differences between the different educational groups. This suggests that a word gap associated with the level of education attained by the mother is not apparent in the first year of a child’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably be familiar with the idea of behavioural “nudges” — interventions that encourage people to make better choices, without changing the actual options available. As a concept, nudging has become hugely popular, with at least 200 “nudge units” in governments and institutions around the world. We’ve certainly reported on a few studies finding that simple nudges &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/03/giving-people-simple-moral-nudges-encourages-them-to-donate-much-more-to-charity/&quot;&gt;encourage people to give more to charity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/19/simply-changing-the-order-of-fast-food-menus-nudges-customers-towards-healthier-soft-drink-choices/&quot;&gt;help people to make healthier soft drink choices from fast food menus&lt;/a&gt;, for example. You might be forgiven for thinking, then, that there are no limits to what nudging can do….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0795-z&quot;&gt;set of studies&lt;/a&gt; designed to “nudge” commuters’ behaviour, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour &lt;/em&gt;and involving a total of almost 69,000 people, has found that there definitely are limits. “The failure of these well-powered experiments … highlights both the difficulty of changing commuter behaviour and the importance of publishing null results to build cumulative knowledge about how to encourage sustainable travel,” write Ariella S. Kristal and Ashley V. Whillans, of Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39383&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were employees of a major European airport. About half had reported driving by themselves to and from work. But almost 60% of this group said they would consider carpooling, and 41% said that finding a “matched” person with a similar commute to carpool with was a key reason why they weren’t already doing it. Many employees also reported that if they were given discounts on public transport, they’d be more likely to use it. The airport did already have a carpool service, and was also well connected to subway, rail and bus infrastructure. It seemed, then, like the ideal place to nudge people towards commuter behaviours that would benefit their own health and pocket, as well as, of course, the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, Kristal and Whillans tested a letter and email campaign designed to encourage employees to sign up for carpooling by highlighting the benefits and providing testimonials from carpoolers. Though this intervention did increase registrants, this increase was tiny, and, statistically, it made absolutely no difference to the numbers who actually used the service. (For this study, the researchers sent out 15,000 letters. Only 33 employees registered for the service as a result. One month later, only three who’d received the initial letter were active carpoolers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second study, they gave employees details of good personal carpooling matches, and reminded them that carpooling would save them money. (Remember, a lack of knowledge about someone suitable to carpool with was reported in initial surveys as a key barrier to doing it.) But  again, this intervention did not increase carpooling behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they tried giving a different group of more than 7,000 employees a free one-week bus trial. But this intervention failed to subsequently increase registration for discounted bus passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourth experiment, the pair provided just over 1,000 employees with comprehensive personalised travel plans. These plans included information about carpooling matches, bus and train routes and times, transit pass discounts and bike routes. These employees were also offered a one-on-one session with the airport commuter team to talk this through. Only 21 people signed up for these sessions. And, overall, the intervention made no difference whatsoever to the participants’ commuter behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one significant limitation to the study that the researchers themselves point out: this particular airport offers employees a free parking space. Perhaps these attempted nudges would have had more impact on people who have to pay for their parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they do draw a few cautionary conclusions from their findings. One: the work “suggests that people do not always reveal their true intentions or barriers to sustainable commuting.” Though many had initially said that they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; carpool or use public transport if they had discounted travel, this isn’t what transpired. Further work will be needed to investigate exactly why this is (maybe they don’t really want to talk to co-workers during the commute, for example). But it does seem that nudges aren’t enough to change commuter behaviours. Heavier-handed policies, such as congestion charges and parking bans, may be necessary to bring about shifts in this type of behaviour, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, though, they think the findings also suggest that nudges might not be that effective at changing habitual behaviours, in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0832-y&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal welcomes the publication of this paper. Though the majority of studies reporting nudge interventions have found them to be successful, given the known problem of bias towards publishing positive results, “it’s possible that many more unsuccessful interventions exist but have never been reported,” the editorial observes. And clearly, this is an example of a case where null results have policy implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the editorial notes, “the study points to the limits of nudges and reminds us that they are not a panacea. While they can be a low-cost and simple way to shift many behaviours, it’s important to remember that not all behaviours are equally easy to shift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0795-z&quot;&gt;What we can learn from five naturalistic field experiments that failed to shift commuter behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; was announced on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, marking a turning point for the public health systems serving the health of constituent populations across the globe. This declaration moment is important for narrative on COVID-19 because it is the point at which it is accepted that the virus is not only travelling to different countries, but is now circulating in those countries. Governments are now required to take action to moderate the impact of the infection, reducing harm for the polity until the virus – through the mutation of its biological properties, human immunity, vaccines or some combination of these – takes its place, we hope, among the many other microbes with which human life has found co-existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO declaration is also an important moment for the COVID-19 story because it reveals how data about notifications of diagnosed infection and deaths are used to make decisions and therefore reveals how, in the circumstances of a pandemic, it is keenly apparent that numerical and narrative futures constitute each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandemics are narrated into meaningful existence and COVID-19 is no exception. In Australia, for instance, news stories on the novel coronavirus have escalated since January 2020 to become headlined on many broadcast and digital news platforms. This pattern of media interest conforms to what has been seen in previous outbreaks. Swine flu in 2009 was a significant media event that did not go unremarked in the interviews and focus groups I and colleagues conducted with members of the general population variously impacted by the pandemic threat. Ebola, too, was a prominent news story in 2014 as was Zika in the run up to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro  in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 resembles these other outbreaks and pandemics, but the news stories about it seem to have a distinctively numerical quality. The number of known infections in a particular place over a period of time gives an index of the transmissibility of an infection. Mortality rates – a measure of the proportion of people that die with an infection – are also woven into pandemic stories, in general. But COVID-19’s numbers seem to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; its story. News feeds continually update the counts of diagnoses and deaths, and have numerically tracked the contagion from a supposed source in China to other countries, notably South Korea, Iran and Italy, and then to most other parts of the world. This pandemic by numbers approach charts the particular transmissibility and severity of this virus, but also lends itself to our increasingly complex small-screen media diet, where numbers and graphs alongside images and videos more easily convey the COVID-19 story than do long form narrative texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 also comes into a context where public health systems have increasingly turned to mathematical models to make decisions about how to manage various infections, notably HIV and influenza. Models are used to decide how to apply resources and strategies to best effect. For example, modelling has shown how HIV can be prevented by HIV treatments, because they reduce the likelihood of the transmission of the virus. For influenza, models are used to calculate what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to protect the whole population from an emerging infection. These models can be adjusted to fit what is known about the biosocial properties of a particular infection, the efficacy of treatments and vaccines, and cost. In the case of COVID-19, for example, models may be indicating that containment will reduce the speed and scope of transmission and therefore reduce mortality, the burden on the health system, and ultimately the cost for governments. COVID-19 may be a fully-fledged algorithmic pandemic in the sense that its storyline is transparently about its numbers and because it is managed in terms of the models that combine numerical indices of transmission, mortality, burden, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematical models and narratives also have a point of contact in relation to futures and pasts: they both offer means of trying to shape what might happen through action in the present guided by understandings of what has happened. Decision-makers want to know how to act now to reduce the future impact of a pandemic and models support these decisions by analysing pre-existing data about transmission, mortality, the benefits and costs of treatments, vaccines and containment, for example. Modelling, then, looks to what the future might be by assessing a pandemic’s past numbers. This is strictly true even during the course of a particular pandemic. Narratives on pandemic futures also recall the past, for example, through reference to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, swine flu in 2009, and other outbreaks, and on that basis orient the narrator and their interlocutors to possible futures. Public policy statements about containment requirements and news media vision of empty supermarket shelves both reflect action in the present that is predicated on pasts and aims to shape futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all its life threatening, anxiety-making potential, though, the numerical narrative on COVID-19 is surprisingly impersonal. Stories of the many lives affected by the pandemic and the full tenor of its corporeal horrors are crowded out by governmental advice and updating of the numbers. One reason for this separation of pandemic knowing and lived experience is their incommensurability. Pandemics are constituted in the sheer scale and spread of their numbers, so much so that no one person can experience a pandemic without recourse to some signification of this calculated, collective plight. Infections, in contrast, are visceral and personal, including for those who devote themselves to providing care. Moreover, narrative arguably meets its limits in the experience of an infection because, like traumatic experience, living through a debilitating one is not an easy story to tell. Some accounts of how people experienced the 1918-1919 pandemic remark on the lack of affect, giving the impression that emotion was bracketed aside as irresponsible, impossible or even a luxury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerical narrative, then, may not only be one of the ways we can know a pandemic is happening; it may provide the means of living with emerging threat. As they say, time – and numbers – will tell how things turn out for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: “people walking on train station” by Liliya Lisa.

 &lt;p&gt;Diets and superfoods are all the rage. From acai berries to the Zone diet, many a dietary trend has come along promising a range of benefits, such as weight loss, heart health, and improved cognition. But the science behind these claims is often sketchy at best. One dietary regime that has stood the test of time – and importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-studies-on-the-mediterranean-diet&quot;&gt;scientific scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; – is the Mediterranean diet. Earlier this year, U.S. News and World Report named the Mediterranean diet as &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://health.usnews.com/wellness/food/articles/how-us-news-ranks-best-diets&quot;&gt;the best diet of 2020&lt;/a&gt; for the third year in a row. The diets were scored by a panel of nationally recognized experts in diet and nutrition. In second place was another consistent high performer in the rankings, the DASH diet (DASH stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension) which focuses on lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are on a DASH diet or the Mediterranean diet you are probably eating fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, as well as whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts.  You are also probably consuming olive oil as a substitute for unhealthy vegetable or coconut oils.  Olive Oil, particularly the extra virgin preparation, contains lots of antioxidants (just look at that rich color; it screams anti-oxidants) and also has significant anti-Inflammatory properties. Everyone knows that these are the two most important properties of healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body clearly benefits from eating olive oil. Does your brain care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering this question is not easy. First of all, olive oil is a complex blend of various chemicals. It would be nice to know which of these is most advantageous and whether they influence brain health directly or indirectly. A recent study attempted to find answers using an animal model that mimics conditions of multiple sclerosis in the human brain. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by brain inﬂammation leading to numerous degenerative changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain inflammation present in multiple sclerosis patients is thought to be driven by changes in the gut microbiome. Scientists now understand that the gut microbiome plays a signiﬁcant role in both the progression and severity of the disease. This is the likely scenario: an imbalance in the gut bacteria leads to inflammation, chemical debris released from the bacteria migrate out of the gut into the blood and then into the brain. The most harmful of these bacterial debris is called lipopolysaccharide and it can induce a powerful inflammatory response inside the brain. People with multiple sclerosis have elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide in their brains, spinal cords, and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olive oil modifies how your gut microbiome communicates with your brain. Olive oil’s beneficial effects on the human brain and body are likely related to the presence of the polyphenols hydroxytyrosol and oleic acid. Hydroxytyrosol protects cells that are under oxidative stress. Oleic acid has beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2018.1469281&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of olive oil demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Administering olive oil animals significantly reduced the number of harmful chemicals that can cause tissue injury and aging, particularly within the brain. Olive oil administration also increased levels of the enzymes that provide protection against oxidative damage in the brain and also reduces the negative actions the lipopolysaccharide released by bacteria in the gut. Olive oil also reduced the level of inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, yes, your brain benefits a lot from adding olive oil to your diet and these benefits originate in response to the changes that olive oil makes to your gut microbiome. Olive oil should become a big part of the diet for anyone with an aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Photo by Steve Buissinne from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/olive-oil-salad-dressing-cooking-968657/&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/&quot;&gt;How olive oil promotes brain health&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620131832/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/lessons-learnt-from-coronavirus-and-global-environmental-challenges/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lessons learnt from Coronavirus and global environmental challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-a-pandemic-could-save-the-environment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How a pandemic could save the environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Open Access and Open Science are critical, especially in times of crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak shows how important it is for medical professionals, scientific experts, and every member of the public to have immediate access to the latest science. Equal access to the latest research can assuage public fears or spur government action. Today, we’re happy to report that &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; published its first COVID-19 paper since we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;fast-tracking submissions on January 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science leaders have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf&quot;&gt;recently requested&lt;/a&gt; that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable&quot;&gt;already supports&lt;/a&gt;, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push &lt;u&gt;all &lt;/u&gt;PLOS content to PubMed Central.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230548&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by Mingli Yuan and colleagues from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The researchers studied 27 patients infected with COVID-19 and admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan. In this patient group, the authors associated clinical features identified from computed tomography (CT) scans of patients’ lungs with eventual outcomes. They scored patients based on features they observed such as ground glass opacity, abnormality on both sides, and widespread distribution of pathology in the lungs, to produce an overall severity score for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Yuan adds: “This study allows us to compare radiologic findings with the mortality of patients infected with COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since February 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, PLOS’ family of journals have received approximately 175 coronavirus-related submissions. This paper had a turnaround time of less than 21 days from submission to acceptance. A fast, open and transparent process of publishing reliable, peer reviewed science &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;its underlying data is an important contribution towards tackling this outbreak, and we are happy to make contributions to this effort. We are forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/covid-19&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/a&gt; as they publish. Meanwhile, you can keep tabs on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/dfs&quot;&gt;Disease Forecasting and Surveillance Channel&lt;/a&gt; for curated research related to coronavirus. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks and climate change, to also consider posting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/a&gt;.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181&quot;&gt;search link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By Joerg Heber, Editorial Director, PLOS and Editor-in-Chief, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As the global research community, along with everyone else, adopts measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, we wanted to update you on how we are dealing with the situation at PLOS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOS Operations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you have a paper in process at any PLOS journal, it is being processed as normal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are conscious of the challenges that many of you face during this crisis. We will remain supportive and flexible, which may affect individual paper processing times (more below). We are also carefully monitoring the health and well-being of our staff, managing and coordinating workloads, and supporting each other with flexibility. While the situation is far from normal in both of our primary locations (USA and UK), at this point we do not anticipate issues preventing the efficient publishing of our seven journals. We are facilitating the prompt evaluation of any papers related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and all other papers are also being handled as per our standard processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reassurance for Our Research Communities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We understand that the global research community is significantly but also variably affected by this pandemic, and so we want to provide the following clarifications and reassurance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To Authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are flexible regarding turnaround times for revisions and other tasks during this stressful time. Please keep in touch with us if you need any extensions or if you experience any challenges around manuscript preparation; we will work with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are fast-tracking all relevant research related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and are processing all other submissions as normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are forwarding all submissions and papers related to the outbreak to the World Health Organization for their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;database &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;of publications on coronavirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We encourage all researchers to also consider posting a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Please remember that – across all our journals – we protect primary research studies from being considered “scooped” by closely related, parallel studies recently published in other journals. So, there is no need to rush your research, or revisions, for the sake of being selected for novelty!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To Reviewers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you have agreed to do a review, or would like to do a review, for a PLOS journal but need extra time, please just let us know. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you can, please review &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprints related to coronavirus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; directly via the preprint’s commenting options or on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Rapid PreReview server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;  — this can speed up the review process down the line, as constructive comments may be vetted and used in a review process at a journal (read about PLOS’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;initiative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;) or authors can respond rapidly to comments made&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In light of the now-limited resources for experimental research due to closed laboratories, we encourage you to carefully consider the need for additional experiments or analyses in revision requests, especially if the conclusions are adequately supported by the data. (Note: while we recommend this for all journals during this crisis, this is always standard practice at PLOS ONE and simply a reminder in this case.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To Editors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thank you for your continued support of open research and of PLOS. We appreciate that you will have multiple calls on your time, and that at the moment it is hard to predict when these time pressures will occur. We are here to support you, please let us know if you need more time or assistance on any paper you are working on; we will work with you and the authors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you would like to temporarily pause from receiving new manuscript invitations, please add your unavailable dates in Editorial Manager (how-to video &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV85pXzLEmA&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To you all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The notes above relate to your activities around working on journals. We appreciate and would like to take this moment to thank all of you – authors, reviewers, and editors –  who are on the front lines of fighting the pandemic, and caring for people affected by it.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;How companies and teams make decisions can be very challenging. Poor or ill-structured decision-making processes can make the organization less successful and create destructive conflicts in decision-making teams. But there are a few strategies companies can try that help organizations make big decisions in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People operate in complex and dynamic environments, making decisions with limited information under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. In contrast to routine decisions, strategic decisions are often made at top-management level and they have an impact on the whole organization in terms of its future direction and the scope of its activities. Such important decisions have a significant impact of the organization’s resource allocation that require trade-offs between alternatives and the setting of organizational priorities. In addition the strategic decision making process  rarely results in one clear best solution to the problem, but an organization makes a  decision it will be difficult to reverse. This is because the implementation of a decision involves a significant resource commitment and change in organizational activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we have ways to assess risk through probability theory, dealing with strategic decision problems is much more difficult where the information we gather to support a decision and the actual decision outcomes are uncertain and ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/psychology/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-262&quot;&gt;In complex decision situations, groups are better at solving problems than acting alone&lt;/a&gt;. This may be because group members bring a variety of information, critical judgment, solution strategies, and a wide range of perspectives to the decision problem. However, groups can be subject to destructive conflict and cognitive biases that may hinder the quality of decision outcomes and group members’ decision acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main group decision-making biases are &lt;em&gt;risky shift&lt;/em&gt;, as groups tend to make risker decisions than individuals alone, and &lt;em&gt;groupthink&lt;/em&gt;, as group members strive for consensus and harmony in their decision-making. In addition, group conflict may arise when people with competing opinions and solution alternatives clash.  Group decision-making, therefore, presents a managerial conundrum. On the one hand, multiple perspectives of group members can add insight into the problem situation. On the other hand, group diversity can produce fragmentation, conflict, or groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group member interaction in decision-making situations may produce two types of conflict: cognitive and affective conflict. Task-focused&lt;em&gt; cognitive conflict&lt;/em&gt; arises when group members focus on a task or an issue and debate to come up with a creative solution.  Cognitive conflict improves decision-making quality as the goal of the decision-makers is to find the best possible solution rather than win the argument. However, there is a danger that this beneficial cognitive conflict spills into a dysfunctional, affective conflict. Instead of working constructively to achieve the best possible solution, the debate becomes personal, adversarial, and a lose-win paradigm where one view prevails while others are discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affective conflict tends to be emotional and focuses on personal incompatibilities or disputes. These disputes can result from group members’ personal judgments that they are not fully able to explain to group members. The more these personal judgments influence decisions, the more there is potential for decision-making group members to speculate and find reasons to distrust the motivation and hidden agendas of other group members. Hence, too much affective conflict may hinder overall group performance as the decision will not be accepted by some decision-making group members regardless of the quality of the decision outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management consultants have developed several decision-making techniques to encourage critical interaction between decision-making group members. &lt;em&gt;Devil’s advocacy&lt;/em&gt; is a decision-making technique where one or more people in the group works to point out all the flaws and risks with an option under consideration. &lt;em&gt;Dialectical inquiry&lt;/em&gt; is a decision-making technique where divide into two camps: those advocating for an idea and those advocating against it. Both sides highlight the advantages of their assigned decision and outline the disadvantages of the opposing idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy lead to higher quality assumptions and decision outcomes than a consensus approach in decision-making. However, consensus-seeking groups express more satisfaction and desire to continue to work with their groups and indicate a greater level of decision acceptance than those who were asked to apply dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy in their groups’ decision-making process. Hence, management scholars’ attention has turned to developing techniques that maintain moderate levels of cognitive conflict to ensure high quality decision outcomes, but simultaneously preserve group cohesion to prevent emergence of affective conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causal mapping is a visual decision-making technique that is designed to help groups improve their strategic decision-making processes and promote cognitive conflict, while at the same time preventing the emergence of affective conflict&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Visual tools are particularly useful in strategy work as decisions are often made collectively in group working situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a causal map, ideas are causally linked to one another through the use of arrows and nodes. The arrows indicate how one idea or action leads to another. In effect, the maps are word-and-arrow diagrams where the arrows mean “might cause,” “might lead to,” or “might result in.” Causal mapping facilitates a visual articulation of a large number of ideas, actions, and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of a fully developed causal map is depicted in below. The map incorporates the collective understanding of a decision-problem by a decision-making group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;310&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/gggggg-180x90.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; /&gt;Image Credits: Mikko Arevuo, ‘Epistemic objects in collective decision-making: a practice perspective on the use of causal maps as situated material artifacts’, PhD Thesis, Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield CERES (2015). [accessed 16.07.2019]&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causal maps that have been created in groups bring together the thinking of many people, including conflicting views, subtly different slants on the same issues, and different perspectives held by individual people. Such causal maps provide simplified representations of the beliefs of the greater group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group causal mapping could be perceived as a form of brainstorming, but there is a distinction between group maps and a free-flowing brainstorming of ideas. Group mapping that is used for decision-making is focused on raising issues and concerns. These are usually activities or events that can either support or challenge the decision-making aspiration of the group. In contrast to eliciting “off-the-wall” ideas in group brainstorming sessions as the means of unleashing creativity, group mapping focuses on bringing together the group members’ current wisdom and experience, as well as issues surrounding the problem. Therefore, group mapping is a process of engaging in a dialogue to uncover the causality between the problem and a number of potential solution outcomes, represented as a visual object. The mapping process provides the means for the decision-making group to structure and merge differing perspectives that should lead eventually into a shared understanding of the issue in a holistic manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Strategy-Mapping-Nonprofit-Organizations-ebook/dp/B00JZUPLPU/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1583250943&amp;amp;refinements=p_27%3AJohn+M.+Bryson&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;text=John+M.+Bryson&quot;&gt;There is increasing evidence that&lt;/a&gt; the causal mapping process prevents decision-making groups from talking over each other and going around in circles. It helps group members to speak and be heard. The mapping process produces a lot of ideas and can ultimately clarify the most suitable course of action. Furthermore, the shared and collective enactment of a group causal map can increase individual ownership, acceptance, and the feeling of fairness of the decision outcomes. This is because the map shows evidence that people have listened to everyone in the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: AbsolutVision, ‘Photo of bulb artwork’ via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/82TpEld0_e4&quot;&gt;Unsplash &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-strategists-are-improving-team-decision-making-processes/&quot;&gt;How strategists are improving team decision-making processes&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620039770/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fgggggg-180x90.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/is-the-fetus-a-resident-or-a-body-part/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Is the fetus a resident or a body part?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/eight-rules-for-teaching-during-covid-19/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eight rules for teaching during COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/adult-aging-alone-american-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated care is characterized by a proactive and person-centered approach to care, which is seamlessly coordinated across multiple professional disciplines and care interfaces. Integrated care aims to improve outcomes such as functioning, quality of life, and quality of care. The organisation of integrated primary and community care is considered an essential step towards supporting older people to age in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining people’s safety at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support older people living at home, it is essential to maintain their safety. Older people encounter limitations in multiple domains of life, which could pose risks to their ability to live safely and independently at home. Such risks may relate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/47/6/830/626240&quot;&gt;different factors&lt;/a&gt;, including people’s functioning and behavior, their physical and social environments, and the health and social care they receive. This wide range of risks could lead to a multitude of problems that challenge people’s safety at home, ultimately resulting in emergency department visits, (re)hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. Given its proactive, interdisciplinary and comprehensive character, integrated care is expected to provide opportunities to address &lt;a href=&quot;https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/18/6/424.long&quot;&gt;the prevention of such risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1482-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our recently published scoping review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that integrated care programs for older people living at home address a broad range of safety risks. After examining included programs according to the predefined conceptual framework shown in Figure 1, findings show that all programs addressed risks related to people’s functioning and behavior, and several programs addressed risks associated with people’s health and social care management. Fewer programs addressed risks related to people’s social and physical environments. However, as the number of people receiving care and support at home keeps rising, risks related to people’s socio-economic conditions, their home environments, and increasing caregiver responsibilities, for example, are becoming more prominent. Therefore, addressing such risks is important, especially since &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0521-5&quot;&gt;older people themselves also express their concerns&lt;/a&gt; regarding these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11783&quot; style=&quot;width: 299px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11783 size-full&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/pic.jpg&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1. Domains of risks that could challenge people’s ability to live safely at home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timely identification of risks, combined with relevant clinical, behavioral and environmental interventions and support, as well as care coordination or case management, would enhance care providers’ ability to support older people’s safety at home. Prioritizing such a proactive and multidimensional approach requires combining the expertise of professionals from different disciplines of health and social care. However, our scoping review suggests that these linkages between health and social care are not yet common practice in integrated care programs for older people living at home. Investing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016885101930260X&quot;&gt;collaborative skills&lt;/a&gt; and inter-professional dynamics, as well as addressing financial and organisational incentives for collaboration, are deemed necessary to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484371/&quot;&gt;strengthen these linkages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing safety, autonomy, quality of care and quality of life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review showed that integrated care programs can potentially incorporate many ways of addressing and preventing risks. However, it remains challenging to priorities these activities in a way that is meaningful for older people. Adopting a person-centered way of working, in which professional expertise is tailored to people’s individual needs and preferences, is considered one of the core components of integrated care. In this light, it is important to acknowledge that safety is not the only aspect to consider, especially in the care provided in the context of people’s homes. People’s homes are not only care settings, but the setting of their daily lives, and older people may have preferences or make choices that value quality of life over safety. This means that safety risks cannot be addressed independently of older people’s perspectives. Instead, professionals are tasked to consider their professional perceptions in combination with older people’s preferences, and find a balance between aspects such as safety, prevention, autonomy and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in practice, this raises the question of responsibility and accountability for the safety of older people living at home. Naturally, professionals have no control over how older people live their lives and the choices they make. As such, professionals cannot be held accountable for the adverse consequences of those choices. What then, exactly, is the responsibility of health and social care professionals? And what is the responsibility of older people themselves, their families, or society? How is accountability for adverse events shared across these different stakeholders? These questions necessitate a widespread debate on our perceptions and expectations of quality of care, prevention, and ethics, as well as individual, professional and societal responsibility and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the health care paradigm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding, integrated care provides both a platform and tools that could be harnessed further to support older people living at home in a manner that balances safety with other values important to older people. However, it is important to note that efforts to integrate health and social care alone are not enough. Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being – a paradigm that recognizes the role that health, social, and environmental factors play in older people’s ability to live safely at home, and in which many different actors in the wider community play their part and perform their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

Rampant panic buying, superstore shelves emptied of toilet paper, selfish people hoarding hand sanitizer. Worries about elderly relatives, jobs, money, health care costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a serious anxiety disorder, how can you possibly cope in the current climate of fear and uncertainty? What if one of the core recommendations to help prevent disease transmission is the very pathology you've worked so hard to overcome?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contamination fears cause many individuals with OCD to compulsively wash their hands. Meanwhile, the directive to frequently wash your hands with soap &amp;amp; water for 20 seconds could be quite triggering for some. The International OCD Foundation has provided helpful resources:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iocdf.org/covid19/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Resources for the OCD and related disorders community during the COVID-19 outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;In times like these, what the experts are recommending temporarily becomes our new normal.  This may mean that you need to make some changes to your treatment, including which exposures you do, when you do them, how frequently, etc. What might normally be considered a “baseline” for people with OCD to aspire to should shift to match the recommended guidelines for as long as those guidelines are in place. A good suggestion would be to talk about the guidelines with your treatment team at your next session and go over how, if at all, your plan might change for the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important for all of us in the OCD and related disorders community to remember that this is temporary, and understand that it may feel uncomfortable. You are not going backwards in your recovery journey because the baseline changes. These troubled times will end, and you will keep doing your best in the meantime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;They also provide recommendations for what you should and should NOT do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples of &lt;b&gt;What to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set a time limit of 5 minutes &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;per day for reading news and updates from &lt;b&gt;trusted sources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;take breaks and allow yourself to do things you enjoy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;consult your treatment team &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples of &lt;b&gt;What NOT to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;avoid the temptation to learn “everything” about COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;do not excessively wash your hands &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;don’t let “social distancing” rob you of your support networks &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;

Some patients on an acute psychiatric unit may be agitated, uncooperative, or even violent, and it’s not hard to imagine the distress of anyone who has a patient spit on them as we’re all trying to remember not to shake hands. Inevitably, there will be patients who present for psychiatric admission with no respiratory symptoms, who are admitted and then become ill and are diagnosed with COVID-19. In the meantime, the potential is there for contagion to other patients on the unit, the hospital staff, and visitors to the unit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; if you have any suggestions for helpful resources or personal coping strategies, feel free to comment here or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neurocritic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;feedflare&quot;&gt;

		<updated>2020-03-16T17:57:14+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_578&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/eleonora.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of Eleonora Presani, Executive Director of arXiv&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-578 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/eleonora-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Eleonora Presani, Executive Director&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading source of open access scientific research, is pleased to welcome Dr. Eleonora Presani as its first executive director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Presani earned her PhD in astroparticle physics at the University of Amsterdam and then completed her postdoc at CERN, where she worked remotely on the International Space Station’s AMS02 instrument. After that, she was publisher at Elsevier for high energy physics journals, and her projects included SCOAP3, SoftwareX, and Physics of the Dark Universe. In the last four years her career shifted to digital product development, working as Product Manager in Scopus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As executive director, Dr. Presani now leads arXiv’s operations, as well as technical and business planning, governance, and fundraising efforts. Based in New York City, she oversees a growing staff distributed across Cornell University’s Ithaca campus, Cornell Tech in NYC, and other locations. She also coordinates a global network of volunteer advisory board members and moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am honored and thrilled to take the helm of arXiv, a groundbreaking service with incredible potential for technological growth and innovative development,” Dr. Presani says. “arXiv was a ‘disrupter’ of traditional academic publishing before the world wide web became popular, and it continues to be a central point of global scientific knowledge sharing. I have been a user of arXiv since my undergraduate study in physics, and it was such an important source of information to me throughout my academic career, as it has been and continues to be for millions of researchers around the world. I look forward to engaging with the scientific and member advisory boards, as well as the larger, global community, to take us to the next level, and make this knowledge more accessible to everyone who wants it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Presani is passionate about bringing the art and complexities of technology to a wider audience, using accessible and creative methods. She also enjoys bridging together systems and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very fortunate to have someone of Eleonora’s experience and background joining the arXiv team,” says Carol Hoover, member of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board (MAB) and Digital Information Resources Manager at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library. “She is a strong communicator with deep technical capabilities and has a solid understanding of arXiv’s purpose and mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Licia Verde, chair of arXiv’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and ICREA Professor, says, “We are proud that we can count on Eleonora, her skills, talents and expertise in scientific dissemination and the publishing ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv was founded in 1991 by physicist Paul Ginsparg and is a groundbreaking invention that popularized free, open-access scholarly research. Today, it continues to allow researchers from around the world to share scientific findings quickly, in fields ranging from astrophysics to economics. More than 180 moderators shepherd scholarly articles through the submission process, and more than 230 institutional members contribute financial support, in addition to the Simons Foundation, Cornell University, and other funders. arXiv has grown exponentially in the past decade, with more than 1.6 million submissions and more than a billion downloads in its 29-year history.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2020-03-16T12:30:32+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;The human brain is often described as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18233409&quot;&gt;most complex object in the known universe&lt;/a&gt; – we know so much, and yet so little, about the way it works. It’s no wonder then that the study of brain today encompasses an enormous range of topics, from abstract understanding of consciousness to microscopic exploration of billions of neurons. Brain Awareness Week takes place this year March 16-22. To mark the occasion, we’ve put together a list of books that explore the matter between your ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/birth-of-intelligence-9780190908324&quot;&gt;Birth of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Daeyeol Lee &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is intelligence? Does a high level of biological intelligence require a complex brain? Can man-made machines be truly intelligent? In &lt;em&gt;Birth of Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, distinguished neuroscientist Daeyeol Lee tackles pressing issues that will be key to preparing for future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-not-to-train-the-brain-9780198789673&quot;&gt;How (not) to train the brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amir Raz and Sheida Rabipour &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;143&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we improve cognitive performance through deliberate training? The short answer is yes, albeit with some caveats. In this book, the authors review data from hundreds of articles and provide an overarching account of the field, separating scientific evidence from publicity myth and guiding readers through how they should – and should not – train the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-evolutionary-road-to-human-memory-9780198828051&quot;&gt;The Evolutionary Road to Human Memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Elisabeth A. Murray, Steven P. Wise, Mary K. L. Baldwin, and Kim S. Graham &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book tells an intriguing story about how evolution shaped human memory. As our ancestors faced the problems and opportunities of their time, their brains developed new forms of memory that helped them gain an advantage in life. Sometime during human evolution, another new kind of memory emerged that ignited the human imagination, and empowered every individual, day upon day, to add new pages to the story of a life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/musical-illusions-and-phantom-words-9780190206833&quot;&gt;Musical Illusions and Phantom Words&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Diana Deutsch &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF4XXCFsD6Q-145x220.png&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is perfect pitch so rare? Why do some people hallucinate music or speech? In this ground-breaking synthesis of art and science, Diana Deutsch, one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of music, shows how illusions of music and speech—many of which she herself discovered—have fundamentally altered thinking about the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sex-lies-and-brain-scans-9780198752882&quot;&gt;Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara J. Sahakian and Julia Gottwald &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans&lt;/em&gt; takes readers beyond the media headlines. The authors consider what the technique of fMRI entails, and important ethical questions these techniques raise. Should individuals applying for jobs be screened for unconscious racial bias? How far will we allow neuroscience to go? It is time to make up our minds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-9780190495992&quot;&gt;The Elephant in the Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOGhBuYI0KI-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our brains are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better – and thus we don’t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is “the elephant in the brain.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/your-brain-on-food-9780190932794&quot;&gt;Your Brain on Food, Third Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Gary L. Wenk &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This essential book vividly demonstrates how a little knowledge about the foods and drugs we eat can teach us a lot about how our brain functions. The intersection between brain science, drugs, food and our cultural and religious traditions is plainly illustrated in an entirely new light. Wenk tackles fundamental and fascinating questions, such as: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@OUPAcademic/feed-an-injured-brain-fad1cb8b729d&quot;&gt;Are some foods better to eat after brain injury&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These books showcase some fascinating areas of brain research. But we’ve still got a long way to go before most of our questions about this intricate organ are answered. A comprehensive understanding of the brain is especially critical to combating public health issues, including rising rates of dementia and psychiatric disorders. As such, the continuing progress of brain research will be beneficial to us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Owned by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/&quot;&gt;Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/619898700/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/619898700/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How olive oil promotes brain health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-process-of-dying-during-a-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The process of dying during a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://ankursinha.in/2020/03/15/a-vimscript-function-to-select-signatures-in-neomutt.html"/>
		<id>tag:ankursinha.in,2020-03-15:/2020/03/15/a-vimscript-function-to-select-signatures-in-neomutt.html</id>
		<updated>2020-03-15T09:39:20+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;I've been using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/&quot;&gt;Neomutt&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/2017/12/16/transitioning-to-neomutt-and-friends-for-e-mail.html&quot;&gt;while now&lt;/a&gt;.
It allows me to stick to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.byobu.org/&quot;&gt;Byobu&lt;/a&gt; based terminal workflow that I'm used to.
Most importantly, it lets me use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; to write my e-mails, so I don't need to
really learn another tool now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/&quot;&gt;Neomutt&lt;/a&gt; can be configured to add a signature at the end of the e-mail, and one
can select a signature depending on various parameters, such as the senders
address using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/man/neomuttrc&quot;&gt;hooks&lt;/a&gt;. However,
sometimes, one does need to select other signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; way, of course, is to simply delete the last few lines, and
then read in the new signature using &lt;code&gt;:r &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This takes a few
more key strokes than one would like (well, than I like) so I thought I'd
dabble in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Vim_script&quot;&gt;Vim script&lt;/a&gt; a bit and automate it. Here's what I've come up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code vim literal-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&quot; A function to load the right signature when I'm using neomutt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; LoadSignature&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;signature&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Only work for mail files&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; this_file_type &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;filetype&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; this_file_type &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;mail&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;This is not a mail file! Not running!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    &quot; Get the current signature's line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Go to last line&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; saved_cursor_position &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; getpos&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Set cursor to file end and search backwards&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; cursor&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;99999999999999999999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; search&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'-- '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Confirm that the line was found&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;No signatures detected.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    &quot; Check if signature file exists&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigdir &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; escape&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;expand&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'$HOME'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'\'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Sync/99_private/neomuttdir/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigfile &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sigdir . &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;:signature . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.sig&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; filereadable&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sigfile&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; delete the current lines after the &quot;-- &quot; line&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:delstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        execute delstart . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;,$d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; Read the new signature&lt;/span&gt;
        execute sigstart . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;read &quot;&lt;/span&gt; . sigfile
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; Return cursor to wherever it was&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; setpos&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; saved_cursor_position&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;File &quot;&lt;/span&gt; . sigfile . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot; not found!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Available signature files:\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt; . globpath&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sigdir&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'*.sig'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endfunction&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, adding this to &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; would let one run &lt;code&gt;:call
LoadSignature('signature')&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; to select a signature. Each signature is a
different file with a &lt;code&gt;.sig&lt;/code&gt; file extension in the location given by
&lt;code&gt;sigdir&lt;/code&gt;, and the name of the file is the argument that needs to be given
to the function. If the signature file cannot be found, it'll list available ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite simple really, and I'm sure it can be made better, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This episode is an exploration of glial cells with R Douglas Fields, author of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2W5xVfA&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;The Other Brain: The Scientific and Medical Breakthroughs That Will Heal Our Brains and Revolutionize Our Health&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; Glial Cells outnumber the neurons in our nervous system, but until the last few years they were thought to merely support cells. Dr. Fields takes us through the discovery that they have their own signaling methods and are much more important than we ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This interview first aired in 2010, but Dr. Fields reviewed the original transcript and made no significant corrections.

 &lt;p&gt;As the global impact of COVID-19 becomes apparent, we write to share updates relevant to the arXiv community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, arXiv is unaffected by the outbreak and continues to operate as usual. Our intention is to maintain the same speed and service that our community values so deeply. As arXiv’s scientific director Steinn Sigurdsson said, “With quarantines and major conferences being cancelled, arXiv will be as important as ever to sharing research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we acknowledge that our team is global, and the situation is evolving rapidly. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our community, and we recognize that staff and volunteer moderators may need to take time off to address their personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we plan to keep papers flowing as much as possible, we need to accept that delays might happen. We hope that by keeping open communication among moderators, staff, and users, we can avoid any major disruptions. If your paper is delayed, we graciously ask for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we’ve added a&lt;a href=&quot;https://status.arxiv.org&quot;&gt; status page&lt;/a&gt; that will allow anyone to monitor and subscribe to updates around arXiv’s operational status, including planned maintenance, unscheduled outages, and other events that may affect the availability of arXiv services. More information about the status page is available on our recent&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/03/02/communicating-arxivs-operational-status/&quot;&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience and understanding during this complicated moment.&lt;/p&gt;
