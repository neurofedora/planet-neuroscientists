<p>Editors of a materials journal have resigned six years after the title was purchased by a publisher based in Canada, claiming the company “multiplied the number of publications while increasing prices at the expense of quality.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.iieta.org/Journals/RCMA"><em>Revue des Composites et des Matériaux Avancés</em></a> (<em>RCMA</em>) was published by Lavoisier, a French firm, until late 2018. It was then <a href="https://www.iieta.org/ojs/index.php/RCMA/about#:~:text=Focus%20and%20Scope,Peer%20Review%20Statement">purchased</a> by the <a href="https://www.iieta.org/">International Information and Engineering Technology Association</a> (IIETA) “without anyone being informed,” former editor-in-chief <a href="https://cv.hal.science/franciscollombet">Francis Collombet</a> wrote in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RCMA-resignation-email-5jan2026.pdf">a January 5 resignation email</a> signed by 22 other board members. </p>



<p>The resignation continues: “We, the members of the <em>RCMA</em> editorial board, can no longer serve as a guarantee for IIETA, which, by buying up quality journals, has multiplied the number of publications while increasing prices at the expense of quality.”</p>



<span id="more-133788"></span>



<p>Collombet, an emeritus professor at Toulouse University in France, had been editor-in-chief of the journal since 2017. Of the 22 others who resigned, <a href="https://archive.is/Oji0a/again?url=https://www.iieta.org/Journals/RCMA/Editorial%2520Board">all but two</a> were affiliated with institutions in France. The four editors <a href="https://www.iieta.org/Journals/RCMA/Editorial%20Board">still listed</a> on the journal’s website come from universities in China, Turkey, South Africa and Uzbekistan. The other editor-in-chief, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9227-0029">Changlong Wang</a>, a professor at Hebei University of Engineering in China, also remains on the journal’s masthead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collombet told Retraction Watch he did not contact Wang “nor any of the board members that IIETA appointed without consulting me” regarding the resignation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their resignation email, the former editors say a <a href="https://www.iieta.org/Journals/RCMA/Archive/Vol-29-No-5-2019">2018 special issue</a> covering a conference was the first produced by IIETA instead of Lavoisier. “This was the last time we were able to produce an issue of RCMA that made sense from a scientific and ethical point of view,” Collombet wrote. Since then, the editors have not had access to peer reviews, he said in the email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have never been asked to review anything,” Collombet told us.</p>



<p>Andrew Zhang, the managing editor at <em>RCMA </em>and <a href="https://www.iieta.org/ojs/index.php/IJHT/about/editorialTeam">several</a> <a href="https://www.iieta.org/ojs/index.php/I2M/about/editorialTeam">other</a> IIETA journals, responded to our questions, including about access to peer reviews, with a statement:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The review work has always been carried out by the editorial board, and the number of articles we publish is relatively small, which can be easily confirmed on our website. We also keep the APC low in order to support the journal’s ongoing operation. At the same time, we are working to fill editorial board vacancies, with the Co-EiC ensuring that regular publication continues as usual.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>RCMA</em> is one of seven journals IIETA purchased from Lavoisier, which was a result of the French publisher’s <a href="https://actualitte.com/article/22450/droit-justice/l-editeur-scientifique-lavoisier-demande-une-procedure-de-sauvegarde">financial difficulties</a>, <em>Actualitte</em> reported at the time. <em>RCMA </em>is the third journal from which the editorial board resigned en masse after changing hands from Lavoisier to IIETA. It joins our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">Mass Resignations List</a> as number 50, including 7 from 2025.</p>



<p>Computer scientist <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> was on the editorial board of the journal <em>Ingénierie des Systèmes d&#8217;Information</em>, another IIETA journal formerly published by Lavoisier. The editorial board resigned en masse in 2019 in protest of the acquisition, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ISI-resignation-26-sept-2019.pdf">an email we have seen</a>. Since then, he and his colleague <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Ophelie.Fraisier-Vannier/">Ophélie Fraisier-Vannier</a> <a href="https://themeta.news/linvasion-des-profanateurs-de-revue/">have been investigating</a> the Lavoisier-turned-IIETA journals and have documented trends in author affiliations toward institutions primarily in India, China and Iraq, and increases in publication volume and article processing fees. They will present their results at the World Conference on Research Integrity in May.</p>



<p>Fraisier-Vannier, a computer science professor at Toulouse University, shared stats specific to <em>RCMA</em>, including a more-than-doubling in annual publication volume since 2018, from 22.6 in the years 2001-2017 to 55.3 each year since 2018.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="270" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-1024x270.png" alt="" class="wp-image-133789" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-1024x270.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-300x79.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-768x203.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>RCMA publication volume by year, courtesy of Ophélie Fraisier-Vannier</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fraisier-Vannier told us before IIETA bought the journal in 2018, most — 85 percent — of the authors who published in <em>RCMA </em>had affiliations with French institutions. Since the journal changed hands, only 7 percent of published articles have been from researchers working in that country, with over two-third of the articles coming from Iraq, Algeria and India, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/la-revue-francaise-de-reference-en-matiere-d-intelligence-artificielle-est-elle-passee-sous-controle-chinois-7419089"><em>RadioFrance</em> covered</a> resignations at <em>Artificial Intelligence Review, </em>another Lavoisier journal bought by IIETA. Thirty-seven of its editors, including its editor-in-chief, resigned after the new publisher changed an already published issue to include three articles with authors at Chinese institutions, according to <em>RadioFrance</em>.<br></p>



<p>Last year, researchers <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/14766415">used Oxbridge Publishing House, Ltd</a>. to examine journal buyout trends. They noted the publisher bought journals indexed in Web of Science — as <em>RCMA</em> is — and scaled up publication volumes and costs while lowering academic standards, the researchers said. <a href="https://themeta.news/linvasion-des-profanateurs-de-revue/"><em>The Meta News</em> reported</a> in October journals are sold for anywhere up to half a million dollars.</p>

</div>


<p>“Research will help you get ahead,” British surgeon <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-ankur-khajuria/?originalSubdomain=uk">Ankur Khajuria</a> told his 16,000 followers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1w4PY6CzMl/">in a 2024 Instagram post</a> while seated in scrubs embroidered with his name. “If you want to learn about publishing, check out the research academy at <a href="http://highyielduk.com">HighYieldUK.com</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company, which offers medical students mentoring in publication, isn’t the only commercial venture for Khajuria, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon in his mid-thirties active <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/coronavirus-mental-health-storm-nhs-workers">in the media</a>, including as a contestant <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/tv-old/9751121/i-was-on-squid-game-the-challenge-unbearable-rules/">on Squid Game: The Challenge</a>. His entrepreneurship has extended into medical device manufacturing under the banner of Avance Innovations, which he founded and where he is CEO. For his professional efforts, Khajuria has been given a prestigious award and high praise from his colleagues, with one calling him &#8220;brilliant.&#8221;</p>



<p>But an investigation by Retraction Watch reveals a different view. Khajuria’s academy raises concerns about promises of publication for a price, and his prolific publication record has set off flags on PubPeer, where commenters have raised allegations of plagiarism. And Avance Innovation’s signature surgical device, while marketed for humans, has apparently been tested on only six rats and no people. Close examination by the Medical Evidence Project, an endeavor of The Center for Scientific Integrity (publisher of Retraction Watch), indicates the data in that rat study lack internal consistency, making them questionable.</p>



<span id="more-133757"></span>



<p>Khajuria did not respond to multiple requests for comment sent to his email and social-media accounts. However, some claims made by his companies were changed following our inquiries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Guaranteed publications, at a price</strong></h3>



<p>Born in India, Khajuria has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_khajuria/p/DHeD17utEXG/">described</a> moving to the United Kingdom at the age of 11 without speaking a word of English. After attending the exclusive Wellingborough School in Northamptonshire, he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-ankur-khajuria/details/education/">amassed</a> an impressive string of credentials: a medical degree from Imperial College London, a master’s in Surgical Science and Practice from the University of Oxford, and a Ph.D. from the University of Portsmouth. The last institution awarded him the degree <a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/research-degrees/phd-by-publication">based on publications he had already completed.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>He now <a href="https://highyielduk.com/about-us/">signs</a> his name: “Dr Ankur Khajuria, BSc (Hons) MBBS (Dist.) AICSM FHEA FRSPH MRCS (Eng) MAcadMEd. MFSTEd. MSc (Oxon) PhD.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Khajuria promotes High Yield UK as a way for students to follow in his footsteps of success. Billed as a “Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Masterclass,” the company has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250114033943/https:/highyielduk.com/courses/systematicreview/">guaranteed</a> medical students and junior doctors a peer-reviewed paper for £898, according to archived promotional materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some customers have given High Yield UK high marks.</p>



<p>“This has been the best investment into my professional/academic endeavours thus far,” a medical student named <a href="https://www.kiandaneshi.com/">Kian Daneshi</a> wrote in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250722090051/https:/www.trustpilot.com/review/highyielduk.com">Trust Pilot review</a> of High Yield UKs <a href="https://www.instagram.com/highyielduk/reel/C-QDt9OPRSM/">“research fellowship”</a> last year, a review that has since been removed. “I managed to work on 10 projects in total, with 5 guaranteed 1st/co1st authorships.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But our reporting on commercial publication-guarantees has raised concerns about <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">the ethics of the trade</a>. The practice is sometimes employed by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/25/journal-pulls-papers-following-retraction-watch-investigation/">for-profit paper mills</a>. A review of Khajuria’s own prodigious output – he boasts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1ue8EMiE3a/">more than 100 publications and book chapters</a> in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=cQ1_orwAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">the last decade</a> – shows he typically writes papers with teams of students in conjunction with one other more established author. At least five of Khajuria’s publications show apparent plagiarism, text recycling, or statistical irregularities, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Ankur+Khajuria">according to commenters on PubPeer</a>.</p>



<p>Two of Daneshi’s papers with Khajuria <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E779F971CD32592C5AE30D03D35BA7">have significant overlap in their text</a>, as noted by an anonymous commenter on PubPeer.</p>



<p>“The text similarity is most marked in the conclusions which only differ by 7/112 words,” the commenter observed. “The conclusions are presented as independent scientific findings yet differ only by changing the procedure name and a few others.” (Daneshi did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p>Khajuria hasn’t addressed these issues as he has turned even minor publishing milestones into life lessons for his followers.</p>



<p>“Thrilled for my recent acceptance in <em>The Lancet</em>, with an impact factor of 202.7,” he wrote on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dr-ankur-khajuria_lancet-research-publication-activity-7057996372049817600-TL4-/">in 2023.</a> This “acceptance” was of <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00924-8/fulltext">a three-paragraph letter to the editor</a>, but for Khajuria it became another teachable moment.</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re a medical student or doctor striving to achieve similar success, I encourage you to stay committed to your goals and continue sharpening your skills,” he added. “A great way to do this is by exploring resources like the research courses offered by highyielduk.com.”</p>



<p>His peers have praised his work.</p>



<p>“He is one of the most brilliant surgeons in terms of scientific work that I know,” said <a href="https://alfredohoyos.com/">Alfredo Hoyos</a>, an editor at <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</em> who has collaborated with him. Hoyos coauthored <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39100865/">a bibliometric analysis</a> with Khajuria and Daneshi, which found that “outcomes” and “complications” were important themes in research on Brazilian butt lifts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting a surgical device for humans, tested only on rats</h3>



<p>Hoyos told us he helped Khajuria revise his published study of Avance Innovation’s signature product: the ORASIS device. Developed by Khajuria and billed as&nbsp;“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240714235944/https:/avanceinnovations.unicornplatform.page/">the future of vascular anastomosis surgery</a>,” the 3-D printed wafer promised to help surgeons join blood vessels faster, safer and more easily than ever before by using microfluidic channels to draw blood away from a surgical site, keeping the area clear for suturing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The device won the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dr-ankur-khajuria_innovation-surgery-microsurgery-activity-7308891394616545280-fXbB">2024 Cutler’s Surgical Prize</a> from the Royal College of Surgeons in England and was <a href="https://www.plasticsurgery.org/for-medical-professionals/publications/plastic-surgery-resident/news/resident-travel-scholars-share-their-takeaways-from-pstm23-in-austin">a runner-up</a> in the American Society of Plastic Surgeons’ Innovation Challenge. According to promotional materials, the “FDA-registered” device could “reduce operative time by 30 percent” and yield “potential cost savings over $1B in the U.S. market alone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a newly released <a href="http://medicalevidenceproject.org/GRIMU">forensic analysis by the Medical Evidence Project</a> of the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/abstract/2024/01000/application_of_a_microsuction_background_device.24.aspx">only published study</a> supporting those statements found the study’s statistical results could not be reproduced. The 2024 study in question, published in <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</em>, involved six rats and no human subjects. It compared the time required for experienced surgeons to suture animals’ femoral arteries with and without the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the paper, the authors reported a 21 percent reduction in procedure time — not 30 percent of the total operative time as claimed by Avance — yet even that modest improvement remains uncertain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Heathers, director of the Medical Evidence Project, said when he and David Grimes, a Retraction Watch Sleuth in Residence, checked the data for internal consistencies using a newly developed technique, “The <em>p </em>values from the primary results were either inconsistent or impossible, and some of the secondary results were not reproducible.”</p>



<p><a href="https://gabrielcrone.com/">Gabriel Crone</a>, a graduate student researching statistical problems in psychology at York University in Toronto, who <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09593543241311861">has previously published on Heathers’ </a>methodologies, said he agrees the anomalies uncovered by the Medical Evidence Project report are “somewhat concerning.” But without more information on how the original statistical tests were run, or access to the raw data, Crone added, it’s not possible to determine the cause of the anomalies.</p>



<p>Josh Destafano, a spokesperson for Wolters Kluwer, which publishes <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</em>, says that it does not comment on specific authors and their research, but noted that “if one of our journals receives an indication that there has been wrongdoing to manipulate research, we review that inquiry based off of COPE guidelines.” The Royal College of Surgeons of England did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Avance previously posted testimonials to ORASIS from anonymous surgeons and offered instructions for purchasing the device on its website, saying the device has been “<a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumers-medical-devices/are-there-fda-registered-or-fda-certified-medical-devices-how-do-i-know-what-fda-approved">FDA-registered</a>.” Device registration is generally required if a manufacturer plans to produce or distribute a medical device in the U.S.</p>



<p>Late last year, following our inquiries, a disclaimer was added to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250516024530/https://avanceinnovations.unicornplatform.page/">the website</a> that read, “All product information provided on this site is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute marketing, promotion, or sale of the device.” The website has since gone offline.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://bjoern.brembs.net/2026/01/procurement-before-prestige/">Procurement Before Prestige</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-text-align-right"><em>How audit rules and public infrastructure could break science’s publishing monopolies.</em> A<em>n English version of my post for the Verfassungsblog from <a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/rechnungshof-statt-redaktionsschluss/">December 19, 2025</a>.</em></p>



<p><strong>Scientific journals that feel straight out of 1665, prices that could come from a MrBeast meet-and-greet, privacy as lax as Facebook, and reliability as dubious as a TikTok lifehack: it was long past time for the EU to free science—if anyone would let it.</strong></p>



<p>On “Palindrome Day” — 23 May 23 — something happened that few outside the world of science policy noticed, and even fewer expected. Under the anodyne title <em>“<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/">The Hazards of Scholarly Publishing</a>,”</em> the Council of the European Union, in its 3949th session, adopted formal conclusions on scholarly publishing.</p>



<p>At first glance, this sounds like bureaucratic filler. What dangers could possibly lurk in the act of publishing research papers? Paper cuts? The analog era is long gone. And yet, as the Council implicitly recognized, it has not vanished nearly fast enough.</p>



<p>The central anachronism is still with us: commercial scientific publishers. These companies are leftovers from the age of printed journals, yet they continue to dominate the digital dissemination of research. After World War II, a shrewd businessman named <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1756196199502351&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oTwjFcsV-XqQ1SMbHauwr">Robert Maxwell </a>spotted the profit potential of this niche. Through companies like Pergamon Press — now part of Elsevier — he helped turn scientific publishing into a gold mine. The legacy of those profits even extended, indirectly, to his daughter, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse">convicted sex trafficker </a>Ghislaine Maxwell, whose financial independence — in part due to generous funding by university libraries — helped place her in the orbit of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>



<p><strong>Profit over merit</strong></p>



<p>This history matters because scientific publishing today remains one of the most profitable legal industries on Earth. Profit margins of <a href="https://blogs.uwe.ac.uk/psychological-sciences/standards-and-profits-in-academic-publishing-all-publishers-and-open-access-arrangements-are-not-the-same/">up to 40 percent</a> are routine. The EU Council identifies one core reason: publishers typically take control of researchers’ intellectual property. Since each scientific paper is published only once, this creates a built-in monopoly. With no real competition, publishers can charge prices that strain — or exceed — the budgets of public institutions.</p>



<p>At the same time, digitization has reduced <em>publishing costs </em>dramatically. Printing, shipping, and storage have essentially disappeared. However, <em>prices </em>were kept nearly constant, so libraries now pay up to ten times the <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27468.2">actual cost of producing an article</a>. The result is a system where public money flows steadily into private hands — with little to show for it.</p>



<p>Quality, for one, has not improved. Quite the opposite. Publishers have invested remarkably little in quality control or modern digital functionality. Many of the most expensive journals now publish some of the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full">least reliable science</a>. The so-called “replication crisis” has become <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002870">so visible</a> that even Donald Trump referenced it in a 2025 executive order on “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/restoring-gold-standard-science/">Restoring Gold Standard Science</a>.”</p>



<p>For authors, the submission process has barely evolved since email submissions were allowed in the early 1990s. Reviewers work largely pro bono and with minimal publisher support. And the final product — the scientific article — has about the same digital functionalities as a photographed tombstone.</p>



<p>If publishers charge ten times their costs, why do they “only” earn 40 percent profits instead of 90? Some of the answer lies in executive perks — private jets and luxury yachts do not come cheap. But another, more troubling investment has grown steadily: digital surveillance.</p>



<p>In 2021, a commission convened by the German Research Foundation <a href="https://www.dfg.de/resource/blob/174924/datentracking-papier-en.pdf">warned</a> that unregulated tracking on publisher platforms could violate academic freedom itself. This concern is not hypothetical. Together with the Society for Civil Rights, I have filed a <a href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/themen/demokratie/wissenschaftstracking">data-protection complaint</a> against unlawful data processing on publishers’ websites with the data-protection authority of Baden-Württemberg. Scientific publishers have quietly become global data brokers.</p>



<p><strong>The EU tries to break the lock-in</strong></p>



<p>Why has science tolerated this arrangement for so long? The answer is structural dependency. Early-career researchers, often precariously employed, must publish in established journals to have any chance at a permanent position. Libraries, in turn, must subscribe to those same journals so researchers can read and cite them. The EU Council aptly calls this a “lock-in.”</p>



<p>The lock-in benefits those who publish in the most expensive — pardon, the most <em>prestigious</em> — journals. And of course these authors pass this lesson on to their students: if you want to stay in science, publish in prestigious journals first, worry about reliability second &#8211; or not at all. The perverse outcome is that the journals most rewarded by the system are often those <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full">producing the least reliable results</a>. In cancer research, only about 12 percent of findings can be <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67995">reproduced</a>. No deep knowledge of evolutionary biology is needed to see how that can happen: selection pressure rewards visibility, not quality.</p>



<p>When the EU warns of “the hazards of scholarly publishing,” it is not fretting about excessive footnotes. It is pointing to wasted public funds, violations of fundamental rights through data tracking, and an incentive structure that systematically rewards unreliable science while penalizing rigor. Above all, it is pointing to a dependency that has left science unable to reform itself.</p>



<p>The Council’s proposed <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9616-2023-INIT/en/pdf">remedy </a>is strikingly direct. Member states and the Commission are urged &#8220;to invest in and foster interoperable, not-for-profit infrastructures for publishing based on open source software and open standards, in order to avoid the lock-in of services as well as proprietary systems, and to connect these infrastructures to the EOSC&#8221; (European Open Science Cloud). Translated into plain language: replace commercial journals with public infrastructure.</p>



<p>This infrastructure would handle not only articles, but also data, software, and code. It would prioritize quality assurance, functionality, and accessibility — not profit. And it is already taking shape. Since 2023, the EU-funded platform <em><a href="https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/">Open Research Europe</a></em> has begun operating. From 2026 onward, researchers from participating countries will be able to publish there without fees. The platform is being rebuilt entirely on open-source software, with a decentralized architecture that institutions across Europe can help maintain.</p>



<p>In just two years, the EU has moved from declarations to implementation — achieving more than commercial publishers have in decades.</p>



<p>Follow this path to its logical conclusion, and the ambition becomes clear: to break publishing monopolies entirely, replacing journals as they have existed since 1665 with a decentralized, public system. Given the failures of the current model, this is not radical. It is overdue.</p>



<p>Even before the Council’s conclusions, many scientists — myself included — <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.230206">had been calling for a science-led alternative</a>. In that sense, the EU’s decision is a rare example of evidence-based policy done right. Where science has become trapped, the European Commission has offered a way out.</p>



<p>But infrastructure alone will not suffice. A replacement does not automatically become the default. Authors today are not truly free to choose where they publish, and incentives will not change on their own.</p>



<p><strong>Merit over exclusivity</strong></p>



<p>Two additional steps could help. First, research funders could require support for Open Research Europe — and for local implementations of its infrastructure — as a condition of grants. This would not be unprecedented; funders already impose many technical and administrative requirements.</p>



<p>Second, audit courts (government accountability offices, GAOs) could intervene. To this day, many institutions negotiate individually with legacy publishers. Historically, this made legal sense: publishers controlled exclusive access and hence enjoyed the &#8220;single-source exemption from procurement rules&#8221;. Today, they provide standardized publication services. Most already use the same technical formats, such as the JATS standard. This makes services substitutable — and substitutability triggers competitive procurement rules.</p>



<p>Audit courts/GAOs should therefore require institutions to put publication services out to public tender, just as they do for IT hardware or cleaning contracts, or pretty much anything else. The European Commission has already shown how this works. For its publishing needs as a public institution, rather than negotiating behind closed doors with major publishers, it conducted a competitive process. The result was Open Research Europe.</p>



<p>If audit courts/GAOs were to take on their responsibilities in this matter, scholarly institutions would have to treat their publishing needs as competitively and transparently as all their other procurement.</p>



<p>Some will object that academic freedom includes the freedom to choose where to publish. But this argument is easily countered in two ways. First, scholarly authors already lack meaningful choice, they need to publish where they must. Second, academic freedom rights are primarily a shield against state interference — not a blank check to fund practices that waste public money, violate rights, and undermine scientific reliability.</p>



<p>So those who still wish to publish in legacy journals should be free to do so — at their own expense. Once a robust alternative exists, it is unlikely many will choose otherwise. And without authors, there will not be many journals left, where researchers can be forced to publish in.</p>



<p>The next step for Europe could now be to seek partners beyond its borders. As more institutions join a decentralized, nonprofit publishing network, others will follow — just as they did with the Internet in the 1990s. Scientific publishing could finally catch up to the digital age.</p>

<p>Researchers change the name they publish under for many reasons, most of which aren’t fodder for a Retraction Watch story. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/10/author-changes-name-publishes-10-papers-in-journals-that-banned-him/">Trying to skirt a publishing ban</a> is one that is. And another case that recently caught our attention may be in a similar category.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researcher <a href="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/1915604">Abduladheem Turki Jalil</a> is currently affiliated with the University of Thi-Qar in Nasiriyah, Iraq. His first published paper appears to be <a href="https://www.gjphm.org/index.php/gjphm/article/view/7">a survey on breast cancer</a> from 2019. Jalil’s publications then took off, rising exponentially to <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=2022&amp;as_yhi=2022&amp;q=author%3A%22Abduladheem+Turki+Jalil%22+OR+author%3A%22AT+Jalil%22+-retraction+&amp;btnG=">more than 100</a> in 2022. According to Elsevier’s Scopus database, <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57219215491&amp;source=sd-apx">Jalil has an h-index</a> of 44, and on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/abduladheem16/">his Instagram profile</a>, he claims to be among the world’s top 2% scientists (he <a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/8">no longer</a> is).</p>



<p>Jalil’s massive output has not failed to attract attention. In 2022, then-sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/18/nick-wise-sleuth-publisher-taylor-francis/">Nick Wise</a> began <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22n.+h.+wise%22+AND+authors%3A%22turki+jalil%22">flagging the researcher’s papers</a> on PubPeer, providing screenshots of <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22n.+h.+wise%22+AND+%22facebook%22+AND+%22advert%22+AND+authors%3A%22turki+jalil%22">Facebook ads selling authorship</a> of articles that matched several of Jalil’s publications. Wise also wrote a <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/10/19/the-incredible-collaborations-of-renaissance-men-and-women/">blog post about authorship-for-sale networks</a> that mentioned Jalil and his extraordinary productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133748"></span>



<p>Jalil has 18 retractions<a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dabduladheem%2bturki%2bjalil"> in our database,</a> and more than 90 of his articles, or about a third of all his publications, have been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22Abduladheem+Turki+Jalil%22">flagged on PubPeer</a>.</p>



<p>Last year, Jalil began calling himself <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAD-1741-2021">Abduladheem Al-Attabi</a> on his papers. The website of the foundation <a href="https://nabea.pub/">he founded, Nabea Al-Ajyal</a>, which publishes <a href="https://napress.nabea.pub/journals/">several journals</a>, hosts conferences and offers editorial services to researchers, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251209164955/https:/nabea.pub/about-us/">referred to him</a> as Al-Attabi until recently. But after we contacted him, the name of the foundation’s CEO and owner changed to “Mustafa Tareq Shanshool” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251220172521/https://nabea.pub/about-us/">on the website</a>.</p>



<p>On Facebook, however, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/abduladheem.turki.jalil/">he is still</a> Abduladheem Turki Jalil.</p>



<p>A post on X by the anonymous watchdog account @Spottingthespot suggested the name change is <a href="https://x.com/Spottingthespot/status/1883493031674044573/photo/2">an attempt to bury the long list of retractions</a>.</p>



<p>Jalil did not respond to our request for comment. But following <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-country/iraq/">our stories</a> on research fraud in Iraq this fall and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1486551055974520">subsequent national media attention</a> to such issues, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=k14pHnMAAAAJ">his Google Scholar profile was removed</a> and his name<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8403-7465"> on ORCID hidden</a>.</p>



<p>Some of Jalil’s collaborators may be familiar to our readers. His most frequent coauthor, Yasser Fakri Mustafa, a dean at the University of Mosul, has had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/05/yasser-fakri-mustafa-iraq-mosul-university-dean-paper-mills-retractions/">more than a dozen articles pulled</a> after being linked to paper mills, as we reported in September. Then there is Lakshmi Thangavelu, <a href="https://www.saveetha.com/collaborations">dean of international affairs</a> at Saveetha University, or SIMATS, in Chennai, India. As we reported in 2023, Thangavelu, who also has<a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dLakshmi%2bThangavelu"> several retractions</a> for paper mill-related issues, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/21/exclusive-researcher-outs-indian-universitys-publishing-scam-after-it-fails-to-pay-him/">offered money</a> to international researchers for adding her institution as an affiliation on their papers, thus boosting Saveetha’s publication metrics.</p>



<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, Jalil’s output dropped rapidly after 2022. He has published only seven articles <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:%22abduladheem+al-attabi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5">since he began</a> using his new name last year and just <a href="https://mejc.sums.ac.ir/article_50506.html">a single new paper</a> in 2025.</p>



<p>The journals he publishes at <a href="https://napress.nabea.pub/">Nabea Al-Ajyal Foundation Press</a> also appear to have taken some headwinds. Three of the titles – <em>Trends in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology</em>, the <em>Journal of Biomedicine and Biochemistry</em> and <em>Future Dental Research</em> – <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kv3MbgFSgtSDnEGkA2JacrSjunRu0umHeZCtcMeqO5E/edit?gid=2104690845#gid=2104690845">were delisted</a> in March from the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> after failing to meet best practices. Jalil was editor-in-chief of two of these publications – the <a href="https://biomedbiochem.nabea.pub/biomedbiochem"><em>Journal of Biomedicine and Biochemistry</em></a> and <a href="https://tpb.nabea.pub/tpb"><em>Trends in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology</em></a> – but has since stepped down.</p>



<p>Not everyone seems to be worried about Jalil’s tarnished publication record. In August, the editor-in-chief of Begell House’s <a href="https://www.begellhouse.com/journals/critical-reviews-in-oncogenesis.html"><em>Critical Reviews in Oncogenesis</em></a>,<a href="https://wdst.begellhouse.com/search/details/7cfa2a0a20adf115.html"> Benjamin Bonavida</a>, invited Jalil to edit a special issue on exosomes in cancer, according to a letter <a href="https://x.com/ZarbaWatch/status/1982234307507654759">shared on X</a> in October. Dozens of papers by Bonavida have been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22Benjamin+Bonavida%22">flagged on PubPeer</a> and we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=bonavida">written about him twice</a>.</p>



<p>“As a leader in the field, I am taking this opportunity to extend you a personal and exclusive invitation to be the Editor (or Co-Editor with a colleague) for one issue beginning 2026,” Bonavida wrote to Jalil.</p>



<p>Bonavida did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

</div>


<p>An appellate court has dismissed a legal challenge by a cancer researcher against her former institution, ruling the university’s misconduct investigation and disclosure process did not violate her right to due process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, The Ohio State University determined that Flavia Pichiorri, a former postdoc in the lab of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=carlo+croce">Carlo Croce</a>, was responsible for manipulating and reusing images in four publications, spanning from her time in Croce’s lab through establishing her own lab at Ohio State. Pichiorri <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/26/exclusive-city-of-hope-cancer-researcher-goes-to-court-to-fight-misconduct-finding/">sued the Ohio State Board of Trustees in April 2023</a> alleging the release of its misconduct findings to “prestigious journals” and her new employer violated her due process rights, defamed her, and inflicted emotional distress, among other claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in a <a href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/25a0352p-06.pdf">December 19 ruling</a>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded Pichiorri’s complaint never identified an adequate “liberty interest” worthy of procedural protections under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. The appeals court affirmed a lower court’s decision tossing the complaint for failure to state a constitutional claim.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133726"></span>



<p>Richard Goldstein, a Boston attorney who represents scientists involved in research misconduct cases, said the Sixth Circuit’s decision is consistent with those of other appellate federal courts in similar cases. However, the case is particularly important because it&#8217;s one of the first to focus on the regulations mandating confidentiality, he said.<br><br>“In general, scientists have had little or no success in the federal courts when it comes to challenging the acts and omissions of institutions in research misconduct cases,” Goldstein told Retraction Watch. “This case is somewhat unique because it specifically addresses the issue of confidentiality, which is one that rarely gets attention in the court system, but confidentiality is a very significant element of the institutional process and it is a matter of great concern to scientists.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pichiorri and her attorneys did not return messages seeking comment. A spokesperson for Ohio State told us: “We’ll let the ruling speak for itself.” </p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OSU-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">court filings</a>, attorneys for the school had asked the court to dismiss the suit, arguing Pichiorri’s due process claims were without basis, and that her state claims were preempted by federal regulation. Because Congress has manifested “a clear intent to occupy the field of research misconduct,” there is “no room for plaintiff’s state-law claims,” attorneys for the university wrote.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Pichiorri worked at Ohio State from 2004 to 2016, first as a postdoctoral researcher in Croce’s lab, then as a research scientist, and finally as an assistant professor of hematology. She left “by all accounts on good terms” in August 2016, according to a summary of the case in the court’s decision, for City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, Calif. Pichiorri’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/flavia-alessandra-pichiorri-67475a150/">LinkedIn profile</a> and <a href="https://flaviapichiorri.com/">personal website</a> state she is a professor there, but a spokesperson for City of Hope told us the institution no longer employs Pichiorri.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>After her departure, Ohio State received allegations that some of her work contained falsified data. Following an investigation, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02002-5">university found Pichiorri had committed research misconduct</a> and barred her from future employment with the university, according to the decision summary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The institution also recommended that two of Pichiorri’s papers should be retracted and another corrected. Of the two articles recommended for retraction, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610822004974">one has been retracted</a> and the other marked with an <a href="https://rupress.org/jem/article/219/11/e2012095009272022e/213516/Expression-of-Concern-In-vivo-NCL-targeting">expression of concern</a>. A correction was made to <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/5290/text/">the third paper</a>. Pichiorri has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820342411">two</a> <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2009.10.014">other</a> retractions on papers she wrote with Croce.</p>



<p><em>Nature</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02002-5">reported the university’s findings</a> in 2022, calling them one of “the first determinations of research misconduct relating to work done in Croce’s lab.” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=carlo+croce">Croce</a>, once a high-profile cancer researcher at Ohio State, now has <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCroce%252c%2bCarlo%2bM">15 retractions</a>. He has filed several defamation lawsuits unsuccessfully, and reportedly owes his attorneys <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/judge-orders-cancer-researchers-art-collection-seized-to-pay-fees-from-failed-libel-suit/">more than $1 million</a>.</p>



<p>In her complaint, Pichiorri alleged Ohio State did not simply disclose its findings when they came out in 2020, but “re-sent the report to others and repeated the misconduct findings over the years.” The institution alerted “prestigious journals” about the report as late as July and November 2022 and notified City of Hope, according to the lawsuit.<br><br>The disclosures caused Pichiorri ongoing “public humiliation and emotional distress,” and “harmed her reputation and standing in the research community,” she claimed in her suit. The consequences included the National Institutes of Health removing her from a “coveted panel” on which she had long served, and City of Hope investigating “all her past work funded by the National Institutes of Health,” according to the suit. While City of Hope found no other misconduct, the investigation reduced “her role as a senior leader” and “one of her employees quit as a result,” according to her complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The appeals court, however, ruled Pichiorri failed to meet the legal standard required to show that a government-related defamatory statement violated constitutional due process. That standard, called the stigma plus test, requires a plaintiff to demonstrate the defamation not only damaged a person’s reputation but was accompanied by a tangible loss of a liberty interest, such as a job or license termination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Neither of Pichiorri’s two alleged injuries show an actionable change to a cognizable interest,” the appeals court wrote in its decision. In addition, the court pointed out Pichiorri did not claim City of Hope took any personnel action against her, such as “a discharge, demotion, or the like.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rather, she alleges (vaguely) that she suffered a ‘diminished role’ at the City of Hope and that a staff member resigned,” judges wrote. “Her complaint identifies no more than a harm to her ‘future employment opportunities,’ … at the City of Hope because she now has a worse reputation as a researcher. That harm falls short under the stigma-plus test.”</p>



<p>Given the “lack of details” about the NIH panel, the court added there was also no “plausible claim” that the removal rose to the required level of harm.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The court also struck down Pichiorri’s claims that Ohio State officials engaged in “conscience-shocking behavior” when they disclosed her research misconduct allegations to medical journals and the City of Hope Medical Center more than two years after their investigation was completed. Pichiorri argued these disclosures “shock the conscience” because they ran afoul of a then-applicable confidentiality rule by the Office of Research Integrity. The rule requires an institution to maintain the confidentiality of “records or evidence” that identify the subjects of an investigation, except as may otherwise be prescribed by applicable law, according to court documents.<br><br>But judges said substantive due process protects a person’s privacy only when the government’s disclosure of personal information could lead to harm such as,&nbsp; “sexual … personal, and humiliating details.” Pichiorri’s allegations did not include the type of harms found protected in past cases, the court ruled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In sum, neither Pichiorri’s claim that the Ohio State officials defamed her nor her claim that they violated a confidentiality regulation plausibly alleged conscience-shocking behavior,” judges said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In his opinion, Goldstein said the court’s ruling is an endorsement of practices institutions have been engaging in for some time.<br><br>“It does not mean institutions can breach their confidentiality obligations, but the case is significant because, if an institution lets the cat out of the bag, either deliberately or by accident, the scientist under investigation has little recourse in federal court,” he said. “ORI’s new regulations, which are more explicit than the ones the court looked at in this case, would permit the disclosures OSU made here.”<br><br>Goldstein&nbsp; referred to <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/blog/new-ori-final-rule-guidance-documents-released">updated guidance</a> from ORI, which took effect January 1, 2026, amending the agency’s recommendations about confidentiality, investigation timelines, and the required records for research misconduct proceedings, among other topics.<br><br>The new regulations explicitly allow disclosure to journals if there is a “need to know,” Goldstein said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I suspect that the institutions will feel more comfortable with the procedures that they have adopted, and as a result, I think it will encourage them to expand the circle of people and entities who are told of a misconduct proceeding,” he said. “This could dramatically increase the likelihood a misconduct investigation will become a matter of public record.”</p>

</div>


<p>When two recent retraction notices mentioned data were “destroyed in a flood,” we were skeptical. We’ve seen water take the blame for missing data before. </p>



<p>In 2019, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/09/03/a-flooding-accident-engineer-has-seven-papers-retracted-at-once/">we wrote about</a> a chemical engineer who said his suspicious data were lost in a laboratory flooding accident. The researcher lost nine papers as a result, as we previously covered. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/29/concerns-about-image-manipulation-sorry-the-data-were-lost-in-a-flood/">Three years earlier in 2016</a>, researchers in Sri Lanka lost a paper after claiming they, too, had lost their data in a flood. We couldn’t verify the researchers’ claims.</p>



<p>But this time, thanks to a public records request, we’ve confirmed there was in fact a deluge at the researcher’s lab.</p>



<span id="more-133706"></span>



<p>The most recent papers, published in the <em>American Journal of Physiology: Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology</em>, had been flagged on PubPeer for image similarities in several figures, eventually leading the corresponding author to seek out the lost data. A subsequent university investigation found the data were destroyed in a flood, according to the <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00037.2008_RET">retraction</a> <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00159.2011_RET">notices</a> published in August.</p>



<p>The investigation took place at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, where <a href="https://www.kumc.edu/sanant.html">Shrikant Anant</a>, the corresponding author of both papers, is currently associate research director and a professor. He was formerly the associate dean for research at the institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both notices state the articles were retracted at Anant’s request. We submitted a public records request to learn more about what happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our request for the university investigation was denied. But documents we did obtain confirm Anant’s lab at KU <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Soce3622@wh12121210330.pdf_Redacted.pdf">requested replacement equipment</a> following a flood on October 27, 2012. The deluge originated from a broken eyewash station on the sixth floor of the building. The fifth floor had the most water damage, and the fourth floor — where Anant’s lab was located — “was not as bad as the fifth but still had heavy flows of water coming down,” according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Cates-East-Water-Events.pdf">a university report</a>. </p>



<p>At the time of the first retracted study, <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00037.2008">published in 2008</a>, Anant was a professor at the University of Oklahoma. He had moved to KU by the time the second paper was <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00159.2011">published in 2011</a>. Both articles describe potential treatments for colon cancer and have been cited 29 and 27 times respectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anant told us he was first alerted to issues with the papers via PubPeer, where each garnered attention in 2018 when two different users highlighted image issues in the works. In 2021, sleuth Kevin Patrick <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/ADA562DB2AA80D6BCC68E2952A1412">commented</a> that an image in the 2008 paper “seems to make an appearance” three times in two different figures, and all three iterations “seem to appear with different brightness,” he wrote under his known pseudonym “Actinopolyspora biskrensis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/ADA562DB2AA80D6BCC68E2952A1412">also wrote</a> in March 2025 that a gel strip in the 2008 paper was “uncomfortably similar” to a strip in a <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00540.2007">third paper</a> Anant coauthored and published in <em>Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology</em>, which has been cited 23 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anant did not respond to our questions regarding whether the university investigated this paper as well. The ethics office at the American Physiological Society, which publishes the journal, did not respond when we asked if the journal planned to look into the third paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0FC5D18DB12555D23B21458D5C9971">August 2018 PubPeer comment</a> on the 2011 paper highlighted an image in two figures, noting an apparent “vertical stretch” in one of the bands. In March 2025, Patrick wrote that in two figures showing arrays of lab dishes, a dish from one set seemed to appear in the other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked for more information on the 2012 flood, including which labs were affected and how much damage was caused, the university’s press office did not respond.</p>
