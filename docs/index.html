<p>An article by Genentech scientists received an extensive correction in January for multiple instances of image duplications after comments on PubPeer spurred the authors to review the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the correction “inadvertently omitted” an additional duplication, and will be updated after Retraction Watch brought the matter to the journal’s attention, a representative for the publication said. The sleuth who identified the additional duplication said the original article should have been retracted instead of corrected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0604044103">Death-receptor activation halts clathrin-dependent endocytosis</a>,” appeared in July 2006 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, with a correction issued that September. It has been cited 99 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131146"></span>



<p>Most of the authors, including the first and corresponding authors, were affiliated with the biotech company Genentech, based in South San Francisco. When the paper was published, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the former president of Stanford University, was senior vice president for research drug discovery at the company, according to an <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/152571/tessier-lavigne-cv.pdf">online CV</a>. Tessier-Lavigne <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/19/stanford-president-resigns-over-manipulated-research-will-retract-at-least-3-papers/">stepped down</a> from Stanford in 2023 after <em>The Stanford Daily</em> reported on questions about his research, including from his <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/17/internal-review-found-falsified-data-in-stanford-presidents-alzheimers-research-colleagues-allege/">time at Genentech</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In June 2023, an anonymous user on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9A35BEC1F3D18F4B8B5AC8DA8BAF8C#1">commented</a> on elements of figure 2 of the paper that appeared “more similar than expected.” Another user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9A35BEC1F3D18F4B8B5AC8DA8BAF8C#2">chimed in</a> with an additional finding in the same figure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three of the paper’s authors <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9A35BEC1F3D18F4B8B5AC8DA8BAF8C#4">responded</a> in August 2023. The post, signed by first author Cary Austin, second author David Lawrence, and last author Avi Ashkenazi, all Genentech employees, stated the editors of <em>PNAS</em> had alerted them to the query.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We agree that the images are problematic and are undertaking a comprehensive examination of the image data in the article,” the three authors wrote. “We will then update journal editors to determine an appropriate course of action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 3 of this year, <em>PNAS</em> published a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425433121">correction</a> detailing about two dozen instances of splicing, both vertical and horizontal, and duplication in five of the paper’s figures. The authors stated they found the issues with the help of an expert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because the source X-ray films or image files are no longer available, the authors have repeated these experiments,” the notice stated, with reference to a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.24.619217v1">preprint</a> the authors posted on bioRxiv in October 2024. “The new data confirms the original results, reaffirming the experimental conclusions,” they added.</p>



<p>“The editors have evaluated and approved the authors’ response and maintain confidence in the paper,” the notice concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">David Sanders, a biologist and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">scientific sleuth</a> at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., reviewed the original article at our request to look for any issues not noted in the correction. He identified an additional duplication in figure 12, which the correction stated exhibited “potential vertical splicing,” but not duplication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to the paper’s authors, <em>PNAS</em>, and Genentech with Sanders’ finding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prashant Nair, a representative for the journal, told us the editorial office had “inadvertently omitted” mention of the duplication in figure 12 while finalizing the correction text with the authors. The journal will update the correction notice to include the duplication, Nair said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The figure “was part of the editor’s original evaluation,” he said. “As stated in the published Correction notice, the editor reviewed the information provided in the authors’ response and remains confident in the findings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors did not respond to our query. Karen Ring, senior manager for science communications, public affairs and access at Genentech, said the company was “aware of the potential issue you refer to in Figure 12 and are working with PNAS to address it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ring did not respond to our question about whether any other work by the authors was under review. “Genentech is a company founded on principles of scientific excellence and integrity and we remain committed to those principles today,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sanders said the original <em>PNAS </em>article “with so many problems” should be retracted. “It simply wasn’t valid.”</p>



<p>The journal has previously allowed authors to correct a paper with reference to data published in a preprint. In <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2415544121">August</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419360121">October</a> of last year, <em>PNAS</em> published two corrections for the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0800135105">same paper</a> in which data had been reused. The authors “performed confirmatory experimentation” posted in a preprint, according to the initial correction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The practice allows authors “to escape responsibility for the original article,” Sanders said. “I find that an unsatisfactory solution.”</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: This post responds to a Feb. 13 article in </em>The Atlantic<em>, “</em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/02/rfk-kennedy-vaccines-scientific-literature/681681/"><em>The Scientific Literature Can’t Save Us Now</em></a><em>,” written by Retraction Watch cofounders Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky.</em></p>



<p>The contentious issue of what — and more importantly who — to believe, when it comes to medical science, is at a critical moment. Watchdog organizations such as Retraction Watch provide a great service to science and the public, by exposing junk scientists and their products, helping to disinfect the field with their sunlight. I commend Mr. Marcus and Dr. Oransky for their sustained efforts in this meta-discipline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, policing the scientific literature is a tricky business. In particular, one must be careful to apply the same standards one demands of others to one’s own work. Agreeable as many of their points are, Marcus and Oransky’s article discrediting Mawson and Jacob’s study (which Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited during his confirmation hearings) falls woefully short of meeting even basic scientific editorial standards. This failure imbues their article with the same yellow hue that they decry in others’ journalism.</p>



<span id="more-131140"></span>



<p>Resorting to a combination of circumstantial evidence and <em>ad hominem</em> characterizations, Marcus and Oransky insinuate that the study, which purports to show a link between current childhood vaccinations and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), is scientifically flawed and thus not to be trusted. Yet nowhere do they provide any substantive critique of the study itself. Indeed, it is unclear from their article whether Marcus and Oransky even read the study they seek to discredit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather, their argument runs as follows: The study’s first author is no longer an academic. The journal that published it was not indexed by an organization with scientific credibility. Several editorial board members seem shady. The journal can’t even be bothered to spell an editor’s name correctly. And, by the way, the hypothesis Mawson and Jacob investigate has already been “thoroughly debunked” and is therefore pointless to question.</p>



<p>Really? So henceforth, no investigator shalt ever study whether vaccines are associated with, not just autism, but the spectrum of NDDs (as Mawson and Jacob do)? Which vaccines are Marcus and Oransky specifically referring to? All vaccines? Or only the MMR? As they must know, it is nigh impossible to prove scientifically that a hypothesized association doesn’t exist, let alone for all vaccines, and a roster of disorders. Would they extend this inference then to every new vaccine that enters the market? What if someone’s findings don’t align with what is already “known”? Should they be tossed out? Buried?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not clear what relevance Mawson’s employment status has to the validity of his and his co-author’s study. Many scientists work at private research institutes, or for corporations, outside of academia. That two editorial board members have, according to the claim, tainted scientific reputations, is circumstantial. The lower scientific stature of <em>Science, Public Health Policy &amp; the Law</em> might seem damning, were it not for the fact that, as Marcus and Oransky’s own work has shown, publication in a venerated journal is no guarantee of a study’s reproducibility, or even veracity. Conversely, publication in low-tier journals may be the terminal fate not only of shoddy research, but unpopular ideas. The former deserves no defense; the latter does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worse, Marcus and Oransky sandbag their own article with unsubstantiated, dubious claims, meant to advance their argument but ultimately leaving it naively exposed to Hitchens’s razor (“<em>What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence”</em>). How could they possibly know that “far more papers should be retracted than are retracted”? Not every publication with errors discovered post hoc need beget a retraction. Scientific journals commonly publish errata. Further, on what grounds can they plausibly claim that “most” published papers “serve no purpose whatsoever”? I allege they do not have exclusive insight into what purpose a given paper serves, especially considering posterity. Short-run citations are not the same as purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On my read of <a href="https://publichealthpolicyjournal.com/vaccination-and-neurodevelopmental-disorders-a-study-of-nine-year-old-children-enrolled-in-medicaid/">Mawson and Jacob’s paper</a>, it appears to be a straightforward analysis of 47,155 Florida Medicaid claims records from 1999 to 2011. Nothing immediately screams “junk.” The authors use methods common for other claims-based case-control studies, and control for confounding effects of age, gender, and congenital anomalies in their analysis. Their paper describes a relatively balanced assessment of the study’s strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the study was rejected without review from other journals, it is unclear what the basis for rejection was, but this editorial action is common and not necessarily an indication of study quality. Publication bias, which refers to how a study’s results affect its publication status, could easily be a factor influencing preceding editorial decisions. In any case, the records are publicly available, and the methods appear duly described, enough to make the study reproducible, should anyone want to analyze it independently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My prior research in vaccine safety, infectious diseases and neurologic disorders, treatment of vaccine-preventable cancers, and quality of medical scientific literature have made me no champion of the vaccine-autism theory. As for disclosures, I have consulting agreements and research funding from pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck, makers of vaccines. I love vaccines, but I will defend scientists who want to study their safety, and report what they find, where they are able to find a receptive outlet, irrespective of how well their findings comply with other studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We all should defend studies against sloppy attempts to discredit them. Because in the current tumult of distrust in experts, it has never been more crucial that Marcus and Oransky, and influential media that provide them a platform, retain their scientific high ground. Status and slick innuendo do not confer the right to skirt rigorous discourse when it comes to critiquing science. Weak arguments from strong voices also do our field a disservice. “Settled science” claims are lazy and readily backfire when thrust upon a distrusting public. They also betray a humanistic disconnect, which I suspect lies at the root of this distrust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every month I see patients who refuse to consent for the best known cancer treatment, despite my recommendation, for various personal reasons. Often these reasons are irrational. Many are rooted in misunderstandings courtesy of junk science. My job isn’t to castigate patients for their irrationality. It is first to establish their goals of care. Within that, I can convey my interpretation of the present state of the pertinent medical science. Then, it’s up to them. Among my most important ethical obligations, described in the Declaration of Geneva, is to respect patients’ autonomy, even if it conflicts with what I believe to be in their best interest. Policing junk science can slow, but won’t eliminate irrational beliefs. Nor will policies that threaten individual autonomy, such as making vaccines coerced or compulsory. This merely fuels distrust.</p>



<p>With respect to vaccines and autism, based on work from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30753348/">DeStefano et al.</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25898051/">Jain et al.</a>, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464417/">others</a>, I would conclude that the balance of scientific evidence to date does not support the hypothesized association. This can be stated without having to malign studies that cut against the grain. Yet such mouthfuls are insufficiently sensational, and do not lend themselves to pithy soundbites in mainstream media — which is the point here. Scientific discourse and mainstream journalism operate by different standards. The conventional forum to raise concerns about an article is within the journal’s pages, as a Letter to the Editor, typically alongside a rebuttal from the author(s). Since <em>The Atlantic</em> has chosen to dedicate its pages to scientific discourse, I trust it will provide space for rigorous dissent.</p>

He previously studied vaccine safety at the Center for Health Studies in Seattle and his current research areas include treatment of vaccine-preventable malignancies and quality of scientific literature.</em></p>

<p>The authors of a paper on how incentives influence IQ have requested an expression of concern after a recent retraction altered the results of their study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 20, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/20/stephen-breuning-nimh-misconduct-retraction/">we reported</a> that a paper by embattled researcher and child psychologist Stephen Breuning was retracted decades after an investigation found evidence of scientific misconduct. Breuning’s papers came into question following a 1987 report from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which found he “knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly” engaged in research misconduct and fabricated results in 10 NIMH funded articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, six of Breuning’s papers have been retracted. The latest retracted article, originally published in 1978, was not part of the investigation but came about “due to concerns about the integrity of the data reported and other issues identified within the NIMH Final Report that clearly established a pattern of ongoing scientific misconduct,” the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022440578900043?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a> read.</p>



<span id="more-131128"></span>



<p>Data from that paper were included in a 2011 meta-analysis, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1018601108">Role of test motivation in intelligence testing</a>,” published in <em>PNAS,</em> which compared IQ scores under incentivized and standard testing conditions. An <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2502439122">expression of concern</a>, published February 20 in <em>PNAS</em>, stated that when the authors removed the retracted paper’s data and re-analyzed the remaining 18 experiments, they found the results for this component of their work “changed substantially,” the notice read. “At the request of the authors, we are issuing this expression of concern and will update readers as more information becomes available.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The expression was requested by three of the authors, <a href="https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/angela-duckworth">Angela Lee Duckworth</a>, <a href="https://publichealth.indiana.edu/about/directory/Patrick-Quinn-quinnp.html">Patrick D. Quinn</a>, and <a href="https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/donald-lynam/">Donald R. Lynam</a>. Duckworth did not respond to a request for comment. </p>



<p>Research psychologist Russell Warne has been studying Breuning’s work, and, as we reported in our earlier story, had reached out to Duckworth and <em>PNAS </em>about the inclusion of Breuning’s data. “It is unfortunate that Dr. Duckworth, her coauthors, the editors, and the PNAS readers were victimized by Stephen Breuning&#8217;s fraud,” Warne told Retraction Watch in an email. “But a wrong is now being righted, and I applaud the courage that Dr. Duckworth and the <em>PNAS </em>editors have shown in dealing with this issue.&#8221;</p>

                In the late 19th century, Karl Weierstrass invented a fractal-like function that was decried as nothing less than a “deplorable evil.” In time, it would transform the foundations of mathematics.

<p>A four-year-old paper claiming conversion therapy reduced same-sex thoughts in gay men has been retracted after criticism from other researchers prompted further review of the work.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-222/v2">Efficacy and risk of sexual orientation change efforts: a retrospective analysis of 125 exposed men</a>,” published in <em>F1000Research </em>in March 2021, found conversion therapy (referred to in the paper as sexual orientation change efforts) was “effective and safe.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>F1000Research</em> is an open publishing platform where peer review takes place after publication. The title is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science but does appear in Scopus, which reports the paper was cited seven times.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131114"></span>



<p><em>F1000Research</em> <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-222">retracted</a> the article on February 4 after two independent external reviews, according to the notice. “The methodology, and subsequent statistical analysis, employed by the study cannot support the conclusions around efficacy and effectiveness,” the notice reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study’s lead author is D. Paul Sullins, a sociology professor at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. We wrote about him <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/08/25/publisher-flags-paper-sex-parenting-neo-nazi-group-cites/">in 2017</a> when his paper on same-sex parenting received an expression of concern after it was cited on posters distributed by a neo-Nazi group.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As conversion therapy has a controversial history, so do its papers. Many face scrutiny, and have been retracted for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/06/17/catholic-medical-journal-pulls-paper-on-conversion-therapy-over-statistical-problems/">statistical problems</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/02/journal-retracts-70-year-old-article-on-homosexuality-for-long-discredited-beliefs-prejudices-and-practices/">antiquated beliefs</a>. They can even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/12/30/conversion-therapy-statements-pulled-from-homosexuality-paper/">perpetuate stereotypes</a> about the gay community. Despite some authors’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/30/psychologists-want-to-retract-old-papers-about-conversion-therapy-elsevier-says-no/">regrets about publishing</a>, the papers can end up <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/04/12/controverial-homosexuality-reparative-therapy-paper-staying-put-despite-authors-regrets/">staying in the literature</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversion therapy has been <a href="https://theconversation.com/conversion-therapy-is-discredited-and-increases-risk-of-suicide-yet-fewer-than-half-of-us-states-have-bans-in-place-161330">discredited</a> by many members of the scientific community and has been denounced by the American Medical Association, the American Counseling Association, and the American Psychological Association. Despite this, Sullins and his coauthors sought to “overcome ideological polarization in data acquisition and studies of this controversial topic,” he <a href="https://researchers.one/articles/24.09.00002">wrote online</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper was originally published in <em>F1000Research</em> in March 2021, but a second version appeared five months later that had been revised to include a missing citation and corrected two misreported numbers. The retraction applies to both versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February 2024, a concerned researcher who asked Retraction Watch to stay anonymous raised concerns to <em>F1000Research </em>about the article in an email seen by Retraction Watch. The researcher alleged flaws in the research design, including a failure to establish common treatment methodology, duration of treatment, or accreditation of the people administering the therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sullins <a href="https://researchers.one/articles/24.09.00002">reposted an updated version</a> of the paper in September 2024 on the platform Researchers.one after<em> F1000Research</em> did not allow the authors to make further revisions, he said. “Rather than permitting the journal <em>F1000Research</em> to suppress evidence and debate on this issue, we hope in this forum to instead enable more debate and consideration of the evidence, from any ideological point of view,” he wrote in the post’s comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sullins told us in an email the authors are in the process of republishing the study at the <em>Journal of Open Inquiry in the Behavioral Sciences</em>, which claims to “share science, not control narratives,” <a href="https://unsafescience.substack.com/p/the-journal-of-open-inquiry-in-the">according to one of its founders</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in the Researchers.one comments, Sullins posted his correspondence with <em>F1000Research</em>. The emails from F1000 revealed the paper was also retracted because it bore similarities to another article. An unnamed representative from <em>F1000Research</em> said “the underlying data presented in the above article is the same data used in the article: ‘&#8217;Effects of Therapy on Religious Men Who Have Unwanted Same-Sex Attraction.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That paper, which was <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0024363918788559?journalCode=lqra">retracted in 2020</a>, shares a coauthor with the <em>F1000Research</em> paper: <a href="https://saintjosephpsychologicalclinic.com/">Paul Santero</a>, a psychologist at Saint Joseph Psychological Clinic in San Diego.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santero did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same comment thread, Sullins said the authors “do not agree that declining to cite a retracted study constitutes some sort of nondisclosure,” but decided to add the citation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The study has come under scrutiny before. In 2021, shortly after the paper was published, a commenter on PubPeer using the pseudonym “Crotalaria dewildemaniana” pointed out <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/085220A82C58195A9F368B2CF5E57C">ethical concerns</a> with the work. The commenter noted the American Psychiatric Association <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/getattachment/3d23f2f4-1497-4537-b4de-fe32fe8761bf/Position-Conversion-Therapy.pdf">opposes conversion therapy</a> and many states ban the practice, a number that has since risen from 13 <a href="https://counseling.northwestern.edu/blog/conversion-therapy-in-the-united-states-accessible/">to 28</a>, according to Northwestern University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-222#article-comments">lengthy comment</a> published on the article in 2023, <a href="https://psych.indiana.edu/directory/faculty/lorenzo-luaces-lorenzo.html">Lorenzo Lorenzo-Luaces</a>, a researcher at Indiana University in Bloomington, questioned the use of language in the article like “forgiveness of sins,” which he said implied a religious perspective that could have influenced the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark Robinson, a media relations manager for Taylor &amp; Francis, which owns <em>F1000Research</em>, told us more than one person contacted <em>F1000Research </em>regarding potential issues with the paper, which led to the investigations.</p>



<p>An external reviewer agreed with Lorenzo-Luaces, according to the correspondence posted on Researchers.one.The reviewer also pointed out that “discussing same sex behavior and/or orientation as something that goes into remission is also problematic.”</p>



<p>“Given the problem with the methods here, it is not possible that the statistics could be solid,” the reviewer wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the comments on the Researchers.one version of the paper, Sullins noted that version “corrects a coding error in the reported percentages in Tables 3, 5 and 6, which slightly strengthens the results.” This version also includes a disclosure of the retracted Santero study, Sullins said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sullins also affirms the religious perspective Lorenzo-Luaces criticized, stating the authors “made it obvious” that the men in the sample were “extremely religious,” which could have influenced their positive experience with conversion therapy. However, the authors removed the term “remission” from the new version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The anonymous researcher who emailed Retraction Watch also noted the study authors did not disclose potential conflicts of interest, including Sullins’ ties to “anti-LGBT” organizations such as the <a href="https://ruthinstitute.org/">Ruth Institute</a>, for which he is a <a href="https://ruthinstitute.org/about/fr-sullins/">senior research associate</a>. No competing interests were disclosed in the study.</p>



<p>Sullins told us his association with these groups is “personal, not contractual or financial.” He continued: “Not that these other affiliations are a secret. Many are disclosed on my c.v., which &#8230; can be discovered from a short web search,” he wrote.</p>



<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note, February 24, 2025: Paul Sullins wrote to us after this story published to point out his affiliation with the Ruth Institute was disclosed <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-222/v2">on the original paper</a>, which we list above as an example of an undisclosed conflict of interest. </em></p>

                <p>Since its founding over twenty five years ago PLOS has been dedicated to advancing open science, ensuring that knowledge is accessible to all, for the benefit of all.&nbsp; We believe that for science to maximally benefit society and inform policy, its core principles&mdash;integrity, transparency, inclusivity, and collaboration&mdash;must be upheld. These same principles are the foundation of our mission and guide our unwavering commitment to champion science that is independent, rigorous, and open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are deeply concerned about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00525-1">a range of recent US Executive Orders </a>that collectively have the potential to dismantle the US scientific enterprise as it has existed for the past 70 years.&nbsp; We are already seeing the impact of these disruptions and censorship efforts within our communities.&nbsp; Any attempts to restrict knowledge creation or censor its dissemination&mdash;whether through limiting research topics, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00367-x">mandating or restricting specific language</a>, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/trump-dei-cdc-fda">removing scientifically and medically valuable data from government websites</a>&mdash;undermine the core principles of scientific inquiry and obstruct progress. And they stand in direct conflict with our core values, our mission and our editorial policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS will not compromise on issues of scientific rigor and editorial integrity. Our editorial policies, designed to safeguard the integrity of the peer review process and ensure the accuracy, reliability, and accountability of published research, remain unchanged. We will not approve changes to terminology or removal of data that compromise the scientific accuracy of content. Requests to remove legitimate authors from manuscripts violate our authorship policies which are grounded in principles of credit, accountability and transparency. Our editorial policies ensure that we work within a framework of agreed-upon standards and practices that foster consistency and maintain accuracy across the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research thrives when rooted in the open exchange of ideas, different perspectives, and international cooperation. A variety of perspectives in the editorial process is essential to ensure a broad range of expertise and experiences inform how research is conducted, interpreted and evaluated. At PLOS, we seek diversity because more expert voices make for better science. We are proud to collaborate with a global community who dedicate their time, energy and expertise to ensuring&nbsp;that research serves society in the most impactful way possible.</p>



<p>We are actively working to understand the evolving implications of these directives and the disruption they have brought.&nbsp; Many researchers and institutions are facing difficult challenges and we want to reassure our community that we remain dedicated to the advancement of open science. Openness enables rigorous review and objective analysis, allowing the self-correcting mechanisms of science to function and ensuring research stands up to scrutiny. And open science facilitates innovations that continue to improve virtually every aspect of human and planetary life.</p>



<p>PLOS will always anchor our decisions in our values and our principles. And we will continue to speak up vocally for open, independent science.</p>

<p>A Wiley journal has retracted more than two dozen articles in the last few months for peer review issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The articles, which appeared in <em>Environmental Toxicology</em>, have been retracted in batches, the latest on February 16-17, with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?Ppub=&amp;field1=Title&amp;field2=AllField&amp;field3=AllField&amp;publication%5B%5D=15227278&amp;publication=&amp;sortBy=Earliest&amp;startPage=&amp;text1=Retraction&amp;text2=&amp;text3=">previous sets </a>in January and November.</p>



<p>The retraction notices of all 26 papers read in part:</p>



<span id="more-131105"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following an investigation by the publisher, the parties have concluded that this article was accepted solely on the basis of a compromised peer review process. Therefore, the article must be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All authors of the retracted papers are affiliated with universities in China. Most of the corresponding authors had email domains not associated with a university or research organization, containing random sequences of letters and numbers, a potential sign of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/09/20-ways-to-spot-the-work-of-paper-mills/">paper mill activity</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from the Wiley press office told us in an email the journal had “identified concerning peer review patterns associated with manuscripts in progress as well as some previously published papers.” The batches in November and January were retracted as part of the same investigation, the representative confirmed. They did not immediately respond to our request for additional information regarding the February retractions or inform us whether they plan to continue retracting papers.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Wiley has had mass retractions for peer review anomalies. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/03/wiley-medical-journal-retracts-dozens-of-paper-for-manipulated-peer-review-with-more-to-come/">June 2024</a>, <em>International Wound Journal</em> retracted dozens of articles for “compromised” peer review. And since late 2022, the publisher has retracted more than 11,000 papers from Hindawi journals, which Wiley acquired in 2021.</p>



<p>Nine of the retraction notices stated that one or more of the authors disagreed with the retractions. <a href="https://en.cpu.edu.cn/zlf_en/main.htm">Zheng Lufeng</a>, associate professor at China Pharmaceutical University in Nanjing, was co-corresponding author of the retracted article “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24204">MiR-375 impairs breast cancer cell stemness by targeting the KLF5/G6PD signaling axis</a>.” He told us in an email the authors were not involved in the peer review process. “This is the editor’s responsibility,” he said. Lufeng also wrote he hoped the editors would amend the retraction notices to indicate the retractions had “nothing to do” with the authors.</p>



<p>Aside from Lufeng, none of the corresponding authors responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the papers retracted so far, all but two were published in 2024 issues or online under Wiley’s “<a href="https://authorsupport.wiley.com/s/article/what-is-early-view#:~:text=Question%3A-,What%20is%20%22Early%20View%22%3F,offered%20by%20many%20Wiley%20journals.">EarlyView</a>” service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notices stated all articles were “retracted by agreement between the journal Editor-in-Chief” and Wiley Periodicals LLC. Paul B. Tchounwou, associate dean at Morgan State University, was the editor-in-chief of the journal until November. The current editor-in-chief is Christyn Bailey, a full-time editor at Wiley. Neither Tchounwou nor Bailey responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> is a search engine for scientific publications. There are alternatives like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a> (not a search engine but a database, often used in the medical field), <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> (also a database, but with richer annotations), <a href="https://citationgecko.azurewebsites.net/">Citation Gecko</a> (to discover networks of forward- and backward-citations, which is handy to check for missed papers), all of which I&#8217;m using from time to time. Or new tools based on large language models like <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">perplexity.ai</a> or <a href="https://www.litmaps.com/">litmaps</a>, which still have to show their value in the long run. Personally, I prefer Google Scholar. It casts the widest net among all these tools, covering not only journal publications but also conference preceedings, thesis publications, patents. This strategy also indexes crap from predatory journals, which is usually easy to spot for a scientist, but also some hidden gems that you would otherwise miss.</p>



<p>Google Scholar can be used not only as a search engine but is at the same time a tool to assemble the publications associated with a single researcher in a Google Scholar profile. Here are my pieces of advice on how to make the best use of your Google Scholar profile as a researcher in neuroscience (and related disciplines). Let me know if I missed something important!</p>



<p><strong>1. Create a public Google Scholar profile</strong></p>



<p>Once you have a Google account, it is pretty straightforward to create <a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html">a Google Scholar profile</a>. As soon as you have own publications associated with this profile, it also makes sense to make the profile public &#8211; this renders you searchable via Google scholar as a person with an ID. Since most people in the neurosciences are using Google Scholar (with a larger minority of medically-oriented or traditional researchers still preferring PubMed), this small step makes you more visible as a identifiable researcher, without having to go back to OrcID or other identifiers.</p>



<p><strong>2. Curate your publications</strong></p>



<p>From time to time, you will be informed by Google Scholar about new publications that are associated with your name. You can tell the algorithm to automatically update new publications (I&#8217;d choose this option only if you are very busy) or to decide by yourself each time (recommended). In the latter case, don&#8217;t forget to forward updates from Google Scholar in case you are not using the associated gmail account for your daily business.</p>



<p>Such a manual curation is a good use of your time to make your Google Scholar page useful to others and more readable. To do so, delete publications that are erroneously associated with your account. If  publications that are listed separately are versions of the same study, merge them as shown below:</p>

<p>Sometimes, Google Scholar decides to include non-peer-reviewed scientific work in its search results, for example your thesis. I noticed that Google Scholar also includes posts of this blog post if they are structured like a scientific article and include a list of references. For example, the following email showed up when I posted a blog post reviewing papers on <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2024/07/08/four-recent-interesting-papers-on-astrocyte-neuroscience/">astrocytic physiology</a>:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="1024" height="732" data-attachment-id="7924" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/02/18/how-to-use-google-scholar-as-a-neuroscientist/image-6/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1.png" data-orig-size="2038,1458" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1.png?w=640" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7924" style="width:541px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>I believe it is nice that Google Scholar also picks up these instances of scientific output in its results, but I don&#8217;t include them on my Scholar profile in order not to confuse the profile&#8217;s typical human viewer.</p>



<p>In theory, it is possible to add your own items to Google Scholar, based on Github repositories or other scientific output that is not found by Google Scholar. However, I would not recommend it since it may appear as if you were trying to artifically inflate the number of publications in your profile.</p>



<p><strong>3. Annotate shared first authorships</strong></p>



<p>As most tools for literature search, Google Scholar normally does not display &#8220;equally contributing&#8221; first authors. For many projects in experimental neuroscience, however, two or more authors are &#8220;equally contributing&#8221;, without being reflected by Google Scholar&#8217;s author list. To fix this issue and to make your Google Scholar profile a more accurate reflection of your contributions to  publications, you can click on an article, hit the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button and add asterisks (*) to the equally contributing first authors. Note that this procedure will update the author list in your Google Scholar profile but not in the Google Scholar search results. For example, an item may then appear like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="147" data-attachment-id="7925" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/02/18/how-to-use-google-scholar-as-a-neuroscientist/image-7/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2.png" data-orig-size="2522,363" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2.png?w=640" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7925" /></figure>



<p><strong>4. Set up personalized alerts to stay up to date</strong></p>



<p>Apart from being a useful web display of your publications, Google Scholar can also be used to keep you updated about current research related to your own publications. To do so, go to your Google Scholar profile page and click on the &#8220;Follow&#8221; button in the top right corner. This window will pop up:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="652" data-attachment-id="7927" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/02/18/how-to-use-google-scholar-as-a-neuroscientist/image-9/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4.png" data-orig-size="1510,962" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4.png?w=640" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7927" style="width:394px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>Hit the checkbox &#8220;New articles related to my research&#8221;, and you will be informed via email about publications related to your own (published) research. From my experience, &gt;90% of these &#8220;related publications&#8221; are irrelevant and can be ignored, while the remaining &lt;10% are useful. It&#8217;s certainly better than relying on bluesky or other social media or going through table of contents of journals. The updates are quite independent of journal names and not biased by the usage of social media by a specific researcher. Therefore, it is also possible to spot relevant and well-done research published in smaller journals or by less prominent researchers, without losing track of &#8220;high profile&#8221; studies.</p>



<p>Of course, if you don&#8217;t have yet any publications, it does not make so much sense to receive alerts about publications related to your work. In this case, go to the Google Scholar profile page of your supervisor, scientific hero, postdoc colleague or anybody who in your opinion does great research. Then, hit the &#8220;Follow&#8221; button on his/her Google Scholar profile page and select &#8220;New articles related to this author&#8217;s research&#8221;, and you will be updated about research close to your interests.</p>



<p>Of course, getting updates about new research can be quite stressing sometimes, and it is impossible to fully stay up to date with the literature. If you have the feeling that you cannot keep up with the &#8220;related&#8221; literature anymore, that&#8217;s okay. Just cancel your Google Scholar alerts, do some real science and come back to literature search at a later timepoint. Of course, you may miss some of the hottest developments. But following all the newest trends and hot topics can also be stressful, and we all should do our very best to purge any sources of unnecessary stress and distraction from our work life as researchers.</p>



<p><strong>5. Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Google Scholar. But it is always imporant not to get sidetracked by pure citation counts. Don&#8217;t judge a person based on their profile with its citation counts per year and numbers of publications. Always pick one or two first-author publications that you can judge scientifically, and check out what is behind the title, in the abstract, the figures, the methods sections, or the acknowledgements. Citation metrics can be manipulated and gamed, and nothing replaces the deep dive into real science.</p>



<p>Google Scholar also comes with quite a good documentation. Check <a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html#setup">it out</a>!

<p>Nick Wise had a prolific start to his sleuthing journey. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">July 2021</a>, the fluid dynamics researcher started looking for tortured phrases in published papers, and has since had a hand in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=%22Nick+Wise%22+">at least 1,000 retractions</a>. He also helped identify unique phrases for the Tortured Phrases Detector, a function of the Problematic Paper Screener that identifies signs of misconduct. Last month, Wise teamed up with other research fraud hunters in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00212-1"><em>Nature </em>article</a> that outlined “five essential steps to combat industrialized scientific misconduct.”</p>



<p>His success in calling out research misconduct helped him land a full-time job.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7284533579181666304/">In January</a>, Wise started a new position as research integrity manager at publisher Taylor &amp; Francis. We spoke with him about how his new position will impact his career trajectory and how he plans to use his sleuthing past in his new position.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131089"></span>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch:</strong> As research integrity manager, what will you be doing?</p>



<p><strong>Wise: </strong>I will be primarily investigating research integrity concerns, whether raised internally or externally, for both published and unpublished works. The cases could be relatively simple plagiarism or image manipulation concerns for a single paper, or larger cases involving tens or even hundreds of papers across multiple journals, including where we may suspect paper mill involvement.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch:</strong> What from sleuthing will you take into your research integrity job?</p>



<p><strong>Wise: </strong>I wouldn’t have this job without my sleuthing work, and I think almost every aspect of it transfers to my new job. I think that my knowledge of paper mills and selling authorships will be particularly useful, and there have already been cases where I have recognized names from investigations I conducted before starting the job.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>Will you be able to continue sleuthing outside of your job?</p>



<p><strong>Wise:</strong> I feel that, in effect, I am sleuthing from 9 to 5 every day, so I don’t have a great desire to keep going into the evening, and that’s before getting into potential conflicts of interest. I’m very interested in what other sleuths find and I’m still in contact with them. It’s important to my work to keep track of new investigations and developing trends in research misconduct.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>Any interesting lessons from your first few weeks on the job?</p>



<p><strong>Wise: </strong>I thought I was fairly cynical about the kinds of misconduct that goes on, but it turns out I am not cynical enough. Being able to look behind the curtain and see reviewer’s reports, communications between authors and editors etc. really opens your eyes to what some people are trying to get away with.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>What are your thoughts on sleuths being compensated for their work? Would having a paid opportunity to continue your sleuthing have altered your career trajectory?</p>



<p><strong>Wise:</strong> I would have loved to be able to be employed full time by an organization to investigate research integrity issues, with the ability to look at any publisher. However, as far as I know, no such positions exist. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/02/introducing-the-retraction-watch-sleuth-in-residence-program/">Retraction Watch sleuth in residence</a> scheme is excellent, but it is just for a single year. There are other initiatives to pay sleuths for investigations, however that would be as and when required, so the sleuth would still need other employment. There are no stable options.</p>



<p>As I said, I feel that I am a paid sleuth at Taylor &amp; Francis. I am restricted to one publisher, but there’s more than enough to keep me busy.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>What are your thoughts on the integration of AI in publishing practices? (T&amp;F supports “<a href="https://taylorandfrancis.com/our-policies/ai-policy/">responsible use</a>” of genAI.)</p>



<p><strong>Wise: </strong>My personal opinions on generative AI are that it is a tool that can be used competently or incompetently, for good or bad. It can do things that other tools have been able to do for years that we have no problem with: search, translation, grammar and spell checking, etc. It can also generate entire papers, along with hallucinating references to texts that do not exist and creating anatomically implausible diagrams.</p>



<p>There is no point banning the use of generative AI as there is no way to tell for sure that something is AI-generated. Even if we could say for certain that some content was the output of a generative AI, an author could say that they had used the AI for spell checking, or some other acceptable task. I think that all publishers can do is ask people to use AI responsibly. Pandora’s box is already open.</p>

<p>The 3,000+ journals in the Springer Nature portfolio published over 482,000 articles in 2024, according to data published this week on a new <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/advancing-discovery/research-integrity">research integrity page</a> on the company’s website. The page also shares a data point you don’t typically get from publishers: 2,923 articles were retracted.</p>



<p>The numbers are a small part of the page, which outlines the tools the publisher uses for quality control, what prompts a research integrity investigation, and what happens during such investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher breaks down the retraction numbers a little more:</p>



<span id="more-131073"></span>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>61.5% (1797 articles) of the retractions were of papers published before January 2023.</li>



<li>38.5% (1126) of retractions were for articles published after January 2023.&nbsp;</li>



<li>41% of the retractions for content published after January 2023 were for open access articles.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We asked Springer Nature why they chose to share these numbers, and who the intended audience of the page is. Alice Henchley, director of communications, integrity, ethics and editorial policy for the Springer Nature Group, replied: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We created the page to help provide more information on how the accuracy and integrity of research is maintained, particularly in light of the growing interest in how new technologies are impacting the research system. We hope that this transparency will be helpful to the community and further demonstrate our commitment to scientific integrity, both in terms of the rigour we apply prior to acceptance, and the responsibility we take for updating the publication record when concerns are identified after publication.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Among the Springer Nature retractions in the Retraction Watch Database, <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>tops our list. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/22/sleuths-spur-cleanup-at-journal-with-nearly-140-retractions-and-counting/">reported in August</a> that the journal, which lost its impact factor in June, was cleaning up hundreds of papers for “suspicious citations, tortured phrases and undisclosed use of AI in the journal’s articles.” </p>



<p>Also high on the list: <em>Scientific Reports</em>, which has made headlines here for a retraction on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/11/all-the-red-flags-scientific-reports-retracts-paper-sleuths-called-out-in-open-letter/">an article full of tortured phrases </a>and others for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/19/papers-in-scientific-reports-and-their-expressions-of-concern-raise-questions/">concerns over paid authorship</a>; and <em>Applied Nanoscience</em>, which<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/26/springer-nature-journal-pulls-nearly-three-dozen-papers-from-special-issues/"> retracted 34 papers</a> in special guest-edited issues riddled with problems.</p>

                The library sorting problem is used across computer science for organizing far more than just books. A new solution is less than a page-width away from the theoretical ideal.
