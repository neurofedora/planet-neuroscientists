<p>A neuroscientist who studies alcohol and stress faked data in two published studies and two grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), according to a U.S. government watchdog.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://psychologyneuroscience.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/lara-s-hwa-phd">Lara S. Hwa</a>, an assistant professor of neuroscience at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, since January 2021, “engaged in research misconduct by knowingly or recklessly falsifying and/or fabricating data, methods, results, and conclusions in animal models of alcohol use disorders,” the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-hwa-lara-s">concluded in its findings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI found Hwa, who has not immediately responded to our request for comment, “falsified and/or fabricated experimental timelines, group conditions, sex of animal subjects, mouse strains, and behavioral response data” in the grant applications and papers. The articles were published when she was a postdoc at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. </p>



<span id="more-128076"></span>



<p>One of the grant applications in which ORI said Hwa submitted fake data, “Long-term Alcohol Drinking Alters Stress Engagement of BNST Circuit Elements,” was funded for $734,145. The other grant application was “administratively withdrawn” last December. Hwa was a principal investigator on another grant, not included in ORI’s findings, that received $84,218 from 2013-2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59709">Alcohol drinking alters stress response to predator odor via BNST kappa opioid receptor signaling in male mice</a>,” one of the papers included in ORI’s findings, appeared in <em>eLife</em> in July 2020. The authors <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/74986">retracted it</a> in November 2021 “based on error [sic] in methods and data reporting, which they identified following publication, that cast doubt on the conclusions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extensive retraction notice stated that five co-authors, not including Hwa, the first author, notified the senior author of an error in the published data. Then, the authors “deeply examined the results and identified several more errors” in the paper, which are detailed in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For several figures, the authors determined the published data “did not match the raw data values,” and after re-analyzing the raw data, “there were multiple changes in statistical significance, leading to an overall change in the interpretation of the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The changes that would be required to correct the paper are sufficiently extensive that its overall conclusions must currently be considered to be in doubt. All of the authors are in agreement that retraction is the appropriate course of action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0279-2">Predator odor increases avoidance and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the prelimbic cortex via corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 signaling</a>,” published in <em>Neuropsychopharmacology</em> in 2018, has not been flagged. As part of the settlement agreement Hwa agreed to, she must request that the paper – which has been cited 24 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – be corrected or retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hwa also agreed to four years of supervision of her research, beginning on August 18 of this year. During the four years of supervision, she also may not serve on any NIH advisory or peer review committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Baylor University has not immediately responded to our request for comment on the findings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/10-billion-snow-crabs-disappeared-alaska">10 billion snow crabs have disappeared off the Alaskan coast. Here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p>From 2018 to 2021, an estimated 10 billion snow crabs disappeared from the eastern Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, with the population plummeting to record lows in 2021. Researchers had only speculated as to what happened to the missing crabs. Now, a study in the Oct. 20 <em>Science </em>finds that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk7565" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a marine heat wave probably spurred a mass die-off</a>, in part by causing crabs to starve.</p>



<p>“It’s a fishery disaster in the truest sense of the word,” says Cody Szuwalski, a fishery biologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle.</p>





<p>On average, snow crabs bring in about $150 million of annual revenue for Alaskan fisheries. In the 2021-2022 crabbing season, that revenue fell to around $24 million. With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">marine heat waves becoming more common</a> because of human-caused climate change, the future of such fisheries and arctic marine ecosystems, more broadly, is uncertain, researchers say (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>)<em>.</em></p>



<p>The new research can help fishery managers anticipate and prepare for similar events such as the crab collapse in the future, Szuwalski says, particularly when it comes to getting proper disaster aid to affected fishers quickly.</p>



<p>Usually, cold, arctic water makes ideal habitat for snow crabs (<em>Chionoecetes opilio</em>) and other crustaceans. As winter’s thick sea ice melts, the frigid meltwater settles on the seafloor, creating a cold-water pool with temperatures below 2˚ Celsius. Crabs thrive in this chilly sanctuary on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. But a marine heat wave in the region in 2018 and 2019 prevented the usual amount of sea ice from forming, and, according to yearly temperature and population survey data, the cold pool never appeared and then the crab population collapsed.</p>



<p>Szuwalski and colleagues used computer models to analyze temperature data combined with population surveys, fishing catch numbers and lab experiments to look for drivers behind the sudden collapse. Two causes stood out: higher water temperatures and an initially dense crab population.</p>



<p>The water temperature probably didn’t kill the crabs directly, as snow crabs in laboratories can survive in waters up to 12° C. Instead, the crabs might have starved to death, Szuwalski says.</p>



<p>Data show the crab population initially boomed in 2018 — reaching historic highs — thanks to ideal ocean conditions for newborn crabs around 2010. But the crabs also occupied a smaller area than normal, though Szuwalski and colleagues are uncertain why. That means more crabs were crammed onto less space on the shelf. Then came the heat wave. Higher water temperatures can rev the cold-blooded crabs&#8217; metabolism; previous research has shown that the calorie requirements of snow crabs in labs almost double as water temperature rises from 0° to 3° C.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the crowded crabs probably needed more food, but because of the smaller foraging area they had even fewer resources to sink their claws into. Compared with similar-sized crabs from the previous year, those surveyed in 2018 had lower body weights, another clue starvation played a role in the missing crabs.</p>



<p>“It’s just yet another example of something we didn’t expect, but now we have to live with,” says Christopher Harley, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who was not involved with the research. In the eastern Bering Sea, it could take at least four years before more crabs of a fishable size start showing up, meaning fishers there will remain in a lurch.</p>



<p>Such effects of marine heat waves are likely to extend beyond snow crabs. Ecosystems in northern latitudes, such as Alaska’s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">are changing more rapidly</a> in response to climate change than anywhere else (<em>SN: 8/11/22)</em>. Scientists can typically use data from the past to help predict and prepare for changes in the future. But the future increasingly holds events that have never happened on record before — like the snow crab population collapse — so they’re harder to prepare for, Harley says.</p>



<p>That’s especially true, he says, because there hasn’t been enough attention on the secondary effects of marine heat waves on cold-blooded creatures, such as higher calorie needs and the risk of starvation.</p>

<p>An article that proposed potential benefits of private equity firms investing in autism service providers has been removed from the journal in which it was published.</p>



<p>The article, “Private equity investment: Friend or foe to applied behavior analysis?” was originally published in the&nbsp;<em>International Electronic Journal of Elementary Education</em>&nbsp;as part of a January 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/issue/view/61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special issue</a>&nbsp;devoted to applied behavior analysis (ABA) for autism.</p>



<p>ABA is the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/controversy-autisms-common-therapy/" target="_blank">most widely used therapy</a>&nbsp;for autism, and companies that provide it have faced a flood of interest from private equity firms in the past decade.</p>



<span id="more-128065"></span>



<p>The sole author of the article, Sara Gershfeld Litvak, “decided to retract the article due to her commitment to scientific integrity and ethical values,” following “a rigorous review process,” according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/issue/view/61/65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">undated retraction notice</a>&nbsp;on page 266 of the special issue. Litvak is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhcoe.org/about-bhcoe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founder and CEO</a>&nbsp;of the Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (BHCOE), a company that offers accreditation for organizations that provide ABA services, and she co-founded the Autism Investor Summit, an annual meeting focused on the business side of autism services. She is also an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calexpartners.com/sara-gershfeld-litvak.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advisory board member</a>&nbsp;for Calex Partners, a firm that provides advice on mergers and acquisitions for autism-related businesses.</p>



<p>The original retraction notice did not mention any specific issues with the article, which is no longer available on the journal’s website. A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/article/view/2141/649" target="_blank">correction notice</a>&nbsp;to the issue’s introduction, published 4 October, says that the editors retracted Litvak’s article “due to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that led to numerous inaccuracies within the reference and the body of the paper.” A close examination of a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spectrumnews-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/19124325/Litvak-Private-Equity-Investment-Friend-or-Foe-highlighted.pdf" target="_blank">PDF copy</a>&nbsp;of the article obtained by&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Retraction Watch</em>&nbsp;revealed that nearly two-thirds of the article’s references appear to not exist.</p>



<p>Litvak did not respond to an email request for comment and is on “personal leave” from BHCOE, according to an autoreply message. The journal’s editor-in-chief deferred questions to the special issue’s editors, who said they “do not have anything additional to add beyond the retraction notice and erratum to the introduction article.”</p>



<p>Of the 36 references in Litvak’s article, the DOI hyperlinks given for 18 of them eitdid nther link to a different article or return an error message stating that the DOI is “not found,”&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Retraction Watch</em>’s analysis shows. The article titles provided in 22 of the references do not appear in the cited journals’ table of contents or in Google search results.

<p>In her article, Litvak argued that concerns about the quality of care and ethics should not be “isolated to the ownership or oversight of the organization.” She included many positive points about private-equity involvement in ABA — often citing the nonexistent references. For example, one sentence that cited a source <em>Spectrum</em> and <em>Retraction Watch</em> could not locate stated that “Investment capital in ABA-based therapy has resulted in some benefits such as increased innovation, increased access to care, and greater adherence to regulations and guidelines.”</p>

The report’s authors noted that Litvak’s article “conflated” for-profit and private-equity-owned companies, and that much of the evidence it cited was from the 2000s, before private equity became involved in behavioral health. Litvak’s article “does not address private equity ownership, despite its title,” they wrote.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Romaric.Loffroy.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" width="120" height="165" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Romaric.Loffroy.jpg?resize=120%2C165&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128061" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Romaric Loffroy</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A professor of interventional radiology in France pointed the finger at an alleged ghostwriter after he was caught plagiarizing large portions of text in a review article, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>“After careful checking, I noticed that I am not the author of this paper despite my first authorship since it has been written by our previous medical writter [sic],” <a href="https://archive.fo/Dvmw6">Romaric Loffroy</a> of CHU Dijon Bourgogne wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Loffroy also toned down the offense, saying he wouldn’t care if others had plagiarized his work.</p>



<span id="more-128060"></span>



<p>The review, <a href="https://qims.amegroups.org/article/view/8064/html">“Current role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer,”</a> was published in October 2015 in <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em> and has been cited 28 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Nowhere does it mention the involvement of a medical writer.</p>



<p>The paper borrows heavily from two other reviews published in 2015. Its entire introduction was lifted verbatim from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495493/">an article</a> in the <em>Indian Journal of Urology</em>, while its conclusions were copied from <a href="https://doi.org/10.4111/kju.2015.56.5.337">a paper</a> in the <em>Korean Journal of Urology</em>.</p>



<p>Audrey Licandro, research director at CHU Dijon Bourgogne, told Retraction Watch the institution was “currently conducting an internal investigation of this matter and will get back to you as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>After discovering the plagiarism, the authors of the paper in the <em>Korean Journal of Urology</em> contacted Loffroy. They did not hear back. Then a colleague, Henry Woo of the Australian National University, took it upon himself to try as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought that I would see if I would have any more success,” Woo told us. On October 16, he emailed Loffroy and his coauthors, as well as the journal’s editor-in-chief, Yi-Xiang Wang of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>“Significant amounts of text from your paper have in fact been copied word for word from two manuscripts. Whether intentional or not, it constitutes serious academic misconduct,” Woo wrote in his email. He added that he found it “disturbing” the journal had not spotted the plagiarism and recommended Loffroy request a retraction.</p>



<p>In a reply sent that same day, Loffroy downplayed Woo’s concerns. Besides claiming he had not written the article, he pointed out that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The paper you talk about is a review paper published more than 8 years ago and not an original article, not involving any relevant or original data, which is no more excusable but much less harmful in terms of scientific impact, since most journal review articles are just repetitions. You probably know that better than me. Third, the article certainly went through the journal’s plagiarism software which did not identify any significant word duplication at that time and which is not my responsability [sic]. In addition to that, it seems that word duplication here represents roughly less than 8% of the paper, which is largely within the limits of what is acceptable, although I am not an expert on that topic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Last but not least, I am very impressed by the time it takes for certain people to check for plagiarism. I would like to have that much time to check plagiarism of my own articles but my schedule unfortunately doesn’t allow it, and I must admit that I really don’t care. My interest is elsewhere. In conclusion, I consider that it is not my role to initiate any action and let the Editor decide but I remain available to the competent authorities for additional information if needed, in complete transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Loffroy, who did not answer emails or phone calls asking for comment, has been a deputy editor of <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery </em>since 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. The extent of his ties to the journal, if any, prior to that is unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em> is published by AME Publishing Company. It was one of many “potentially predatory” titles on the now-defunct <a href="https://beallslist.net/">Beall’s List</a>, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/05/board-members-decry-their-own-journals-retraction-of-paper-on-predatory-publishers/">many find controversial</a>. Wang, the journal’s editor-in-chief, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>In a reply to Loffroy, Woo pointed out that the offensive review had been accepted “an almost unbelievable 14 days” after submission. He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You cannot absolve your academic misconduct by blaming an undisclosed ghost medical writer. The failure to declare involvement by a ghost writer in itself represents academic misconduct and this could be even worse had you not disclosed this to your co-authors. It would be interesting if your co-authors were to comment on this and whether they would support you or distance themselves from the academic misconduct associated with this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Woo also pointed out:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The failure of the journal software system to detect your plagiarism does not absolve you of having undertaken plagiarism. When complete sections, and which in your case includes the abstract, introduction and conclusions having <strong>entire word for word duplication </strong>from two other manuscripts, the percentage of duplication is irrelevant. … My personal belief is that this article did not go through a plagiarism check and particularly given the track record of AME publications on the former Beall List of predatory journals.</p>



<p>The reason that I think it appropriate to check your other submissions to journals that were on the Beall List is that blatant plagiarism is not usually an isolated event. Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aging-enzyme-restore-muscle-strength">Blocking an aging-related enzyme may restore muscle strength</a></h4>

              
                <p>As people age, their muscles tend to dwindle and weaken, especially with lack of use. With continued muscle loss, daily tasks are harder to perform and the risk of falling increases. One research team is teasing apart what’s behind this muscle loss by focusing on an enzyme associated with aging, which they’ve named a “gerozyme.”</p>



<p>The enzyme is 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, or 15-PGDH. It breaks down a protein called prostaglandin E2. That protein activates the proliferation of muscle stem cells, regenerating damaged muscles.</p>





<p>Stem cell biologist Helen Blau of Stanford University School of Medicine and colleagues previously found that blocking 15-PGDH in old mice restored their withered muscles and improved their strength after a month of treatment. On the flip side, young mice lost muscle and became weaker after their levels of this enzyme were increased for a month.</p>



<p>Blau’s team has now found that 15-PGDH accumulates in the muscles of old mice as the connections that allow communication between muscles and nerves are lost, another consequence of aging. Treating old mice for one month with a drug that inhibits 15-PGDH <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adg1485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restored these connections, called synapses</a>, between muscle fibers and motor nerve cells, and boosted the animals’ strength, the team reports in the Oct. 11 <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. Those synapses are how the brain directs muscles to move.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that blocking the gerozyme 15-PGDH may be a way to help recover strength that has diminished due to nerve injuries, motor nerve cell diseases or aging.</p>

                <p>Calcium imaging with two-photon point scanning is <em>the</em> technique to chronically record from identified neurons in the living brain of animals. The central piece of two-photon point scanning microscopes is a scan engine. This can be a complex optical device like a deformable mirror or an acousto-optical deflector; but more often, it is just a mirror sitting on a rod and scanning forth and back as fast as possible. The fastest such mirrors are so-called resonant mirrors.</p>



<p>Currently, there is only one major provider of resonant scan mirrors for microscopy, and only few months ago, the lead times had risen to &gt;1 year. Resonant mirrors are therefore much more precious than their mere price tag, and it is worth trying to get the best out of existing resonant scanners, instead of replacing them with new scanners at the sight of the slightest problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><font size="-1"><strong>Figure 1. </strong>A typical resonant scan mirror, mounted on top of an oscillating rod.

<p>Recently, I have been working with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johanna-A-Nieweler">Johanna Nieweler</a>, a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">Helmchen lab</a>, to piece together her two-photon microscope from the remains of a previous microscope. Among the surprisingly numerous problems that Johanna encountered and fixed during this work was a problem that was ultimately due to the resonant scanner. In this blog post, I will describe how we identified the problem and came up with a &#8211; in my opinion &#8211; very elegant solution. This might be a useful resource for optical engineers who are dealing with similar problems and for microscopists who want to understand more about resonant scanners.</p>



<p><strong>A periodic line jitter for high-zoom scanning</strong></p>



<p>The problem was not immediately apparent. An image of small fluorescent beads acquired with the scanning microscope looked fine when zooming out:</p>

<p>However, to evaluate the imaging quality, but also for real experiments that resolve subcellular structures, zoomed-in imaging is essential. In our case, we noticed some kind of irregular distortion of the scan pattern, as if the beads were changing their shapes or dancing around:</p>

<p>To better understand this distortion, we switched off the slow galvo scanners and performed a line scan with the fast resonant scanners only. This configuration clearly revealed a periodic jitter of the scan phase of the resonant scanner.</p>

<p>Such an artefact could be due to many possible sources. First, it could be that the software to acquire and bin the incoming data stream might have a bug. Second, there could be a vibration responsible for sample movement. Third, it could be some line noise coupling into the &#8220;sync signal&#8221; emitted by the resonant scanner. Fourth, the mechanical scanning itself could be governed by this period modulation.</p>



<p><strong>Finding the problem</strong></p>



<p>The resonant scanner under scrutiny was a 4 kHz resonant scanner from Cambridge Technology. First, we measured the periodicity of the signal distortion &#8211; the frequency was around 270 Hz. So it was unlikely to be line noise, which is at 50 Hz or multiples thereof in Europe.</p>



<p>Next, we also did not find any vibrations that might have caused this problem.</p>



<p>We checked and replaced the the power supplies of the resonant scanner, without any improvement.</p>



<p>Finally, we turned our attention to the resonant scanner. The resonant scanner produces a so-called &#8220;sync signal&#8221;, which is a TTL signal that indicates whether the scanner is moving in the clock-wise or counter-clockwise direction. At the turning point of the directional change, the scanner flips the TTL signal and therefore generates the electrical trigger signal for the next line of the imaging frame. This means that an imprecise generation of the TTL signal, or a wobbly oscillation of the mirror itself could generate a jitter of the TTL signal and a modulation of the line signal as we observed.</p>



<p>Indeed, when we looked at the sync signal on the oscilloscope (we triggered on a rising flank and looked at the oscilloscope on the subsequent rising flank of the TTL), we observed a jitter of the signal that would explain the artefact in the image.</p>

<p>Now, this jitter could be due to a physically wobbling scan mirror; or due to an imprecise readout of the turnaround point by the TTL signal generator at the resonant scanner. Is it possible to distinguish between these two options? Yes, it is. If the scanner is scanning properly and only the TTL signal generation is affected, one could in theory simply replace the periodic TTL signal and then observe an artefact-free image.</p>



<p>We therefore replaced the bad TTL signal with an artificial TTL produced by a signal generator, at the exact same frequency as the resonant scanner&#8217;s frequency. Fascinatingly, we observed that this procedure fixed the problem beautifully. One can also notice that the picture drifts away if the signal generator frequency does not exactly match the frequency of the resonant scanner:</p>

</div><figcaption><strong>Video 1.</strong> Linescan of beads, with a signal generator replacing the sync signal of the resonant scanner. While recording the video, we slightly modified the frequency of the signal generator, resulting in a drift of the image to the left or right for even the tiniest mismatch between the scanner&#8217;s frequency and the signal generator&#8217;s frequency. We did not move the sample or the microscope at any time during the recording.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite this limitation, we concluded that the scanner was apparently not wobbling around, and only the generation of the TTL signal was defective.</p>



<p><strong>From a workaround of the problem to a permanent and user-friendly solution</strong></p>



<p>But there is a problem &#8211; we cannot simply use the signal generator with a fixed frequency TTL signal and hope that things will be fixed. First, the resonant scanning frequency of any resonant scanner changes slightly over time as it warms up. Second, the resonant scanning frequency also varies (a few fractions of a percent) when the zoom level of the microscope and therefore also the scan amplitude of the resonant scanner is changed. A mismatch between the scanner&#8217;s frequency and the sync signal would result in the drift that is visible in the video above.</p>



<p>What we therefore needed was a system that uses the jittery TTL sync signal of the resonant scanner and produces an output that is phase-locked to the sync signal, but without the jitter &#8230;</p>



<p>At this point, I vaguely remembered that this can be achieved by a simple analog electric circuit, and after an internet search, I found the Wikipedia article on the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">phase locked loop</a>&#8221; (PLL), which described exactly what we were looking for. A PLL uses an input (in this case, a jittery TTL signal) and creates a synchronized TTL signal that is typically phase-locked and runs at the same frequency but without jitter when the feedback is filtered appropriately. So we only had to implement this circuit, insert this device between the scanner&#8217;s sync signal and the &#8220;line trigger&#8221; input channel of the DAQ board, and our images would look perfectly line-triggered!</p>



<p>The problem here is that neither Johanna nor I had been trained as electrical engineers, so we would have struggled to translate this relatively simple idea into a working device. However, there was a true expert and lover of electrical circuits at the Brain Research Institute in Zürich: Hansjörg Kasper. Working as a support engineer at the institute for several decades, he was not only an expert for basically any practical technical question ranging from laser physics to soldering techniques, but he was also very familiar with analog circuits. While nowadays often replaced by micro-processor-based solutions, analog circuit elements such as PLLs had been standard components of electrical engineering 30-40 years ago and therefore very familiar to Hansjörg. For example, he had used PLLs in a system that he designed more than twenty years ago to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=81566&amp;tag=1">track head and eye movements of small animals</a>.</p>



<p>He was quickly intrigued by our problem and accidentally had such a phase-locked loop circuit at his hand, the &#8220;classic&#8221; &#8211; as he called it &#8211; <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/CD4046B">CD4046</a> PLL element.</p>

<p>By the way, these circuits are quite cheap (&lt;10 Euros). Within one day, Hansjörg soldered the components together to produce the desired behaviour. To this end, he followed the instructions that come with such a circuit element, indicating how to choose resistors and other elements to produce the desired behaviour.</p>



<p>He sent me this circuit diagram of his final circuit, optimized for stabilizing the sync signal of a 4 kHz resonant scanner:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><font size="-1"><strong>Figure 4. </strong>Circuit diagram of a PLL circuit based on a CD4046 element. An inverter (&#8220;U2A 74HC14&#8221;) is included to generate a signal with the same phase shift as the input signal. At the bottom, it is indicated how to re-dimension the capacitor C1 in order to optimize the circuit for a 8 kHz instead of for a 4 kHz resonant scanner. Drawing and annotations were done by Hansjörg Kasper in <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a>.</font></p>



<p>Soldering this circuit requires a bit of practice but could be learned rather quickly by any talented tinkerer. The true challenge, in my opinion, is to start with the <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4046b.pdf?ts=1694374810508&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">CD4046 datasheet</a> (or the datasheet of a similar PLL circuit) and figure out how everything must be connected. It is not much more than 5 pages of the datasheet that are relevant, but I would probably not have understood it easily without Hansjörg&#8217;s explanations. Hopefully the circuit diagram above provided by Hansjörg will make it easy for anybody who will try to replicate our PLL stabilizer!</p>



<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>



<p>The circuit turned out to work beautifully. We hooked it up to the microscope, and within days we had already almost forgotten that it existed &#8211; this is a true hallmark of great engineering: that the problem is solved so perfectly and robustly that you quickly forget about its mere existence. Here is the stabilized line scan, in direct comparison with the line scan without stabilization. The residual slow wiggling of the line is due to 50 Hz line noise (a different problem).</p>

<p>If there is anybody out there struggling with a similar resonant scanner problem, I hope that this blog post will give them the tools to address and solve this problem!</p>



<p>In the end, I was curious whether the same solution could also be helped to generally stabilize resonant scanners. Resonant scanners are known to become &#8220;wobbly&#8221; with age or when scanning with low amplitudes (high zoom-in). I was simultaneously working also on another two-photon resonant scanning setup with an 8 kHz scanner, and I noticed some sort of wobblying and instability for very high zoom settings. Therefore, I used a signal generator to provide a highly stable sync signal to replace the scanner&#8217;s sync signal. Unfortunately, no improvements of the imaging quality could be observed. Apparently, in this case the resonant scanner was indeed wobbling physically, while the 4 kHz scanner was oscillating properly and only the generation of the TTL signal was compromised.</p>



<p>Altogether, this small engineering project with Johanna and Hansjörg was, in my opinion, extremely interesting and valuable. Growing up in the age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduinos</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pis</a>, where every problem can be solved by a bit of code running on a microprocessor, it was impressive to be reminded of the power of analog circuits. Of course, this implementation was only possible because we had an expert for and lover of analog circuits, Hansjörg Kasper, in our institute.</p>



<p>P.S. Hansjörg had been at the heart of the institute for more than 40 years. He retired officially in 2022 but did the work for this PLL project while working part-time at the Brain Research Institute in the Spring of 2023. Unexpectedly and unfortunately, he died in the early Summer of 2023.<br />During his time at the institute, his work had helped many dozens of PhD students and postdocs tremendously, by solving many small and big technical challenges that typical scientists are rarely equipped to address by themselves. Many a small device and machine that was built during his era, from synchronization boxes for behavioural setups to our small PLL circuit, will continue to run in the labs of the Brain Research Institute in the future, many years after him.</p>



<p>P.P.S. Big kudos to Johanna Nieweler, together with whom I worked on this project, to Hansjörg Kasper (R.I.P.), who designed and built the PLL circuit, to Martin Wieckhorst, who helped with the first brainstorming about the PLL circuit, and to Fritjof Helmchen, who supervises both Johanna and me.</p>

                <p>Last Saturday’s “ring of fire” eclipse, which blocked out 98 percent of the sun’s surface, was a rare and spectacular sight for those who got to view it. But the total solar eclipse in 2024 is going to be a particularly special event.</p>



<p>On April 8, when the eclipse will cross the United States, the sun will be nearing its most active phase. Solar maximum, as it’s known when the sun acts up every 11 years, features more sunspots, increased light and radiation, and frequent blasts of charged particles from the sun’s surface in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-solar-storms-earth-havoc-space-weather-forecasts">solar storms</a> that threaten satellites and may even disrupt communications and power grids on Earth (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>).</p>





<p>Being on the brink of a solar maximum also means it’s a great time for an eclipse.</p>



<p>The combination of high solar activity and a total eclipse provides a rare view of the outer edges of the sun at a time when researchers have more scientific instruments to study our star than ever before, says astrophysicist Kelly Korreck of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. That’s leading to a flurry of activity and a host of projects to take advantage of the opportunity to learn about the sun and its effects on our planet and atmosphere.</p>



<p>The benefits extend beyond working scientists. “There&#8217;s a lot of emphasis on citizen science and having folks join NASA in doing [solar] science projects,” Korreck says.</p>



<p>Here are a few of the ways you can contribute to science during the upcoming eclipse.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Help make an improved eclipse megamovie</h4>



<p>Volunteers along the path of totality, where the sun is fully blocked by the moon, will take pictures of the eclipse to be stitched together into a movie covering the event as it moves from Texas to Maine. The 2024 <a href="https://eclipsemegamovie.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eclipse Megamovie</a> will be an improved follow-up to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/citizen-science-solar-eclipse">2017 effort</a> that was the first crowdsourced collection of total eclipse images turned into a movie (<em>SN: 8/2/17</em>).</p>



<p>The primary goal of the 2017 version was to inspire people to get out to see the eclipse, says physicist Laura Peticolas of Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, Calif. This time around, the intent is to “gather data in a more structured way in 2024 to increase our likelihood of having publishable results.”</p>



<p>Volunteers with access to high-quality cameras, on mounts that allow them to precisely follow the sun’s path in the sky, will collect images aligned and sized to optimize the scientific value of the movie.</p>



<p>“We are one of the only [volunteer-based] teams looking at how the [visible plasma jets] move from the bright sun&#8217;s photosphere out to the solar wind, where NASA can watch the features continue into the solar system,” Peticolas says.</p>



<p>To contribute images for the movie, volunteers need <a href="https://eclipsemegamovie.org/team/volunteers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to apply by October 31</a>. The Eclipse Megamovie collaboration will provide the sun-tracking mounts for free to up to 100 volunteers. People who miss the volunteer application deadline or don’t have the right equipment to take pictures can participate in efforts to analyze the data in the months following the eclipse.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Help nail down the shape of the sun</h4>



<p>If all you have is a smartphone camera, you can still contribute to science, provided you can get to the path of totality.</p>





<p>With the <a href="https://sunsketcher.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SunSketcher</a> app, you can help time the appearance of bright spots of light, known as Baily’s beads, that appear when sunlight shines through valleys on the moon just before and after the total eclipse. Data from volunteers who install the app “will allow us to precisely determine the shape of the sun,” says astrophysicist Gordon Emslie of Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green.<strong></strong></p>



<p>The results, Emslie says, will help test theories of gravity by looking at how the shape of the sun affects the orbits of planets. “By including as many phones as possible, spread out over the 2,000-mile-long, 100-mile-wide path of the April 2024 eclipse, we will get views of the solar shape from a very large number of vantage points.”</p>



<p>You can take part without interrupting your other eclipse-watching activities. Just install the app on your phone, prop it up facing the sun and start the app running at least five minutes before totality. The app will handle the rest, and you get to keep copies of the pictures as a souvenir.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Help listen to the effects on wildlife</h4>



<p>Eclipses have a dramatic effect on animals, as first scientifically <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20023118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observed in 1932</a>. Volunteers with the <a href="https://eclipsesoundscapes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eclipse Soundscapes</a> project will expand on earlier studies by using sound data they collect on or near the path of totality.</p>



<p>Instructions for building the equipment you’ll need are on the Eclipse Soundscapes website. You can also apply to get a completed kit. But if you don’t get one of the prebuilt ones and don’t want to put a data recorder together from scratch, or if you won’t be close to the path of totality, you can still participate by observing the impacts of the eclipse on the environment, wherever you happen to be.</p>



<p>After you upload your observations to the Eclipse Soundscapes website, volunteers will analyze them along with all the other submitted observations.</p>



<p>There’s more to it than sound, says MaryKay Severino, who is a science education expert with the ARISA Lab in Medford, Mass. Eclipses “are multisensory events, which makes them more powerful and more accessible,” she says. “Eclipse Soundscapes focuses heavily on the sound in addition to other sense observations to help us begin to understand how solar eclipses affect nature.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More citizen science opportunities</h4>



<p>Some projects rely on teams sharing specialized equipment to observe the eclipse. The <a href="https://debinitiative.org/main/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamic Eclipse Broadcast Initiative</a> will provide cameras and telescope systems, along with training, for 60 teams who will estimate the speed and acceleration of plumes ejected from the solar corona.</p>



<p>Upwards of 35 teams taking part in the <a href="https://eclipse.boulder.swri.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizen Continental-America Telescope Eclipse</a> project will use cameras that can record the corona with polarized light in a quest to understand how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">solar wind emerges</a> from the sun (<em>SN: 6/7/23</em>).</p>



<p>Both projects have limited supplies of equipment, which means limited opportunities for volunteers, so get in touch with them soon if you want to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other projects involve repurposing equipment intended for different uses. Ham radio buffs can join the <a href="https://hamsci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HamSCI</a> community to see how eclipses change the way radio signals propagate through the atmosphere. NASA’s <a href="https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radio JOVE project</a> includes eclipse-monitoring information for amateur astronomers who typically rely on radio telescopes to study the sun, Jupiter and the Milky Way galaxy.</p>



<p>Whether you set up a camera, install an app, join a team or fire up your radio receiver, Korreck says there has never been a better time for citizen scientists to contribute to solar eclipse research. And if you miss the event on April 8, you’ll have to wait a while for another chance, she says. “This is the last one for 20 years that covers any major part of the U.S.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-accelerators-electrons-lasers">Tiny accelerators get electrons up to speed using lasers</a></h4>

              
                <p>One day, powerful particle accelerators might fit in your pocket.</p>



<p>Two teams of physicists have built tiny structures that both accelerate electrons and keep them confined in a manageable beam, instead of spewing them willy-nilly. That’s a first for such mini accelerators, and a crucial step toward making these devices more useful and widespread.</p>



<p>“One of the main problems with particle accelerators … is that they’re too big and they’re too expensive,” says physicist Jared Maxson of Cornell University, who was not involved with the new research. Miniaturizing the devices means scientists could make high-energy electrons on a tabletop, Maxson says. That could open up new possibilities for medicine and science.</p>





<p>Constructed on silicon chips, the accelerators are composed of two rows of pillars about 2 micrometers tall, reminiscent of miniature rows of skyscrapers. When hit with laser light, the pillar structure generates electromagnetic fields that push the subatomic particles faster and faster along an extremely narrow alley between the pillars, less than a micrometer wide.</p>



<p>Electrons in one device <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06602-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained 12.3 kiloelectron volts</a> of energy over a distance of half a millimeter, a 43 percent bump that brought the particles to 40.7 kiloelectron volts, physicist Peter Hommelhoff and colleagues report October 18 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, carefully placed gaps between the pillars help keep the beam of electrons in focus, mimicking the capabilities of larger accelerators. “This is really the first accelerator based on nanophotonics that contains all the features any modern accelerator contains,“ says Hommelhoff, of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany.</p>



<p>Physicist Robert Byer of Stanford University and colleagues reported a similar achievement October 3 at arXiv.org, with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy gains up to 23.7 kiloelectron volts</a>. The two groups are part of a larger collaboration called the Accelerator on a Chip International Program, or ACHIP, which unifies efforts to build these small accelerators.</p>



<p>The world’s most powerful particle accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva, with a ring that’s a whopping 27 kilometers around. Protons in the LHC reach energies of trillions of electron volts. The new tiny accelerators, with mere thousands of electron volts, &nbsp;won’t be creating Higgs bosons anytime soon — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-boson-particle-physics-standard-model-discovery-anniversary">the particle famously found</a> at the LHC in 2012 (<em>SN: 6/29/22</em>). But such devices have their own set of potential applications.</p>



<p>For example, high-energy electrons can treat skin cancer by damaging the DNA within cancer cells, killing them. But generating the energetic electrons currently requires a roomful of bulky machinery. With an accelerator on a chip, electron beam therapy could become more accessible.</p>



<p>And similar treatments could go more than skin-deep. “The dream is to be able to have a fiber that can go in a human body to do a local radiation treatment … because the whole accelerator can fit inside you,” says Pietro Musumeci of UCLA, who is a member of ACHIP but was not involved with the new results.</p>



<p>Another application could involve using the devices to create special states of light that could be useful for quantum computing. Or the accelerators might be useful for materials research, for example, for making images of thin materials with ultrahigh time resolution.</p>



<p>But the accelerators still have a long way to go. Electrons emerge from the devices at a rate that’s many orders of magnitude below conventional accelerators. And while the devices focus the beam in two dimensions (in the direction of the beam and perpendicular to it horizontally), further work is needed to focus the beam vertically.</p>



<p>The devices’ energy gains still need to be scaled up, too. The energy the electrons accumulate over a given acceleration distance is on par with conventional accelerators, tens of millions of electron volts per meter. But scientists want to far surpass those accelerators with billions of electron volts per meter.</p>





<p>Even so, the work demonstrates techniques that once seemed absurd to attempt. At first, when Byer described the idea to colleagues, “they’d all break out in hilarious laughter,” he says. “We don’t get laughter anymore; we now get appreciation.”</p>

<p>In February, <a href="https://publichealth.indiana.edu/research/faculty-directory/profile.html?user=allison">David Allison</a> came across a study with a familiar problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the study purported to show an educational program helped women lose weight, but they had not directly compared the treatment and control groups. Instead, they’d used a statistically invalid method to compare changes within the groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Allison, the dean at Indiana University’s School of Public Health in Bloomington, along with researcher Luis-Enrique Becerra-Garcia and other colleagues, in July submitted a critique of the study to the journal that had published it. Four days later, Nauman Khalid, the journal’s editor in chief, wrote to the study’s lead author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I got excellent feedback from Dr. Becerra-Garcia,” Khalid wrote. “According to their analysis, the statistical tool that you used in your research is wrong and not well-validated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, after a lack of adequate response from the authors, the study will be retracted, according to Khalid. </p>



<span id="more-128057"></span>



<p>Becerra-Garcia called Khalid&#8217;s action “prompt and decisive.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Although the study has not yet been retracted, the response from the journal is a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/26/when-editors-confuse-direct-criticism-with-being-impolite-science-loses/">departure</a> from the back-and-forth between authors and publishers that can stall retractions. Another paper Allison’s group critiqued was <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2023/9829387/">recently retracted</a> – more than three years after they first raised concerns about the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study to be retracted, “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02601060231153947?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">Effects of the application of a food processing-based classification system in obese women: A randomized controlled pilot study</a>,” was published in the journal <em>Nutrition and Health</em> this past February.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers examined the&nbsp; effects of an educational program based on Brazil’s new dietary guidelines, and found the program led to significantly decreased body mass and increased quality of life for the women who followed it compared to women in a control group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02601060231194653">commentary</a> by Allison’s group critiquing the study appeared in the same journal in September.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=david+allison">Allison</a> has been working for years&nbsp; to correct statistical errors in the nutrition literature. He told Retraction Watch that studies that use these kinds of invalid statistical methods “are more likely to mislead readers to think that effectiveness of some intervention has been shown by accepted statistical procedures with known and stated error rates when it has not been. This may lead to the unwitting adoption or investment of time, money, effort, and risk in inert interventions.”</p>



<p>Becerra-Garcia told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Regarding statistical methods, it is pertinent to note that in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design like the one used in Giacomello et al., 2023, to test for the effectiveness of an intervention, it is crucial to directly compare differences between groups in a significance test rather than relying solely on inspecting changes within each group. This entails testing whether the control and the intervention group differ in their respective change in outcomes from before to after treatment. This study only analyzed within-group changes (before vs. after) without statistically comparing between groups, which is a statistical error known as the “Differences in Nominal Significance” (DINS) error.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Becerra-Garcia added that he and his colleagues have detected the same error in other studies, and the mistake can sometimes lead to incorrect conclusions, as it did with this study.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On July 25, well before the critique was published, Khalid emailed Daniel Fernandes Martins, the senior author of the study and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern Santa Catarina in Brazil, informing him of the critique.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Per their commentary, they recommend correcting or retracting your original article,” he wrote.</p>



<p>He also wrote that Martins, who did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch, would have 15 days to take either action, according to the journal’s policy. However, the study remained online for many months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the critique of the study was published in September, Becerra-Garcia asked Khalid about the status of the study, writing that he and his coauthors “believe it is essential to address these issues to maintain the integrity of the scientific literature.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reply, Khalid said the authors of the study had requested the study be withdrawn without comment. To do so would be against the journal’s ethical standards, he said, and instead, the study would soon be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Khalid told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The main reason for retraction includes significant issues in statistical analysis of data and wrong presentation of conclusion. The initial research data was cross-verified by Prof. Allison&#8217;s group, and the re-evaluated data was shared with original authors via published commentary. Moreover, the original authors wanted to withdraw their manuscript, which I didn’t agree.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that “the authors need to be more vigilant in statistical analysis with human subjects since the minute change in conclusion has significant impact on what we see in this research.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debunk-periodic-cicada-myth-guts">Scientists debunked a long-standing cicada myth by analyzing their guts</a></h4>

              
                <p>There are at least three certainties in life: death, taxes and the periodic emergence of millions of cicadas. But one big cicada uncertainty has finally been put to rest — the question of whether the adult insects eat.</p>



<p>Periodical cicadas (<em>Magicicada </em>spp.) live in various broods across the eastern United States. Every 13 or 17 years, depending on the brood, adult cicadas emerge from the ground en masse and embark on a four-to-six-week saga of mating and laying eggs on young trees before dying. When the baby cicadas hatch, they fall to the ground, burrow into the earth and feed on plant roots until they’re ready for the next emergence. But there’s long been a popularly accepted idea that once adults emerge, they don’t eat.</p>





<p>That perception might stem from cicadas’ lack of obvious chewing mouthparts, like those possessed by very hungry caterpillars, says James Hepler, a research entomologist at the U.S. Arid Land Agricultural Research Center, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in Maricopa, Ariz.</p>



<p>The idea has even been perpetuated in some scientific papers, including one published by a USDA scientist in the 1970s, Hepler says. That’s despite the fact that other scientists had reported seeing cicadas sticking their tubular mouthparts into plant stems, possibly to access sap. “We decided to kind of settle it once and for all,” he says.</p>

Hepler <em>et al</em>/<em>Journal of Insect Science </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While working at the USDA’s Appalachian Fruit Research Station in West Virginia, Hepler and colleagues analyzed the gut contents of 75 periodical cicadas collected from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cicada-science-brood-x-2021">Brood X, which emerged in 2021</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/21</em>). Since the cicadas were suspected to feed on plant sap, which is mostly water and wouldn’t leave much of a trace in their innards, the team used a highly sensitive technique capable of picking up and decoding minuscule amounts of DNA.</p>



<p>Far from finding empty stomachs, the researchers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jisesa/iead082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified DNA from 22 kinds of plant</a>, including box elder, ash, oak and even cannabis. Given that “the cicadas are ingesting very minute quantities of DNA,” Hepler says, “we were pleasantly surprised that we were able to find DNA in there at all.” The results appear in the Oct. 18 <em>Journal of Insect Science</em>.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s really nice that they actually looked at the gut content,” says Chris Simon, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs who works on cicadas but wasn’t involved in the study. “We see them feeding,” she says, but this is “verification that they&#8217;re actually ingesting these particular things.”</p>



<p>Hepler is now interested in the timescale of adult feeding. “Do the cicadas move around from plant to plant on a daily basis, on a weekly basis?” he asks. There’s also the question of what effect this mass sap-sucking has on plants. “An individual cicada seems to have a relatively low impact,” Hepler says. But when hundreds of thousands of them descend on greenery almost at once, the plants face “the potential for pretty significant water loss.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/how-does-boredom-impact-our-mental-health">How does boredom impact our mental health?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Boredom is something that we’re all familiar with, regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity. For instance, as the PM declared the first COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020, most of us stopped going to work and school, meaning we now had all the time in the world and nothing to keep us occupied. As a result, the percentage of adults in Great Britain who reported feeling depressed skyrocketed. This shocking news became a common topic of discussion, and made many re-evaluate the impact that boredom has on our mental health.</p>

<h2>1.   What is boredom?</h2>
<p>At first glance, boredom may seem like a simple and easy-to-understand concept - when you have nothing to do, or when an activity is not engaging enough. While that definition isn’t incorrect, it doesn’t tell us a lot about its nature. Instead, we’ll define it as the feeling of wanting stimulation while not having access to it, and it can be both a personality trait (boredom proneness) and a temporary state. </p>

<p>One thing we can all agree on is that boredom makes us feel uncomfortable. A 2014 study claimed that people are likely to pick a painful stimulation over no stimulation at all. In this experiment, subjects were kept in an empty room for 15 minutes, next to a button that if pressed, would inflict a mild electric shock. The aim of this study was to investigate whether imagination and thoughts alone were enough to keep us entertained in the face of boredom. Surprisingly, 18 out of the 42 participants (mostly men) ended up pressing the button, fully aware of its consequences. Although this experiment failed to account for differences in pain tolerance, it does correlate with what we see outside the lab – for example, the fact that some people pick at painful scabs when they’re bored. That brings us to our next question: why do we hate being bored?</p>
<h2>2.   Why do we get bored?</h2>
<p>To answer this question, we must understand why we get bored in the first place. Scientists believe that our ancestors greatly benefitted from the feeling of boredom as it pushed them to try new things in pursuit of novel stimulation, such as seeking the company of others and forming meaningful bonds. Staying in groups meant a higher chance of survival, so it makes sense why our brains, even to this day, are so afraid of being alone. Natural selection favoured those who actively sought human connections as they were more likely to find a mate and survive to pass on their advantageous genes. Activities such as socialising also prompt the creation of connections in the brain; conversely, avoiding these activities could result in neurodegeneration and brain atrophy. Because we don’t like feeling uncomfortable, we are compelled to look for new stimuli and therefore, we’re able to increase our chances of survival and prevent damage to our brains in the long run. We are also rewarded with dopamine, which explains why completing these activities feels so fulfilling and gratifying. So, to put it simply, boredom has to feel uncomfortable, or else we would simply swipe it under the rug and go about our same old routine without a second thought.</p>
<h2>3.   Lack of stimulation and depression</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve discussed the benefits of boredom and how it motivates us to seek stimulation. However, that’s only one side of the argument. What about people who suffer from boredom proneness? And what if you simply ignore it? That brings us back to the COVID-19 example. Although necessary, our daily lives were severely disrupted, and we experienced never-seen-before levels of boredom. That, subsequently, caused our mental health to decline. According to the Office for National Statistics, 1 in 5 adults in Great Britain reported feeling depressed during quarantine, whereas before the pandemic it was around 1 in 10. Of course, that wasn’t single-handedly caused by boredom; financial stress, the loss of loved ones and several other factors also played a key role. Having said that, it would be fallacious to sit here and discredit its contribution to the numbers. Since that dull and monotonous lifestyle was forced upon us, we had no chance to act on or tend to our brain’s needs, and so, the uneasy feeling never went away and our dopamine levels remained low. </p>

<p>Moreover, boredom as a personality trait is closely linked to drug abuse, gambling addiction and depression. Research shows that individuals who are prone to feeling bored have fewer dopamine receptors in the brain, meaning that they need more stimulation to feel satisfied and consequently partake in riskier activities. This has been shown to affect men more than women as was suggested by the electric shock experiment, though, scientists are not entirely sure of the underlying reasons. </p>
<h2>4.   Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Boredom is our brain’s response to lack of stimulation. Its main functions are to instigate the search for novel stimuli and to push us away from activities we don’t enjoy. We can, therefore, conclude that boredom in moderation is a sign of a healthy brain, one that recognises it as a threat and tries to eliminate it. Even though we sometimes have no control over our surroundings, such as how you can’t stop going to school just because you find it boring; take it as a friendly reminder to make the most out of your spare time to ensure that your brain is getting the stimulation it needs. </p>

<p><strong>Stephen Matheson (SM): </strong>Preprinting has gone from a semi-controversial practice that was resisted by some publishers, to a practice that is still misunderstood and opposed by some subcommunities in science but is overall uncontroversial and broadly embraced. We used to discuss preprints as a separate topic in our session on publishing&mdash;we stopped doing that a couple years ago.</p>



<p>I think our advice to writers is&hellip; well, timeless. Two of our fundamental principles are that good scientific writing is just good writing; and that one must know oneself as a writer before trying to adopt particular practices or habits. Those things haven&rsquo;t changed at all, though I think it will soon get harder to find oneself (as a writer) than it was before Bard and ChatGPT. GPTs will change scientific writing, and all writing, and we&rsquo;ll start addressing that this year using materials developed by Charla in her teaching at CSHL.</p>



<p><strong>Charla Lambert (CL): </strong>I think the rise of generative AI this year will be the biggest change, though its effects on scientific writing norms are TBD and playing out in real time. It will certainly affect people&rsquo;s writing, editing, and creation processes in ways that we don&rsquo;t yet foresee. It has the potential to be really beneficial for people who struggle with writing, people whose primary language isn&rsquo;t English, people who don&rsquo;t have access to or funds for professional editing services or training, etc.&nbsp; But I agree with Stephen that it also has the potential to mask people&rsquo;s individual style in writing and, as a scientific community we&rsquo;d then lose out on a lot of distinct and engaging voices.</p>



<h2 class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>I&rsquo;m curious how bringing together expertise from different organizations and different areas of scientific communications has helped shape the training that you&rsquo;ve created. What are some of the benefits and/or challenges of collaboration? Has your work together impacted how you think about scientific writing and science communications broadly?</em></strong></h2>



<p><strong>SM:</strong> There is no single good/best way to write. That&rsquo;s one principle we emphasize from the beginning, so we are effectively obligated to provide students with diverse writing coaches who come from different areas of science and who have different (sometimes strikingly different) habits and practices in writing. We all enjoy our collaboration very much, which is good because the retreat would be ineffective without that diversity.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> There is no single good/best way to write.  </p></blockquote>



<p>The only challenge created by our collaboration is the fact that our course only happens once a year and is planned by a team that is dispersed among as many as four different institutions in three states. Charla and the CSHL courses team do the vast bulk of the preparation.</p>



<p>How has our collaboration changed how I think about scientific writing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Teaching and coaching in the retreat has led me to more strongly emphasize the (potential) importance of dramatic flair (e.g. &ldquo;twists&rdquo;, pause for effect) and similar tactics that seem at first to be inappropriate in scientific writing. It is all too common for the pursuit of precision and completeness to overshadow and doom the more important pursuit of clarity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. We urge students to reflect on their strengths and especially on their weaknesses (&ldquo;Identify your kryptonite&rdquo;) and then work with both. This is great advice in any part of life and I actively include it in mine.</p>

<p><strong>CL: </strong>Stephen&rsquo;s correct that we place an intentional emphasis on diversity when assembling the slate of coaches in a given year&mdash;diversity in backgrounds, experiences, positions, writing styles, and approaches to coaching writers. One of the amazing things that happens each year is a recognition among the &ldquo;students&rdquo; that there really are core principles they keep hearing from all the different coaches. Everything we suggest tends to stem from the audience for a given piece, the goals in writing to that audience, and clarity in the writing to achieve those goals. We don&rsquo;t prescribe an abstract set of do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts&mdash;there&rsquo;s an explicit recognition that everyone&rsquo;s writing process is different and what works well for one person won&rsquo;t necessarily work for another&mdash;but everyone leaves the retreat with some tools for examining clarity in their own writing.</p>



<p>And yes, the big challenge to collaboratively running this retreat is getting to do it only once a year! There have been many jokes over the years about starting a consulting company, a train-the-trainer model, or even a podcast about writing (I&rsquo;m still not sure who&rsquo;d listen to that, haha). The curriculum and experience are definitely ongoing needs in science. I love running the retreat with Stephen and the great coaches and co-instructors we work with, but we all have limited bandwidth.</p>



<h2 class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>Do you find that trainees benefit from working together as part of the course? Are there benefits or challenges to workshopping with researchers from different disciplines and institutions?</em></strong></h2>



<p><strong>SM: </strong>Small groups are a HUGE part of the retreat and are consistently rated very favorably by students.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>CL: </strong>Absolutely. Peer feedback groups are essential, and we spend time talking about how to give and receive feedback constructively so the time in small groups is effective. We intentionally create the groups so that, as much as possible, people are working on similar things (manuscripts, grants, fellowships, job applications, etc.) and are from very different subdisciplines. There&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers what you do well when writing, and there&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers in different subdisciplines what might be confusing in your writing. The small groups help develop empathy for and a sharp focus on the audience.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Peer feedback groups are essential, and we spend time talking about how to give and receive feedback constructively so the time in small groups is effective.</p></blockquote>



<p>One anecdote I&rsquo;ll share: One year, the work in small groups spun out into a full-class discussion on journal clubs and the climate in science. As coaches, we give both positive and constructive feedback, and we ask the students to give positive feedback in small groups before getting mired in more critical comments of someone else&rsquo;s writing. This often takes a lot of practice because the students are typically used to seeing science function only on critical or &ldquo;negative&rdquo; feedback. At the end of the retreat, one of the students expressed surprise that they benefited from hearing positive feedback instead of just critical comments from their peers. Another student asked why journal clubs don&rsquo;t typically prescribe both positive and constructive feedback&mdash;the class agreed that journal clubs often devolve into negative commentary, sometimes even <em>ad hominem</em> attacks. Finally, a third student who was an early-career faculty member realized they could run their journal clubs differently, and vowed to do so in the future. It was a really satisfying integration of all the different professional hats I wear!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2023-nikon-small-world-photography">The inside of a rat’s eye won the 2023 Nikon Small World photo contest</a></h4>

              
                <p>An eye full of cellular stars is a stunning example of the beauty that exists in nature’s smallest sizes.</p>



<p>A glimpse of the back of a rat’s eye, and the immune cells that keep it healthy, won first place in the 2023 Nikon Small World photomicrography competition. The image, composed of multiple snapshots captured with a confocal microscope, was taken by neuroscientist Hassanain Qambari of the Lions Eye Institute’s Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science in Perth, Australia.</p>

<p>The photo is artificially colored to showcase the eye’s optic nerve — the black spot in the center — and surrounding structures in the retina, a layer of cells within the eye that captures light. A protein that helps blood vessels contract is shown in red and cell nuclei are blue. In yellow are astrocytes, a kind of immune cell that helps control inflammation in the retina. </p>





<p>The image is part of research that aims to uncover how diabetic retinopathy — a disease where high blood sugar damages retinal blood vessels — can alter the function and structure of the retina, Qambari says. When people are diagnosed, the disease is typically already in a late stage and the retina has sustained irreversible damage. Some people can go blind.</p>



<p>By pinpointing any changes that happen early on, researchers may be able to develop a drug to reverse those changes before the disease advances and causes damage.</p>



<p>The inner workings of the rat eye is one of <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86 photos recognized in this year’s competition</a>, the winners of which were announced October 17.

Cell nuclei are magenta.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132400">Vaibhav Deshmukh</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some of these cells are in fix-it mode.</p>



<p>The photo, snapped by molecular physiologist Vaibhav Deshmukh, showcases cells called myoblasts that build muscle. These myoblasts are from mice and can be grown indefinitely in lab dishes. With dyes and antibodies, Deshmukh, then studying heart myoblasts as a graduate student at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, marked different parts of the cells in blue, orange and magenta. </p>



<p>One cell, in the image&#8217;s center, is in metaphase, a stage of the cycle that divides a single cell into two. During metaphase, the nucleus dissolves, and DNA-carrying chromosomes line up in the center of the cell. In the next step of the cycle, the chromosomes will be pulled apart. The image shows “how a dividing cell changes its shape and navigates through a crowded space to complete the cell cycle,” Deshmukh says.</p>



<p>In the body, myoblasts kick into high gear when muscle is damaged. Muscle fibers can’t repair themselves after injuries like sprains and cuts. Instead, myoblasts fuse to the fibers to help muscle regenerate. </p>

<p>Allergy sufferers, beware — this photo may cause phantom itchiness or sneezing.</p>



<p>Educator John-Oliver Dunn of Bendorf, Germany, took more than 600 images to piece together a view of sunflower pollen on an acupuncture needle. Dunn wanted to showcase how small pollen is relative to a needle, first attempting to take photos with an insulin needle. But as acupuncture needles have a finer point, they hold the pollen better, Dunn says.</p>





<p>A sunflower is not actually a single flower. The brown center of just one is filled with hundreds of tiny flowers. The male flowers of this bunch are responsible for the pollen, sprouting long filaments covered in pollen for insects to pick up and take to other plants.</p>

<p>Bright butterflies often steal the spotlight from duller-colored moths. But the scales on this Chinese moon moth (<em>Actias ningpoana</em>) are snatching it back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Photographer Yuan Ji snapped this photo of a dead moth in his studio at the World Expo Museum in Shanghai. Many photographs focus on moon moths’ flashiest features: spots that adorn their wings or long tentacle-like extensions. But Ji zoomed in on a different spot at the top border of the insect’s left wing.</p>



<p>Microscopic butterfly and moth scales give the insects their wing decor, which can sometimes help the organisms blend into their surroundings to hide from predators. For Ji, the scales resemble cars on a road.</p>

The axolotl has been magnified 25 times its normal size.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132403">Priscilla Vieto Bonilla and Brandon Antonio Segura Torres</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Biologists Priscilla Vieto Bonilla and Brandon Antonio Segura Torres spent days shadowing one amphibian egg from zygote to hatch day.</p>



<p>What emerged was this small axolotl (<em>Ambystoma mexicanum</em>), shown at 1 week of age. Axolotls are salamanders native to just two lakes in Mexico, one of which no longer exists and another that has been reduced to mainly canals. The young creature will retain its youthful features throughout its life, a phenomenon called neoteny, Vieto Bonilla says.</p>



<p>It’s unclear why the animals look forever young, but it may be because their native lakes never dried up, at least not before Spanish colonizers started draining lakes near present-day Mexico City to control flooding in the 1600s. Other amphibians that live in areas with transient streams or lakes mature from water-living young into adults capable of thriving on land or in water. But year-round access to lakes may have helped axolotls hold onto larvae-esque features, such as gills, that allow them to stay in water full time.</p>



<p>The pair of photographers, both undergraduates at the Universidad Nacional del Comahue in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, were delighted to watch a new life develop. “While studying the theory in the classroom is one thing,” Vieto Bonilla says, “observing the zygote dividing in real time was an entirely different experience.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenhouse-gas-climate-change-roisin-commane-scientists-to-watch">Róisín Commane sleuths out greenhouse gas leaks to fight climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>New York has a greenhouse gas accounting problem. The state broadly tracks its sources of air pollution, from energy production to transportation to waste management, but the books don’t always match what’s actually in the air. The amount of methane over New York City, for example, is puzzlingly higher than expected.</p>



<p>It’s a mystery that Róisín Commane is trying to solve. Part accountant, part sleuth, the Columbia University atmospheric chemist scours the city from pavement to rooftop looking for unidentified or incorrectly cataloged sources of greenhouse gases — and uses this information to improve our understanding of the city’s anthropogenic emissions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>There are two primary strategies to quantify emissions. Bottom-up models calculate total pollution from individual sources using representative values for each type of emissions. Top-down models describe total pollution moving through an area using measurements taken directly from tower sensors or planes.</p>



<p>The challenge lies in reconciling the two, Commane says. “These models can be tweaked to make sure that they represent the atmosphere as we understand it now.”</p>





<p>It’s important work. Urban areas account for about 70 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, and among cities in the United States, New York City is the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.</p>



<p>A better accounting of greenhouse gas emissions could help New York reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and assess how well its reduction efforts are working, Commane says. “We all have great intentions, but if we can show it’s reducing emissions, that’s a much more tangible thing.”</p>



<p>And the findings in New York City could inform similar efforts elsewhere, especially in places with comparable natural gas infrastructure.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Emissions estimates don’t match reality</h4>



<p>Commane compares atmospheric modeling to solving a complicated puzzle. “I’ve always enjoyed playing with numbers,” she says.</p>



<p>After studying chemistry and mathematical physics at University College Dublin in Ireland, Commane got a Ph.D. in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Leeds in England. There, she learned to build tools that measure atmospheric gases, including laser systems.</p>



<p>Atmospheric scientist Steven Wofsy, who advised Commane while she was a research associate at Harvard University, praises her ability to “think about problems holistically.” She’s very creative, he says, pointing to work she did on Arctic carbon. Many existing models focused solely on the summer growing season, when carbon uptake from photosynthesis is at its peak. But Commane extended her experiment to include the winter months, when the ground layer finally freezes and soil microbes that break down and release organic matter as carbon become dormant.</p>



<p>Commane found that, in warmer years, delays in Arctic freezing could lead to <a href="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~rcommane/publications-/5361full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enough soil emissions to offset summer uptake</a> and turn the tundra into a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.</p>



<p>The work in the Arctic is “slightly depressing” because “things are thawing very quickly up there,” Commane says. “The Arctic is suffering from what we&#8217;re emitting down here.”</p>



<p>Moving to Columbia University in 2018 to start her own lab gave Commane the opportunity to help address emissions at their source. In addition to New York City’s status as the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, it ranks third worldwide.</p>





<p>She started by characterizing the city’s greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. In collaboration with scientists from the City University of New York, Stony Brook University and the University of Rochester, she developed a network of monitors to sample gases around the city and state.</p>



<p>She also noticed how verdant the city was. New York City is home to an estimated 7 million trees, yet vegetation is left out from most of the city’s carbon accounting models, Commane says.</p>



<p>Commane wondered whether the trees might help explain why carbon emissions measured in the atmosphere were slightly lower than what the bottom-up models predicted. Using the latest high-resolution land cover maps to incorporate vegetation into their model, she and Dandan Wei, a postdoc in her lab, found that the city’s trees were absorbing <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aca68f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a surprisingly large amount of carbon dioxide</a> during the afternoon, about 40 percent of the city’s emissions on a summer’s day.</p>



<p>“So the trees do really matter,” Commane says, and models need to account for them. Otherwise, attempts to measure total emissions from human activity in the atmosphere would miss the chunk of carbon that is temporarily taken up by the trees.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Eyes on methane</h4>



<p>As for methane, levels in the air above the city are at least three times as high as those predicted by bottom-up models. But no one knows what causes the excess.</p>



<p>To figure that out, Commane looks for methane relative to other gases, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ethane. When the sensors pick up large plumes of gas, Commane uses a technique called source attribution to determine how the plumes were produced. Wind speed and plume intensity provide information about the direction to and distance from the source.</p>



<p>Then it’s a matter of hopping into a car or going on foot to measure and confirm the exact location of the emissions with portable sensors, Commane says.</p>



<p>So far, her group has attributed a surprisingly large amount of the unaccounted-for methane to chimneys and rooftops. These are likely due to incomplete combustion of natural gas associated with building heating systems. The researchers also detected localized spikes of methane around certain equipment in now-closed landfills, which could be reduced through engineering solutions that prevent leakage. The largest signals came from older wastewater treatment plants, Commane says, but on the bright side, refurbished facilities barely produced any methane at all.</p>



<p>“The ground-truthing that Dr. Commane is doing is really important,” says Ellen Burkhard, a senior adviser at the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the state agency that funds this part of Commane’s research.</p>



<p>“By making these measurements in a sophisticated way, repeatedly, we can characterize the source and [how] that source may change over time,” Burkhard says. “It&#8217;s sort of the old adage: You can&#8217;t manage what you don&#8217;t measure.”</p>



<p>Though Commane continues to work on other projects, she finds the partnership between her lab and the energy research agency particularly rewarding because it’s so solutions-oriented. It keeps her realistic but hopeful in the fight against climate change. “If we didn&#8217;t have a way of trying to help fix things, it would feel a lot more futile,” she says. “Here, I can do something about it. And that makes a big difference, I think.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Alireza Poshtkohi will talk about his PhD research in the talk entitled: &quot;Mathematical Modelling of Plasma Membrane Electrophysiology and Calcium Dynamics in Microglia&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Microglia, a type of glial cell, perform many tasks while interacting with neurons,
astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Despite moderate advances in the characterisation of
microglia in laboratory rodents, very little information is known about the physiology of
microglia in the human brain. This is a challenging task and consequently this research
attempts to advance knowledge of microglia function through mathematical modelling.
Microglia restructure their intracellular actin cytoskeleton to enable motility; this
requires a complex molecular cascade involving a set of ionic channels, membrane-coupled
receptors, and cytosolic components. In this research, we develop a theoretical foundation
for studying P2-mediated calcium and PI3K/Akt signalling in human microglial cells.
Firstly, a detailed mathematical model is built for the dynamics of human P2XRs in
microglia. Subsequently, experimental whole-cell currents are used to derive the
P2X-mediated electrophysiology of human microglia (sodium and calcium dynamics, and
membrane potential). Secondly, microglial-directed motility involves a complex family of
intracellular signalling pathways that are mainly controlled by P2Y-mediated cytosolic
calcium (Ca2+) signalling and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. This work addresses the
development of mathematical models for these two complex aspects of microglial functions
and investigates the interconnecting role of PI3K pathway to Ca2+.
Our predictions reveal new quantitative insights into how P2Rs regulate ionic concentrations
in terms of physiological interactions and transient responses. Simulation results show that
kink-like, intricate Ca2+ responses mediated by P2XRs arise from a complex cooperative
activation of both P2XRs, and ionic extruders and pumps. More importantly, the proposed
model supports our hypothesis that calcium influx via P2YR and P2XR can explain the
experimentally observed twin peaks in the phosphorylated Akt. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first biophysical model that aims to predict complicated Akt and
P2-mediated Ca2+ responses in microglia. The biophysical models provide direction for new
fundamental experimental research.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541601826" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Math Real?</a><br><em>Eugenia Cheng<br>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>Every mathematician has a story that goes something like this. You’re at a party, and someone asks what you do for a living. “I’m a mathematician,” you say. “You must be a genius!” they reply. Or perhaps you end up being an impromptu therapist to someone who needs to vent about traumatic experiences they had in math class decades ago. </p>



<p>Mathematics is treated with both reverence and fear: People often see math as an objective, apolitical tool that can buttress or refute arguments, but they also feel intimidated and anxious when they think they might have to use it.</p>





<p>Mathematician Eugenia Cheng has spent much of her career working to alleviate those anxieties. As scientist in residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, she teaches mathematics to artists, many of whom have never seen themselves as “math people.” She has also written several books, for both adults and children, that seek to cultivate mathematical curiosity and illustrate some of the ways mathematical thinking can enrich our lives. Her latest, <em>Is Math Real?: How Simple Questions Lead Us to Mathematics’ Deepest Truths</em>, demonstrates the ways that seemingly naïve questions can unlock fascinating journeys to understanding math for math’s sake, rather than purely in service of real-world applications.</p>



<p>Math has a reputation for supplying concise, black-or-white answers to questions. Getting straightforward math questions right or wrong is often presented as the litmus test of whether someone has mathematical ability. But that view of math is simplistic, Cheng explains. Rather than a tool for obtaining objective right answers, math is a method for asking questions and exploring the possibilities those questions raise.</p>



<p>Students are naturally curious about numbers and patterns, but math classes often teach them that math facts should be accepted without question. For instance, a student might learn that a prime number is defined as a whole number — a positive number without a fractional or decimal part — that is only divisible by itself and 1. The number 1, however, is not considered a prime number. If a student asks why not, they will likely be told it just isn’t; deal with it.</p>



<p>But in fact, there is a good reason to exclude 1 from the prime numbers. As Cheng describes, the prime numbers are the multiplicative building blocks of the whole numbers; every whole number greater than 1 can be broken down as a product of prime numbers. Because multiplying by 1 doesn’t do anything to a number, 1 isn’t needed to build the other whole numbers, at least when multiplication is considered. (For addition, it’s a whole different story.) Excluding 1 from the primes allows us to break every whole number greater than 1 down into a product of primes in only one way — 12 is the product of two copies of 2 and one copy of 3, for example, and cannot be broken down into any different set of primes. If 1 were a prime number, those products would no longer be unique. You could toss any number of 1s into the mix and still get the same product.</p>



<p>Mathematicians have found the uniqueness of these products useful for exploring properties of numbers, so they came to the consensus not to include 1 in the primes about a century ago. Considering the reasons mathematicians define primes precisely the way they do is more interesting than simply accepting the definition so you can get an A on a math test.</p>



<p>The prime number example is just one of many simple questions that Cheng poses in the book to motivate deep dives into the logical foundations of Western mathematics: Why does 1+1 = 2? Why does −(−1) = 1? Why does 2+4 = 4+2? And, yes, is math real? Cheng’s answers to those questions touch not only on our understanding of mathematics itself, but also on her personal experiences with math education as both student and teacher. </p>



<p>She also examines how mathematical thinking intersects with life within and outside of the classroom, from the subtle imperialism of the commonly used Mercator map projection, which inflates the perceived size of countries that were colonialist powers, to the parallels between open-mindedness to new mathematical ideas and open-mindedness to the experiences of marginalized groups in society.</p>



<p><em>Is Math Real?</em> will help readers understand the questions that drive mathematicians and encourage people to see the value of math in their own lives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strike-against-venus-lightning">Here’s another strike against Venus having copious lightning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Venus has long been depicted as having a hellish atmosphere. Despite that reputation, evidence increasingly suggests that our neighbor’s cloudy shroud isn’t riddled with lightning.</p>



<p>Last month, planetary scientists proposed that most if not all of the bright flashes observed in Venus’ atmosphere <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-atmosphere-meteor-lightning-space">could be explained by meteors</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/23</em>). Now, a separate team suggests that whistling electromagnetic waves often created by lightning on Earth and other planets are not sparked by lightning on Venus.</p>





<p>In 2021, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">Parker Solar Probe</a> swung past the nighttime side of Venus on its way toward the sun (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>). As it did, its instruments picked up radio waves that scientists have dubbed whistler waves. Such disturbances got their name because their frequency quickly changes from high to low before they disappear, says Harriet George, a space physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>Oddly, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL105426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venus’ whistler waves were traveling downward toward the planet</a>, not up and away from it, as they would have been if they’d been caused by lightning, George and her team report in the Oct. 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>An alternate source of energy for these whistler waves could be disturbances in Venus’ weak magnetic fields, the researchers suggest. As magnetic field lines shift and reconnect, they can release prodigious amounts of energy, George says. In other milieus, magnetic reconnections <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">accelerate the solar wind</a>, help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">heat the sun’s outer atmosphere</a> and help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watching-northern-lights-form">trigger Earth’s auroras</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/23; SN: 11/14/19; SN: 7/24/08</em>). They’ve got the right characteristics to create whistler waves on Venus too.</p>

                <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.14.520391">Bagur, Bourg et al. (2022)</a> from the Bathellier Lab in Paris make the interesting finding that the auditory code is represented as temporal sequences of neuronal activity in early auditory processing stages and as spatial patterns in auditory cortex. I am not an expert for auditory cortex, but I found this paper quite compelling and interesting, both in terms of methodological approaches and in terms of concepts.<br />Sophie Bagur has already published a few very interesting papers that are both excellent and creative and definitely worth a read. For example, in a study published with her as senior author <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100355">Verdier et al. (2022)</a> on an entirely different topic, they showed that optogenetic stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle could be used to improve behavioral training of mice and replace water restriction protocols very effectively.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.07.536077">Lai, Tanaka et al. (2023)</a> from Albert Lee’s lab wrote a very cool paper where they made rats navigate mentally. In short, they used the spiking output of the hippocampus, which they extracted online, to control a virtual reality that (1) represented themselves in a spatial context (&#8220;mental navigation&#8221;), or that (2) represented another object in a spatial context (&#8220;telekinesis&#8221;). Using this approach, the authors tried to show that hippocampus represents mental navigation of the self but also mental navigation of objects in the external world.<br />A minor issue I had with the paper was that the authors write very prominently that they constructed a low-latency (&#8220;real-time&#8221;) closed-loop system, feeding back neuronal activity into the virtual environment. However, this ultra-fast feedback is first going through a decoder that uses a 5-s running window, basically eliminating the speed of the feedback loop. This secret is hidden somewhere in the Methods section.<br />In addition, I had the feeling that the claim of “mental navigation” would require slightly stronger evidence that the animal did not really move physically while performing “mental navigation”. The existing analyses could have been deepened a bit. However, in general I really liked the paper, both for its ideas and for its technical implementation of the brain-machine interface for rats. Definitely worth a read!<br />Let&#8217;s try to dig a bit into the conceptual space around this study. The manuscript made me wonder how different it is whether we mentally move objects (like tetris objects, &#8220;telekinesis&#8221;) or avatars (like in a 1<sup>st</sup> person video game, &#8220;mental navigation&#8221;). Do both situations feel the same for us? We do certainly identify with avatars viewed from a 3<sup>rd</sup> person perspective (as in many video games). The transition from 3rd person avatars (&#8220;mental navigation&#8221;) to movable objects (&#8220;telekinesis&#8221;) seems pretty smooth from my perspective. A pixelized avatar from super mario feels almost like an object, and we treat pacman for sure like an avater, even though it is barely more than an object. There does not seem to be a sharp transition between an eating blob like pacman or snake to something less animated like a tetris element. It seems like introspection might be a good way to better understand how we as humans differentially treat virtual avatars or virtual objects in our mind.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-stem-cells-breast-cancer-spine">Newly identified stem cells can lure breast cancer to the spine</a></h4>

              
                <p>When breast cancer spreads, it often targets the spine. Now scientists may have finally discovered why.</p>



<p>A newfound kind of stem cell <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06519-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drives cancer cells to bones in the vertebrae</a>, pathologist Matthew Greenblatt of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and his colleagues report September 13 in <em>Nature. </em>The find helps explain a long-standing mystery of metastasis: why some cancers break away from their site of origin, journey through the bloodstream and take up residence in the backbone.</p>





<p>“This is a major advance in our understanding of bone metastasis,” says Xiang Zhang, a cancer biologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>In people with metastatic breast cancer, some 70 percent experience subsequent bone cancer. And of the bones in the skeleton, cancer cells preferentially seek out vertebrae. For these patients, “spine metastases are one of the most common complications,” Greenblatt says, “and one of the most dreaded.” Tumors that take root in the spine can crush the spinal cord, which houses nerve bundles crucial for body sensation and movement. Such damage can hamper people’s ability to walk and control their bladder and bowels, and shorten their life spans.</p>



<p>Doctors have known for decades that some cancers preferentially seek out the spine, Greenblatt says, but no one has had a good explanation for why. One idea proposed in 1940, that actions like coughing jolt blood off course and somehow send cancerous cells to the vertebrae, still hangs on today. It’s what Greenblatt learned when he was a medical student. But for him and his team, “that didn&#8217;t make sense to us scientifically.”</p>



<p>What did end up making sense was stem cells. The researchers had a hunch that stem cells inside vertebral bones differed from those in other sites in the skeleton, like the long bones in the arms and legs. In the lab, that’s just what they found. Greenblatt’s team pulled out a population of stem cells from mice vertebrae distinctly unlike ones collected from long bones. These new stem cells switched on a separate set of genes and behaved differently in experiments, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Until now, scientists didn’t know that these two types of bones held distinct populations of stem cells. “We assumed they were the same,” says Geert Carmeliet, a cell and molecular endocrinologist at KU Leuven in Belgium who was not involved with the work, but wrote an accompanying <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02768-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentary</a>. The team’s discovery raised the possibility that spinal stem cells might play a role in spinal disease.</p>

Sun <em>et al</em>./<em>Nature</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In one key experiment, Greenblatt’s team transplanted spinal stem cells into one hind leg of mice and long bone stem cells into the other. Each transplant formed miniature bones, or organoids, in the animals’ bodies — a tiny vertebra on the right, for example, and a bit of long bone on the left. Then, the researchers injected breast cancer cells into the mice and watched where they ended up.</p>



<p>The cells traveled to the mini vertebra nearly twice as often as they did to the little long bone, as if lured by a cancer-calling Pied Piper. It’s an elegant way to show that “tumor cells preferentially come to the [vertebra] organoid and not to the organoid of the long bone,” Carmeliet says.</p>



<p>The newly identified spinal stem cells, found in both mice and humans, secrete a protein called MFGE8 that acts as a tumor attractant, the team discovered, drawing cancer cells to spinal tissue. The protein may not be only factor involved, Greenblatt says, “but it&#8217;s an important one in driving tumor cells to the spine.”</p>



<p>It’s possible that blocking MFGE8 could prevent or treat spine metastasis. “I think it&#8217;s definitely worth further investigation,” Zhang says. But, he notes, it’s still too early to know what the therapeutic implications may be.</p>





<p>Greenblatt’s team is now exploring whether the new stem cells can recruit other types of tumor cells to the spine. When prostate cancer spreads, for example, it also tends to travel to vertebrae over other types of bone. He and his colleagues are also curious whether our bones may be hiding anything else. “We&#8217;re starting to think about what other stem cells may be left to discover in the skeleton.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-jet-nova-blast-m87-galaxy">The black hole–powered jet in galaxy M87 is making stars explode</a></h4>

              
                <p>High-speed gas shooting from the galaxy M87 is causing stars to go nova, a study suggests, and no one knows how.</p>



<p>A nova occurs after a dense star known as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down">white dwarf receives gas from an orbiting star</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). As the white dwarf’s intense gravity squeezes the gas, it heats up and explodes, but both stars survive the violence. In fact, over millions of years, the same star goes nova again and again. Recent observations indicate that these eruptions forged much, and perhaps most, of the universe’s supply of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">the valuable metal lithium</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/19</em>).</p>





<p>Nova explosions erupt in our galaxy as well as others, including the giant elliptical M87, whose jet of fast-moving gas is powered by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">black hole</a> at the galaxy’s center (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Now Hubble Space Telescope data show that there’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an excess of these explosions along M87’s jet</a>, researchers report in a study submitted September 28 to arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Alec Lessing, an undergraduate student at Stanford University, Michael Shara, an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and their colleagues used the telescope to locate 135 nova outbursts in M87, whose jet is many thousands of light-years long. The galaxy itself is 54 million light-years from Earth, at the heart of the nearest galaxy cluster, named Virgo.</p>

<p>After identifying the nova explosions, the team plotted their positions in the galaxy. “It was striking to the eye,” Shara says of the plot. “The novae appeared to be preferentially aligned with the jet.”</p>



<p>By dividing the galaxy into 10 equal sectors, the astronomers found that 25 blasts occurred along the jet — versus only 10 to 16 in each of the galaxy’s other sectors. The chance that this is just a statistical fluke is only about 0.3 percent, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“I was really surprised,” says Massimo Della Valle, an astronomer at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics in Naples, who was not involved with the new study. “If these objects are novae, the jet has to be responsible for this somehow.”</p>



<p>Perhaps, he says, the jet pushes interstellar gas onto white dwarf stars in nova systems, increasing the amount of material that accumulates on the stars’ surfaces. As a result, the white dwarfs explode more frequently than they otherwise would, accounting for the surplus of nova outbursts along the jet.</p>



<p>The jet itself, Shara says, doesn’t seem to supply enough gas or radiation to explain the explosions. “The jet is to blame, but we just don’t know why or how,” he says. “It is somehow causing the novae to be more prevalent in that sector, but whether it’s because it’s triggering the novae somehow or birthing the novae — making more of them there — or some other process … we don’t know.”</p>



<p>For additional clues, Shara hopes to use Hubble to examine other galaxies that resemble M87, to see whether their jets are also accompanied by such eruptions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-genetically-modified-silkworms-spider-silk">In a first, genetically modified silkworms produced pure spider silk</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spider silk is prized for its unrivaled strength and toughness. But figuring out a way to mass-produce it is no easy feat. Spiders cannot be put to work to pump out the fibers the way silkworms can: They’re extremely territorial and inclined to eat their neighbors, and they refuse to keep at the task for long. So for decades, scientists have tried to genetically-engineer various organisms — including bacteria, yeast, mice, hamsters and even goats — to produce spider silk, but with only partial success.</p>



<p>Now, for the first time, researchers from China have coaxed <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(23)00421-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pure spider silk out of genetically modified silkworms</a>. The material is six times as tough as the Kevlar used in bulletproof vests, the team reports in the Oct. 4 <em>Matter</em>.</p>





<p>The fibers flaunt “better mechanical properties than anybody else has been able to show,” says molecular biologist Randy Lewis, a spider silk expert at Utah State University in Logan who wasn’t involved with the study.</p>



<p>The strands are not as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silk">strong or as stretchy as natural spider silk</a>, but they are an advance (<em>SN: 11/7/08</em>). Previous work in silkworms generated weaker fiber blends of only 30 to 50 percent spider silk.</p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to insert the complete instructions for making spider silk protein into silkworms and make sure the protein wound up in the silkworms’ silk-making glands. That allowed the team to take advantage of the insect’s natural machinery. Breeding the tweaked silkworms then resulted in some that inherited the spider silk gene from both parents, meaning they could produce purer spider silk.</p>



<p>If the silk someday makes it out of the laboratory, doctors could use it to sew extra-sturdy sutures. Police officers could don stronger armored vests. And a more environmentally friendly fiber could replace common synthetics like nylon and polyester.</p>



<p>“Spider silk stands as a strategic resource in urgent need of exploration,” Junpeng Mi, a synthetic biologist from Donghua University in Shanghai, said in a news release. Mi estimates that the surgical applications of spider silk alone could aid millions worldwide.</p>



<p>Yet mass production of spider silk faces hurdles. Mi and colleagues will first need to confirm that the genetic changes they induced in the silkworms will last several generations. If not, manufacturers may need to regularly jump-start the engineering process.</p>

Mi</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers would also confront the same challenges of traditional silkworm farmers, including ensuring the insects’ health. Biologist Justin Jones, another spider silk researcher at Utah State University, notes that silkworms are notoriously vulnerable to infection.</p>



<p>Even when the silkworms are healthy, these factory workers can create disparate silk fibers. “In the silk world, as we’ve discovered, the real problem is that there are hundreds and hundreds of strains of silkworms out there that farms use, and … they don’t give you the same mechanical properties,” Lewis says.</p>



<p>Still, silkworms make one of the most attractive candidates for this type of genetic engineering. Most of the other modified creatures eke out only small amounts of usable fiber, in part because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-can-be-coaxed-making-toughest-kind-spider-silk">their enzymes chop up the DNA responsible for spider silk protein</a> (<em>SN: 4/2/19)</em>.</p>





<p>And pumping out protein is just one part of the process; spiders then dissolve the protein in a liquid called dope, and transform the resulting goop into a sturdy fiber. Although silkworms can be tricky to work with, the worms sidestep both challenges: Their bodies are already accustomed to producing silk.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Mi’s team hopes to develop even stronger and stretchier fibers. By incorporating artificial amino acids into the spider silk protein, Mi imagines the researchers could potentially push past even the upper limits of the natural fiber.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-brain-cells-new-census">What a look at more than 3,000 kinds of cells in the human brain tells us</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new look at the human brain is beginning to reveal the inner lives of its cellular residents.</p>



<p>The human brain holds a dizzying collection of diverse cells, and no two brains are the same, cellularly speaking. Those are the prevailing conclusions of an onslaught of 21 papers published online October 12 in <em>Science</em>, <em>Science Advances</em> and <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The results just start to scratch the surface of understanding the mysteries of the brain. Still,&nbsp;they provide the most intimate look yet at the cells that build the brain, and offer clues about how the brain enables thoughts, actions and memories. The collection of data may also guide researchers in their hunt for the causes of brain disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and depression.</p>





<p>The new brain map is a result of a coordinated international research effort called the National Institutes of Health’s Brain Initiative Cell Census Network, or BICCN, which ramped up in 2017. Many of the studies in the collection are based on a powerful technology called single-cell genomics. The method reveals which genes are active inside of a single cell, information that provides clues about the cell’s identity and job.</p>



<p>As part of the BICCN, researchers examined all sorts of brains. One project detailed the cells in small pieces of live brain tissue taken from 75 people undergoing surgery for tumors or epilepsy, an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experiment-live-human-brain-helps-scientists-map-nerve-cells">approach that’s been used on smaller scales</a> before (<em>SN: 8/7/19</em>). Another looked at samples taken from the brains of 17 deceased children. Still another looked at brain tissue from seven people, seven chimpanzees, four gorillas, three rhesus macaques and three marmosets.</p>



<p>The resolution provided by single-cell genomics revealed details about human brain cells in a way that previous methods couldn’t. “It’s remarkable how well it works,” says Ed Lein, a neuroscientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle and one of the lead researchers in the BICCN group. Collectively, the new studies describe over 3,000 cell types that reside in the human brain.</p>



<p>The main takeaway, Lein says, is that “the brain is really complex, from a cellular perspective.”</p>



<p>Amid that complexity, several key insights have already emerged, including hints about how human brains develop, how they vary among people, and how they differ from the brains of close primate relatives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Growing brains</h4>



<p>Some of the studies focused on very young brains. A study of the first two trimesters of brain growth, for instance, turned up previously <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf9941" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unknown details</a> about the identities of nerve cells in the thalamus, a kind of waystation for information coming into the brain. Many of those cells, called GABAergic neurons, are born elsewhere in the developing brain and migrate into the thalamus.</p>



<p>Other results show that the early years matter, a lot. Seth Ament, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, and his colleagues <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ade1283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked at brain cells in the cerebellum</a>, a brain region at the back bottom of the brain. In children who died with inflammation in their brains, certain kinds of nerve cells there — Purkinje and Golgi neurons — had altered levels of active genes. The pattern, which held across eight brains, suggest that inflammation early in life could alter nerve cell development in certain spots.</p>



<p>“I’m amazed we saw something so consistent across the samples,” Ament says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Unique brains</h4>





<p>Some of the studies focused on variability between brain regions and between people.</p>



<p>One study looked at cells from about 100 spots taken from four adult brains. The researchers found, among many other things, that cells called astrocytes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add7046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used their genes differently </a>depending on where they reside. The finding hints that these cells, which are known to help nerve cells form connections and keep brain tissue healthy, may be specialized for their region.</p>



<p>Another study examined <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf6812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight regions</a> of the neocortex, the wrinkly outer area responsible for sophisticated thinking. &nbsp;Cells in those regions are somewhat standardized, sorting consistently into 24 categories, the scientists found. But the regions do have differences in the proportions of the cells. &nbsp;What that means for how these regions work is anybody’s guess.</p>



<p>Similarities also exist between people. Researchers found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf2359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly consistent patterns</a> of cells when they compared brain cells from 75 people. But there was plenty of wiggle room, too. Microglia, immune cells in the brain that also sculpt nerve cell connections, were especially unique in the genes they use from person to person, for instance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Primate brains</h4>



<p>Some of the research compares human brains with primate relatives, including chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques and marmosets. By looking at cells in other primates’ brains, Lein says, “we finally get to ask the question about what makes humans unique.&#8221;</p>



<p>Overall, cells in the middle temporal gyrus, a part of the brain’s cortex, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t differ a lot between the primate brains</a>. “It’s really remarkable that this complex cellular makeup is so conserved,&#8221; Lein says. &#8220;But you also have these changes.”</p>



<p>Compared with other primates, human brain cells use certain genes differently — in particular, genes related to how the cells form connections and communicate, researchers found. The analysis also turned up a few hundred genes that appear to behave in human-specific ways in brain cells. The researchers don’t yet know what those genes might be doing.</p>



<p>Imaging neuroanatomist Matthew Glasser cautions that it can be hard to tell exactly which brain areas are comparable among primates. Still, the results are “the first step in something really cool,” says Glasser, of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who was not involved in these studies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Even better brain maps are coming</h4>



<p>Overall, the progress represented by these and related results “is truly mind-blowing,” says cortical cartographer David Van Essen, who didn’t work on the new studies. “The community will certainly benefit from what’s coming out in this collection of papers.”</p>



<p>But, more importantly, it’s just a glimpse of what’s to come. “It’s not an end point in my view,&#8221; says Van Essen, also at Washington University. “It’s more a midpoint.”</p>



<p>Ament agrees. “These papers, as important as I think they are, are not the end,” he says. “It’s more the starting of it, and now we have a lot more work to do.”</p>



<p>The new brain maps will probably be revised, refined and added to, Lein says. Scientists are already working on the next iterations, which seek to combine zoomed-out views of brain networks and brain behavior with the ultrafine details provided by single-cell technology.</p>



<p>“Now that we have these techniques,” Glasser says, “we’re trying to combine them with brain imaging and systems neuroscience to actually try and figure out the puzzle.”</p>

<p>An education researcher who had four papers <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dIloh%252c%2bConstance">flagged for plagiarism</a> and citation issues threatened to sue the publisher and editors who decided to retract one of the articles, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We obtained the emails containing legal threats by Constance Iloh, formerly an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, through a public records request. Iloh, who was named to Forbes&#8217; “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/lmh45mmmd/constance-iloh-28/#99c978d6afbd">30 Under 30</a>” top figures in education in 2016 and briefly <a href="https://jbhe.com/2021/07/five-black-scholars-who-have-been-appointed-to-new-faculty-positions/">taught at Azusa Pacific University after leaving Irvine</a>, sued to prevent the university from giving us the emails, but after a two-year legal battle, a state appeals court affirmed the records should be released. That battle is described in more detail in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/12/our-two-year-fight-for-the-release-of-public-records/">this post</a>.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/27/high-profile-education-researcher-has-papers-retracted-and-corrected-for-plagiarism-misuse-of-references/">our reporting in August 2020</a> on the retraction of one of Iloh’s articles for plagiarism, the disappearance of another, and the correction of two more, we requested post-publication correspondence between UCI, Iloh, and the journals where the papers had appeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emails UCI released to us in May of this year shed light on the processes three journals took after concerns were raised about Iloh’s work, and how she responded.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128039"></span>



<p>The documents do not indicate UCI had any formal involvement in correcting the scholarly record. Whether the university opened an investigation into allegations of research misconduct is unclear; they told us they were “not in possession of responsive releasable documents” when we requested reports of such an inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh and her lawyer, Elvin Tabah, have not responded to our request for comment. In a <a href="https://constance-iloh.medium.com/how-does-it-feel-to-be-a-problem-b851e959abd6">Medium post</a>, Iloh claimed she experienced “academic mobbing and bullying” at UCI, actions that include “attack, harassment, humiliation, trolling, stalking, death threats, doxxing, and even online identity impersonation.” She described anonymous complaints asking the university to investigate her work for plagiarism as “a hit job” and called coverage of the actions journals took with her papers – presumably our posts – “deviant clickbait.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our previous emails to Iloh offering her an opportunity to comment, another UCI faculty member <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/09/04/professors-legal-threats-were-personal-and-not-made-on-behalf-of-the-university-says-university-of-california-irvine/">sent us legal threats</a>, which the university said “were personal and not made on behalf of the University.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Iloh’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Francis-redacted.pdf">emails with staff at Taylor &amp; Francis</a>, which in 2017 published her article “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2017.1371603">Paving effective community college pathways by recognizing the Latino post-traditional student</a>,” in the <em>Journal of Latinos and Education</em>, reveal that two years elapsed between the publisher opening an investigation into the article and publishing a retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2019, a production editor at Taylor &amp; Francis sent Iloh a PDF copy of her manuscript for her to mark up or submit a list of changes. Iloh replied with an updated manuscript on March 1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 3, the managing editor of the Routledge US Education Journals informed Iloh the publisher had received “feedback [that] inquires about the originality of some sections of text” of her article. The editor offered her “the opportunity to provide clarification on the text in question,” specifically “the decision of the specific material cited (primary versus secondary sources) and the use of direct reproduction of text from sources.”</p>



<p>Iloh responded a few days later. She asked for the “original feedback” to give to her lawyers and said she was not sure what the managing editor was asking of her. “It seems as though you have already made a judgment with ‘decisions’ so I am just not sure specifically what you are asking me to do.”</p>



<p>In the ensuing exchange, the editor gave Iloh multiple opportunities to comment on particular parts of her article and explain “the specific texts used and/or referenced within your article where there is a high degree of similarity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh made veiled legal threats at multiple points, claiming the article didn’t go through copy-editing before publication and she had tried to correct it. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have reached out to the journal with edits that I was told would be done and instead, I was accused of making “decisions” on an article the journal acknowledged having published without copy-edits and me ever completing them.</p>



<p>It was also made clear to me “someone” was clearly “out to get” me, so I already have working understanding this matter is more than what is described.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The managing editor’s response gave Iloh a deadline of October 18 to comment on the “textual overlap that was brought to our attention.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next email in the records, dated March 12, 2020, the managing editor informed Iloh of the publisher’s decision to retract the paper due to “significant textual overlap between your article and several other works.” She gave Iloh a week to respond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh’s responses repeated her claims that the article had not been copy-edited and she should be able to correct the article with added quotation marks and references. She again threatened legal action against the publisher and the whistleblower:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I wish to reiterate legal recourse in event of aforementioned direction from your prior correspondence. I would also like a copy of the original accusation from the “anonymous” so that they and those colluding with them are accordingly dealt with in legal proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The managing editor replied to Iloh the next week with documentation that the article had indeed been copy-edited and Iloh had made corrections in the process before publication. She explained that the publisher had opened an investigation on Nov. 1, 2018 into “textual similarities in your article we had been alerted to.” She also explained the publisher’s process of reviewing requests to change articles after publication, and that they do not make changes while investigating an article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the next few months, Iloh and the managing editor exchanged more emails in which Iloh repeatedly threatened legal action and called the decision to retract her article “problematic and unlawful.” The managing editor reiterated Taylor &amp; Francis’ decision and policies, including that the changes Iloh had requested “are too extensive for us to publish as a correction notice.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2020.1769961">retraction notice</a> was published on August 10, and we posted our first story on Iloh <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/27/high-profile-education-researcher-has-papers-retracted-and-corrected-for-plagiarism-misuse-of-references/">later that month</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In subsequent emails, including one sent to Taylor &amp; Francis executives with further threats to sue the company, Iloh accused the journal’s editors of “bias.” She also cited an error in the original retraction notice and claimed that journal staff were “determined to cause harm to me and retract my article, even on faulty grounds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taylor &amp; Francis <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2020.1816396">corrected</a> the retraction notice, which said her 2017 article had “text overlap” with an article she had published in 2019, but otherwise stood by its processes and decision to retract the article in a letter from Jessica Vivian, the global portfolio director in charge of education journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivian’s letter reviewed the publisher’s documentation that the article had been copy-edited, contrary to Iloh’s claims, and the process they had taken to retract the article and give Iloh an opportunity to explain the textual overlap, which she did not do. The letter also reiterated the company’s plagiarism policy and assessment that “the amount of textual overlap was far too substantial to warrant addressing the textual overlap through a correction.”</p>



<p>“​​With regards to your allegations of abuse and mishandling of your case,” Vivian wrote, “I would welcome the opportunity to review evidence against this claim. If you have this, please do share that with me at your earliest convenience.”</p>



<p>Vivian sent the letter on September 8, the day we filed our records request, so it is the last document included in the records UCI released to us. We do not know how Iloh may have responded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher’s investigation “was conducted properly and professionally and we stand by the conclusions of the re-review of this case,” Mark Robinson, corporate media relations manager for Taylor &amp; Francis, told us in an email. “There was a careful investigation into concerns about the article and extensive correspondence with the author, which is why the process took some time.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In other <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sage-correspondence.pdf">correspondence we obtained</a>, Iloh and staff at the publisher Sage took six months to agree on and publish the wording of a correction notice. Iloh objected to language indicating the original article had problems that were being fixed; staff described the changes she wanted to make to proposed wording as “not transparent enough.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article at issue, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1477971418785384">Does distance education go the distance for adult learners? Evidence from a qualitative study at an American community college</a>,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Adult and Continuing Education</em> in 2018. The emails we obtained start in January 2019 with Iloh apparently sending an updated version of the article attached to an email with no body text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another email to the journal’s editor and a Sage employee who managed the journal, dated March 21, Iloh seemingly sent an attachment related to the correction, but the email’s subject is blank and the body text does not specify what she attached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The managing editor’s reply on March 27 thanked Iloh for “reviewing the draft corrigendum,” but continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>However, we have concerns about the changes which you have made, particularly removing the record of references which have been amended/included in the updated version of your article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The editor explained Sage’s policies “in line with best practices of transparency when making changes to a published version of record.”</p>



<p>The early version of the corrigendum stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The author regrets that at the time of submission the following sources were not adequately referenced</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iloh responded:&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope this email finds you well. Per my previous email, this is not accurate however. Those references were not left out, they were added because of new text. I also do not approve of any language that includes “the author regrets.” I can send a new version as again I do not approve of the current and would never allow such. I will submit shortly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After waiting for Iloh to send her updated version, the Sage editor sent a new revision with “only the information that it is essential to inform the readers of the changes to the version of record.” Iloh did not approve of it, either, and sent her proposed version on May 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that time, the previous managing editor had left Sage, and a new staffer had taken on the role. The editor responded on May 15:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have accommodated your changes as best we can, however the latest changes you have suggested are not transparent enough to meet the criteria set out in the COPE guidelines. We have the agreement of the Editor of the <em>Journal of Adult and Continuing Education</em> on the corrigendum wording, and will therefore be proceeding with the publication of the corrigendum text as attached with this email. I would like to thank you for your co-operation on this matter and hope you appreciate that SAGE and the Editor of the journal are responsible for ensuring transparency and that relevant procedures are adhered to, and therefore have full discretion regarding the content of the corrigendum wording.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iloh sent another version the same day, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As you can see, those references were added in updating the text but they were not missing in the one from before so I want accuracy as well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The editors accepted Iloh’s revision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After extensive emails in the proofing stage of production as Iloh questioned whether one reference was written correctly and asked to remove two references to her prior work (the article Taylor &amp; Francis was in the process of retracting and another that would be removed), the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1477971419857491">correction</a> was published in July 2019. It stated that “sections throughout the original manuscript have been re-written and updated and this manuscript also includes new references.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked SAGE about the journal’s decision to publish Iloh’s correction to the article, which added eight references. A spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Those at Sage who were involved with the decision to publish a correction notice for the article are no longer at the company. Our current research integrity team is looking into what, if any, action we should take on the article now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Iloh’s article “Not non-traditional, the new normal: adult learners and the role of student affairs in supporting older college students” appeared in the 2018 edition of the <em>Journal of Student Affairs.</em> The entire issue had been removed when we wrote our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/27/high-profile-education-researcher-has-papers-retracted-and-corrected-for-plagiarism-misuse-of-references/">August 2020 post</a>, without any notice. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/JSA-and-other-pubs.pdf">emails</a> we obtained shed light on what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2019, Iloh emailed Colorado State University’s Student Affairs in Higher Education program, which publishes the <em>Journal of Student Affairs</em>, with an updated version of her article. According to the researcher, the new text had&nbsp; “minor errors corrected” and two additional references. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I did not know there wasn&#8217;t a copy editing stage, after receiving a revise and resubmit and then an acceptance. I wanted to make sure I took time to carefully correct any errors following my return from family tragedies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the next email in the records, sent in December 2019, a CSU professor informed Iloh that the school’s leadership had decided to remove her article from the 2018 issue of the journal after a “plagiarism check” indicated “significant cause for concern.” The professor attached the TurnItIn report, which revealed&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>direct use of others’ words, including whole sentences, without proper attribution. The most significant of which include the improper use of work by Chen (2017), Ke (2010), and Panacci (2015), as well as of your own work and a Concordia University website.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“I regret this situation keeps dogging you,” wrote the professor, who also mentioned talking with Iloh at an education conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Iloh had tried to make changes to the article after publication, the professor offered Iloh the opportunity to submit a revision “with the plagiarism issues noted in the reports corrected.” If Iloh submitted a new manuscript, the professor wrote, “we will scan it again and assuming all issues have been corrected, we will republish the article online with an errata note that it was originally published in 2018 and revised due to errors in attribution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Iloh did not resubmit, the professor wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>JSA must then note in the journal archives that your article was pulled from the issue due to significant errors in attribution.</p>



<p>I regret that we must take this course of action, but the integrity of the journal and these students’ work as editors must be upheld.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iloh submitted an updated version of the article the same day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March of 2020, the professor conveyed the journal’s decision that the new version didn’t sufficiently address the plagiarism issues, and the journal would not replace the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Although the percentages of individual similar content is very small, I still find issues with inappropriate use of secondary sources appearing as primary sources,” the professor wrote. “Consequently, it is thought that the core issues found with the original manuscript, although reduced, are still evident due to not appropriately attributing secondary sources.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh replied later that day:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>No worries, it is fine just being left it out. Thanks for your correspondence and I hope you are taking good care. I am not even sure what version I sent when I received your first email (as I was dealing with family deaths but wanted to respond given the nature), but these issues will never arise again. I apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We pointed out to the <em>Journal of Student Affairs&#8217;</em> current leadership that at the time we were reporting this article, a <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://sahe.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2023/08/The-Journal-2018.pdf">PDF</a> of the journal issue in which Iloh’s article appeared included the text as it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JSA-Iloh.pdf">originally appeared</a>, with no notice. The professor now in charge of the journal thanked us for pointing out “an error in our website” and said the journal would take the issue down “until an original file can be located to edit and reupload.”</p>

<p>In September 2020, we requested records from the University of California, Irvine, regarding four papers by an assistant professor of education that had been retracted, corrected, or taken down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction and correction notices for the articles, written by Constance Iloh, mentioned plagiarism and misuse of references. After our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/08/27/high-profile-education-researcher-has-papers-retracted-and-corrected-for-plagiarism-misuse-of-references/">initial reporting</a>, we wanted to see if we could learn more about what happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took approximately two and a half years for us to obtain the records, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/12/author-threatened-to-sue-publisher-over-retraction-then-sued-to-block-release-of-emails/">detailed in this post</a>. The emails we obtained shed light on the processes three journals took after concerns were raised about Iloh’s work, and how she responded – including with legal threats. </p>



<p>Here, we tell the story of how we fought in court to get the records, represented by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/opengovlaw/">Kelly Aviles</a>, who specializes in cases involving the California Public Records Act and has successfully sued <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-25/judge-orders-l-a-sheriffs-department-to-release-misconduct-use-of-force-records-after-l-a-times-lawsuit">on behalf of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128036"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On Sept. 8, 2020, we asked UCI for copies of correspondence between the university and Iloh related to the journal articles, and correspondence between the university or Iloh with the journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UCI planned to release the records to us on April 30, 2021, but Iloh filed suit to stop the release, arguing “the correspondences do not relate to conduct of the public’s benefit, Petitioner has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the balance of interests favors nondisclosure.” UCI agreed not to release the records until the court ruled on the case.</p>



<p>In July, Iloh re-filed her suit naming the Center for Scientific Integrity (CSI), Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit, as a “real party of interest.” In a legal filing opposing Iloh’s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent UCI from disclosing the records, Aviles argued that the requested correspondence is indeed a public record, and Iloh can’t “demonstrate any recognized privacy right in the emails related to her alleged wrongdoing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That November, a judge denied Iloh’s request for a preliminary injunction, and Iloh appealed the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January of this year, the appeals court affirmed the decision. Iloh’s appeal rights ended in April, after which UCI released the records to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We also filed an anti-SLAPP motion, under California’s version of a law to “<a href="https://www.rcfp.org/introduction-anti-slapp-guide/">provide defendants a way to quickly dismiss meritless lawsuits—known as ‘SLAPPs’ or ‘Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation’—filed against them for exercising their First Amendment rights</a>.”</p>



<p>The trial court judge denied our motion, but the appeals court reversed the denial and sent the matter back to the trial court for further analysis. The decision stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By targeting and seeking to impede CSI&#8217;s newsgathering activity, Iloh&#8217;s petition threatens to chill CSI&#8217;s speech-related processes like newsgathering; if successful, this could inhibit CSI&#8217;s exercise of free speech. This is the type of lawsuit the anti-SLAPP statute is designed to address, and it should be stricken if Iloh cannot demonstrate a probability of prevailing on her petition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The appeal court’s decision that the anti-SLAPP statute applies to our case “is essentially a game changer” for legal cases to prevent the disclosure of public records, Aviles said. “Ensuring the anti-SLAPP statute applies is critical,” and if the decision stands, she expects everyone facing such a suit to invoke the statute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iloh has asked for California’s Supreme Court to review the decision, but the court has not yet decided whether to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, we’ve paid about $4,000 in filing and other court fees. If you would like to help us defray those costs, please make a U.S. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/support-retraction-watch/">tax-deductible donation here</a>.</p>



<p>The long court battle for the release of public records is “not the way any of this is supposed to work,” Aviles said, but “unfortunately way too common.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The public is entitled to this information, she has no basis to stop disclosure, and yet here we are, years later,” she said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-hunt-cave-lion-skeleton-first-direct-evidence">Neandertals hunted cave lions at least 48,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Roughly 48,000 years ago, Neandertals killed a cave lion by thrusting a wooden spear into its abdomen, lion remains from Germany suggest.</p>



<p>The discovery represents the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42764-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first direct evidence of Neandertals hunting cave lions</a>, and the oldest evidence of any hominid slaying a large predator, researchers say. But such behavior probably began much earlier among Neandertals, zooarchaeologist Gabriele Russo and colleagues report October 12 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers also examined three cave lion paw bones from another German site that date to at least roughly 190,000 years ago. These bones, discovered in 2019, were originally part of a pelt that Neandertals skinned off a freshly killed cave lion (<em>Panthera spelaea</em>), the researchers suspect. The bones lay close together and included one with marks typically made during skinning of animal hides. No evidence indicates that the paw bones were used as pendants or as parts of clothing.</p>





<p>“A lion pelt with attached claws could have embodied many meanings for Neandertals and been worn as a special piece of clothing for warmth, significant occasions or simply displayed,” says Russo, of the University of Tübingen in Germany.</p>



<p>A puncture wound on a rib from the cave lion’s skeleton, unearthed in 1985, resembles impact marks made by wooden spears, the researchers say. Based on the wound’s angle, hunters approached the lion, probably an old male, from behind and stabbed it in the lower abdomen while it lay on its right side. Stone tool marks on other skeletal parts indicate that hunters butchered the animal.</p>



<p>Previous finds have suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/german-mine-yields-ancient-hunting-spears">Neandertals used wooden spears to hunt wild horses</a> 300,000 to 400,000 years ago, and to hunt deer and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meat-rotten-putrid-paleo-diet-fire-neanderthal">possibly elephants roughly 125,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/97; SN: 3/29/23</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-first-insects-ensnared-plastic-pollution">Ants may be the first known insects ensnared in plastic pollution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some Canary Island ants have picked up an unwelcome stowaway — plastic waste.</p>



<p>Plastic entanglement is commonly associated with aquatic and ocean life. Finding plastic-wrapped ants suggests that humankind’s <a href="https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/een.13284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pernicious polymer pollution</a> affects a wider range of wildlife than previously thought, researchers report September 18 in <em>Ecological Entomology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists noticed the tangled insects while studying 113 ants they’d collected from the volcanic island of La Palma. One <em>Lasius grandis </em>ant was ensnared in a thin, red fiber, while a <em>Monomorium</em> ant was wrapped in a black fiber. Chemical and physical analyses of the fibers, which were woven around the ants’ bodies and legs, revealed they were made of plastic.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Plastic waste is famously treacherous for seabirds and marine mammals, but it can cause problems for landlubbing animals too, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/camel-eating-plastic-trash-waste-deadly-masses">clogging camels’ guts</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-ppe-trash-masks-gloves-pollution-deadly-wildlife">killing songbirds</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>12/15/20</em>; <em>SN</em>: <em>4/12/21</em>). Scientists have also documented some insects interacting with plastics. Aquatic caddisfly larvae <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-020-08790-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can use small plastic fragments</a> to construct their protective body casings, says Bethanie Carney Almroth, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who was not involved in the new research.</p>



<p>There’s little evidence of plastic binding up ants and other small land insects, though. The La Palma ants represent one of the first known examples of a plastic trash–entangled terrestrial invertebrate.</p>



<p>“These last 15 years, we have acquired enormous knowledge about what happens in marine ecosystems, but it is time to expand to other systems and species for obtaining a greater perspective,” says urban ecologist Álvaro Luna of the European University of Madrid.</p>



<p>The two ants, which Luna and colleagues collected from a pine forest and near the summit of La Palma’s volcano, may have picked up the plastic accidentally while foraging. Because the ants were still alive and mobile when captured, it’s unclear whether the plastic harmed them, Luna says.</p>



<p>Adjacent roads and hiking trails could serve as the fibers’ origins, the researchers suspect. Plastic particles can be carried long distances by the wind to remote areas like those in parts of La Palma where the team found the ants, says marine ecologist Melanie Bergmann of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.</p>



<p>It’s possible that insects have been getting tangled in plastic for a long time and it’s just gone unnoticed. “The more we research, the clearer it becomes that plastic pollution is ubiquitous,” Bergmann says.</p>

<p>This mission is the beginning of “a new era of exploration, and this is the era of sample science,” said Makenzie Lystrup, director of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFvIuSpACQA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live streaming event</a> on October 11. “This is when sample science really begins.”</p>





<p>The mission began seven years ago when the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft left Earth to rendezvous with Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid that may hold clues to the formation of the solar system and the origin of life on Earth. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">OSIRIS-REx lightly touched down on Bennu</a> in 2020, scooped up a coffee cup–sized sample and sealed it away for the long trip back home (<em>SN</em>: 10/21/20) .</p>



<p>OSIRIS-REx<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth"> jettisoned its sample return capsule</a> back to Earth on September 24 (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>). The spacecraft continued on its way, under the new name OSIRIS-APEX, as it headed out on its next mission — going into orbit around the near-Earth asteroid Apophis.</p>



<p>The capsule containing the Bennu samples parachuted down to a desert landing site in Utah, where it was picked up and helicoptered to NASA’s Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston. NASA scientists carefully opened the capsule in a dedicated clean room designed to ensure that the pristine asteroid material wouldn’t be contaminated by any terrestrial material.</p>



<p>The material in the capsule was collected by blowing dust and rocks into a container with blasts of nitrogen gas. The sample consists primarily of asteroid material from as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-has-picked-osiris-rex-landing-site-asteroid-bennu">deep as 50 centimeters below the surface</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/19</em>). Additional dust and grit that adhered to the spacecraft landing pads when OSIRIS-REx touched down on Bennu will offer a look at the composition of the surface of the asteroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mission returned some bonus material as well, in the form of loose debris that was inadvertently kicked up into the capsule in the area around the collection container, prior to the capsule sealing up for the trip home. The science team has delayed opening the main sample canister, instead taking time to collect and analyze the bonus sample.</p>



<p>Much of that material is made up of water-bearing clay minerals. “The reason that Earth is the habitable world that we have, with oceans and lakes and rivers and rain,” said planetary scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who leads the OSIRIS-REx mission, “is because these clay minerals, like the ones we&#8217;re seeing from Bennu, landed on Earth 4 billion years ago to 4.5 billion years ago, making our world habitable.”</p>



<p>Other grains contain elements common on Earth, including carbon and iron, Lauretta said, as well as platelike sulfur structures that may have been crucial for jump-starting life.</p>



<p>A quarter of the Bennu sample will go to scientists on the OSIRIS-REx mission for analysis. The rest will be divvied up among scientists around the globe, with a portion set aside for future study.</p>



<p>“This stuff is an astrobiologist&#8217;s dream,” said Daniel Glavin, a senior scientist for sample return at Goddard. “I just can&#8217;t wait to get at it. And this material will be around for generations and generations.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pig-kidney-monkey-survival-organ-transplant">A monkey survived two years with a miniature pig’s kidney</a></h4>

              
                <p>Little pigs with big genome edits could be the future of organ donation.</p>



<p>A monkey that received a kidney from a genetically engineered miniature pig <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06594-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lived for more than two years after the transplant</a>, scientists report October 11 in <em>Nature</em>. The team took a molecular red pen to donor pigs’ genomes, editing the animals’ organs to be more of a match for humans. Such an editing strategy could one day make it more likely for people’s bodies to accept organs from different species.</p>





<p>The work, funded by biotechnology company eGenesis, is the latest in a string of efforts seeking to use other species to address global organ shortages. The new study is “promising work and a step in the right direction,” says Parsia Vagefi, a transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>In the United States, the demand for new organs to replace damaged or diseased ones far outpaces supply. As of October 11, nearly <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">104,000 Americans sit on the national transplant waiting list</a>. Some 89,000 of these people are seeking kidneys. “There just simply aren’t enough kidneys to go around,” said eGenesis president and CEO Mike Curtis in a news conference on October 10. Most people waiting will never get the offer, he says. “They will die on dialysis.”</p>



<p>That’s where cross-species transplantation — giving people organs from other animals — comes in, Curtis said. It’s “the only near-term viable solution to solving this huge shortfall in organ availability.”</p>



<p>But the path forward is studded with scientific stumbling blocks. Pig organs aren’t a molecular match for human bodies, for one. Porcine cells display suspicious-looking sugars that spell “stranger” to our immune systems. This can prompt rejection of a transplanted organ.</p>



<p>If the body sees those sugars, “It’s like, ‘whoa, you’re not supposed to be here,’ and the immune system attacks,” says Jayme Locke, a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Scientists tweak donor animals’ genomes to “make the pig kidney as human as possible so that our body recognizes it and doesn’t immediately attack it,” she says.</p>



<p>Locke and others have already made progress in this field. In 2021, a team at NYU Langone Health <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">tested how well a kidney from a genetically modified pig</a> functioned by attaching it to a brain-dead woman (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>). In 2022, Locke’s group upped the ante, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/campus/item/12566-uab-announces-first-clinical-grade-transplant-of-gene-edited-pig-kidneys-into-brain-dead-human" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publishing the first peer-reviewed study on a gene-edited pig kidney transplanted into a brain-dead person</a>.</p>



<p>That year, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pig-heart-organ-transplant-brain-dead-people">doctors also transplanted modified pig hearts into two brain-dead people</a> — and even a living man (<em>SN: 7/12/22</em>). The man, 57-year-old David Bennett from Maryland, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">survived for two months with the transplanted organ</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/22</em>). This September, another patient, Lawrence Faucette, became the second living person to receive a genetically modified pig heart.</p>



<p>In August, Locke’s team reported that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2808483?guestAccessKey=b0ebd45b-dbfd-4566-bcda-0411f989ae23&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=081623" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pig kidneys transplanted into a brain-dead man can function normally</a>, producing urine over the course of a seven-day study. Her team worked with a different kind of genetically modified pig than the ones Curtis and his colleagues created — one with 10 genomic edits rather than up to 69.</p>



<p>The edits, which strip away some pig aspects and add in human ones, fall into three main categories designed to make the animals’ organs safer for human use. They lop off stranger-danger sugars from pigs’ cells, insert human genes to help prevent organ rejection and knock out potentially harmful retroviruses embedded in the pigs’ genomes. “This is probably the most genetically modified pig that I&#8217;ve seen described in the literature,” Locke says.</p>



<p>Curtis’ team mixed and matched edits in different pigs and transplanted their kidneys into monkeys. Because these are pig kidneys genetically tailored for humans, scientists have to dose the monkeys with powerful immunosuppressive drugs, so the animals don’t reject the new organs. But these types of animal studies are important, Locke says, because they can demonstrate long-term organ function, which is difficult to show in people with brain death.</p>





<p>Eight out of 15 monkeys that received pig kidneys lacking the sugars and carrying the human genes survived 176 days or longer, Curtis&#8217; team showed. One monkey lasted much longer, living 758 days after the kidney transplant. Monkeys with pig kidneys missing the human genes didn’t fare nearly as well, surviving a median of 24 days.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s encouraging when you see a pig kidney being able to function for two years,” Vagefi says. “But I think it’s even more encouraging when you see it done consistently.” Like any good study, he says, the work opens a chasm of questions. He wonders, for example, how many more genetic edits pig organs may need to succeed long-term in monkeys regularly.</p>



<p>Even then, there might not be a single kind of pig donor that’s right for every person, Locke points out. She thinks it’s important to have options. Doctors may “need more than one type of genetically edited pig in order to serve all the people in need.”</p>
