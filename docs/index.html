                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Eleonora Bernasconi will talk about her work in the talk entitled &quot;Predicting saccades given the behavior of Purkinje cells&quot;.
Please see below for the abstract of a supporting paper.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A better understanding of the neural and functional mechanisms underlying drug-induced
changes in pathological nystagmus is likely to improve medical treatment. A treatment
option for downbeat nystagmus (DBN), a common form of acquired fixation nystagmus that
often occurs with cerebellar degeneration, is low doses of the potassium channel blocker
4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The upward ocular drift in DBN has a spontaneous and a vertical
gaze-evoked component. Detailed analysis of the effect of 4-AP in patients showed that the
drug consistently improved the gaze-evoked component, but had less effect in reducing the
spontaneous drift. We show by a combination of computational modelling at the systems
level and at the neuronal level how this differential effect can be investigated. We have
previously postulated that DBN is caused by damage to the floccular lobe (FL). 4-AP, which
has been shown to increase the excitability of Purkinje cells (PCs) in slice experiments,
may thus suppress DBN by partly restoring floccular function. We simulated the effect of
low concentrations of 4-AP on the cellular level using a multicompartment model of a PC,
in which we changed ion channel properties to simulate damage. The transition from the
cellular level to the systems level was achieved by constructing a population response.
Systems level modelling predicted that the effect of 4-AP on the PCs should reduce DBN,
but the predicted effect on the gaze-dependent component was less than is observed in
patients. Our results suggest that the beneficial effect of 4-AP on DBN cannot be solely
explained by its effect at the neuronal level of PCs, and suggests added effects at the
level of the population of neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-plant-leaves-fibonacci-spirals">A 407-million-year-old plant’s leaves skipped the usual Fibonacci spirals</a></h4>

              
                <p>An unusual arrangement of leaves in a 407-million-year-old fossilized plant is complicating scientists’ understanding of plant evolution.</p>



<p>Most land plants living today have spiral patterns involving the famous Fibonacci sequence of numbers. Because the spirals are so common, scientists have thought that the patterns must have evolved in some of the earliest land plants. But the leaves of the ancient plant, a member of one of the first plant groups known to have developed leaves, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg4014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were arranged in spirals that can’t be described by Fibonacci numbers</a>, researchers report in the June 16 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The study “helps us to understand how [the] diversity of plants has been generated,” says botanist Barbara Ambrose, the director of laboratory research at the New York Botanical Garden in New York City, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two previous ones: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on. Examples of spirals in plants that involve Fibonacci numbers can be seen in the arrangement of the leaves of some succulents, the bracts of a pinecone and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/golden-blossoms-pi-flowers">seeds of a sunflower,</a> among many other plants (<em>SN: 8/27/02</em>).</p>



<p>In plants with spiraling patterns of leaves, all the leaves can be described by a set of curved lines that spiral clockwise out from the center as well as by a set of curved lines that spiral counterclockwise. If the numbers of clockwise and counterclockwise curves are both numbers found in the Fibonacci sequence, it’s known as Fibonacci spiraling.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t sure why most modern plants adopt Fibonacci spiraling, but it might help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematical-lives-plants-0">maximize the amount of space</a> between leaves or other plant parts (<em>SN: 7/21/07</em>). The patterns could also arise from the distribution of auxins, a type of plant growth hormone.</p>

Hetherington</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the new study, Sandy Hetherington, a paleobotanist at the University of Edinburgh, and colleagues studied fossils of the extinct <em>Asteroxylon mackiei</em>, a member of a group of plants called lycopods that also includes modern club mosses. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The fossils were obtained from the Rhynie chert, a roughly 400-million-year-old deposit of sedimentary rock in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, that contains exceptionally well-preserved fossils of some of the first land plants. In 1969, researchers collected hundreds of cross-sectional images of <em>A. mackiei </em>fossils and the surrounding rock. Hetherington’s team digitally reconstructed the cross sections into 3-D representations of the original plants.</p>



<p>Two of the four reconstructed plants exhibited non-Fibonacci spiraling in their leaf arrangements. Both plants had eight counterclockwise spirals (a Fibonacci number). But one had seven clockwise spirals and the other had nine, neither of which is a Fibonacci number.</p>



<p>The leaves on the other two plants didn’t grow in spirals at all — instead, they grew in a series of rings stacked along the stem.</p>



<p>“Given the prevalence of Fibonacci spirals today and in the later fossil records of plants, we definitely expected Fibonacci spirals,” says study coauthor Holly-Anne Turner, a paleontologist now at University College Cork in Ireland. The <em>A. mackiei</em> fossils predate the next-earliest lycopod fossils that show non-Fibonacci spiraling by almost 50 million years.</p>





<p>Lycopod leaves evolved separately from leaves in other types of plants, but some modern lycopods do exhibit Fibonacci spiraling. That suggests the spiraling patterns may have evolved separately in different lineages of plants, says Peter Crane, a botanist and president of the Oak Spring Garden Foundation in Upperville, Va., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p><em>A. mackiei</em> is just one species, Ambrose notes. Though the fossil record is patchy, reconstructing other early plants could offer more clues to how these spirals evolve in nature.</p>



<p>New computing technology also means that it’s worth revisiting fossils that had been analyzed by hand decades ago, Turner says. With the amount of information and detail that can be collected from computer simulations, “you could find something really great.”</p>

<p>A pharmacy researcher who left the University of Pennsylvania sometime last year has been found guilty of research misconduct in multiple federal grant applications and five published papers, four of which have already been retracted.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/25/penn-maintains-wall-of-silence-over-now-retired-prof-as-retractions-mount/">we have reported</a>, William Armstead, who is retired from Penn, was working among other things on the effects of brain injury on piglets – experiments in which the animals were slaughtered. He has had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dArmstead%252c%2bWilliam%2bM">seven papers retracted</a>, and <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/penn-scientist-william-armstead-investigation-retracted-piglets-20220906.html">reported in September</a> that he had left the university. Penn <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/25/penn-maintains-wall-of-silence-over-now-retired-prof-as-retractions-mount/">did not respond to several requests</a> for comment when we attempted to reach officials there about Armstead’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-armstead-william-m">U.S. Office of Research Integrity</a>, much of that work appears to have been suspect:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127442"></span>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-mosquito-possum-flesh-eating-disease">In Australia, mosquitoes and possums may spread a flesh-eating disease</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>HOUSTON </strong>— Some mosquitoes buzzing around parts of Australia could be ferrying dangerous cargo from possums to people: flesh-eating bacteria.</p>



<p><em>Mycobacterium ulcerans </em>is the microbe behind Buruli ulcer, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/africas-latest-scourge">disfiguring skin disease</a> that largely occurs across areas of Australia and Africa (<em>SN: 7/17/99</em>). Antibiotics can help ulcers heal completely, but untreated cases can cause scarring, permanent disfigurement and disability.</p>



<p>Humans aren’t the only creatures that can get the disease. In Australia, the country’s native possums — including the common ringtail (<em>Pseudocheirus peregrinus</em>) — do too, developing ulcers and shedding the bacteria in poop. The possums are thought to transmit the bacteria to people, and researchers have suspected mosquitoes interacting somehow with infected possums could play a role.</p>





<p>Figuring out exactly what animals may harbor the bacteria and how they come into contact with people could help with efforts to control the disease. But a link between the possums, mosquitoes and people hadn’t been found.</p>



<p>Now, surveys of mosquitoes in southeastern Australia have provided that link. Analyses of captured mosquitoes show that a small number of the insects <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10789/presentation/3516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had recently fed on both possums and people</a>, molecular microbiologist Timothy Stinear reported June 18 at the ASM Microbe 2023 meeting.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses also revealed that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.07.539718v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>M. ulcerans</em> bacteria from mosquitoes, possums and people are identical</a>, Stinear and colleagues reported May 7 at bioRxiv.org in a preliminary study that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. The finding that the microbes have indistinguishable DNA in all three “really [ties] up that transmission chain between all of these species,” said Stinear, of the University of Melbourne in Australia.</p>



<p>The research provides “pretty compelling” evidence that mosquitoes could be transmitting the disease in Australia, says Jennifer Guthrie, a microbiologist and epidemiologist at Western University in London, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>



<p><em>M. ulcerans</em> is a slow-growing microbe. It can take from two to nine months before people develop symptoms of the flesh-eating disease. “Pinpointing transmission of something that happened months and months ago is really challenging,” Guthrie says.</p>



<p>In their research, Stinear and colleagues captured more than 72,000 mosquitoes from the Mornington Peninsula, a part of southeastern Melbourne where the disease is found. When the team tested about 18,000 individuals for <em>M. ulcerans</em>, nearly all that tested positive belonged to one species of day-biting mosquito: <em>Aedes notoscriptus</em>.</p>



<p>Of 13 mosquitoes from that species that had recently fed on an animal, two had sucked blood from both a ringtail possum and a person. That’s a small number, but such mosquitoes are probably rare, given that only about 200 to 300 cases of Buruli ulcer are reported in Australia each year, though cases are on the rise. In 2022, around 2,100 Buruli ulcer cases from 11 countries were reported to the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>The team also found overlap among the areas where infected mosquitoes hang out, where researchers find possum poop contaminated with the bacteria and where there are diagnosed Buruli ulcer cases in people. But it’s still unclear how exactly the mosquitoes may carry <em>M. ulcerans</em> from animal to person.</p>



<p>It’s possible that <em>A. notoscriptus </em>feeding on possum ulcers could physically bring microbes along for the ride to their next victim. But other mosquito species analyzed by the researchers also feed on possums yet don’t seem to pick the bacteria up. Another idea is that possums’ poop sometimes ends up in the small artificial containers where <em>A. notoscriptus</em> likes to lay its eggs, contaminating the water and infecting the growing insects.</p>



<p>The transmission of the disease in Australia appears to be distinct from what occurs in Africa. In western Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/still-waters-skin-disease-microbe-tracked-ponds-swamps">water bug</a> bites can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212553114000089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inject the bacteria into skin</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/08</em>). Whether the bugs transmit the microbes to people from another animal is unknown.</p>





<p><em>M. ulcerans</em> from each continent are so genetically similar that it’d be surprising if the transmission cycle were incredibly different, Stinear said. But, so far, surveys in western Africa of other animals including mosquitoes and small mammals have yet to turn up signs of <em>M. ulcerans</em>. It’s possible, he said, “we’re missing something in our studies in Africa.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-snow-melt-great-salt-lake-utah-shrinking">Dust from a shrinking Great Salt Lake may be accelerating Utah’s snowmelt</a></h4>

              
                <p>Utah’s trademarked “greatest snow on earth” may be getting dirtier — and melting faster — due in part to dust blowing off newly exposed lakebed from the shrinking Great Salt Lake.</p>



<p>Snow in the Wasatch Mountains above Salt Lake City had <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acd409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more dust deposited on it in 2022</a> than in any year since observations began in 2009, researchers report in the June <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>. The dust accumulation caused snow to disappear 17 days earlier than if the snow had been clean.</p>





<p>An earlier, faster snowmelt may alter the water supply for the 1.2 million people who live in the region, as well as ecosystems downstream, says McKenzie Skiles, a snow hydrologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. It also affects the region’s ski areas, which contribute more than $1.5 billion per year to the local economy.</p>



<p>In arid parts of the western United States, snow acts as a natural reservoir. More than half the municipal water in Salt Lake City comes from four streams that drain snow out of the Wasatch Mountains. But current forecasting tools don&#8217;t account for the impact of dust, Skiles says, which absorbs sunlight, speeding up snowmelt. That means people can’t accurately predict when snow runoff will happen so they can use water efficiently.</p>



<p>As an avid skier, Skiles noticed the slopes near Salt Lake City looked especially dirty in 2022. So she and colleagues investigated whether the increase in dust was related to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-salt-lake-shrinking-utah-drought">consecutive years of record-low water in the Great Salt Lake</a> (<em>SN: 4/17/23</em>).</p>



<p>The team collected snow samples from a plot adjacent to Alta Ski Resort and found that storms deposited substantial amounts of dust 16 times during the 2022 snowmelt season. After calculating where the dust came from during each storm based on wind direction and atmospheric conditions, the team found that Great Salt Lake contributed nearly a quarter of the total dust to the study site. It also released the most dust relative to the lake’s exposed surface area. This was surprising, Skiles says, because the Great Salt Lake&#8217;s dry lakebed is tiny compared with the exposed surfaces of neighboring dust sources, such as the much bigger West Desert, a dry landscape west of Great Salt Lake. The West Desert contributed about of half the dust, while other dried-up lakebeds and deserts, some as far away as Idaho and Nevada, delivered the rest.</p>

The dust speeded up snowmelt by 17 days.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129202">Otto Lang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The future of Utah is going to be drier,” says Patrick Belmont, a hydrologist at Utah State University in Logan who was not part of the study. Earlier snowmelt causes the landscape to dry out faster, creating “a feedback loop that’s hard to break out of,” he explains. As Great Salt Lake shrinks and deposits more dust on the mountains, there’s less water available to refill the lake during the summer, which in turn exposes a larger dust source as the shoreline recedes.</p>



<p>A smaller lake also means less winter snow, Belmont says, as evaporation from Great Salt Lake contributes up to 10 percent of the snowpack in the Wasatch range. “Unless we make some big policy changes, we should expect to see a much lower Great Salt Lake, and it&#8217;s very possible that we lose the lake altogether.”</p>



<p>Skiles and her colleagues plan to keep monitoring the snowpack and to use remote sensing to see if dust is impacting snow across all of the mountains that drain into the Great Salt Lake. “We need more years of data to understand if this is the new normal,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asia-xiongnu-nomadic-empire-expansion">How Asia’s first nomadic empire broke the rules of imperial expansion</a></h4>

              
                <p>In an age that spawned the ancient Roman and Egyptian empires, Mongolia’s Xiongnu Empire broke the rules of imperial expansion.</p>



<p>Long before the Mongol Empire arose, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-western-man-found-ancient-mongolian-tomb">Asia’s first nomadic empire, horse-riding Xiongnu people</a>, conquered ethnic groups across the continent’s northeastern and central expanses (<em>SN: 1/29/10</em>). A common political system headed by Xiongnu imperial rulers formed about 209 B.C. and lasted for roughly 300 years. Unlike in Rome or Egypt, mobile groups of Xiongnu animal herders accomplished this feat without building cities, forming central bureaucracies, devising a writing system or mobilizing masses of farmers to produce food.</p>



<p>Today, remnants of Xiongnu culture largely consist of more than 7,000 tombs, some heavily looted and many yet to be excavated, in Mongolia and nearby parts of China and Russia. In the last decade, geneticists and archaeologists have ramped up efforts to study these sites and ancient records to decipher the Xiongnu Empire’s political organization and technological achievements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="391" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061623_BB_mongolia-nomadic-empire_inline3.jpg" alt="A map of Asia with a large red patch representing the Xiongnu Empire stretching across central Mongolia, parts of southern Russia and to western Asia." class="wp-image-3129092" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061623_BB_mongolia-nomadic-empire_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061623_BB_mongolia-nomadic-empire_inline3-666x383.jpg 666w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061623_BB_mongolia-nomadic-empire_inline3-323x186.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129092">Starting from a heartland in what’s now central Mongolia, the Xiongnu Empire (brown) spread across a large part of northern Asia, taking hold around 2,200 years ago.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129092">naturalearthdata.com/Wikimedia (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC0 1.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A few ancient Chinese chronicles include descriptions of the Xiongnu political system. These accounts portray the Xiongnu as predatory raiders who belonged to a “simple” confederation of herding groups run by a few nomadic alpha males. Even so, warfare with mounted Xiongnu warriors equipped with bows, arrows and metal weapons had inspired Imperial Chinese leaders to construct their Great Wall.</p>



<p>Some researchers have argued that Xiongnu people formed a lesser, “shadow empire” alongside Imperial China. But that view is giving way to a picture of the Xiongnu Empire as a different, not lesser, type of ancient state, says Yale University archaeologist William Honeychurch.</p>





<p>In this view, nomadic Xiongnu elites developed a flexible system of political power that connected mobile groups with different genetic and cultural ancestries spread across extensive grasslands and forests. “Elite lineages were not only an important part of a multiethnic Xiongnu state, but members of these lineages were sent to peripheral areas as part of state integration,” Honeychurch says. One new study, for example, indicates that Xiongnu women from elite lineages in central Mongolia served as “princess” emissaries to the empire’s frontier, assuming political power in distant territories populated by various ethnic groups.</p>



<p>“This must have been an empire organized around moving populations,” says archaeologist Bryan Miller of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “Xiongnu elites were savvy politicians who delegated power to keep the empire together.”</p>



<p>In another recent development, excavations in Central Mongolia point to Xiongnu people as early ironworking innovators whose advances spread to their regional neighbors. These discoveries, and others, highlight the unappreciated complexity and the ongoing mystery of how Xiongnu society worked, researchers say.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Xiongnu dispatched frontier ‘princesses’</h4>



<p>Initial insights into the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xiongnu people’s diverse genetic origins</a> were first published in 2020. DNA extracted from remains of 60 individuals excavated at 27 Xiongnu sites indicated that two genetically distinct populations of Mongolian herders had coalesced to become the Xiongnu people around 2,200 years ago. One population descended from several western Mongolian cultures and the other from a couple of eastern Mongolian cultures.</p>



<p>Additional genetic contributions to the Xiongnu mix then came from farther away, most likely a culture near present-day Ukraine as well as Imperial China, reported archaeogeneticist Choongwon Jeong of Seoul National University in South Korea and colleagues.</p>



<p>Building on those findings, Jeong’s team then examined DNA of 17 individuals from elite and low-status graves at two Mongolian cemeteries on the Xiongnu Empire’s western frontier. Central Mongolia’s Xiongnu heartland lay around 1,200 kilometers to the east.</p>



<p>The six largest and richest tombs contained <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf3904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women whose genetic ancestry traced back to central Mongolia</a>, the scientists reported in April in <em>Science Advances</em>. These women rested in wooden coffins placed in square tombs. Items found in these tombs included gold sun and moon emblems of Xiongnu imperial power, glass beads, silk clothes and Chinese mirrors.</p>

<p>One woman was buried with horse-riding equipment, a gilded iron belt clasp and a Chinese lacquer cup. These objects have previously been found in graves of male horse-mounted warriors. But such items signal that a deceased person had been powerful, not necessarily a warrior, says Miller, a study coauthor.</p>



<p>Miller and his colleagues suggest that the women had been sent to the frontier to maintain Xiongnu traditions and nurture <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-nomadic-herders-beat-path-silk-road">contacts with Silk Road trade networks</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/17</em>). Preliminary signs of genetic relatedness among individuals interred at one of the cemeteries suggest that some elite Xiongnu “princesses” also cemented power by marrying into local families.</p>





<p>The elite women’s graves were flanked by simple graves of adult men, and of girls and boys ranging from babies to adolescents. These commoners possessed greater genetic diversity than the female big shots. If the men were retainers or servants of female elites, they had come from distant parts of the Xiongnu Empire or possibly beyond, the researchers say.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Male rulers were homebody ‘princes’</h4>



<p>Like these female elites, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ara.2023.100446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">premier Xiongnu rulers had common roots in central Mongolia while their followers had diverse geographic origins</a>, another team reports in the June <em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>. But rather than being sent to the far reaches of the empire, these rulers stayed close to home.</p>



<p>Three male nobles interred in large underground tombs at one of the largest Xiongnu cemeteries, Gol Mod 2, spent most or possibly all their lives in the Khanuy Valley where they were buried, say archaeologist Ligang Zhou of Henan Provincial Institute of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology in Zhengzhou, China and colleagues.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, at least four of eight individuals buried in some of the many small satellite graves situated near the nobles’ tombs had spent much of their lives in distant places before settling in or near the Khanuy Valley, measurements of different forms of the element strontium in individuals’ teeth and bones indicate. Diet-related strontium signatures, which vary from one region to another, signal where a person spent early and later parts of their lives.</p>



<p>The identities of those in satellite graves, who were apparently killed to form entourages of followers that accompanied deceased nobles, are unclear. They include children and adults, Zhou says. Some were buried with metal weapons or luxury objects such as jewelry.</p>



<p>Genetic and strontium findings suggest that “Xiongnu political organization in central and western Mongolia was highly similar,” Zhou says. Then, as the empire expanded, rulers in the Xiongnu heartland sent select members of their extended families, such as high-ranking women, to new territories in order to replicate the imperial power structure.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Iron innovations bolstered the Xiongnu Empire</h4>



<p>From the start, Xiongnu imperial power depended on a ready supply of iron weapons and other gear that enabled horse-mounted warfare. Researchers who view the Xiongnu Empire as a faint version of &nbsp;Imperial China argue that the nomads’ power depended on importing crops and borrowing iron-making techniques, or simply trading for iron products, from the Chinese.</p>



<p>But new findings suggest that Central Mongolian metallurgists launched a regional boom in iron production around the time the Xiongnu Empire originated, says archaeologist Ursula Brosseder of the University of Bonn in Germany.</p>



<p>At a riverbank site, Brosseder and colleagues have excavated five iron smelting installations that contain by-products of iron making and burned wood. Radiocarbon dates of that material extend to as early as around 2,200 years ago, when the Xiongnu Empire arose.</p>



<p>That makes these finds, each of which consists of two pits connected by a tunnel, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41826-023-00066-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the oldest Xiongnu iron smelting kilns</a> by at least 100 years, the researchers reported in March in <em>Asian Archaeology</em>.</p>



<p>Earlier research had established that people living just north of Xiongnu territory in southern Siberia started producing iron as early as around 2,800 years ago. Based on comparisons of finds in the two regions, Xiongnu metallurgists not only learned about iron making from their neighbors but also invented tunnel furnaces, the investigators say. Eastern Asian groups outside the Xiongnu sphere began making and using tunnel furnaces over the next couple of centuries.</p>



<p>Discoveries by Brosseder’s group “show that metallurgy reached the Xiongnu in Mongolia from southern Siberia, not China,” says archaeologist Nikolay Kradin, director of the Institute of History, Archaeology and Ethnology at the Far-Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Vladivostok. Craftspeople at several iron-making centers, some slightly younger than Brosseder’s discoveries and others yet to be found, must have managed that technological transition, hypothesizes Kradin, who did not participate in the new research.</p>



<p>Brosseder suspects the Mongolian site she’s studied hosted a major iron-making operation. Four iron-making furnaces excavated near the other five have not yet been dated. And ground-based remote sensing equipment has revealed signs of at least 15, and possibly 26, more iron smelting kilns still covered by sediment.</p>



<p>“We can expect more findings of Xiongnu iron smelting centers considering the demand for iron horse gear, arrowheads, carts and other material by the empire’s large army,” Brosseder says.</p>



<p>No reliable estimates exist for the size of that army, or for the overall number of Xiongnu people, says Michigan’s Miller. Xiongnu herders, who also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60194-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occasionally cultivated a grain called millet</a>, moved across the landscape in relatively small groups that must have been greatly outnumbered by <a href="http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1950_population.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imperial China’s estimated 60 million citizens</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The capital was a seasonal seat of power</h4>



<p>In the same valley where Brosseder’s group discovered the oldest known Xiongnu iron smelting kilns, Mongolian researchers have uncovered remains of what was probably <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/18/c_139222374.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Xiongnu political center, or perhaps even its capital, called Longcheng</a> in 2020. Consistent with everything else about the Xiongnu Empire, “this was a capital of a different kind,” says&nbsp; Miller.</p>



<p>Longcheng excavations so far have focused on a large building that may have hosted important gatherings.</p>



<p>Roof tiles on that structure bear an inscription in ancient Chinese characters that reads “Son of Heaven Chanyu.” Chinese records refer to the supreme Xiongnu ruler as “chanyu.” That royal inscription, the only one found within the Xiongnu realm, identifies Longcheng as a seat of power, Miller says.</p>



<p>Rather than a permanent site, Longcheng, like several <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">excavated Xiongnu villages and walled compounds</a> in central Mongolia, served as a seasonal stopover or temporary meeting place, Miller suspects (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>). “We don’t know if those other sites were separate political capitals for the Xiongnu,” he says. Top Xiongnu honchos gathered for part of the year at Longcheng before packing up and moving elsewhere, he speculates. Xiongnu herders, regardless of political status, navigated animals to seasonal grazing spots. Staying in one place throughout the year was not an option.</p>



<p>Having a flexible, mobile system of rule appears to have kept the nomadic realm rolling for a few hundred years before the Xiongnu Empire rapidly disintegrated about 1,900 years ago. Why it did so is an enduring mystery. Perhaps the empire succumbed to combined attacks by Imperial China and other groups or, in true nomadic fashion, Xiongnu people reorganized on a smaller scale and moved to safer areas.</p>



<p>Still, “the Xiongnu had created a massive imperial network in Asia,” Miller says. “Their ways of life didn’t go away overnight.” For instance, Xiongnu-mediated trading by groups situated along Central Asia’s Silk Road routes continued despite military defeats in the empire’s central Mongolian heartland. Only further archaeological and genetic discoveries can clarify how Xiongnu people in the imperial core responded to those setbacks.</p>



<p>Whatever happened, Asia’s first nomadic empire can likely be counted on for a few more surprises.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-mosquito-united-states">Four things to know about malaria cases in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time in 20 years, five people have picked up malaria on U.S. soil.</p>



<p>On June 26, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory, announcing that over the last two months <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00494.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four people in Sarasota County, Fla, and one person in Cameron County, Texas</a>, had developed the mosquito-borne illness. The new cases mark the first time since 2003 that U.S. residents have contracted malaria after being bitten by a mosquito close to home. All five people received treatment and are improving.</p>





<p>Malaria, which is caused by <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites and spread to humans by <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes, is not unheard of in the United States. The disease was once prevalent before widespread spraying of the insecticide DDT helped to purge the country of any parasite-infected mosquitoes. By 1951, malaria had been eliminated within U.S. borders.</p>



<p>But the disease still circulates in many countries around the world. Globally, there are more than 200 million cases of malaria each year and hundreds of thousands of deaths, most of which happen in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. In October 2021, the agency approved <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-science-stories-updates-mosquitoes-malaria-tulsa-wildfires">a malaria vaccine for children living in sub-Saharan Africa</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/21</em>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic stifled travel, about 2,000 cases were diagnosed across the United States each year. Such cases were exclusively in people who traveled abroad to parts of the world where the disease is common and returned home with parasites in tow. But none of the five people in Texas and Florida had traveled, meaning they’d contracted the disease from local mosquitoes.</p>



<p>The risk of local transmission in the United States “remains extremely low,” the CDC noted in the health advisory. But the <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes, vectors capable of spreading the parasite from person to person, are found around the country, a grim reminder that malaria can still pose a threat. &nbsp;</p>



<p>People tend to think of malaria as a tropical disease, says Christopher Vitek, a medical entomologist at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Edinburg. “But the fact of the matter is, historically we’ve had a fair amount of malaria transmission here in the U.S.” And the risk of transmission now is not zero. Officials in Texas and Florida are keeping an eye out for more cases.</p>



<p>Here are four things to know about malaria and the latest cases.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Local transmission in the United States is rare, but not worrisome</h4>



<p>At the moment, experts aren’t highly concerned about the five new cases. “We’ve gotten really good at understanding transmission,” says Johanna Daily, a parasitologist and infectious diseases physician at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. “And we’re very good at vector control, which is really going to be the win here.”</p>



<p>Spraying insecticide around homes and areas where mosquitoes breed can help bring the insects’ numbers down. Window screens keep the insects out of homes, and mosquito repellents or clothing treated with the insecticide permethrin can prevent bites. Getting rid of standing water can stop mosquitoes from multiplying. These tactics helped end a 2003 outbreak — when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5319a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight people in Palm Beach County, Fla.,</a> were infected by local mosquitoes — as well as 62 other outbreaks since 1957.</p>



<p>Because malaria is still a huge problem in many places, outbreaks in the United States, while rare, also aren’t unexpected. For this latest one, “it would be more surprising to me if it was far more cases or spread out across a lot of counties,” says Sadie Ryan, a medical geographer at the University of Florida in Gainesville.</p>



<p>One small plus is that the parasite behind the current outbreak is <em>Plasmodium vivax</em>, which is not the cause of the worst type of malaria. That title belongs to <em>P. falciparum</em>, the most common and deadliest of five species known to infect people. While some <em>P. vivax</em> infections are still fatal, it’s far less deadly, Daily says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="449" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/063023_EG_malaria_inline-1.jpg" alt="An image of red blood cells with dark spots in the middle on a white background." class="wp-image-3129375" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/063023_EG_malaria_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/063023_EG_malaria_inline-1-580x383.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/063023_EG_malaria_inline-1-282x186.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129375"><em>Plasmodium vivax</em>, seen as dark spots inside red blood cells, is one of five parasite species that can cause malaria in people. While less severe than the most common type of parasite, <em>P. vivax</em> infections can still be deadly.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129375">Ed Reschke/stone/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new cases will likely make health care workers hypervigilant, Daily says. But <em>P. vivax </em>can lie dormant inside the liver for weeks, months or years after the infection. “I do worry that as months go by and we forget about locally acquired malaria” that some people might go undiagnosed and spark new outbreaks.</p>



<p>It may seem odd that cases appeared in two separate states around the same time, but there’s no evidence to suggest that the cases are related, according to the CDC.</p>





<p>Certain events in other parts of the world — such as a spike in cases in a spot with lots of travel — can make it more likely that malaria might pop up in the United States, Vitek says. Increased travel to places where there are ongoing outbreaks can raise the chances a person or mosquito with malaria will arrive on U.S. soil.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Malaria can be hard to identify by its early symptoms</h4>



<p>People with malaria typically develop fever and flulike symptoms including chills, body aches, headache and tiredness. These symptoms are also typical of other diseases like mosquito-borne dengue fever, Daily says, which can make malaria hard to pick up if health care workers aren’t already considering it among the list of possibilities.</p>



<p>“You cannot clinically distinguish dengue from malaria from the flu from other things,” she says.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Treatments are available, but if left untreated, malaria infections can become severe and cause seizures, coma and death.</p>



<p>There are some hallmarks, such as anemia, jaundice and fevers that come and go. <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites infect and reproduce inside red blood cells and liver cells, which burst and release offspring into the blood stream. Some people develop anemia or jaundice as infected cells die. And when the body detects these foreign invaders, it can spark a fever. As young parasites hide inside new cells, the alarm bells quiet and the fever fades. With <em>P. vivax</em>, such cyclic fevers might appear every 48 hours or so.</p>



<p>But sometimes a fever’s timing isn’t textbook, which can throw off health care workers, Daily says. So, it’s important for people involved in patient care to keep malaria in mind when considering the possibilities. “We never think about malaria unless it’s a traveler who comes, has a fever, has nonspecific symptoms and says ‘Well, I just got off a plane.’”</p>



<p>Now, health care workers working in and nearby the affected Florida and Texas counties need to consider malaria as a cause of illness. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Infected travelers and mosquitoes can transport malaria across borders &nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>It remains unclear why the five people got infected without traveling. But there are two ways for malaria to return to places where it has been eliminated, Vitek says. Either infected travelers transport the parasite across borders, or infected mosquitoes do.</p>



<p>In the first scenario, a traveler might return home with malaria and just so happen to get bitten by an <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito. Around nine to 18 days later, after any parasites have multiplied inside the mosquito, the insect can transmit malaria to the next person it bites.</p>



<p>There are many <em>Anopheles </em>species capable of transmitting malaria, such as <em>Anopheles freeborni</em>, the western malaria mosquito, across the United States. Florida, for instance, hosts 14 different species. Two of those, <em>A. quadrimaculatus </em>and <em>A. crucians</em>, are responsible for most past cases. These insects are twilight biters that love to hang out in vegetation around swamps, Ryan says. Fortunately, not many people tend to go to these spots during Florida summers when mosquitoes are rampant.</p>



<p>But if a traveler with malaria happens to venture out and get bitten by <em>A. crucians</em>, that insect could become an unwitting vector of disease.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Infected mosquitoes can also travel by land, air or sea — often by hitching a ride alongside people — and transport <em>Plasmodium</em> from place to place. “Airport malaria,” for example, can happen when the insects travel by plane and infect people who live nearby, Daily says. But <em>Anopheles </em>mosquitoes don’t travel very far, so such cases would typically pop up a mile or so away from airports.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mapping malaria</h3>



<p>While many countries around the world, including the United States, have eliminated malaria and have no known transmission, the disease is still a major problem. Most cases and deaths happen in Africa, where the deadliest and most common malaria parasite, <em>Plasmodium falciparum,</em> is common. Other regions have transmission in only some places.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Warming temperatures and travel can help mosquito ranges spread</h4>



<p>Climate change is expected to expand the range of many insect-borne diseases, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nepal-reeling-from-unprecedented-dengue-virus-outbreak">including dengue</a> and <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04531-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malaria</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/19</em>). But whether it’s the reason malaria is circulating in the United States for the first time in decades is unclear. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Independent of warming temperatures, Texas and Florida already “are in a very suitable part of the world for malaria,” Ryan says. While mosquito control pushed the disease out, such places aren’t going to stop being fitting spots for malaria transmission. “The possibility of introduction is always here.”</p>



<p>As the climate warms, however, the mosquitoes’ livable range could extend farther north, both Ryan and Vitek say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, an invasive, malaria-spreading mosquito that has an affinity for biting people is also on the move.</p>



<p><em>Anopheles stephensi</em> thrives not in swamps or rural areas far from people, but in artificial containers in urban areas across India and the Middle East, Ryan says. Now, “it has left its original range, and it’s setting up shop across different countries in Africa.” If the species were to also spread to the United States, its tendency to bite people and live in urban areas could make it a riskier vector than current species to spread malaria among people. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts have the tools to deal with these urban mosquitoes because <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, the species that spreads dengue and Zika, also thrives close to people, Ryan says. Still, “it just definitely makes me nervous that we need to be anticipating that and be ready for surveillance.”</p>



<p>For now, it’s unlikely malaria is going to spread all over the United States, Daily says. Even if more than five people develop malaria, she expects the current outbreak will end. “I hate for people to feel anxious going outside or getting mosquito bites. So, we can reassure the public: There’s ways to prevent [malaria], ways to treat it. It’s curable.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-input-fiber-making-philippines">Indigenous input revealed early hints of fiber making in the tropics</a></h4>

              
                <p>On the island of Palawan in the Philippines, a cave has yielded reams of ancient artifacts, including thousands of stone tools. No traces of hewn trees or stripped bark or carved meat remain to hint at what the tools may have been used for. But they do bear signs of wear and tear, prehistoric marks from the tasks they once aided.</p>

Xhauflair spent months living among Indigenous Pala’wan communities, studying how artisans use tools for various tasks in an effort to reveal how the ancient artifacts may have been used.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129361">H. Xhauflair</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To archaeologist Hermine Xhauflair and her colleagues, these marks can serve as fingerprints, identifying the ways past humans used the tools. For help deciphering these fingerprints, Xhauflair’s team turned to the Indigenous Pala’wan people, who live near the site where the artifacts were discovered and share a deep ancestral knowledge of how to process natural resources on the island. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wanted to learn from the experts of the forest,” says Xhauflair, of the University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>





<p>Thanks to that collaboration, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the oldest evidence of fiber making in the tropics</a> now goes back to 39,000 years, the researchers report June 30 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Access to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/textile-archaeologists-use-ancient-tools-weave-tapestry-past">fiber technologies</a> may have opened up all sorts of possibilities for nets, traps and boats, the scientists speculate (<em>SN: 8/28/19</em>).</p>



<p>One of the first steps in the study involved securing an introduction to the Pala’wan. Xhauflair presented her research plan to the councils of elders of several villages. The councils granted her and her colleagues permission to live with Pala’wan communities for three months and record craftspeople as they used tools for various tasks, including processing plant-based fibers.</p>



<p>After dissecting the techniques and identifying the 95 plant species that Pala’wan artisans were recorded using, the researchers built and tested a set of 16 stone tools that resemble those from the cave.</p>



<p>Xhauflair emulated Pala’wan techniques to strip and pull apart layers of plants such as bamboo and palm to make strong, flexible strips and other fibers. Many of the plants and techniques left distinct notches and striations on tool surfaces. Comparing the markings with those on the artifacts revealed striking similarities, which suggests that the ancient tools had been used in fiber making too.</p>

Xhauflair used re-created tools and Pala’wan techniques to make plant-based fibers. The process created markings on the tools that are like those of the ancient artifacts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remnants of ancient fibers are particularly rare, since the plant materials used to make them tend to decay quickly in the wet, humid tropics. The oldest evidence for fiber making anywhere in the world goes back roughly 120,000 years in Israel.</p>



<p>“The incorporation of Indigenous knowledge and many tool-use experiments on a wide range of fibrous plants give confidence” in the new findings, says archaeologist Richard Fullagar of Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The evidence for cutting fibrous plant parts is strong.”</p>



<p>The likenesses of the markings on the ancient tools to those made using Pala’wan techniques suggest that similar techniques have been used for at least 39,000 years. Whether such techniques have been passed down continuously over generations, or they disappeared and then were relearned, independently, later remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/static-electricity-pull-ticks-hosts">Static electricity can pull ticks on to their hosts</a></h4>

              
                <p>You don’t need to touch a tick for it find you, a new study suggests. The blood-sucking parasites may be able to catapult themselves from vegetation to their hosts thanks to static electricity.</p>



<p>Mammals, birds and reptiles carry considerable electrostatic charges — equivalent to voltages of hundreds to tens of thousands of volts. And ticks seem to respond to that. Tick nymphs brought close to various objects charged to voltages encountered in nature <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00772-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequently whoosh across the gap</a> to land on those surfaces, researchers report June 30 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“We know that static electric charges naturally accumulate on many animals, but how the forces generated by these electric charges influence the ecology of said animals has barely been studied,” says Sam England, a biologist at the University of Bristol in England.</p>



<p>Ticks are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ticks-here-stay-scientists-finding-ways-outsmart-bloodsuckers">fiendish parasites that feast on blood of vertebrates</a> and are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-lyme-and-other-tickborne-diseases-rising">notorious for spreading Lyme disease</a>, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other potentially debilitating diseases (<em>SN: 8/9/17; SN: 11/15/18</em>).</p>



<p>To see if ticks respond to the natural electric fields emanating from their potential hosts, England and his colleagues started with dried rabbit feet and acrylic surfaces charged by rubbing rabbit fur on them. Live castor bean tick nymphs (<em>Ixodes ricinus</em>) held anywhere from a few millimeters to a few centimeters away were readily yanked through the air to these surfaces, showing that electrical forces could carry the ticks across distances several times longer than they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team then placed 20 live nymphs, one at a time, on an aluminum plate sitting just a few millimeters below a tiny spherical steel electrode. When the electrode was charged to 750 volts — typical of voltages found on vertebrates — three out of four ticks traversed the gap. When the team repeated the experiment with the same number of ticks but no charge on the electrode, no nymphs zipped across.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An electrically charged nylon ball attracts a nearby tick (<em>Ixodes ricinus</em>), lifting it to the object’s surface by electrostatic forces. Since static charges are common on vertebrates, ticks might leverage the free ride to make the jump to potential hosts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By varying the voltage on the sphere and the distance between it and the plate, the team also found that dead nymphs could be lifted by an electric field comparable to that from human skin from about 10 centimeters, or four inches, away.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the electrostatic force in every case pulled the nymphs against gravity — an extreme scenario as ticks usually aren’t situated underneath a host in nature.</p>



<p>“This is quite unique given that ticks cannot jump to reach their hosts,” says Martin Giurfa, a neuroscientist at University of Toulouse in France who studies learning and memory in insects and who was not involved in the study. “The fact that they are teletransported by the electrostatic fields produced by their hosts … is remarkable.” It’s possible, he adds, that other parasites that latch on to skin might be similarly attracted to their hosts. Previous research has demonstrated how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/static-electricity-parasite-nematodes">parasitic nematodes</a> can use static electricity to catapult themselves on to fruit flies (<em>SN: 3/16/23</em>).</p>



<p>The findings suggest new anti-tick measures for people, England says. Outdoor clothing, for example, could be treated with an antistatic spray to reduce the tendency of these fabrics to accumulate static charge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boys-experience-depression-differently-girls">Boys experience depression differently than girls. Here’s why that matters</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Teenagers in the United States are in crisis. That news got hammered home earlier this year following the release of a nationally representative survey showing that over half of high school girls reported persistent feelings of “sadness or hopelessness” — common words used to screen for depression. Almost a third of teenage boys reported those same feelings.</p>



<p>“No one is doing well,” says psychologist Kathleen Ethier. She heads the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Adolescent and School Health, which has overseen this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/yrbs_data_summary_and_trends.htm?s_cid=hy-DSTR1-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biennial Youth Risk Behavior Survey</a> since 1991.</p>





<p>During the latest round of data collection, in fall 2021, over 17,000 students from 31 states responded to roughly 100 questions related to mental health, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, sexual behavior, substance use and experiences of violence.</p>



<p>One chart in particular garnered considerable media attention. From 2011 to 2021, persistent sadness or hopelessness in boys went up 8 percentage points, from 21 to 29 percent. In girls, it rose a whopping 21 percentage points, from 36 to 57 percent.</p>



<p>Some of that disparity may arise from the fact that girls in the United States face unique stressors, researchers say. Compared with boys, girls seem more prone to experiencing mental distress from social media use, are more likely to experience sexual violence and are dealing with a political climate that is often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/abortion-roe-v-wade-pregnancy-biology-supreme-court-ruling">hostile to women’s rights</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>But the gap between boys and girls might not be as wide as the numbers indicate. Depression manifests differently in boys and men than in girls and women, mounting evidence suggests. Girls are more likely to internalize feelings, while boys are more likely to externalize them. Rather than crying when feeling down, for instance, boys may act irritated or lash out. Or they may engage in risky, impulsive or even violent acts. Inward-directed terms like “sadness” and “hopelessness” miss those more typically male tendencies. And masculine norms that equate sadness with weakness may make males who are experiencing those emotions less willing to admit it, even on an anonymous survey.</p>



<p>Consequently, screening tools, such as the one used by the CDC’s survey, may miss depression in about 1 in 10 males, research suggests.</p>



<p>“We need to have more of a recognition that boys and men, some of them, not all of them, are suffering,” says clinical psychologist Ryon McDermott of the University of South Alabama in Mobile. “And we miss them. We miss them in our assessments, and we miss them in our discussions.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Diagnosing depression in boys and men</h4>



<p>The idea of overlooked depression in men is not new. Take what happened on the Swedish island of Gotland. In the 1960s and ’70s, suicide rates were high. So in 1983, health officials launched an education program for Gotland doctors on depression treatment and suicide prevention.</p>



<p>At first, the program looked like a resounding success. The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1992.tb01448.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island’s overall suicide rate dropped</a> from roughly 20 out of every 100,000 people in 1982 to roughly 7 out of every 100,000 people by 1985, researchers reported in the 1992 <em>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</em>.</p>



<p>But a subsequent, deeper analysis showed that the decline was almost entirely among women. In the 2½ years before and after the program, the number of women dying by suicide decreased from 11 to two, while the number of men dying by suicide mostly stayed steady, seeing a marginal decline from 16 to 15.</p>





<p>Men struggling with suicidal thoughts appear less likely to seek help and more likely to have doctors ignore their depressive symptoms when they do seek help, Wolfgang Rutz, then a psychiatrist at a Gotland hospital, theorized in 1996 in the <em>Nordic Journal of Psychiatry</em>. Doctors observed, for instance, that men who were depressed often didn’t present with classic symptoms, such as sadness, but instead presented as hostile, impulsive and aggressive.</p>



<p>Rutz suspected that this gender disparity in diagnosis and treatment might underpin why, at the time, men in Sweden were being diagnosed with depression half as often as women but dying by suicide five times as often. Without obvious signs of depression, Rutz noted, to the outside observer, many male suicides occurred seemingly without warning.</p>



<p>“The criteria of depression that are taught in psychiatric textbooks and diagnostic manuals today and which also have been used in the Gotland project seem insufficient in detecting <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/08039489609099732?journalCode=ipsc20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the typical masculine way of being depressive</a>,” Rutz wrote.</p>



<p>Rutz went on to develop a screening tool for male depression, which paved the way for more recent male-specific tools. They include the Male Depression Risk Scale, developed by Simon Rice, a clinical psychologist at Orygen, an Australian nonprofit research, clinical and advocacy institute focused on youth mental health.</p>



<p>The scale focuses on emotion suppression, anger and aggression; drug and alcohol use; somatic symptoms, such as concerns about sleep and sex; and risk-taking. Participants rate various statements, such as how often they bottle up negative feelings, have difficulty managing anger or use drugs for temporary relief. None of the questions ask about sadness or hopelessness.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Better screening</h3>



<p>The Male Depression Risk Scale asks individuals to rate how often over the last month various statements (some shown below) apply to them. </p>



<ul>
<li>I bottled up my negative feelings.</li>



<li>I had unexplained aches and pains.</li>



<li>I needed alcohol to help me unwind.</li>



<li>I overreacted to situations with aggressive behavior.</li>



<li>I stopped caring about the consequences of my actions.</li>



<li>It was difficult to manage my anger.</li>



<li>Using drugs provided temporary relief.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>Research shows that some men meet the criteria for depression on the Male Depression Risk Scale but not on more traditional scales. In a recent study of 1,000 Canadian men, Rice and his team found that 80 respondents, or 8 percent, met the criteria for depression only on a traditional scale that includes a question about how often the respondent has felt “down, depressed or hopeless.” In addition, 120 respondents, or 12 percent, met the criteria on both scales. But 110 respondents, or 11 percent, met the criteria for depression only <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32401094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the men’s scale</a>, the team reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Mental Health</em>.</p>



<p>The results suggest that had the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey included a male-specific question about depression, there might still have been a gender gap but perhaps a smaller one.</p>



<p>Too many boys and men are suffering in silence, says Rice, who is also a principal research fellow at the University of Melbourne. Ten or 11 percent of missed cases “might sound like a small percentage,” he says, “but at the population level, that is huge.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is it depression or something else?</h4>



<p>The idea that acting out and aggression could, on occasion, constitute symptoms of depression remains controversial.</p>



<p>The CDC, Ethier says, has relied on extensive research in formulating its survey’s depression-related question, which reads: “During the past 12 months, did you ever feel so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that you stopped doing some usual activities?”</p>



<p>“That item is actually quite good at predicting who has depressive symptoms,” Ethier says, adding that such accuracy holds true for both girls and boys.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that boys aren’t struggling, Ethier says. Anecdotally, for instance, teachers are reporting a spike in behavioral problems in their classrooms, particularly among boys. But rather than indicating depression, Ethier says, such behavior is emblematic of the broader mental health crisis among teens.</p>



<p>That might sound like splitting hairs. If boys are distressed, why not label them as depressed? Providing the proper diagnosis matters for appropriate treatment and future health outcomes, Ethier says. “We know that depressive symptoms in adolescence have long-term implications for health and mental health. I don’t know that the research is as conclusive about that for behavioral issues in the classroom.”</p>



<p>For McDermott, who studies the difficulties of measuring depression, such behavioral problems could indicate other disorders, chiefly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. But he has no doubt that some of those boys are depressed. “It is hard to say with 100 percent certainty that all boys who are acting out are experiencing depression, but it is a good bet that many of them are,” he says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Depths of despair</h3>



<p>Over the last decade, a national survey of U.S. high school students called the Youth Risk Behavior Survey has consistently found higher levels of persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in teen girls compared with teen boys. But some experts say the survey may not offer a complete picture of boys’ mental health.</p>

<p>The core symptoms of depression, whether internal or external in nature, are the same in men and women, McDermott says. But on a depression scale focusing on internalizing symptoms such as sadness or hopelessness, a depressed man would, on average, score lower than an equally depressed woman.</p>



<p>Why those baselines vary by gender isn’t entirely clear, McDermott says. But when it comes to hopelessness, evidence suggests that boys might sometimes suppress those feelings in adherence to male norms that discourage vulnerability. Consider the results of a review of 74 studies with a total sample size of more than 19,000 mostly U.S. participants published in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Counseling Psychology</em>. High scores on a scale measuring <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2016-56584-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conformity to Western masculine norms</a>, such as emotional control, self-reliance and power over women, were linked with poorer mental health, including depression, and a reduced likelihood of seeking help.</p>



<p>Gender norms become entrenched during the teen years, says Leslie Adams, a behavioral researcher at Johns Hopkins University. That’s when boys are really absorbing messages around masculinity from friends, family and social media. “Endorsing feelings of sadness and hopelessness kind of goes against these learned, general scripts,” Adams says.</p>



<p>Those male scripts are poorly understood, say Adams and others studying male mental health, because most gender research focuses on girls and women.</p>



<p>For instance, take research into social media use. Ethier points to the popularity of male social media personalities espousing harmful attitudes toward women, such as TikToker Andrew Tate, who was recently arrested in Romania on suspicion of human trafficking. Anecdotally, Tate and influencers like him are one way boys come to understand the world, but data on the influence of social media on boys are sparse, Ethier says.</p>



<p>“We focus a lot on the ways that social media might be impacting girls in terms of body image,” she says. “I don’t think we focus enough of the conversation on what is being portrayed to boys.”</p>



<p>The resulting knowledge gap about boys’ lives affects all of society. “It is difficult to see that we can effectively address the health of boys and young men, achieve gender equity for girls and young women, or achieve rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth, without <a href="https://www.jahonline.org/action/showPdf?pii=S1054-139X%2817%2930321-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tackling the masculine identities adopted by boys</a> in adolescence,” a group of pediatric health experts wrote in a commentary in 2018 in the <em>Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Depression’s link to suicide</h4>



<p>Just as Rutz observed on the island of Gotland, missing depression in boys and men can come with high stakes.</p>



<p>“Depression can manifest in many ways … beyond sadness and hopelessness,” Adams says. “When we don’t assess the other ways that depression can manifest, there are implications. One is suicide.”</p>



<p>Adams suspects that the same tendency to frame depression as an internal emotion also influences how researchers ask about suicide. For instance, asking about who has considered suicide or made a plan, as the CDC does in its youth survey, reflects the belief that the respondent is both ruminating and thinking ahead. “For boys, [suicide] may not have that linear path,” Adams says. “We’re missing … impulsivity.”</p>



<p>That could help explain why, in the CDC survey, teen girls reported higher levels of suicidal thinking, planning and attempts than boys, despite the fact that boys die by suicide at higher rates. Provisional federal data show that, in 2021, roughly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 of every 100,000 girls ages 15 to 24 died by suicide</a>. That’s compared with roughly 24 of every 100,000 boys of the same age. From 2020 to 2021, the rate of suicide in that age group increased 5 percent in girls compared with 8 percent in boys.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Suicide stats&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The latest data in the United States show that the overall suicide rate for males is much higher than for females. That gap holds across most age groups, even though teen girls report higher levels of suicidal thinking and planning than boys.</p>

<p>Access to guns might factor in here. For every 10 percent increase in household gun ownership in a state, the <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)32383-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">youth suicide rate increases by about 27 percent</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>. And boys are seven times as likely to kill themselves with a gun than girls are, according to a 2022 report by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun violence prevention organization.</p>



<p>Missed depression in boys could help explain a long-standing research question, Adams and others say: Why do more women get diagnosed with depression, the most common precursor to suicide, when more men die by suicide?</p>



<p>One path forward is to look beyond sadness and hopelessness as proxies for depression, Adams says. What about impulsivity, conflict with others or social withdrawal? Perhaps those symptoms serve as better proxies for depression — and suicidal thinking — in men, she says.</p>



<p>Understanding other proxies could protect not just depressed individuals from harm but also broader society, another line of research suggests. Seena Fazel, a forensic psychiatrist at the University of Oxford, and colleagues began examining data from Swedish patient registries to investigate if depression links to violent behavior. Their participant pool included about 47,000 adults diagnosed with depression from 2001 to 2009 and nearly 900,000 people without such a diagnosis.</p>



<p>People with depression were three times as likely to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-57580-022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commit a violent crime</a>, such as assault, arson or a sexual offense, as individuals without depression, the team reported in 2015 in <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>To attempt to rule out genetic or environmental differences, the team looked at siblings. A person with depression was twice as likely to commit a violent crime as their sibling without depression. Fazel and another team reported a similar <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856717302290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link between depression and violence among teens and young adults</a> in 2017 in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>The link between violence and depression has been found for both men and women. But since men commit most violent crimes, missing depression in men is a concern, Fazel says.</p>



<p>But he stresses the importance of keeping such findings in perspective. His earlier work, for instance, found that over a 13-year period in Sweden, there were 450 violent crimes committed per 10,000 people. Of those, 24 were committed by people with severe mental illness. “With guns and mental illness,” Fazel says, “you are much more likely to kill yourself than kill somebody else.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Shifting views on depression</h4>



<p>The idea that depression may look different in men and women — not to mention <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">differences based on other demographic factors</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/23, p. 18</em>) — is gaining traction.</p>



<p>For instance, a 2022 revision to the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, or <em>DSM</em>, the American Psychiatric Association’s reference book, acknowledges the gender differences in depression. The revision’s authors note that, compared with depressed women, depressed men tend to report “greater frequencies and intensities of maladaptive self-coping and problem-solving strategies, including alcohol or other drug misuse, risk-taking and poor impulse control.”</p>



<p>Even before the revision, the <em>DSM</em> included “irritable mood” as a feature of depression in youngsters. So teenagers’ age and gender both potentially influence how they express depression.</p>



<p>Even if the idea that depression looks different in boys and girls gains wider acceptance, changing the Youth Risk Behavior Survey will take time. If enough experts express concerns about how questions related to mental health are posed, then the earliest the CDC could amend the survey would be for the 2025 round of data collection, a CDC spokesperson told <em>Science News</em>.</p>



<p>But the experts I spoke with are hopeful that such changes will trickle into other mainstream research. Even adding a single word to questions, such as asking about irritability in addition to sadness and hopelessness, could identify a huge number of depressed boys who might otherwise appear fine, these researchers argue.</p>



<p>Tweaks of this nature, Rice says, “could be a game changer at identifying depression in boys [and] young men.”</p>

<p><em>BMJ Open</em> has retracted a paper describing a study in which people with diabetes will be switched from cigarettes to vaping after the journal learned – late in the process of publication – that the authors were indirectly funded by the tobacco company, Philip Morris International.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/4/e045396">International randomised controlled trial evaluating metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetic cigarette smokers following switching to combustion-free nicotine delivery systems: the DIASMOKE protocol</a>,” was originally published on April 1, 2021. Its <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/6/e045396ret">retraction notice</a>, dated June 20, 2023, reads:</p>



<span id="more-127370"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted by the journal and publisher following a post-publication review of the funding source. This paper is in breach of BMJ Open’s policy not to publish research that has been funded by the tobacco industry, and therefore we have retracted this paper.</p>



<p>Following a query raised post-publication, BMJ now understands that ECLAT SRL (the listed funder) receives sponsorship from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, which is a not for profit group supported and funded by the tobacco company, Philip Morris International. The authors added a disclaimer to the article, referring to Foundation for a Smoke Free World (FSFW) as the “grantor,” when the article was revised as part of the pre-publication peer-review process. The addition of this information and its significance was not specifically brought to the editor’s attention by the authors. Had this been done, the article would not have been published. BMJ Open’s <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/2013/10/15/journal-policy-on-research-funded-by-the-tobacco-industry/">Editorial Policy</a> states that the journal will not consider for publication any study which has been partly or wholly funded by the tobacco industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is not the first time links to the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/04/21/journal-retracts-paper-suggesting-smoking-is-linked-to-lower-covid-19-risk/">prompted a retraction</a>.</p>



<p>The corresponding author of the paper, Arkadiusz Krysinski, of the Polish Academy of Sciences’ Mossakowski Medical Research Centre in Warsaw, and CK MSW, also in&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warsaw, did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>We asked Adrian Aldcroft, editor in chief of <em>BMJ Open</em>, how the authors should have brought &#8220;this information and its significance&#8221; to its attention, and whether the journal had considered any changes to its processes based on the episode. He told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors added their &#8220;disclaimer&#8221; relating to FSFW after peer review rather than including it as part of their funding statement, where we would expect to see this information. The authors did not draw our attention to the disclaimer when they submitted their revision (e.g., in the cover letter or the point by point response). As such, the disclaimer went unnoticed by the editor. The editor was not aware of the link between ECLAT (the stated funder) and FSFW (and, by extension, PMI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This case has highlighted for us the link, which is not immediately apparent, between the tobacco industry and products intended to help smokers, such as e-cigarettes. Our editors are now more careful assessing the COIs of any study relating to smokers and smoking. BMJ is also revising the tobacco policy and related processes across the portfolio in an effort to avoid similar cases in the future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-new-view-milky-way-space">Neutrinos offer a new view of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have made the first image of the Milky Way using neutrinos.</p>



<p>The extremely low-mass subatomic particles have no electric charge, and pass easily through gas, dust and even stars on their way from the places where they originate to detectors here on Earth. High-energy neutrinos zip throughout the cosmos, but where they come from is usually a mystery.</p>



<p>Now, by combining artificial intelligence and data collected over the course of a decade with the IceCube detector in Antarctica, researchers have found the first evidence of high-energy neutrinos that originated from inside the Milky Way and mapped the particles onto an image of the galaxy’s plane. It’s the first time our galaxy has been imaged with anything other than light.</p>





<p>The map includes suggestions of <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific high-energy neutrino sources within the Milky Way</a> that might be the remnants of past supernova star explosions, the cores of collapsed supergiant stars or other as-yet-unidentified objects, the team reports in the June 30 <em>Science</em>. But more research is needed to clearly pick those sorts of features out of the data.</p>



<p>Previously, only a few high-energy neutrinos have been traced back to their potential birthplaces, all outside the Milky Way. Those include two that appeared to come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-black-holes-stars-tidal-disruption-event">black holes shredding their companion star</a>s and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-blazar-icecube">others from a highly active galaxy known as a blazar</a> (<em>SN: 5/16/22, SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>“We’re quite unambiguously seeing neutrinos from both galactic and extragalactic space these days,” says physicist Kate Scholberg of Duke University who was not involved with the research. “There’s so much more to learn, and it can be tremendous fun to figure out how to see the universe with neutrino eyes.”</p>



<p>Neutrino astronomy could potentially allow us to see distant objects in a way that no other telescopes can match. That’s because neutrinos can cross huge expanses of space without being absorbed or deflected. X-rays, gamma rays, optical light and the charged particles that make up cosmic rays, on the other hand, can be deflected or absorbed along the way, which may obscure their origins.</p>



<p>To physicist Naoko Kurahashi Neilson of Drexel University in Philadelphia, the map she and her team produced is the latest contribution to a shift in neutrino science. In the past, neutrino observatories like IceCube haven’t provided the sorts of views of the sky that telescopes relying on optical light, X-rays or gamma rays offer.</p>



<p>“When I first joined IceCube,”  Kurahashi Neilson says, “I used to do air quotes” when using the phrase <em>neutrino astronomy</em>. “I don&#8217;t do that anymore.… I don&#8217;t have to because we&#8217;re starting to resolve things” in neutrino images that resemble the astronomical images from other telescopes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Three ways to map the Milky Way</h3>



<p>In these three views, the Milky Way is seen in visible light (top), in gamma rays (middle) and in high-energy neutrinos (bottom). This first-ever particle-based map is based on data collected with the enormous IceCube detector embedded deep in the Antarctic ice. Dust obscures portions of the visible light map, and gamma rays can come from a variety of sources. Neutrinos have the potential to pinpoint locations where high-energy cosmic rays coming from supernova remnants, the cores of collapsed stellar giants and other as-yet-unidentified sources interact with dust in the galaxy, creating the neutrinos.</p>

<p>The downside of neutrinos is that they’re extremely hard to detect. The IceCube experiment is enormous in part to overcome that challenge. It consists of 5,160 sensors in a cubic array one kilometer on a side embedded deep in the Antarctic ice. The large size of the experiment increases the odds of seeing a tiny fraction of the neutrinos flying through space from the Milky Way and other places in the cosmos.</p>





<p>Of the 100,000 or so neutrinos that IceCube scientists observe each year, some leave long tracks in the detector that potentially point back to where the neutrinos came from. Many of the neutrino signals in IceCube, though, are known as cascade events. They make bursts of light in the detector, but don’t reveal neutrino origins as well as tracks can.</p>



<p>“This is data we used to throw away in terms of astronomy,”  Kurahashi Neilson says. There’s still information indicating where the neutrinos come from in the data. But it’s difficult to identify the promising cascades in the hundreds of thousands of meaningless, background events that IceCube has collected.</p>



<p>Kurahashi Neilson decided to take up the challenge by plowing through a decade of IceCube cascade data with the help of an artificial intelligence system known as a neural network. “You can train the neural nets to identify which events are worth keeping … [and] which events are more background-like,”  Kurahashi Neilson says.</p>



<p>It’s an approach Kurahashi Neilson pioneered in 2017 and steadily improved until she and her colleagues were able to identify the neutrinos used in the new map.</p>



<p>“It’s an impressive analysis and the techniques may well not yet be pushed to their limits,” Scholberg says. “Clearly a lot more work needs to be done, but it’s very exciting to see the basic expectation [of Milky Way neutrinos] verified. This is an important step forward in understanding of the high-energy particle sky.”</p>

<p>A paper published in <em>Science</em> two years ago has been flagged with an expression of concern while the editors give the authors a chance to correct a data issue identified by two different readers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abh2890">Light-induced mobile factors from shoots regulate rhizobium-triggered soybean root nodulation</a>,” was published in September 2021 and has been cited 43 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice, published today, states:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127400"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The editors have been made aware that data presented in Fig. 5 assessed GmNSP1 expression rather than GmNIN expression. We are alerting readers to these concerns while the authors provide additional data to correct the manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for the journal told Retraction Watch two separate individuals had emailed the editorial team about an issue in the paper, with the most recent email arriving earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Science</em> editors contacted the authors of the paper, who acknowledged the problem and said the error in the figure was unintentional, the spokesperson said. The authors also told <em>Science</em> correcting the error wouldn’t change the conclusions of the paper and offered to provide more data to address the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked about the decision to allow the authors to submit replacement data. The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Science</em> editorial, after consulting advisers, agreed to allow the authors of the study to provide additional data to correct Figure 5. Under these circumstances, while <em>Science</em> waits for the data, and in order to alert our readers as to the need for amendments to the paper, we are posting an Editorial Expression of Concern. After the sought after data is provided, <em>Science</em> editorial will review it to confirm it represents and matches what the authors had published in 2021.&nbsp; At that point, the authors may need to further provide corrections to the text and figures of their 2021 study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-exploit-third-wild-vertebrate-species-animals">Humans exploit about one-third of wild vertebrate species</a></h4>

              
                <p>The aptly named resplendent quetzal is prized for its plumage. Golden poison frogs are popular creatures in the pet trade. Pangolin meat is considered a delicacy, and their scales are used in traditional medicine.</p>



<p>Those three animals are among the third of all wild vertebrate species that people eat, trade or otherwise use, a new study reveals.&nbsp; Out of nearly 47,000 vertebrate species around the world, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-04940-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans exploit about 14,600</a>, researchers report June 29 in <em>Communications Biology </em>in a comprehensive look at humans’ impact on a vast swathe of wildlife.</p>





<p>Some species, like fish trawled from the sea in large quantities for food, are abundant. But human activities are helping push many others of these exploited species toward extinction, marine ecologist Boris Worm and colleagues say.</p>



<p>More than half of the vertebrate species that humans exploit — mostly fish and mammals — are killed for food, the team finds. Birds, reptiles and amphibians are primarily targeted for the pet trade. And about 8 percent of exploited species are recreationally hunted for sport or trophies. Other uses include medicine or clothing, and more than a quarter of the species are used for more than one purpose.</p>



<p>Worm, of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and colleagues collated data compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, which tracks the trade, use and vulnerability of species worldwide. The team considered species from the six classes of vertebrates that contain more than 100 species each: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, ray-finned fishes (such as tuna and salmon) and cartilaginous fishes (a group that includes sharks, rays and skates).</p>



<p>About 13 percent of all vertebrate species facing extinction — those classified by the IUCN as either vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered — are threatened at least in part due to human exploitation, the team found. That includes 5,775, or 39 percent, of the species the study identified as used by humans.</p>



<p>The rise of advanced hunting and fishing technology, as well as global trade and a burgeoning human population, have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-indeed">increasingly skewed the balance of many ecosystems in favor of people and against other species</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/07</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Worm and his colleagues, and some other scientists, think of humans as predators, that’s not quite correct, says Daniel Pauly, a fisheries biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not involved in the study. “Predators are regulated by natural processes, but humans are not.”</p>



<p>The team’s findings, Pauly says, “describe the impact of our mad consumption of the world.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boreal-forest-north-america-shrink">The snow forest of North America may be about to shrink</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of nature’s woody behemoths — the North American snow forest — may soon begin shrinking.</p>



<p>The continent’s boreal forest reposes in subarctic latitudes, spanning much of Alaska and Canada. Scientists had previously suggested that its range might shift northward as the climate warms, helping maintain its expansive breadth.</p>



<p>But for two decades, the ecosystem’s northern tree line has held fast, while its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39092-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">southerly tree cover has thinned</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Human activities and climate change could push the prodigious forest to contract.</p>





<p>“We are about to transform an entire biome on a continental scale,” says environmental scientist Ronny Rotbarth of Wageningen University in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Millions of people — many from Indigenous groups — depend on the boreal forest to live. It’s thought to contain <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00090/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 25 percent</a> of Earth’s remaining intact forest, and its living flora are estimated to store about <a href="https://carbon2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 billion metric tons of carbon</a>. That exceeds what global fossil fuel burning emitted last year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the forest is being disturbed, and not just by climate change. Logging and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-boreal-forests-record-co2-2021">wildfires</a> — such as those now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">raging in Quebec</a> — can also diminish it (<em>SN: 3/2/23</em>;<em> SN: 6/9/23</em>).</p>



<p>Rotbarth and his colleagues assessed how those pressures were impacting the forest’s range. Using satellite observations, the researchers tracked tree-cover changes from 2000 to 2019. They then analyzed how those changes corresponded with temperature, precipitation and disturbances like wildfires and logging.</p>



<p>Overall, the forest’s tree cover increased, mostly within its northern interior. But its northern boundary showed little to no expansion, while its southern boundary thinned, largely due to wildfires and logging. The researchers also found that the southerly reaches didn’t fully recover from these disturbances during the study period, potentially hindered by climate warming.</p>



<p>The changes may foreshadow a long-term forest contraction, though it’s unclear when exactly that could start.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-gravitational-wave-black-hole">A newfound gravitational wave ‘hum’ may be from the universe’s biggest black holes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Beneath the explosions, collisions and other intermittent bangs in the cosmos, scientists suspect a nonstop soundtrack plays, created by ripples in spacetime continually washing through the universe. After more than a decade of searching, scientists may have finally heard that background hum.</p>



<p>Several teams of researchers from around the world reported on June 28 the first clear evidence of these gravitational waves. Unlike previously detected gravitational waves, these new ones have ripples that are staggeringly long — on the scale of light-years. Their likely source: innumerable pairs of gargantuan black holes, which churn the spacetime cauldron as they orbit one another.</p>





<p>If that hunch is correct, the result would provide the first evidence that pairs of monster black holes, with masses billions of times that of the sun, can coalesce into one.</p>



<p>If the gravitational waves are real, and if they truly are a signal of supermassive black hole pairs, “it’s miraculous,” says astrophysicist Meg Urry of Yale University. “It’s extremely interesting, because we have essentially no handle on what the most massive black holes are doing.”</p>

<p>Gravitational waves are produced by accelerating, massive objects. As these waves careen through the universe, they rumple the fabric of spacetime upon which reality is embroidered. In 2015, scientists with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction?mode=magazine&amp;context=1679">detected gravitational waves for the first time</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). Those waves were spawned by mergers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">relatively puny black holes</a>, entirely different beasts than the supermassive ones that lurk at the centers of galaxies (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>).</p>



<p>While LIGO picks up gravitational wave blips that can last mere fractions of a second, orbiting supermassive black holes are expected to pump out waves continually for millions of years, creating ripples that blanket the cosmos with their constant hum. “This is a very different sort of thing, very new sort of thing,” says LIGO researcher Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. “That is awesome.”</p>



<p>Across the universe, galaxies regularly mingle and merge. As they do, scientists suspected, their supermassive black holes would orbit one another and emit gravitational waves. Many pairs of black holes would be doing this orbital dance at once, in the many merging galaxies scattered throughout the cosmos, all sending their spacetime ripples out into space.</p>



<p>“The Earth is just randomly bumping around on this sea of gravitational waves,” says astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin of West Virginia University in Morgantown and a member of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, or NANOGrav.</p>



<p>Detecting this mishmash of gravitational waves is not easy. The task required scientists to MacGyver the Milky Way, turning the galaxy into a gravitational wave detector by timing the clocklike ticking of dead, spinning remnants of exploded stars called pulsars, which emit beams of radio waves as they twirl. These beams sweep past Earth at regular intervals, like the precise ticks of a clock. Gravitational waves stretching and squeezing the space between the pulsars and Earth cause the pulsars’ ticks, observed with a variety of radio telescopes around the world, to come early or late.</p>



<p>To ensure that they were seeing the gravitational waves, rather than uninteresting jitters, the researchers looked for a special type of correlation between different pulsars. Pulsars near one another on the sky should show similar timing shifts, but those that are at right angles to one another should observe opposite shifts: One pulsar’s blips come early while the other’s come late.</p>



<p>That compelling hallmark has finally been observed, NANOGrav researchers reported June 28 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. “There’s nothing in nature that can mimic this,” says Chiara Mingarelli, an astrophysicist at Yale University and NANOGrav researcher. “Only gravitational waves can make that.” Their result was based on 15 years spent monitoring dozens of pulsars.</p>





<p>“It’s really invigorating stuff,” says astrophysicist Michael Keith of the University of Manchester in England, a member of the European Pulsar Timing Array, or EPTA.</p>



<p>The EPTA team spent an even longer time staring at pulsars — a quarter of a century. “We were getting to the point where we were starting to think maybe the signal is just so weak, we’ll never ever find it,” Keith says. But the telltale correlation between pulsars was also evident in the EPTA results, which were reported in a series of papers accepted in&nbsp;<em>Astronomy and Astrophysics </em>with researchers from the Indian Pulsar Timing Array.</p>



<p>Some scientists have thought that supermassive black holes in merging galaxies would never draw close enough to coalesce with one another, or to emit gravitational waves like the ones observed. “It’s actually been a sore spot for our field for many years,” Mingarelli says.</p>



<p>In contrast, the gravitational wave signal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-weird-secrets-early-universe">seems to be stronger than expected</a> (<em>SN</em>: 6/3/23). That suggests, “there are many black holes, they merge happily, and black holes also grow [to large masses] very happily,” says astrophysicist Marta Volonteri of Institut d&#8217;Astrophysique de Paris, who was not involved with the new research.</p>

<p>Future work could reveal more about supermassive black holes and their environs, says astronomer Ryan Shannon of Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.</p>



<p>“Understanding better the demographics of these supermassive black holes is going to help us understand how galaxies form and evolve,” says Shannon, a researcher on the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array in Australia, which also reported independent results in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and<strong> </strong>in a paper accepted <strong>in</strong>&nbsp;<em>Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia</em>. A shorter-term effort, from the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array, reported its results in&nbsp;<em>Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics</em>.</p>



<p>The teams stopped just short of declaring an ironclad detection of the background of gravitational waves, rather presenting their results as strong evidence for the ripples. Taken individually, their results don’t quite meet the most stringent standards for statistical significance set by physicists. In future work, the teams plan to combine their data, in hopes of further solidifying the detection.</p>



<p>And although supermassive black holes are the simplest explanation for the waves’ origins, researchers still can’t rule out a more exotic provenance. For example, the ripples might have arisen from inflation, the period just after the Big Bang when the universe is thought to have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inflation-trial">expanded incredibly rapidly</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/12</em>).</p>



<p>Whatever the source, the future study of these gravitational waves is bound to have ripple effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-squash-bugs-adult-poop-microbe">Young squash bugs seek out adults’ poop for an essential microbe</a></h4>

              
                <p>For young squash bugs, a sip full of feces can help the microbes go down.</p>



<p>Squash bugs (<em>Anasa tristis</em>) are a major agricultural pest, and a bacterial partner called <em>Caballeronia</em> is essential for their survival. To pick up the bacteria, fledgling squash bugs <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00724-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home in on adult poop in the environment</a>, researchers report in the July 10 <em>Current Biology</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If the nymphs don’t find the microbe, they die, says evolutionary biologist and behavioral ecologist Scott Villa of Davidson College in North Carolina. And&nbsp;<em>Caballeronia</em>&nbsp;is not plentiful in the environment. So having to fend for themselves is a risky strategy, Villa says. “If it’s so important, why in the heck did they not just put them on a platter for their kids?”</p>





<p>Many other insects do just that. Females defecate on their eggs, leaving behind essential bacteria that their young can slurp up. But it was unclear how squash bug nymphs acquired <em>Caballeronia</em>. Figuring it out could lead to ways to interrupt the bacterial supply chain to control the pest’s population, Villa says.</p>



<p>The serendipitous discovery came when Villa and colleagues caught an adult squash bug pooping on camera while working on a different study. Nymphs flocked to the feces and started feeding. When the team then gave nymphs a choice of a mouthful of saline or poop spiked with the bacteria, the bugs were intensely attracted to the feces. Of 229 recorded events, all but three involved bacteria-containing poop.</p>



<p>Nymphs also preferred bacteria-free poop or the bacteria alone to saline.</p>



<p>What’s more, the attraction may be species-specific. The insects were less successful at picking up <em>Caballeronia</em> from feces belonging to their close relative <em>A. andresii</em>, another squash bug.</p>



<p>Why <em>Caballeronia </em>is key for squash bugs is unclear, says coauthor Jason Chen, a microbial ecologist and entomologist at Emory University in Atlanta. But the bacteria probably help ensure the insects get the nutrients they need from their diet.</p>

<p>When it comes to delays in correcting the scientific record &#8212; and less-than-helpful retraction notices &#8212; it&#8217;s not uncommon to see journals blaming universities for being slow and less than forthcoming, and universities blaming journals for being impatient and not respecting the confidentiality of their processes. So in 2021 and 2022, a group of university research integrity officers, journal editors and others gathered to discuss those issues.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.20796">new paper in <em>JAMA Network Open</em></a>, the group recommends specific changes to the status quo to enable effective communication between institutions and journals:&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>(1) reconsideration and broadening of the interpretation by institutions of the need-to-know criteria in federal regulations (ie, confidential or sensitive information and data are not disclosed unless there is a need for an individual to know the facts to perform specific jobs or functions), (2) uncoupling the evaluation of the accuracy and validity of research data from the determination of culpability and intent of the individuals involved, and (3) initiating a widespread change for the policies of journals and publishers regarding the timing and appropriateness for contacting institutions, either before or concurrently under certain conditions, when contacting the authors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Susan Garfinkel, the associate vice president for research compliance at The Ohio State and the corresponding author of the article, some questions.</p>



<span id="more-127384"></span>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch (RW): The group recommends “broadening institutions’ interpretation of the federal concept of need-to-know.” Did it consider <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/11/06/its-time-to-end-the-code-of-silence-at-universities/">broadening beyond journals</a>?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Garfinkel (SG): </strong>The working group was composed of RIOs and journal editors and publishers, so the discussions focused on issues relevant only to institutions and journals. The recommendation to broaden the interpretation of the federal concept of “need to know” is a significant change for institutions to adopt and implement. The working group was very cautious to weigh the effect of such a change on the confidentiality requirements of research misconduct proceedings and therefore did not consider broadening it to include other bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> Did the group consider changing the practice at many institutions of waiting until the ORI or NSF OIG has made a finding in a report to release the findings of its own investigation?</p>



<p><strong>SG: </strong>The working group focused solely on false, fabricated, or plagiarized data and not on institutional findings of research misconduct. We were cognizant that appropriately releasing information about false, fabricated, or plagiarized data will adhere to the confidentiality requirements in federal regulations and institutional policy, i.e., the requirement to protect the identity of respondents and complainants to the extent possible. The working group focused on the timing for institutions to provide information about false, fabricated, or plagiarized data to journals, but did not consider the timing or release of institutional or federal findings of research misconduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong>Who should decide what constitutes “additional information” in this recommendation? “Limit additional sharing of any information provided by a journal to the extent possible.”</p>



<p><strong>SG: </strong>This recommendation refers to limiting sharing of information with other parties. For example, the working group recommended that an institution share complete and sufficient information about false, fabricated, or plagiarized data or text with a journal so that a comprehensive correction or retraction can be published. But to maintain confidentiality, this recommendation advises that journals should restrict sharing the information provided with any other party who may use it for other purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> The group recommends that journals “should not expect institutions to share information about the involved researchers, such as whether a researcher is currently, or has recently been, investigated for serious concerns including misconduct or specific fact-finding that occurred in a research misconduct proceeding.” Why not?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> The working group made this recommendation based on a few facts.&nbsp; First, the confidentiality provision of the federal regulation (42 CFR §93.108) that states, “Disclosure of the identity of respondents and complainants in research misconduct proceedings is limited, to the extent possible, to those who need to know, consistent with a thorough, competent, objective and fair research misconduct proceeding, and as allowed by law.”&nbsp; Second, the primary concern of journals is the integrity of the data or text submitted or published, and not who committed potential research misconduct. Third, it is the institution that must focus on who was responsible for research misconduct, which is a difficult and time-consuming process. Thus, to enable earlier communications between institutions and journals, this recommendation proposes that journals appreciate the limitations under which institutions operate and their inability to share certain information in an ongoing matter.</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> The article describes two problems – delays and transparency – which are closely linked but distinct, and journals and institutions have different pressures here. How do you think this initiative will help reduce delays, particularly in retractions, expressions of concern, and correcting the scientific record?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> Retractions, expressions of concerns, and corrections are currently delayed because journals usually are not provided with any information until research misconduct findings are made by institutions. However, institutions may identify and confirm early in a research misconduct proceeding that data are false, fabricated, or plagiarized. The recommendations from the working group propose that when false, fabricated, or plagiarized data or text are identified and confirmed, that determination can be shared with the journals to allow earlier actions to be taken by the journals.&nbsp; In addition, the working group also proposes that institutions provide complete and specific information limited to the data falsification, fabrication, or plagiarism, which conforms to the confidentiality requirements in federal regulations and institutional policy. These recommendations should allow for shorter delays in correcting the literature and more transparent journal notices.</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> Decoupling data validity from culpability and intent has been <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade3742__;!!KGKeukY!ygH5xebN_xK5qNZCoquRWVSRhoprKBmsbpbxwa7d1rton0vNGRmL_DA9MYg8DG8PU3JnWbssTrowYKX3QL7rqOkxYQ$">suggested before</a>, as the group notes. But it means retraction notices to the scientific community will be even more likely to be incomplete, since journals are <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/retractionwatch.com/2022/08/18/its-time-to-devise-a-more-efficient-solution-science-editor-in-chief-wants-to-change-the-retraction-process/__;!!KGKeukY!ygH5xebN_xK5qNZCoquRWVSRhoprKBmsbpbxwa7d1rton0vNGRmL_DA9MYg8DG8PU3JnWbssTrowYKX3QL5I1YkxjQ$">extremely unlikely to update prior notices</a> if an investigation report is even made available. How do you propose to fix this problem?</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> The decoupling of data validity from culpability and intent should allow retraction notices to be <em>more</em> complete regarding the data. The recommendation is that the institution provide the journal with complete information to understand the specific falsification, fabrication or plagiarism of data or text.&nbsp; For example, rather than limiting a notice to include only that a specific figure is false, the working recommends that the journal be provided with information to explain why the data or text are at issue, which can then be included in their notices. This will allow readers a better understanding of the concern leading to a correction or retraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> We and others have noted <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2675025__;!!KGKeukY!ygH5xebN_xK5qNZCoquRWVSRhoprKBmsbpbxwa7d1rton0vNGRmL_DA9MYg8DG8PU3JnWbssTrowYKX3QL58NijSrQ$">flaws in many institutional investigation reports</a>. How will these recommendations address that problem?</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> This working group did not discuss, and its recommendations are not relevant to, the quality of institutional investigation reports.</p>



<p><strong>RW:</strong> Do the imperatives of public universities here differ from those for private institutions? Use of NIH/NSF funds? Can taxpayer/public interests outweigh expectations of privacy in some instances?</p>



<p><strong>SG:</strong> The recommendations of the working group would apply equally to public and private institutions.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-black-hole-active">200 years ago, the Milky Way’s central black hole briefly awoke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sometime between the American Revolution and the California gold rush, the black hole at the Milky Way’s heart woke up.</p>



<p>The black hole, called Sagittarius A*, has been quiet and dim since it was discovered in the 1990s. It’s thought to have been mostly quiescent for eons. But roughly 200 years ago, the black hole, as seen from Earth, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06064-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suddenly brightened as it let out a brief flare of X-rays</a>, researchers report June 21 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>At about 26,000 light-years away, “Sagittarius A* is the closest supermassive black hole to us,” says astronomer Frédéric Marin of the University of Strasbourg in France. “But it’s dormant.” If the black hole is accreting material from its surrounding disk of gas and dust at all now, it’s at a low rate, making the behemoth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">difficult to observe</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>About 30 years ago, astronomers detected bright X-rays from large gas clouds in the galactic center. One explanation was that at some point, Sagittarius A* shot an X-ray pulse into space after eating some cosmic material, and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-once-glowed-brightly">clouds recorded the afterglow</a> (<em>SN: 4/24/08</em>). But other X-ray sources were possible.</p>



<p>Marin and colleagues used NASA’s Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite to measure the polarization, or direction, of the X-rays. “This direction can act as a compass, pointing to the source of emission,” Marin says. And it pointed straight at the black hole.</p>



<p>That polarization also suggests that the light came from at least one X-ray pulse roughly 200 years ago, the team says. The X-ray fluorescence indicates that the black hole suddenly grew a million times as bright as it is now. It’s unknown how often such pulses happen.</p>



<p>It’s also not clear what exactly caused Sagittarius A* to flare. “It could be a giant molecular cloud that was slowly accreted, or a very big star that passed by and was accreted all at once,” Marin says. “We don’t know yet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-break-internet-save">Quantum computers could break the internet. Here’s how to save it</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Keeping secrets is hard. Kids know it. Celebrities know it. National security experts know it, too.</p>



<p>And it’s about to get even harder.</p>



<p>There’s always someone who wants to get at the juicy details we’d rather keep hidden. Yet at every moment, untold volumes of private information are zipping along internet cables and optical fibers. That information’s privacy relies on encryption, a way to mathematically scramble data to prevent any snoops from deciphering it — even with the help of powerful computers.</p>





<p>But the mathematical basis of these techniques is under threat from a foe that has, until recently, seemed hypothetical: quantum computers.</p>



<p>In the 1990s, scientists realized that these computers could exploit the weird physics of the minuscule realm of atoms and electrons to perform certain types of calculations out of reach for standard computers. That means that once the quantum machines are powerful enough, they could crack the mathematical padlocks on encrypted data, laying bare the world’s secrets.</p>



<p>Today’s quantum computers are far too puny to defeat current security measures. But with more powerful quantum machines being regularly rolled out by the likes of IBM and Google, scientists, governments and others are beginning to take action. Experts are spreading the word that it’s time to prepare for a milestone some are calling Y2Q. That’s the year that quantum computers will gain the ability to crack the encoding schemes that keep electronic communications secure.</p>



<p>“If that encryption is ever broken,” says mathematician Michele Mosca, “it would be a systemic catastrophe.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Y2Q is coming. What does it mean?</h4>



<p>Encryption pervades digital life — safeguarding emails, financial and medical data, online shopping transactions and more. Encryption is also woven into a plethora of physical devices that transmit information, from cars to robot vacuums to baby monitors. Encryption even secures infrastructure such as power grids. The tools Y2Q threatens are everywhere. “The stakes are just astronomically high,” says Mosca, of the University of Waterloo in Canada, who is also CEO of the cybersecurity company evolutionQ.</p>



<p>The name Y2Q alludes to the infamous Y2K bug, which threatened to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/year-2000-chip-danger-looms-large">create computer havoc</a> in the year 2000 because software typically used only two digits to mark the year (<em>SN:&nbsp;1/2/99, p. 4</em>). Y2Q is a similarly systemic issue, but in many ways, it’s not a fair comparison. The fix for Y2Q is much more complex than changing how dates are represented, and computers are now even more inextricably entwined into society than two decades ago. Plus, no one knows when Y2Q will arrive.</p>



<p>Confronted with the Y2Q threat, cryptography — the study and the practice of techniques used to encode information — is facing an overhaul. Scientists and mathematicians are now working urgently to prepare for that unknown date by devising new ways of encrypting data that won’t be susceptible to quantum decoding. An effort headed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, aims to release new standards for such post-quantum cryptography algorithms next year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a longer-term effort takes a can’t-beat-’em-join-’em approach: using quantum technology to build a more secure, quantum internet. Scientists around the world are building networks that shuttle quantum information back and forth between cities, chasing the dream of communication that theoretically could be immune to hacking.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How public-key cryptography works</h4>





<p>If you want to share a secret message with someone, you can encrypt it, garbling the information in such a way that it’s possible to decode it later.</p>



<p>Schoolkids might do this with a simple cipher: For example, replace the letter A with the number 1, B with 2 and so on. Anyone who knows this secret key used to encrypt the message can later decode the message and read it — whether it’s the intended recipient or another sneaky classmate.</p>



<p>It’s a simplified example of what’s called symmetric-key cryptography: The same key is used to encode and decode a message. In a more serious communication, the key would be much more complex — essentially impossible for anyone to guess. But in both cases, the same secret key is used to encode and decode.</p>



<p>This strategy was used in cryptography for millennia, says computer scientist Peter Schwabe of the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Bochum, Germany. “It was either used in a military context or it was used between lovers that were not supposed to love each other.”</p>



<p>But in the globally connected modern world, symmetric-key cryptography has a problem. How do you get the secret key to someone on the other side of the planet, someone you’ve never met, without anyone else getting their hands on it?</p>



<p>To solve this quandary, in the 1970s cryptographers devised public-key cryptography, which uses special mathematical tricks to solve the symmetric-key conundrum. It uses two different, mathematically related keys. A public key is used to encrypt messages, and a mathematically related private key decodes them. Say Alice wants to send a message to Bob. She looks up his public key and uses it to scramble her communication. Only Bob, with his private key, can decode it. To any snoops that intercept the message, it’s meaningless.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to swap secrets with strangers</h3>



<p>Public-key cryptography allows people in far-flung places who have never met to share secret information. A publicly available key is used to encode the message being sent, and a different but mathematically related private key — known only to the intended recipient — is used to decode the message.</p>

<p>Public-key techniques are also used to create digital signatures. These signatures verify that someone online really is who they say they are, so you know you’re really downloading that new app from Apple, not some nefarious impersonator. Only the owner of a private key can sign the message, but anyone can use the public key to verify its authenticity.</p>



<p>The public-key cryptography that permeates the internet is directly vulnerable to full-scale quantum computers. What’s more, symmetric-key cryptography often relies on public-key cryptography to share the secret key needed to communicate. That puts the majority of internet security under threat.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why quantum computers will threaten public-key cryptography</h4>



<p>If public-key encryption keeps your data hidden away under the floorboards, then to read that information, you need to build a way in. You have to be able to access the data with your private key. “There’s got to be a secret door somewhere in there, where if I knock the right way, it opens up,” Mosca says.</p>



<p>Constructing such a trapdoor demands special mathematical tactics, based on operations that are easy to perform in one direction but hard in the opposite direction. Multiplying two prime numbers together is quick work for a computer, even if the numbers are very large. But it’s much more time-consuming for a computer to calculate the primes from their product. For large enough numbers, it’s impossible to do in a practical amount of time with a standard computer.</p>



<p>The challenge of finding the prime factors of a large number is behind one of the main types of public-key encryption used today, known as RSA. A hacker using a classical computer wouldn’t be able to deduce the private key from the public key. Another math problem, known as the discrete logarithm problem, is a similar one-way street.</p>



<p>These two mathematical problems underlie nearly all of the public-key cryptography in use today. But a sufficiently powerful quantum computer would blow their trapdoors wide open. “All of those public-key algorithms are vulnerable to an attack that can only be carried out by a quantum computer,” says mathematician Angela Robinson of NIST, in Gaithersburg, Md. “Our whole digital world is relying on quantum-vulnerable algorithms.”</p>



<p>This vulnerability came to light in 1994, when mathematician Peter Shor, now at MIT, came up with an algorithm that would allow quantum computers to solve both of these math problems. In quantum machines, the bits, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quarter-century-ago-qubit-was-born">called qubits</a>, can take on values of 0 and 1 simultaneously, a state known as a superposition. And qubits can be linked with one another through the quantum connection called entanglement, enabling new tactics like Shor’s (<em>SN: 7/8/17 &amp; 7/22/17, p. 34</em>).</p>



<p>“Back then, that was an interesting theoretical paper. Quantum computers were a distant dream,” says mathematician Dustin Moody of NIST, “but it wasn’t a practical threat.” Since then, there’s been a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">quantum computing boom</a> (<em>SN:&nbsp;7/8/17 &amp; 7/22/17, p. 28</em>).</p>



<p>The machines are being built using qubits made from various materials — from individual atoms to flecks of silicon to superconductors (which conduct electricity without resistance) — but all calculate according to quantum rules. IBM’s superconducting quantum computer Osprey, for example, has 433 qubits. That’s up from the five qubits of the computer IBM unveiled in 2016. The company plans to roll out one with more than a thousand qubits this year.</p>



<p>That’s still far from the Y2Q threshold: To break RSA encryption, a quantum computer <a href="https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-04-15-433/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would need 20&nbsp;million qubits</a>, researchers reported in 2021 in <em>Quantum</em>.</p>



<p>Mosca estimates that in the next 15 years, there’s about a 50&nbsp;percent chance of a quantum computer powerful enough to break standard public-key encryption. That may seem like a long time, but experts estimate that previous major cryptography overhauls have taken around 15 years. “This is not a Tuesday patch,” Mosca says.</p>



<p>The threat is even more pressing because the data we send today could be vulnerable to quantum computers that don’t exist yet. Hackers could harvest encrypted information now, and later decode it once a powerful quantum computer becomes available, Mosca says. “It’s just bad news if we don’t get ahead of this.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">New algorithms could safeguard our security</h4>



<p>Getting ahead of the problem is the aim of Moody, Robinson and others who are part of NIST’s effort to select and standardize post-quantum encryption and digital signatures. Such techniques would have to thwart hackers using quantum machines, while still protecting from classical hacks.</p>



<p>After NIST put out a call for post-quantum algorithms in 2016, the team received dozens of proposed schemes. The researchers sorted through the candidates, weighing considerations including the level of security provided and the computational resources needed for each. Finally, in July 2022, NIST announced four schemes that had risen to the top. Once the final standards for those algorithms are ready in 2024, organizations can begin making the post-quantum leap. Meanwhile, NIST continues to consider additional candidates.</p>



<p>In parallel with NIST’s efforts, others are endorsing the post-quantum endeavor. In May 2022, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put out a memo setting 2035</a> as the goal for U.S. government agencies to go post-quantum. In November, Google announced it is already <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/why-google-now-uses-post-quantum-cryptography-for-internal-comms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using post-quantum cryptography</a> in internal communications.</p>



<p>Several of the algorithms selected by NIST share a mathematical basis — a technique called lattice-based cryptography. It relies on a problem involving describing a lattice, or a grid of points, using a set of arrows, or vectors.</p>



<p>In math, a lattice is described by a set of vectors used to produce it. Consider Manhattan. Even if you’d never seen a map of the city, you could roughly reproduce its grid using two arrows, one the length and direction of an avenue block and the other matching a street block. Discounting the city’s quirks, such as variations in block lengths, you’d just place arrows end-to-end until you’ve mapped out the whole grid.</p>



<p>But there are more complicated sets of vectors that can reproduce the city’s grid. Picture two arrows starting, for example, at Washington Square Park in lower Manhattan, with one pointing to Times Square in Midtown and the other to a neighboring landmark, the Empire State Building. Properly chosen, two such vectors could also be used — with more difficulty — to map out the city’s grid.</p>



<p>A math problem called the shortest vector problem asks: Given a set of long vectors that generate a lattice, what is the shortest vector that can be used as part of a set to produce the grid? If all you knew about the city was the location of those three landmarks, it’d be quite a task to back out the shortest vector corresponding to the city’s blocks.</p>



<p>Now, picture doing that not for a 2-D map, but in hundreds of dimensions. That’s a problem thought to be so difficult that no computer, quantum or classical, could do it in a reasonable amount of time.</p>



<p>The difficulty of that problem is what underlies the strength of several post-quantum cryptography algorithms. In lattice-based cryptography, a short vector is used to create the private key, and the long vectors produce the public key.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Help from the shortest vector problem</h3>



<p>Some post-quantum encryption schemes rely on what’s known as the shortest vector problem. Take a set of two long vectors (green on the left). By placing those vectors end-to-end, it’s possible to trace out a grid of points (blue). The shortest vector problem is to find the shortest of the vectors (the horizontal arrow in the grid on the right) that can be used to trace out that same grid. That’s not so hard in two dimensions. But when used for cryptography, the problem must be solved in hundreds of dimensions, a nearly impossible task.</p>

</div>



<p>Other post-quantum schemes NIST considered are based on different math problems. To choose among the options, NIST mathematicians’ chief consideration was the strength of each algorithm’s security. But none of these algorithms are definitively proved to be secure against quantum computers, or even classical ones. One algorithm originally considered by NIST, called SIKE, was later broken. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30589-4_15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It took just 10 minutes to crack on a standard computer</a>, researchers reported in April in <em>Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT 2023</em>.</p>



<p>Although it might seem like a failure, the SIKE breakdown can be considered progress. The faith in the security of cryptographic algorithms comes from a trial by fire. “The more [that] smart people try to break something and fail, the more confidence we can get that it’s actually hard to break it,” Schwabe says. Some algorithms must perish in the process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A quantum internet could bolster security</h4>



<p>Quantum physics taketh away, but also, it gives. A different quantum technique can allow communication with mathematically proved security. That means a future quantum internet could, theoretically at least, be fully safe from both quantum and classical hacks.</p>



<p>By transmitting photons — particles of light — and measuring their properties upon arrival, it’s possible to generate a shared private key that is verifiably safe from eavesdroppers.</p>



<p>This quantum key distribution, or QKD, relies on a principle of quantum physics called the no-cloning theorem. Essentially, it’s impossible to copy quantum information. Any attempt to do so will alter the original information, revealing that someone was snooping. “Someone who was trying to learn that information would basically leave a fingerprint behind,” says quantum engineer Nolan Bitner of Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill.</p>



<p>This quirk of quantum physics allows two people to share a secret key and, by comparing notes, determine whether the key has been intercepted along the way. If those comparisons don’t match as expected, someone was eavesdropping. The communicators discard their key and start over. If there is no sign of foul play, they can safely use their shared secret key to encrypt their communication and send it over the standard internet, certain of its security. It’s a quantum solution to the quandary of how two parties can share secret keys without ever meeting. There’s no need for a mathematical trapdoor that might be vulnerable to an undiscovered tactic.</p>



<p>But QKD can’t be done over normal channels. It requires quantum networks, in which photons are created, sent zipping along optical fibers and are manipulated at the other end.</p>



<p>Such networks already snake through select cities in the world. One threads through Chicago suburbs from the University of Chicago to Argonne lab and Fermilab in Batavia, for a total of 200&nbsp;kilometers. In China, an extensive network connects cities along a more than 2,000-kilometer backbone that wends from Beijing to Shanghai, along with two quantum satellites that beam photons through the air. A quantum network crisscrosses South Korea, and another links several U.K. cities. There are networks in Tokyo and the Netherlands — the list goes on, with more to come.</p>

<p>Many of these networks are test-beds used by researchers to study the technology outside of a lab. But some are getting real-world use. Banks use China’s network, and South Korea’s links government agencies. Companies such as ID Quantique, based in Switzerland, offer commercial QKD devices.</p>



<p>QKD’s security is mathematically proven, but quantum networks can fall short of that guarantee in practice. The difficulty of creating, transmitting, detecting and storing quantum particles can open loopholes. Devices and networks must be painstakingly designed and tested to ensure a hacker can’t game the system.</p>



<p>And one missing component in particular is holding quantum networks back. “The number one device is quantum memory,” says quantum physicist Xiongfeng Ma of Tsinghua University in Beijing. When sending quantum information over long distances through fibers, particles can easily get lost along the way. For distances greater than about 100 kilometers, that makes quantum communication impractical without the use of way stations that amplify the signal. Such way stations temporarily convert data into classical, rather than quantum, information. That classical step means hackers could target these “trusted nodes” undetected, marring QKD’s pristine security. And it limits what quantum maneuvers the networks can do.</p>



<p>It’s not possible to create pairs of particles that are entangled over long distances in a network like this. But special stations sprinkled throughout the network, called quantum repeaters, could solve the problem by storing information in a quantum memory. To create far-flung entangled particles, scientists could first entangle sets of particles over short distances, storing them in quantum memories at each quantum repeater. Performing certain operations on the entangled particles could leapfrog that entanglement to other particles farther apart. By repeating this process, particles could be entangled across extended distances.</p>



<p>But, thanks in part to quantum particles’ tendency to be easily perturbed by outside influences, scientists have yet to develop a practical quantum repeater. “When that does appear, it’s likely to catalyze global quantum networks,” says David Awschalom, a physicist at the University of Chicago. Not only will such technologies allow longer distances and better security for QKD, but they will also enable more complicated tasks, like entangling distant quantum computers to allow them to work together.</p>



<p>A European effort called the Quantum Internet Alliance aims to build a network with quantum repeaters by the end of 2029, creating a backbone stretching over 500 kilometers, in addition to two metropolitan-scale networks. The effort is “super challenging,” says physicist and computer scientist Stephanie Wehner of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. “We are on a moon shot mission.” Eventually, scientists envision a global quantum internet.</p>



<p>Awschalom imagines the networks becoming accessible to all. “Wouldn’t it be great to be able to go to a public library and be able to get onto a quantum network?”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What does the future of cryptography look like?</h4>



<p>QKD and post-quantum cryptography are complementary. “In order to overcome the threat of the quantum computers we need both,” says physicist Nicolas Gisin of the University of Geneva and cofounder of ID Quantique. When people are exchanging information that doesn’t require the utmost security — say, using a mobile phone to post cat memes on Reddit — post-quantum cryptography will be more practical, as it doesn’t demand a to-and-fro of individual quantum particles. But “there are really situations where we want to make sure that the security is going to last … for several decades, and post-quantum cryptography cannot guarantee that,” Gisin says.</p>



<p>Eventually, quantum techniques could allow for even more advanced types of security, such as blind quantum computing. In that scheme, a user could compute something on a remote quantum computer without anyone being able to determine what they’re computing. A technique called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/communicating-covertly-goes-quantum">covert quantum communication</a> would allow users to communicate securely while hiding that they were exchanging messages at all. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-entanglement-communication-security-bell-test">device-independent QKD</a> would ensure security even if the devices used to communicate are potentially flawed (<em>SN:&nbsp;8/27/22, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>The appeal of such extreme secrecy, of course, depends upon whether you’re the secret-keeper or the snoop. In the United States, government agencies like the FBI, CIA and the National Security Agency have argued that encryption makes it difficult to eavesdrop on criminals or terrorists. The agencies have a history of advocating for back doors that would let them in on encrypted communications — or building in secret back doors.</p>



<p>But quantum techniques, done properly, can prevent anyone from intercepting secrets, even powerful government agencies.</p>



<p>“It’s interesting to think about a world where, in principle, one might imagine perfect security,” Awschalom says. “Is that a good thing or is that a bad thing?”</p>

<p>Clarivate, the company that assigns journals Impact Factors, this year will not give four journals updated versions of the controversial metric used by many institutions and publications as a shorthand for quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journals will remain indexed in Web of Science, but won’t have an Impact Factor for this year in Clarivate’s 2023 Journal Citation Reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Clarivate, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mtq"><em>Marketing Theory</em></a>, a SAGE title, has been suppressed for self-citation. Three other journals have been suppressed for citation stacking, sometimes referred to as “citation cartels” or “<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/03/citation-boosting-episode-leads-editors-resignations-university-investigation/">citation rings</a>.” The other journals are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127390"></span>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dgsgenetika.org.rs/publications/"><em>Genetika</em></a> (the Serbian Genetics Society)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.isisn.org/Bioscience_Research.htm"><em>Bioscience Research</em></a><em> </em>(Innovative Scientific Information &amp; Services Network)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/toc/jbibn/current"><em>Bioinspired, Biomimetic, and Nanobiomaterials</em></a> (ICE Publishing)</li>
</ul>



<p>Jelena Milasin, president of the Serbian Genetics Society, told Retraction Watch that Clarivate’s decision not to give <em>Genetika</em> an Impact Factor this year was “truly devastating.” Milasin also disputed that the journal had participated in a citation stacking scheme:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We tried to explain to the Clarivate staff that we were absolutely unaware of the situation with the citations and that Genetika did not have any kind of relationship with the journal Bioscience Research nor with authors of cited and citing papers (we never heard of that journal). We neither had any influence on the editorial policy of the Bioscience Research journal nor the authors’ decision which papers to cite. Also, none of the papers published in Genetika in 2021 and 2022 cited any article from Bioscience Research.</p>



<p>So, basically, it seems to me quite unfair to be punished for something that was beyond our control.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Milasin said that the suppression decision came in spite of the editors of <em>Genetika</em> offering to retract 32 “suspicious papers” published in 2021 and 2022, to blacklist authors who “misused the papers published in Genetika by citing them unjustifiably,” as well as the authors of the cited papers, and to no longer ask scientists identified as engaging in peer review misconduct to review for the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The listing for <em>Genetika</em> in Clarivate’s Master Journal List indicates that the publication is “On Hold,” meaning that “concerns have been raised about the quality of the content,” and Clarivate is reevaluating whether the title meets its <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">selection criteria</a> for inclusion in Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors and publishers of the other suppressed journals have not yet responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Clarivate <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/28/the-lancet-more-than-doubles-its-impact-factor-eclipsing-nejm-for-the-first-time-ever/">suppressed three journals</a> for self-citation. In 2021, it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">suppressed 10</a>, and 33 the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">year before</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Clarivate refreshed its Master Journal List in March, the company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">delisted 50 journals</a> for failing to meet quality criteria, including 19 from the open-access publisher Hindawi. Delisted journals are no longer included on the Master Journal List or indexed in Web of Science, and Clarivate does not count their citations or assign them Impact Factors. All these changes can have negative effects for authors, because universities often use the metrics to judge researchers’ work for decisions about tenure and promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley, which acquired Hindawi in 2021, later announced that it would <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">close four of the journals</a> that had been delisted, as well as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">retract approximately 1,200 articles</a> for compromised peer review. The company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">paused publication</a> of Hindawi special issues for three months ending in mid-January, and lost $9 million in revenue as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0">published a list</a> of 82 journals Clarivate delisted in March, which also included those removed for production-related rather than editorial reasons, the company <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/building-trust-through-transparency-our-pledge-to-provide-more-clarity-around-web-of-science-journal-coverage/">announced</a> that it would publish the changes it makes to the Master Journal List each month, which it had not done before. <s>No journals have been delisted this month.</s></p>



<p>This year’s Journal Citation Report includes 9,136 titles that have an Impact Factor for the first time, following Clarivate’s <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/clarivate-announces-changes-to-the-2023-journal-citation-reports-release/">decision</a> to expand the metric to journals in its Arts and Humanities Citation Index and Emerging Sources Citation Index. The company also is now publishing Impact Factors to one decimal place, rather than three. The move “introduces more ties, which will encourage users to consider additional indicators and descriptive data when comparing journals,” the company said in a press release.</p>



<p>Update, 7/28/23, 1430 UTC: Andreas Chatzidakis, one of the editors in chief of <em>Marketing Theory</em>, said that the journal was in the process of appealing the decision.</p>



<p>Update, 7/29/23, 1740 UTC: After publication, Clarivate informed us that their earlier statement that no journals had been delisted this month was not accurate, though none had been delisted with the release of the Journal Citation Reports. Clarivate delisted the <em>Russian Law Journal,</em> which we <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/26/three-journals-web-domains-expired-then-major-indexes-pointed-to-hijacked-versions/" target="_blank">had reported</a> had been hijacked,for editorial reasons when it refreshed the Master Journal List earlier this month.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flowers-pollinate-honeybees-low-seeds">Flowers pollinated by honeybees make lower-quality seeds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Flowers pollinated by honeybees make fewer and lower-quality seeds than flowers visited by other pollinators.</p>



<p>That could be because honeybees spend more time buzzing between flowers of the same plant than other pollinators do. As a result, more of the plant’s own pollen is deposited back on itself, leading to more inbred seeds, researchers report June 28 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Honeybees command a lot of attention in insect conservation circles, in part because they are important for pollinating our food supply. But the findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing pollinators like wild, native bees, moths and butterflies in conservation efforts too, the researchers say.</p>





<p>For the study, ecologists Joshua Kohn and Dillon Travis, both of the University of California, San Diego, painstakingly tracked the pollination of flowers from three native plant species — white sage (<em>Salvia apiana</em>), black sage (<em>Salvia mellifera</em>) and <em>Phacelia distans — </em>in San Diego County<em>.</em></p>



<p>Often Travis sat for hours waiting for a single pollinator, honeybee or wild bee or otherwise, to come and go from a flower. Then he put a mesh bag on the flower and came back later to collect its seeds. He also collected the seeds of flowers he had cross- or self-pollinated by hand — also covered with a bag to prevent any new visitors.</p>



<p>Despite boasting over 650 native bee species, San Diego County’s most frequent flower visitor is the western honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>), which isn’t native, the researchers say. “Whatever native plants [are] blooming abundantly, they’re just dripping with honeybees,” Kohn says.</p>



<p>Back in the greenhouse, the team grew the seeds, analyzing characteristics that reflected their&nbsp; quality, such as how many seeds germinated and survived and how many leaves or flowers seedlings grew.</p>



<p>The white sage and <em>P. distans</em> plants produced roughly half the amount of seeds from flowers pollinated by honeybees compared with other pollinators, mostly native insects. And <em>P. distans</em> seeds from honeybee-pollinated plants grew into seedlings with fewer flowers. The black sage plants didn’t get enough non-honeybee visitors for comparison but did produce fewer seeds when pollinated by honeybees compared with cross-pollination by hand.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that honeybees visited about twice as many flowers on one plant before moving to the next than the average of other pollinators. That suggests the fewer, lower-quality seeds may arise because honeybees transfer more pollen between flowers of the same plant, resulting in more inbred seeds. Other pollinators more often flitted between different plants, probably transferring more diverse pollen.</p>



<p>The new finding is concerning, Travis says. Because of honeybees&#8217; methodical pollination habit, it’s likely the results are relevant to other plants. But it’s difficult to know how things will play out in the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One potential consequence could be that native plant populations decline as subsequent generations become more inbred, reducing biodiversity. It would be illuminating to see how inbred plants fare after several generations, says Maria van Dyke, a pollinator ecologist at Cornell University.</p>



<p>For now, this study is an example of why more conservation focus should be on native bees and other pollinators, which are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-bees-pollinators-billion-yields-six-u-s-crops">vital to ecosystems and agriculture</a>, in addition to honeybees, van Dyke says. (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>). Honeybees, wild bees and many other insects are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/much-worlds-honey-now-contains-pesticides-harm-bees">threatened by pesticide use</a> and climate change (<em>SN: 10/5/17</em>).</p>



<p>“It is time to actually shift our dependence for pollination from largely honeybees to … native species as well,” says Jaya Sravanthi Mokkapati, an entomologist at Penn State University. Growing native flowers is one way to support native pollinators, she says, as is adding nesting habitat — like twigs and decaying wood — to yards.</p>

<p>A neurology researcher in Australia is no longer employed at his former university in the midst of a research misconduct investigation, Retraction Watch has learned. And the work of a co-author at another institution also is being assessed for possible research misconduct after sleuths alerted the university to comments on PubPeer about potential data issues in his papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-014-9557-9">Changes in Cathepsin D and Beclin-1 mRNA and protein expression by the excitotoxin quinolinic acid in human astrocytes and neurons</a>,” was published in <em>Metabolic Brain Disease</em> in 2014 and has been cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s editor-in-chief, Gregory Konat, retracted the paper because several of the western blots appeared to be duplicated and he no longer had confidence in the results, according to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-023-01241-3">retraction notice</a>. The six authors are researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Macquarie University and St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127373"></span>



<p>All but one of them agreed with the retraction; first author <a href="https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/our-people/dr-nady-braidy">Nady Braidy</a>, a senior research fellow at UNSW’s Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, did not respond to correspondence from the editor, according to the notice. The corresponding author, Gilles Guillemin, is no longer employed as a neuroscience professor at Macquarie University as the institution investigates some of his work, Retraction Watch has learned. Guillemin is a <a href="https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2009388">Member of the Order of Australia</a>.</p>



<p>Anonymous commenters on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/33ECDD6D3F1978854948927C58B5FA#1">first pointed out</a> potential data anomalies in the paper in September 2021. Two Australian researchers, <a href="https://neura.edu.au/researchers/prof-simon-gandevia">Simon Gandevia</a>, deputy director of NeuRA, and <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/david-vaux">David Vaux</a>, an honorary research fellow and retired deputy director of the Walter &amp; Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, contacted the editor of <em>Metabolic Brain Disease</em> to ask for an investigation into the paper in October 2021, citing the PubPeer comments. (Vaux is also on the board of directors of Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit, the Center for Scientific Integrity.)</p>



<p>In March 2023, the journal’s publisher wrote back to Gandevia confirming that an investigation was underway by their in-house research integrity group. Three months later, the paper was retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaux says he became interested in the paper after reading a post about Guillemin on Leonid Schneider’s <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2021/09/07/none-of-the-work-has-not-been-done-in-my-lab/">blog</a>. By <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dGuillemin%252c%2bGilles%2bJ">our count</a>, one of Guillemin’s papers has previously been retracted, and another marked with an expression of concern. Vaux noticed several papers that were flagged for potential data duplication <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Gilles+Guillemin">on PubPeer</a> were also co-authored with Braidy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don&#8217;t know which of the authors are responsible, whether it&#8217;s Braidy or whether it&#8217;s one of the other authors,” Vaux says. “We&#8217;re just ringing the alarm bell.”</p>



<p>This retraction is Braidy’s first. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9673782/">Two of his</a> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00134/full">publications</a> have been corrected, one has received an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263555">expression of concern</a>, and another is <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/10905/text/">under investigation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I saw all of these postings about all of these papers,” Vaux says. “I thought &#8216;well, given past history, it&#8217;s quite likely that the universities won&#8217;t take any action unless somebody makes an official complaint.'&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Gandevia &#8212; who has taken an <a href="http://retractions.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active interest in scientific integrity</a> &#8212; and Vaux alerted UNSW to the PubPeer comments about Braidy’s papers in September 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter to several university officials they wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The evidence presented on PubPeer is very difficult to dismiss as the result of chance of innocent mistake, leaving the remaining explanation deliberate falsification or fabrication of data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2023, Vaux was told that the case was still in the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/pdfs/governance/policy/2022-01-policies/researchmisconductproc.pdf">preliminary assessment stage</a> – an assessment of whether the complaint constitutes a breach of the university’s code and requires further investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He wrote to Attilla Brungs, UNSW’s vice chancellor, in March, alleging that the university’s handling of the case was not timely and constituted a breach of the <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-code-responsible-conduct-research-2018">Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brungs wrote back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I do appreciate that this investigation is taking a significant amount of time, as warranted by its complexity. I would also like to highlight again for you that UNSW has a far more extensive and rigorous preliminary assessment process that perhaps some other institutions do not have. This allows UNSW to generally ensure more efficient outcomes in most cases.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we emailed Brungs to follow up on the case, a spokesperson for UNSW responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>UNSW Sydney is aware of the concerns, and we are managing these concerns in accordance with our Research Misconduct Procedure. It would be inappropriate to comment any further at this stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“I think the problem is that the university&#8217;s office for handling research misconduct allegations is not competent,” Vaux said.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In September 2021, Vaux also forwarded the PubPeer comments on Guillemin’s papers to the research integrity office at Macquarie University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2023, Macquarie University’s director of research ethics and integrity wrote to Vaux that their preliminary assessment had found ten of Guillemin’s papers had a potential breach of the university’s research code, and that four of them required further investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, a spokesperson for the university wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Macquarie University is aware of the concerns, and they are being managed in accordance with the University&#8217;s Research Code Procedure. We note that Professor Gilles Guillemin has ceased employment at Macquarie University.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We have not received confirmation of when or why Guillemin left Macquarie. According to the spokesperson, “it is not the University&#8217;s place to disclose that information.” But since we started reporting this story on June 14, the webpage for Guillemin’s lab is now <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/macquarie-university-centre-for-motor-neuron-disease-research/our-people2/genetics">no longer accessible</a> and has been removed from the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/macquarie-university-centre-for-motor-neuron-disease-research">website</a> of Macquarie University’s Centre for Motor Neuron Disease Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Braidy and Guillemin did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Universities in Australia self-regulate cases of research misconduct. Vaux says the <a href="https://theconversation.com/australia-needs-an-office-for-research-integrity-to-catch-up-with-the-rest-of-the-world-176019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of a national office for research integrity</a> makes this process inefficient. “Australia should be embarrassed because we&#8217;re behind, falling further behind the rest of the world,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-sharks-predators-paleontology">Megalodon sharks may have become megapredators by running hot</a></h4>

              
                <p>Massive, megatoothed <em>Otodus megalodon</em> ran hot — the ancient shark was at least somewhat warm-blooded, new evidence shows.</p>



<p>Chemical measurements from fossil <em>O. megalodon</em> teeth suggest <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2218153120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sharks had higher body temperatures than their surrounding waters</a>, researchers report June 26 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Analyses of carbon and oxygen in the teeth of these and other sharks, both living and extinct, revealed that the giant shark’s body temperature was about 7 degrees Celsius warmer than estimated seawater temperatures at the time.</p>





<p>That warm-bloodedness may have been a double-edged sword. The trait may have helped <em>O. megalodon</em> become a swift, fearsome apex predator and grow up to 20 meters long, making it among the largest carnivores to ever live on Earth. But the shark’s voracious appetite may have also spelled the species’ ultimate doom. Gigantism has a high metabolic cost, says UCLA marine biogeochemist Robert Eagle: Bigger bodies require more food, and the massive sharks may have been particularly vulnerable to extinction when the climate changed and food became scarcer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mammals are well known for being able to metabolically elevate and maintain their body heat, even in colder environments, a trait called endothermy. But some fish lineages, both living and extinct, are capable of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-marine-reptiles-losing-their-cool">regional endothermy</a>, maintaining some body parts at higher temperatures than the surrounding water (<em>SN: 6/10/10</em>). For example, many modern lamniform sharks — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-teeth-show-how-mass-extinction-scrambled-shark-evolution">the group that includes species like mako and great white sharks</a> — have this ability (<em>SN: 8/2/18</em>).</p>



<p>“Indeed, regional endothermy is one of just two known evolutionary pathways toward giant sizes in sharks,” says Jack Cooper, a paleobiologist at Swansea University in Wales who was not involved in the new study. (The other, Cooper says, is filter feeding, employed by gentler giants such as whale sharks.)</p>



<p>Scientists have long thought that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185185" target="_blank" rel="noopener">megalodon was regionally endothermic</a>, Eagle says, based on a variety of evidence such as estimates of the megashark’s body shape, as well as its likely swimming speeds and energy requirements. The shark was also known to have a very large geographic range around the globe, actively hunting in colder as well as warmer waters, which argues for some warm-bloodedness. A recent study by Cooper and colleagues that modeled the shark’s body in 3-D estimated that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abm9424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adult <em>O. megalodon</em> was a transoceanic superpredator</a>, able to swim faster than any living shark species and fully consume prey the size of today’s largest predators.</p>



<p>The question, Eagle adds, isn’t really whether <em>O. megalodon</em> was endothermic — it’s <em>how</em> endothermic it was. In particular, the team wondered how its body temperatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-megatooth-sharks-food-chain-apex-predator-ocean">compared to one of its primary ocean competitors</a>, which appeared on the scene late in the shark’s reign: <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>, better known as the great white shark (<em>SN: 6/29/22</em>).</p>



<p><em>O. megalodon</em> appeared around 23 million years ago and went extinct sometime between 3.5 million and 2.6 million years ago. Great white sharks emerged around 3.5 million years ago, and they competed for food with their massive cousins. One hypothesis has been that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-white-sharks-megalodon-food-competition-extinction">this competition helped drive <em>O. megalodon</em> to extinction</a> (<em>SN: 5/31/22</em>). Climate change during the Pliocene Epoch, which spanned 5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago, led to a collapse in the population of marine mammals, the primary food source for both sharks.</p>



<p>“The <em>Carcharodon</em> were much smaller … and persisted, whereas the <em>Otodus</em> went extinct,” Eagle says. “<em>Carcharodon</em> probably had a lower requirement for food to maintain its metabolic rate.”</p>



<p>To get more direct evidence of the body temperatures of these shark species, and therefore better understand their respective metabolisms, the team turned to the only fossils the sharks have left behind: their teeth.</p>



<p>Fossilized teeth offer a wealth of encapsulated environmental data. The tooth enamel contains both heavier and lighter forms, or isotopes, of carbon, oxygen and other elements, and the relative abundances of these isotopes is linked to body temperature. Eagle and his colleagues used a technique that examines the abundance of “clumped isotopes” — bonded-together heavy forms of carbon (carbon-13) and oxygen (oxygen-18) — as a kind of ancient geochemical thermometer. The abundance of these bonds is “only affected by temperature,” offering a more unambiguous thermometer than using a single element’s isotopic abundance, Eagle says.</p>



<p>The team used this technique on teeth from the different sharks, as well as fossil samples from other ancient ocean contemporaries including whales and mollusks. (Mollusks, being entirely cold-blooded, represent the ocean water temperature, Eagle says). The data show that both sharks were a bit endothermic, but not only was&nbsp;<em>O. megalodon</em>’s average body temperature (about 27⁰ C) higher than its surrounding waters, it was also higher than the average body temperature of great whites (about 22⁰ C) living in similar waters. Neither shark was as warm-blooded as marine mammals, such as the whale groups <em>Odontoceti</em> and <em>Mysticeti</em>, the team determined.</p>





<p>It’s “a very interesting finding, and it is fantastic that we have more evidence for regional endothermy in megalodon,” Cooper says. <em>O. megalodon’s</em> higher body temperature would have allowed it “to swim further and faster, increasing its chances of encountering prey,” he says. “But it also means that if food availability declines, megalodon would not have been able to meet its huge energetic requirements.” And when changing sea levels in the Pliocene led to a decline in the sharks’ prey about 3 million years ago, “it may well have starved into extinction.”</p>



<p>Eagle and colleagues are now delving into the chicken-or-egg question of which came first for <em>O. megalodon</em>: warm-bloodedness or apex predator status. “You need a high trophic level to become gigantic,” Eagle says. But is warm-bloodedness necessary to get to that high trophic level (apex predator status)? “We’re hoping to fit it all together into an evolutionary story as to what drives what.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Minghua Zheng will talk about the paper entitled &quot;Few-shot Object Counting with Similarity-Aware Feature Enhancement&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This work studies the problem of few-shot object counting, which counts the number of
exemplar objects (i.e., described by one or several support images) occurring in the query
image. The major challenge lies in that the target objects can be densely packed in the
query image, making it hard to recognize every single one. To tackle the obstacle, we
propose a novel learning block, equipped with a similarity comparison module and a feature
enhancement module. Concretely, given a support image and a query image, we first derive a
score map by comparing their projected features at every spatial position. The score maps
regarding all support images are collected together and normalized across both the
exemplar dimension and the spatial dimensions, producing a reliable similarity map. We
then enhance the query feature with the support features by employing the developed point-
wise similarities as the weighting coefficients. Such a design encourages the model to
inspect the query image by focusing more on the regions akin to the support images,
leading to much clearer boundaries between different objects. Extensive experiments on
various benchmarks and training setups suggest that we surpass the state-of-the-art
methods by a sufficiently large margin. For instance, on a recent large-scale FSC-147
dataset, we surpass the state-of-the-art method by improving the mean absolute error from
22.08 to 14.32 (35%↑). Code has been released in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zhiyuanyou/SAFECount">https://github.com/zhiyuanyou/SAFECount</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">cOAlition S</a>, in partnership with <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/">PLOS</a>, are seeking to establish a multi-stakeholder working group to identify business models and arrangements that enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing. The aims of this working group and the eligibility criteria that interested parties must meet in order to apply are outlined below.</p>



<p>We anticipate that the group will consist of a maximum of twelve individuals and will represent the three key stakeholders &ndash; funders, institutions/library consortia and publishers &ndash; in roughly equal proportions.</p>



<p>Once established, the working group is expected to convene up to six times. The key outcome from this collaborative effort will be the development of a model (or multiple models) that, if implemented, would enable equitable participation in knowledge sharing.</p>



<p>Interested parties should apply using the form available at <a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/MultiGroup">https://coalitions.typeform.com/MultiGroup</a>. <strong>Applications must be submitted by 25th August 2023.</strong></p>



<p>The organising committee will review the applications and strive to ensure a well-balanced representation of different stakeholders within the working group. Efforts will also be made to achieve a broad and diverse membership. The first meeting of the working group will be held by videoconferenceon Thursday, 14<sup>th</sup> September, from 14.00 BST to 15.30 BST.</p>



<h2><strong>Multi-stakeholder working group overarching aims</strong></h2>



<ol type="1"><li>To identify business models and arrangements that enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing</li><li>To consider how the &lsquo;per unit&rsquo; payment model (i.e. APCs) can be replaced by more equitable payment models</li><li>To explore how funds made available by research funders to support Open Access can be used to best support a non-APC publishing ecosystem</li><li>To address the possible unintended consequences of publishing funding streams being locked up in individual grants</li><li>To encourage Open Science practices</li></ol>



<h2><a></a><strong>Background: from Open Access to Equitable Participation</strong></h2>



<p>The OA movement aimed to provide equitable access to research outputs. The push to include the cost of publication in research budgets was intended to reduce the overall cost of access to published research.<a href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Twenty years on, what we see is that:</p>



<ul><li>APCs are established as the predominant OA business model in those countries /regions/ disciplines where this economic argument worked but also where they create barriers to participation for those with limited funds.</li><li>The rate of article growth is leading to ever-increasing costs for funders and research-intensive institutions.</li><li>The article embedded as the research output of value, blocking progress towards an Open Science ecosystem.</li></ul>



<p>Viewed through an economic lens, separating responsibility for choice (the researcher) from responsibility for payment (the librarian or funder) creates a dysfunctional system, as has been raised by funders, including Research England. Giving researchers responsibility for the budget to cover the cost of their publications on a &lsquo;publication-by-publication&rsquo; basis, at first sight, appears to address this problem. However, this approach overlooks the deeper incentive system at work while simultaneously negating the ability of libraries or funders to engage in collective negotiation on researchers&rsquo; behalf.</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>The incentives problem</strong></h2>



<p>We continue to operate in a world where:</p>



<ul><li>The majority of research outputs are not accessible, either because they are behind a paywall (in the case of articles) or because they are not shared (non-article outputs).</li><li>The research assessment and incentive systems rely on numbers: number of articles published and Journal Impact Factors (or journal names/&rsquo;prestige&rsquo;) in a hypercompetitive environment that rewards quantity and prestige (or falsely equates it with quality).</li></ul>



<p>These factors reinforce each other, leading to a self-perpetuating state in which the research community feels shackled and is resistant to change. The current model, firmly centred on the event of publication of an article&rsquo;s Version of Record (VoR) as the desired outcome of research and marker of scientific achievement, exacerbates this problem.</p>



<p>In this current system, the majority of scholarly publishers operate, in the words of Uli Dirnagl,<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> as &lsquo;an industry mining the currency of the academic reputation economy&rsquo; and, as such, &lsquo;a lifeline for those who want to keep the status quo.&rsquo; Publishers defend themselves from this criticism by positioning themselves to be in the service of the research community, unable to move until researchers change.</p>



<p>Of course, none of us is free of constraints and incentives: funders need to show that they have invested in worthwhile research; institutions need to generate funding income and need the prestige of researchers and research outputs to attract students; researchers need money, infrastructure and support networks to carry out research; all publishers need a revenue stream, submissions and stakeholder partnerships for sustainability and stewardship of the community&rsquo;s trust. And everyone in the system expects a salary and recognition in some form for work done.</p>



<h3><a></a><strong>What are we aiming for?</strong></h3>



<p>APCs have got us this far. They have usefully shown that OA is possible. But they create perverse incentives, administrative expenses, and burden for researchers, and they embed the article as the primary research artefact. Waivers are not a sustainable solution: researchers do not want to be viewed as &ldquo;charitable cases&rdquo; in need of funds.</p>



<p>At the same time, libraries unintentionally perpetuate this situation, with existing (decreasing) budgets predominantly going towards the largest publishers via &ldquo;transformative agreements&rdquo;, a model which locks in the APC/published unit payments and locks out those publishers trying to progress different (more equitable) OA business models.</p>



<p>So, if we weren&rsquo;t &lsquo;starting from here&rsquo;, how would we design a model, or models, to support born-digital Open Science?</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>What can research funders, publishers and libraries/consortia do to drive change?</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we outline what the three key stakeholders in scholarly communication &ndash; funders, publishers and institutions &ndash; can do to drive change and develop new publishing models and arrangements that are not based on per unit payment systems such as APCs.</p>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Research funders and research performing organisations</u></strong></h4>



<p>Although many research funders are providing financial support to cover publication costs for articles which arise from their funding, in many cases, this funding is held in the research budget.</p>



<p>However, if we are to move away from a per-unit business model &ndash; and empower institutions to negotiate arrangements which are non-APC based and have equity at their core &ndash; funders will need to explore how their funds can be made accessible to institutions (and not tied up in individual grants).</p>



<p>Research funders interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to taking the two steps outlined below and can demonstrate initiatives that they are already taking forward in support of all of these:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ensure that funds made available to cover publication fees are NOT allocated to individual research grants but instead are aggregated and directed to those who procure publishing services, typically the university library.</li><li>Incentivise Open Science behaviours in research dissemination in line with Open Science best practices and <a href="https://sfdora.org/read/">research assessment reform</a> by emphasising in the grant application process that all research outputs &ndash; preprints, articles, data, peer review reports, methods etc. &ndash; are valuable and will be recognised via the research assessment process.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Publishers</u></strong></h4>



<p>Publishers are another key stakeholder, as ultimately, it is in their gift to develop and implement new business models which are not based on APCs.</p>



<p>Publishers interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to supporting <strong>all </strong>the actions below and can demonstrate initiatives that they are already taking forward in support of all of these:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Developing financially transparent business models which are not based on &lsquo;per published unit&rsquo; payments (such as APCs) and which place equity at their core.</li><li>Supporting Open Science practices, for example, by enabling the publication of a wide variety of research outputs, including data, negative findings etc.</li><li>Reimagining quality assessment and peer review processes, for example, by supporting journal independent peer review.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong><u>Libraries/consortia</u></strong></h4>



<p>The third key stakeholder for this working group is libraries and library consortia. They are key players in negotiating fully OA publishing agreements and thus can play a critical role in supporting the move to non-APC based business models.</p>



<p>Libraries/consortia interested in applying to join this working group must be committed to taking the two steps outlined below and can demonstrate ways in which they are already working toward their implementation:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Allocate a growing portion of (aggregated) budgetary spend for OA business models, which are not based on a per published unit&rsquo; payments and which place global equity at their core.</li><li>Support and facilitate Open Science practices, for example, by encouraging the sharing/deposition of a wide range of research outputs.</li></ol>



<h4><a></a><strong>Potential questions for the group to consider</strong></h4>



<ul><li>What other stakeholder groups might need to be involved in the discussion?</li><li>What does an equitable business model look like?</li><li>How can each stakeholder group facilitate business models that move &ldquo;beyond the article&rdquo; and &ldquo;beyond APCs?&rdquo;</li><li>What are the costs to each stakeholder group of swimming against the current tide of an APC/article-based economy? What incentives are barriers to change?</li><li>What are the current financial flows? What would need to change in terms of processes to enable new agreements to work?</li></ul>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trick-snow-flies-survive-self-amputation">A grisly trick helps snow flies survive freezing: self-amputation</a></h4>

              
                <p>A few years ago, John Tuthill was trail running in the Cascade mountains in Washington state when he spotted something dark skittering across the snow.</p>



<p>It was about the size of a wild blueberry, with an elongated body and six legs that moved in a blur.</p>



<p>Tuthill was surprised to see an insect out and about on that cold October day. “I was kind of blown away that there was this animal out running around,” says Tuthill, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was a <em>Chionea</em> fly, he later learned. Also known as a snow fly, it could somehow walk around at temperatures well below what most other insects can tolerate.</p>





<p>Now, Tuthill and colleagues have shown that a grisly trick helps snow flies survive sub-zero conditions. When a leg begins to freeze, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.29.541388v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the insects can rapidly self-amputate it</a>, preventing ice crystals from creeping up into their bodies, the team reports in a paper posted online May 30 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Snow flies may drop one or more legs to prevent themselves from freezing. Even missing multiple limbs, one fly (shown here) can navigate over snow in the wild.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many animal species, including spiders, lizards and crabs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lizard-tail-detach-fall-off-structure-micropillar-nanopore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can drop a limb or tail</a> to escape a predator (<em>SN: 2/17/22</em>), but the new work is the first to show an animal using this life-saving measure in response to the cold, says Christine Miller, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The study describes “a new phenomenon that hadn’t been documented before and a very interesting species that we know very little about.”</p>



<p>Snow flies are a type of flightless crane fly, relatives of the “big, spindly, goofy-looking flies that you see bumbling around in your house,” Tuthill says. The insects, which can live up to two months, aren’t easy to study: They can’t be bred in the lab, and they’re tough to collect from the wild. Snow flies can live in alpine areas that are difficult for people to reach, where the threat of avalanche looms.</p>



<p>The best way to find them, Tuthill says, is to spend a lot of time wandering around, looking at snow. Backcountry skiing fit the bill. In an eight-hour trip, he says, “probably seven hours of that is walking slowly uphill.” From 2020 to 2022, he, his wife, and some friends and volunteers collected hundreds of snow flies, scooping them into plastic tubes they brought back or mailed to Tuthill’s lab. Most of the snow flies that arrived alive came from excursions in Washington.</p>



<p>Tuthill’s team used a thermal camera to record 77 snow flies as they walked on cold plates. The insects kept trekking even when their body temperature fell to an average of –7° Celsius, the researchers found. But more than half of the snow flies tested dropped at least one leg during the experiments.</p>



<p>A sharp-eyed research tech, Dominic Golding, noticed a temperature spike in the flies’ legs just before they fell off. That spike is a sign of ice formation, Tuthill says. Liquid water releases heat as it crystallizes into ice. Neurons in the leg may sense this temperature shift and trigger amputation, preventing the icy crystals from spreading, the team suggests. The flies “have about half a second to get rid of their leg before that wave of ice crashes into their body and then freezes all of their internal organs,” he says.</p>



<p>Snow flies didn’t lose their limbs when the researchers tugged on them — only in response to freezing.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A thermal camera can pick up the moment ice begins to form in a snow fly’s leg and track when the insect self-amputates it. Colors represent temperatures, shown from warmer (yellow) to colder (purple).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other animals have devised different strategies to fend off frost, says Katie Marshall, an entomologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. Some insects pump out antifreeze proteins; certain snails and frogs simply withstand ice forming in their bodies.</p>





<p>“The cool thing about snow flies is that they don’t actually follow either strategy,” says Marshall, who provided feedback on the team’s manuscript, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. They let ice form in their legs, she says, and “self-amputate to get rid of it, which is just completely strange to me.”</p>



<p>Snow flies that amputated their gelid limbs survived more than a minute longer than flies that didn’t, the team found. That extra time may not seem like much. But in the wild, when night is falling and the temperature is dropping and the insects are “looking furiously for a place to hunker down,” Tuthill says, it could be the difference between life and death.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-cosmic-dawn-julian-munoz-scientists-to-watch">Julian Muñoz has a ‘ruler’ that could size up the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Julian Muñoz has come up with a ruler to measure the early universe.</p>



<p>A theoretical physicist, Muñoz studies the distant, dim period in the universe’s history known as cosmic dawn. That’s when stars first began flickering on, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, infusing the universe with initial glimmers of starlight and forming the first galaxies.</p>



<p>Before the first stars, the universe was cold and dark — as Muñoz describes it, “boring.” Then, starlight began to reshape the universe. “It is a very dramatic epoch,” says Muñoz, of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>That epoch is also poorly understood. Cosmic dawn is so unexplored that Muñoz compares it to an uncharted area on early maps of Earth. There, Muñoz says, “there could be dragons.” By studying this era, he hopes to reveal the behavior of one dragon of the cosmos, dark matter, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed">inscrutable substance</a> whose mass binds galaxies.</p>



<p>But to understand the cosmos, scientists have to be able to measure it. Looking far into space means looking deep into the past. The trouble is our 2-D view of the sky doesn’t readily reveal how far away things are. “When we look at the night sky, we’ve got no depth perception,” says cosmologist Adrian Liu of McGill University in Montreal.</p>





<p>Scientists have devised a variety of methods to get a handle on distances, including standard candles and standard rulers — objects of known brightness or length. If you know how bright an object is (compared with how bright it appears) or you know how long a particular feature is on the sky (compared with its apparent length), you can tell how far away it is. A ruler looks smaller from 20 meters away than from 10 meters away, and a 20-watt lightbulb looks dimmer the farther away it is. The same applies over cosmic distances.</p>



<p>Scientists use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-one-way-explode-star">certain types of exploding stars</a>, for example, to estimate distances, because the blasts put out a predictable light show (<em>SN: 5/8/12</em>). Standard rulers or standard candles can be used to trace out how far away other objects of interest are and reveal how rapidly the universe has expanded over its history.</p>



<p>But none of the known standard objects reach back to the cosmic dawn era. That’s where Muñoz’s ruler comes in. “This ability to reach that far back,” Liu says, “that’s the really valuable thing.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sizing up cosmic dawn</h4>



<p>No one has ever seen a conclusive signature of cosmic dawn — the very first galaxies are too distant to observe directly. But there’s another way to spot cosmic dawn’s effects, one that’s been a long-sought target for astronomers. As the first stars formed, their light heated the surrounding hydrogen gas, causing it to absorb light with a wavelength of 21 centimeters, a number that results from the separation between energy levels in hydrogen atoms. Observing that 21-centimeter absorption signal is the aim of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, or HERA, collaboration, an effort that Muñoz and Liu both work on, using a radio telescope in South Africa.</p>



<p>If it can be detected, this absorption signal should have <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.131301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subtle, ring-shaped patterns imprinted in it</a>, Muñoz reported in 2019 in <em>Physical Review Letters.</em></p>

Regions with more absorption (red) correspond to denser pockets of stars, compared with sparsely populated regions with less absorption (blue). Sparse areas tend to be separated by distances of about half a billion light-years (arrow indicates one example); the same goes for dense areas.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125372">J.B. Muñoz</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Those patterns, the basis of his ruler, result from the differing behavior of dark matter and normal matter during an even earlier period, less than 400,000 years after the Big Bang. Sound waves careening through the plasma at that time would have pushed normal matter to high speeds while leaving dark matter at a standstill.</p>



<p>This mismatch in velocities affected where galaxies formed during the later cosmic dawn era. To create a galaxy, dark matter must gravitationally reel in normal matter. But where the velocities differed, the normal matter zipped right on by. The early universe was left with sparsely populated regions of the sky, arranged in ring-shaped patterns with a predictable distance scale. The rings, which are too subtle to pick out by eye from the data but show up in statistical analyses, have radii of half a billion light-years – that’s one long measuring stick.</p>



<p>The new standard ruler could reveal how fast the universe was expanding back then. That information can tell scientists what that youthful universe was made of, revealing the amount of dark matter, normal matter and dark energy, another hidden piece of the cosmic puzzle.</p>





<p>A new expansion measurement could also add fuel to one of the fiercest debates in cosmology. Currently, different measurements of the universe’s expansion rate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">clash with one another</a>, leaving scientists pondering whether there are flaws in our understanding of the cosmos.</p>



<p>Seeking to understand the unknown, including these shadowy cosmic realms, is “an integral component of human nature — like art and poetry,” Muñoz says. “You could live without it, but I really hope you don’t have to.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Looking into dark corners</h4>



<p>Muñoz’s interest in dark matter drew him to the cosmic dawn. The first galaxies grew off a scaffold of dark matter. So information about how and when those galaxies formed can reveal dark matter’s properties. In a report published in 2018 in <em>Nature</em>, for example, Muñoz and colleagues suggested that, if some of the universe’s dark matter had a tiny electric charge, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0151-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a millionth of an electron’s</a>, that could alter the expected cosmic dawn signal.</p>



<p>He has also developed important computational tools, like a new technique that allows for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/523/2/2587/7174391?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lightning-fast simulations</a> of the cosmic dawn, reported in May in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. The time it takes to perform these simulations has previously limited what scientists can study.</p>



<p>“He’s got an eye for interesting ideas,” says theoretical physicist Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, Muñoz’s Ph.D. adviser. But the cosmic ruler, “that’s probably the most singular idea that he’s had.”</p>



<p>Becoming a physicist, in itself, was uncharted territory for Muñoz. As a child, he liked science. He recalls being amazed by fossilized shark teeth that were millions of years old — perhaps his first experience grappling with such grand timescales.</p>



<p>But Muñoz didn’t have a scientific role model; his parents didn’t finish high school. He focused his attention on video games and coding until a high school physics teacher encouraged his scientific streak. He turned to physics, he says, where “it was possible to channel all this nerdy energy for knowledge.” That’s what drives Muñoz to explore the questions that swirl around dark corners of the cosmos. “I do it because I think the answers enrich the human experience.”</p>
