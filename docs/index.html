<p>A paper that purported to find vitamin D could reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms has been retracted from <em>PLOS ONE</em>, four years after the journal issued an expression of concern about the research.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239799">Vitamin D sufficiency, a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL reduced risk for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection</a>,” appeared online September 25, 2020. <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/profile/michael-holick/">Michael F. Holick</a>, a professor of medicine at Boston University and a proponent of the use of vitamin D, was the last author among a group of other researchers from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after publication, the paper gained traction on platforms like Twitter (now X) as evidence vitamin D could treat COVID-19 symptoms.</p>



<p>Amidst this discussion, <a href="https://lnu.se/en/staff/nicholas.brown/">Nick Brown</a>, a science integrity researcher at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EqWov8kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, a research fellow at the University of Wollongong, Australia, pointed out potential flaws with the work, including the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7178D75E4C63D6FA7BC68F914861E0">small sample size</a> of the study and a <a href="https://x.com/sTeamTraen/status/1310997416305451010">lack of patient information</a> such as how the patients died.</p>



<span id="more-129477"></span>



<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> posted an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240965">expression of concern</a> for the article on October 14, 2020. According to the notice, “concerns were raised about the validity of results and conclusions reported in the article and about undisclosed competing interests.” The expression of concern also noted “statements in the article, including in its title and conclusions, that suggest a causal relationship between vitamin D levels and the clinical outcome of COVID-19 infections which is not supported by the data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The competing interests refer to Holick’s “non-financial interests based on his vitamin D research and other activities focused on vitamin D; contributions to an app that tracks vitamin D; and interests that include consultancies, funding support, and authorship of books related to vitamin D usage.” In 2018, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/business/vitamin-d-michael-holick.html">the <em>New York Times</em> reported</a> on Holick’s financial ties to the vitamin D industry.</p>



<p>“This project did not receive any grants. Prof. Holick did not have any funding support for this project,” Mohammad Ali Sahraian, the paper’s corresponding author, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the competing interests, Holick said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The app dminder.info is free. I do not derive any income from it. I am no longer a consultant for Quest Diagnostics and therefore it was not listed. I do not receive any book royalties related to any information that is in this publication. I do not have any conflict of interest regarding any aspect of the study design, the results, or conclusions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 189 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, with the bulk of citations coming after the expression of concern.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On June 6, nearly four years later, <em>PLOS</em> <em>ONE </em>retracted the study. A statistical reviewer and members of the <em>PLOS ONE</em> Editorial Board found that the study design was inadequate to address the research question and the methods used were not detailed enough to reproduce the study, according to the retraction notice. “As such, we have concluded that the article’s conclusions are not supported by the reported data,” the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305303">notice</a> said.</p>



<p>Sahraian said he and his colleagues were “very surprised” and “upset” by the retraction, which should “not be decided without any ethical problem.”</p>



<p>“It would have been preferable for these issues to have been identified and addressed during the pre-publication review process, rather than after the work had already been made public,” Sahraian told Retraction Watch. “However, we did not claim a causal role of vitamin D in the clinical outcome of COVID-19 infections. The current study was cross-sectional and only considered the association between COVID-19 and circulating vitamin D levels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holick, Saharian, and the paper’s first author do not agree with the retraction, while others could not be reached, the notice states. Sahraian said they don’t agree because they provided detailed responses to the editorial board’s concerns on multiple occasions, but did not receive any response from the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I believe it is unfair, unethical, and inhumane to retract an article due solely to the faults of the editorial team rather than addressing the flaws inherent to the study itself,” he said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-knutson-61513910/">David Knutson</a>, head of communications at <em>PLOS</em>,<em> </em>said, “the authors’ comment that the communications in this case were one-sided, and the implication that our editorial decision was biased, are not true.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>PLOS</em> completed an objective evaluation and communicated with the authors on multiple occasions, Knutston said.&nbsp; He acknowledged a “long gap in our communications with the authors between March 2021 and December 2023” and apologized for one instance in which <em>PLOS</em> did not update an author following their query about the retraction decision.</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz said he has mixed feelings about this retraction. “It is to the credit of the editorial team that they even bothered to investigate, and retracting on the basis of low quality &#8211; rather than misconduct or similar &#8211; shows a commitment to integrity that few journals display,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But retracting it “at this point will have no impact whatsoever on the pollution of the literature &#8211; the damage has well and truly been done. I think that the <em>PLOS</em> <em>ONE </em>editorial team should explain exactly why it took an entire pandemic&#8217;s worth of time to come to a decision, given that the issues they cite as reasons to retract are the same ones I pointed out on Twitter in September 2020,” Meyerowitz-Katz said.</p>



<p>Brown said it would have been better if the retraction “didn’t take quite so long,” but given the expression of concern was issued rapidly, “I think the journal handled it overall fairly well.”</p>



<p><em>PLOS ONE </em>cited an <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-publication-ethics-a-frank-discussion-on-handling-difficult-cases/">ethics case backlog</a> for their slowness in retracting this paper, among other papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knutson told us the case was “complex,” and the four year time period “reflects the time we required to complete a rigorous assessment and investigation,” as well as “some internal delays due to competing priorities.” He said:</p>



<p>Given the complexity of this case, the nature of the concerns, and potential clinical implications of the article and the concerns raised, we published an interim Expression of Concern soon after the concerns were raised to our attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knutson said the competing interests mentioned in the expression of concern did not play a part in the retraction of the paper. “The retraction decision was based on concerns about the study design, methodological reporting, and the reliability of the article’s conclusions,” he said.</p>

Do it. Take a moment and think about it.</p><p>Those who do not need to imagine are the 55 million people living with Alzheimer’s and the 10 million living with Parkinson’s, respectively, as they experience similar challenges every day. While these figures raise concern, future projections are alarming: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(18)30295-3/fulltext">by 2050, the number of cases is expected to double in high-income countries and triple in low/middle-income countries</a>. Things are particularly bleak in the latter, as they account for 60% of the cases but less than 25% of global investment in research, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</p><p>With growing patient-per-clinic ratios and soaring inequities across the globe, how will we detect these diseases early and massively enough for timely intervention? What solutions could balance the scales of brain health worldwide? An unsuspected answer involves combining natural speech and artificial intelligence. Yes, this sounds like another flight of imagination, but it all rests on solid science.</p><div><blockquote>Note that these diseases are incurable. Rapid and mass detection is our best alternative; and this is precisely where the need for innovation emerges.</blockquote></div><h2>Tracking diseases</h2><p>Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by progressive atrophy of distinct brain regions. Alzheimer’s usually begins with neuron degeneration in the hippocampus and temporal lobe, affecting memory and several other abilities. In Parkinson’s, neuronal degradation begins in the basal ganglia, leading to motor and cognitive difficulties. Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg. For patients, these diseases are disabling and often fatal. For families, they undermine emotional stability, financial solvency, and quality of life. For governments, they challenge health systems’ infrastructure and finances. Thus, these conditions project from the brain onto society, tracing a devastating trajectory.</p><p>That is why timely detection is crucial. Early diagnosis can mitigate the impact of symptoms, reduce their emotional burden on patients and caregivers, increase time to plan neuroprotective habits, and reduce costs by favoring routine over emergency care. Note that these diseases are incurable. Rapid and mass detection is our best alternative; and this is precisely where the need for innovation emerges.</p><p>Today, diagnosis rests on interviews with specialists, extensive paper-and-pencil tests, and, when conditions allow, brain MRI studies and biomarker assessments. These procedures are invaluable, but imperfect. Many countries lack enough qualified personnel and appropriate technology (and when these resources exist, their costs can be prohibitive). Furthermore, outcomes depend on the judgments of examiners, who vary in training and experience. Moreover, assessments are usually stressful and appointments take weeks or months. Worse yet, these limitations are exacerbated as patient numbers increase and socioeconomic disparities between countries deepen. An urgent need thus arises for new affordable, user-friendly, scalable, and immediate approaches.</p><h2>Red flags in speech</h2><p>This is where digital speech biomarkers come into play. Suppose that Tom, who is pushing 70, has been showing signs of cognitive decline and you suspect he might be suffering from Alzheimer’s. What if you asked him to recount a memory and an app detected traces of the disease in his speech? This non-invasive, low-cost approach offers real-time results without the need to visit a clinic, sparking great enthusiasm. Yet, how exactly does it work?</p><p>The key is that when we speak, we engage multiple brain regions that are affected by these diseases. Some, such as the hippocampus and the temporal lobe, are involved in accessing words as discourse unfolds; others, like the basal ganglia, coordinate the physical movements during speech production. So, if such regions were atrophied, one would expect alterations in the types of words used, their articulation, or other relevant aspects. By testing specific linguistic dimensions, we can uncover the integrity or dysfunction of those brain areas.</p><p>The first step is to record the natural speech of individuals with and without a given disease (the more, the better). Subsequently, complex algorithms quantify multiple aspects of the recording (say, speech rhythm) and its transcription (say, word properties). These metrics are used to train computational models that learn the typical speech characteristics of diagnosed individuals and healthy ones. Once the model is trained, it is presented with acoustic and linguistic measures from Tom, and, essentially, queried with this question: “Model, based on what you’ve learned, does Tom have the disease or not?”</p><p>In a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13472">recent study</a>, our team identified Alzheimer’s disease with nearly 90% success via word property analysis. The model learned that patients, compared to their healthy peers, use words with higher frequency (‘doctor’ rather than ‘physician’), lower specificity (‘dog’ instead of ‘poodle’), and more common sound sequences (like ‘bat’, which resembles ‘cat’, ‘fat’, ‘mat’, ‘rat’, ‘bet’, ‘bit’, ‘bought’, ‘boot’, ‘bad’, ‘bag’, and ‘ban’; as opposed to ‘giraffe’, whose sound sequence is quite unique). Indeed, these lexical properties predicted the patients’ level of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. The reason is quite simple: word selection is a central function of semantic memory, which becomes impaired since the onset of temporo-hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer’s. When navigating semantic memory, people with the disease prioritize the most accessible parts of their vocabulary, consisting of frequent, unspecific, and common-sounds words. And the more severe their disorder is, the simpler the words they favor.</p><p>In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.28751">another study</a>, we detected Parkinson’s disease with over 90% accuracy by measuring motor aspects of speech. We found that patients, compared to healthy individuals, leave longer pauses between words and produce less recognizable sounds. These patterns even differentiated between disease variants. Once again, the finding is clear. Speech production requires coordinating movements of the tongue, lips, and vocal cords, among other organs. Since basal ganglia atrophy affects motor skills, these actions in people with Parkinson’s prove slow, shaky, and imprecise. The audio signal carries traces of these alterations.</p><p>The breakthroughs do not stop there. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33294808/">These methods can anticipate who will develop specific conditions in the future</a>. Some studies also suggest that they outperform standard tests in estimating disease severity and discriminating between syndromes. The approach has been validated with data acquired in hospitals and over the phone, incorporated in clinical trials, and harnessed by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-023-02240-z">user-friendly apps</a>. These are critical milestones towards rethinking clinical assessments.</p><div><blockquote>The breakthroughs do not stop there. These methods can anticipate who will develop specific conditions in the future.</blockquote></div><h2>A story in the making </h2><p>For all its promise, this story is only beginning. The approach requires more validation, especially in large groups of patients. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/146/12/4870/7231969?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">New studies should focus on vulnerable populations</a> to balance the abundant data coming from high-income countries. More generally, a digital medical culture must be cultivated for clinicians to incorporate computational tools. Of course, these milestones demand concerted efforts of scientists, medical professionals, patients, family members, companies, and policymakers. None of this is easy or immediate. The path from science to clinical practice and public policy is long, crooked, and uphill.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not an isolated endeavor. Various teams are working on other digital tools for disease detection, including eye-tracking devices, motion sensors, and gamified cognitive tests. Speech analysis is part of a vast movement pushing for clinical equity through technological innovations.</p><p>To conclude, imagine that we can detect these diseases before Tom shows symptoms of decline. Imagine doing so by reducing the social gaps among world nations. And imagine a future where all this needs no longer be imagined. If such a day ever arrives, it will be through disruptions like this.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/users/tungart7-38741244/">TungArt7</a> via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/illustrations/doctor-writing-medicine-hand-8733826/">Pixabay</a>. </sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/899965244/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/899965244/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f06%2fBRAINJ-Garcia-blog-post-image-AI-speech-and-language-assessment-models-1-480x185.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/06/better-together-coupling-up-to-watch-tv-and-talk-synchronizes-brain-waves/">Better together: coupling up to watch TV and talk synchronizes brain waves</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/06/behind-the-scenes-what-its-like-to-be-a-junior-author-for-the-ohcm/">Behind the scenes: what it&#8217;s like to be a junior author for the OHCM</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/the-hidden-toll-of-war/">The hidden toll of war</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                It’s a question of when, not if, highly effective treatments become available, says the CEO of Alzheimer’s Research UK. But that doesn’t solve the problem of one-third of dementia patients still going undiagnosed.

<p>Ranga Dias, the physics researcher whose work on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00716-2">room-temperature superconductors</a> has been retracted after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/room-temperature-superconductor-retract-journal-nature-e554536a">coauthors raised concerns</a> about the data, has lost another paper for the same reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This retraction brings Dias’ total to five, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dDias%252c%2bRanga%2bP">by our count</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Rochester in New York, where <a href="https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/people/faculty/dias-ranga/index.html">Dias</a> is an assistant professor, is investigating his work, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/another-retraction-looms-embattled-physicist-behind-blockbuster-superconductivity"><em>Science</em> has reported</a>. Washington State University, where Dias obtained his PhD, is also investigating <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/plagiarism-allegations-pursue-physicist-behind-stunning-superconductivity-claims">allegations of plagiarism</a> in his thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dias has not responded to our request for comment about his latest retraction, of a 2021 paper in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> titled “<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.117003">Synthesis of Yttrium Superhydride Superconductor with a Transition Temperature up to 262 K by Catalytic Hydrogenation at High Pressures</a>.” The article has been cited 178 times, according to information presented on its abstract page. </p>



<p>In December, the journal published an <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.239902">expression of concern</a> for the paper, stating it was investigating concerns “regarding the origins and integrity of the transport data” in several of the paper’s figures “with the cooperation of the authors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On June 13, the journal retracted the paper. The <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.249901">notice</a> states: </p>



<span id="more-129463"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, a majority of the co-authors of this study raised concerns about the origins of the superconductivity in this study as presented in Fig. 1C, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. S10B, Fig. S13, and sections of Table S1. These figures and the table were provided solely by Ranga P. Dias. After the origin of the data for these figures and the table was put into question, Physical Review Letters published an Expression of Concern.</p>



<p>After repeated attempts to locate the raw data and obtain an authoritative account of its origins, Physical Review Letters concurs that the article is not supported by its data and that it needs to be retracted. Ranga P. Dias stands by the data in the aforementioned figures and table, and does not agree to retract the paper. The remaining authors regret any confusion or inconvenience caused to the scientific community.</p>

<p>Daniel Ucko, head of ethics and research integrity for the American Physical Society, which publishes the journal, told us the society had “no information to add” to the published notices. </p>

Watching the same movie stimulates similar neural activity across brains: a phenomenon referred to as inter-subject correlation. Subjects sitting in the same room and talking over the content have been shown to increase various other measures of brain synchrony.</p><p>Now it turns out that we don’t even need to be discussing what’s on the screen to get more in tune with each other during the next show.</p><p>Lead author Dr. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/member/sd2035/">Sara De Felice</a>, Professor Antonia Hamilton, and other colleagues at University College London used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain activity in 27 pairs of adults as they each watched two different episodes of the short <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b00xgpj9/dipdap?page=1">BBC children’s cartoon <em>Dipdap</em></a>. In between the episodes, the subjects talked over trivial facts unrelated to the show, such as exotic animals and musical instruments. The researchers then compared the data on brain activity recorded during each episode to see if the non-relevant chatter had affected mental synchrony.</p><p>Their <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/oons/article/doi/10.1093/oons/kvae006/7634764?login=false">results</a>, published in <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/oons">Oxford Open Neuroscience</a></em>, showed increased brain synchrony over the right dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC) and right superior parietal lobe (SPL) in familiar pairs (housemates, friends, or partners) watching the cartoon together compared to pseudo pairs who had not met, and who watched the short film alone. These results are in&nbsp;line with previous studies into&nbsp;these brain regions which indicate that the DLPFC is associated with functions like working memory, abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility while the SPL receives significant visual input, and is also associated with reasoning and memory, as well as attention.</p><p>The study also found that co-watching <em>after&nbsp;</em>a conversation was associated with greater brain synchrony over the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ)–an area of the brain famous for allowing other perspectives (theory of mind)–compared to co-watching before a conversation. This effect was significantly higher in familiar pairs engaging in conversation with each other than in&nbsp;pseudo pairs who talked to someone else.</p><p>“Two things are surprising and novel here,” says Dr. De Felice (now at the University of Cambridge). &#8220;First, having a chat resulted in brains also synchronising&nbsp;afterwards. Second, the chat didn’t have to be related to the movie to see this effect.”</p><h2>Brain games</h2><p>The scientists selected&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/16/4/345/6126231">fNIRS</a> for this research as it uses light to map blood flow in response to neural activity at sites across the head, allowing the study of natural face-to-face interactions because subjects aren’t&nbsp;physically confined in a noisy fMRI machine.</p><p>“fNIRS is non-invasive and robust to movement, allowing the measurement of brain activity from people as they act and interact normally,” says Dr. De Felice. On the downside, its lag time of around five seconds makes it much less spatially and temporally accurate than other techniques.</p><p>The researchers found no significant differences in the other five brain regions selected for measurement.</p><p>&#8220;Brain synchrony was observed in three areas (the DLPFC, SPL, and TPJ) which play a key role in our ability to interact with others, understand intentions and emotions, and interpret other people’s perspectives,” explains Dr. De Felice. “It makes sense that we observe synchrony over these areas during co-watching of the BBC <em>Dipdap</em> cartoon, where the watcher is encouraged to follow and predict what the puppet will face next.”</p><p>She suggests the findings, along with those from&nbsp;numerous other studies, could indicate&nbsp;that brain synchrony extends to and from further behaviours: “This might explain why people who spend considerable time together often find themselves in greater agreement with each other than with those they’ve never met. Through such interactions, individuals can develop a shared reality, both physically and mentally.”</p><p>The next challenge is to better explore the causal relationship between synchrony and social interaction, examining if altering this synchrony using brain stimulation would alter the parameters of interaction, she says.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@sarandywestfall_photo">Sarandy Westfall</a> via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/couple-sitting-on-sofa-beside-dog-inside-room--itLKdE7ojA">Unsplash</a>. </sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/899818373/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/899818373/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f06%2fsarandy-westfall-itLKdE7ojA-unsplash-1260485-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/state-supported-covid-19-nudges-only-really-worked-on-the-young/">State supported Covid-19 nudges only really worked on the young</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/05/mental-disorder-or-something-magical/">Mental disorder or something magical?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/a-sand-county-almanac-at-75-the-evolution-of-the-land-ethic/">A Sand County Almanac at 75: the evolution of the land ethic</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>While presenting a paper in journal club, neurology resident at Baylor College of Medicine, <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/peter-campbell-83231">Peter Campbell</a>, noticed a potential problem. Two infants in a 2018 paper were reported to have died, but their data also appeared in a follow-up study published two years later with no mention of them being deceased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is unclear how a patient who reportedly died could be available for follow-up at 2 years,” he wrote in an email reporting his concerns to Frontiers, the publisher of the articles. The email, sent in April, went unanswered. </p>



<span id="more-129406"></span>



<p>“<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00086/full">Raised Plasma Neurofilament Light Protein Levels Are Associated with Abnormal MRI Outcomes in Newborns Undergoing Therapeutic Hypothermia</a>,” and its 2020 follow-up, “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.562510/full">Raised Plasma Neurofilament Light Protein Levels After Rewarming Are Associated With Adverse Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Newborns After Therapeutic Hypothermia</a>,” have four of the same authors, including lead author Divyen Shah, researcher at Queen Mary University of London. Both appeared in <em>Frontiers in Neurology.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The 2018 paper has been cited 22 times and the 2020 paper eight times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The data in question concerns patients 1 and 3 from <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/310895/fneur-09-00086-HTML/image_m/fneur-09-00086-t002.jpg">table 2</a> of the 2018 paper, who are labeled as having died. Yet their data matches those of participants 4 and 2 in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/562510/fneur-11-562510-HTML/image_m/fneur-11-562510-t003.jpg">table 3</a> of the 2020 paper as “babies with cerebral palsy,” without any indication of death.&nbsp; The data from the second study were purportedly collected after the children were 18 months old.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/irene.litvan">Irene Litvan</a>, editor-in-chief of the journal, told Retraction Watch she was “not made aware of this matter” but that the research integrity team at Frontiers is investigating the issue after receiving Campbell’s email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from the publisher confirmed “we are actively checking the discrepancy brought to our attention by Dr Campbell.”</p>



<p>Shah defended the data.&nbsp; The two children died “later after developing cerebral palsy” and were therefore represented in both studies, he told us in an email. “We have neurodevelopment outcomes for them although they later died,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Campbell was unsatisfied with that explanation: “Is it reasonable to say in a first paper that the children died and then in the next simply say they had poor developmental outcomes? That seems strange.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors should have included more information about the deaths of the patients, and “been more clear,” he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a second email to Retraction Watch, Shah clarified that patient 1 died “after 2 years of age with severe global cerebral palsy” and patient 3 died “at 19 months of age with again the most sever [sic] global impairment and cerebral palsy.” The patients were recruited “between January 2014 and January 2016,” he said, so when the 2018 paper was written, “we already had information about later outcomes for some of these children.”</p>

Although she had declined to write for the 2023 update, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128021040000330">her chapter</a> was still in the book, under a different author’s name.</p>



<p>“When I first saw this, it was like somebody hit me on the head with a hammer and everything that I&#8217;d worked for all my life was put into question,” Vandebroek, an ethnobotanist and senior research fellow at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Kingston, Jamaica, told Retraction Watch. “This shakes my foundation of what I think science should stand for.”</p>



<p>The situation arose when one of the textbook’s editors, <a href="https://uwischolar.sta.uwi.edu/scholar/d11c7a3e-296a-3254-99e8-574b09737e90">Simone Ann Marie Badal</a>, a researcher at UWI, asked if Vandebroek wanted to revise her chapter for the new edition. Vandebroek declined, assuming her chapter would be omitted from the book.</p>



<span id="more-129446"></span>



<p>But the chapter, “Ethical aspects of working with local communities and their biological resources,” not only remained in the book, this time the author is listed as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443186578000128">S. Badal</a>. The new chapter is identical to the original, except for two added sentences from Badal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April, Vandebroek sent a cease and desist letter to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andregwolff/">André G. Wolff</a>, a publisher for Elsevier, alerting him of the issue and requesting the company stop “distributing and selling copies of the textbook that contain the plagiarized chapter and take appropriate steps to collect and destroy all physical and digital copies that have been distributed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In emails seen by Retraction Watch, Wolff acknowledged “this credit line does not reflect appropriately the chapter authorship. We have placed a correction request to rectify the issue.” He also said “miscredited chapter authorship” occurred in other chapters and he would communicate with the affected authors about the corrections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six other chapters mention Badal as a co-author, and three list her as the sole author, including Vandebroek&#8217;s contribution. In the original 2017 book, the chapter “Waxes” was written by W.F. Tinto, T.O. Elufioye, and J. Roach, and the chapter “Evolutionary Perspectives on Plant Secondary Metabolites” was written by R. Delgoda and J.E. Murray. Both chapters in the 2023 version credit only S. Badal. Of the 34 chapters, many new author names appear under chapters previously attributed to other researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Badal said Vandebroek’s signed agreement stipulated ownership of the material transfers to the publisher of the book:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When asked to revise her chapter for the second edition, the author refused and I therefore I undertook [sic] this task. After the book was published, the author contacted the Publisher regarding the crediting of authors. The Publisher&#8217;s representative from Elsevier clarified that the chapter formatting credited current authors at the top of the chapter and acknowledged prior authors in footnotes. Although not required to do so, the Publisher apologised to the author and promised to make the relevant and appropriate edits.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Several chapter authors declined to revise their chapter for the second edition of the book and these chapters were reviewed, and in some cases updated by the volume editor. An error in the production process resulted in the original author names being replaced by the volume editor. This was a production error and not the responsibility of the volume editor and these errors are in the process of being corrected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corrections will credit the original authors along with the revising author as appropriate, the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vandebroek objected to this correction, telling Wolff that Elsevier’s failure to attribute the work solely to her “misleads readers and constitutes a clear assault on [her] reputation.” Wolff’s last response, in May, said the publisher would revert authorship entirely back to her, effective in print and electronic books, in the next two months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, he said, the contributor agreement Vandebroek signed puts Elsevier “under no obligation” to ask authors to participate in any subsequent editions of the Work, and may use all or any of their contribution in further revisions and/or editions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vandebroek said she worries the stipulations of the contributor agreement leave future editions vulnerable to the same situation. Non-participating authors will be credited in subsequent editions to reflect their contribution, a spokesperson for Elsevier said.</p>



<p>“Should we scientists now hire legal representation from our own pocket every time we want to publish to make sure our rights will not be trampled on?” she said. “I just want this to stop. This is damaging, exhausting, demotivating, and corrupt.”</p>

<p>Women often experience acts of obstetric violence or mistreatment during labor and delivery. Conflicts and crises add new challenges to vulnerable health systems, disrupting emergency as well as maternal health services. These occurrences may further deteriorate maternal care, thereby contributing to increased mortality and morbidity. Person-centered maternity care (PCMC), defined as care that is respectful and responsive to women’s needs and preferences on clinical decisions is increasingly regarded as an essential component of healthcare during childbirth at the global level and a vital factor in reducing maternal mortality.</p>
<p>PCMC becomes vital in humanitarian settings, where conflict and displacement pose additional challenges to delivering respectful and responsive maternity care. However, evidence of its implementation and effectiveness in refugee camps remains scarce.</p>
<p>The authors of this study explored Sudanese refugee women&#8217;s experiences of PCMC in Chad&#8217;s refugee camps, offering valuable insights into the practices that support or hinder respectful maternity care in these challenging environments. With facility assessments and additional interviews with trained and assistant midwives as well as birth attendants, the researchers aimed to align the providers&#8217; and patients&#8217; perspectives on PCMC and determine the capacity of the maternities serving refugee camps to provide PCMC. Whilst many women reported positive experiences with maternity care providers, challenges such as insufficient staffing, language barriers, and physical constraints of the health facilities occasionally led to feelings of neglect or disrespect. Overall, these findings indicate that PCMC can be effectively provided in refugee settings but targeted action needs to be implemented to ensure all women receive high-quality care. This study contributes to our understanding of PCMC in refugee settings and demonstrates the need for systemic changes to address resource shortages, improve training for healthcare providers on PCMC and ensure respectful and supportive care.</p>

<p>Hypertension is a main preventable risk factor for all-cause mortality and one of the most important modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Self-measured blood pressure monitoring (SMBP or home blood pressure monitoring) has been shown to improve hypertension control.</p>
<p>In addition to facing well-known disparities in hypertension management as other minorities and medically underserved communities, resettled Iraqi and Syrian refugees have been listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a high-risk population for hypertension. This qualitative investigation aimed to enhance our understanding of SMBP monitoring among Arab American refugees and inform future interventions targeting hypertension control within these communities.</p>
<p>By interviewing a large sample of refugees, these researchers identified key barriers and facilitators to SMBP, such as the lack of access to home blood pressure monitors or the hesitancy in using public devices, as well as the pivotal, positive role of family support.</p>
<p>Interestingly, factors such as poor hypertension literacy, cultural stigma of illness, and anxiety about poor health significantly influenced SMBP practices within this community, thereby underscoring the need for tailored interventions that address both socioeconomic and cultural determinants. Based on these findings, improving patient education and supporting self-management of hypertension become imperative objectives of any hypertension intervention for this refugee community.</p>
<p>Lessons from this study are transferable to other minoritized communities and highlight the importance of understanding the culture of minoritized communities to improve healthcare delivery and clinical practice.</p>

<p>Reliable health monitoring and determination of disease estimates in refugee centers are hindered by missing data to capture the population at risk, an issue generally known in health services research as the &#8220;denominator problem&#8221;. The detrimental effects of the denominator problem are particularly evident in refugee settings epidemiology due to the high mobility and fluctuating dynamics of populations residing there, leading to potential bias in measures of illness and health care utilization.</p>
<p>This study proposes an empirical approach to estimate disease frequency in refugee camps with fragmented health and occupancy data. The researchers utilized individual-level patient data from primary care surveillance systems and matched these with aggregated occupancy data from German refugee centers. This innovative method enabled the analysis of relationships between occupancy, patient numbers, and disease incidence, which, in turn, could be used to predict the ratio between patients and total occupancy and disease incidence when only occupancy information was available.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this research offers a potential solution to the denominator problem in refugee health research and presents significant implications for health needs assessment, health service planning, and surveillance in refugee settings.</p>
<p>By enabling more accurate prediction models and estimates of disease frequency, this method can improve health systems&#8217; ability to quantify needs, plan services and detect infectious disease transmission among highly mobile populations.</p>

<p>Arabic-speaking refugees or immigrants resettled in Canada report poorer mental health compared to refugees or immigrants from other regions e.g. Latin America or US.</p>
<p>Particular emphasis needs to be given to the mental health of refugee or immigrant children and adolescents, as migration stressors mark a critical period in their development and are known to be related to depression, anxiety, and elevated symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Remarkably, however, evidence shows that newcomer children and youth consistently underuse mental health services compared to Canadian-born peers with comparable mental health status.</p>
<p>This qualitative analysis of the perspectives of providers identifies barriers and examines opportunities to improve mental health care for Arabic-speaking newcomer children and families.</p>
<p>Lack of resources, cultural misunderstandings, staff shortages, lack of mental health knowledge or cultural competency contribute to mental health services inadequacy. At the individual or family level, mental health literacy, prioritized settlement needs, stigma, and fear of repercussions for disclosing a mental health concern are found to be major impediments to help-seeking, ultimately, leading to underutilization of mental health services among newcomer families. While barriers at the level of systems, providers, individuals, and families create disparities in access and quality of mental health care for children and families of newcomers, service providers have advocated for a shift to culturally competent, integrated, collaborative, and community-based models of care to increase accessibility, reduce stigma and mistrust, and promote the well-being and resilience of new Canadians.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996?via%3Dihub">March 2020 paper</a> that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/19/french-hydroxychloroquine-study-has-major-methodological-shortcomings-and-is-fully-irresponsible-says-review-but-is-not-being-retracted/">helped spur the discredited claim</a> hydroxychloroquine could treat COVID-19 is under investigation – again – after some of its authors asked to take their names off the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead author, retired researcher Didier Raoult, has 12 retractions, according to <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dRaoult%252c%2bDidier">The Retraction Watch Database</a>. Those retractions involved <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/08/journals-retract-six-didier-raoult-papers-for-ethics-violations/">violations of ethics rules</a>. Journals are <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/embattled-researcher-didier-raoult-earns-dozens-more-expressions-of-concern-and-another-retraction/">investigating</a> many other articles by Raoult and his colleagues, including <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2023/05/29/covid-19-didier-raoult-s-questionable-methodology-once-again-under-fire_6028408_10.html">their work</a> on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID. </p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996?via%3Dihub">Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial</a>,” was published in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-antimicrobial-agents"><em>International Journal for Antimicrobial Agents</em></a><em>.</em> It has been cited more than 3,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129441"></span>



<p>Soon after publication, critics pointed out <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/06/hydroxychlorine-covid-19-study-did-not-meet-publishing-societys-expected-standard/">flaws in the article</a>. The journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920302260#bib0059">commissioned a review</a>, in which <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/frits-rosendaal">Frits Rosendaal</a>, of Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands, called the researchers “fully irresponsible” for presenting flawed information “coupled with the potentially serious side-effects of hydroxychloroquine.” In an <a href="https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement">official statement</a>, The International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC), which co-owns the journal with Elsevier, said in April 2020 that the article “does not meet the Society’s expected standard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, the journal did not retract the paper. In an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092485792030251X">editorial</a> published along with the critical reviews, ISAC leadership wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We believe, in addition to the importance of sharing observational data at the height of a pandemic, a robust public scientific debate about the paper&#8217;s findings in an open and transparent fashion should be made available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A group of scientists again called for its retraction in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Costagliola-et-al.pdf">June 3 email sent to Elsevier</a> and seen by Retraction Watch. Despite ISAC’s April 2020 statement of concern, “nothing happened during the last four years, which seems unusually long to us,” the scientists wrote. In addition, three of the authors told the group they had asked for their names to be removed from the paper at the end of 2023, the group wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Elsevier responded to the group’s email three days later, confirming three of the authors had asked to take their names off the paper “on the grounds of their having concerns about the article of a methodological nature.” The representative told us they “can’t divulge” which authors made the request, or when they did so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The representative also stated that the journal was re-opening the previously closed investigation after receiving the authors’ requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raoult has not responded to our emails seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fabrice Frank, one of the email’s authors and retired independent researcher, told us at least two of the authors had been added “without their consent and without knowing it.” The authors asked to remain anonymous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lonni Besançon, a researcher at Linköping University in Linköping, Sweden, called the fact the article remains available “unacceptable,” adding: “All of the concerns were raised years ago and the paper is clearly responsible” for a waste of scientific efforts, money, and time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besançon and Frank have <a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4">raised concerns</a> about other papers by authors affiliated with the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection (IHU-MI) in Marseille, France, where Raoult was the former director. Nearly all of the authors of the March 2020 paper have ties to IHU-MI.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/01/elsevier-investigating-articles-linked-to-controversial-french-researcher/">Elsevier is investigating</a> some of these claims, and has issued more than 100 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/embattled-researcher-didier-raoult-earns-dozens-more-expressions-of-concern-and-another-retraction/">expressions of concern</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is known that organic waste such as dairy by-products can be used to produce biogas. This is not only a useful way to obtain valuable renewable energy energy, but also an efficient disposal method for large volumes of waste material. Biogas production</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> is achieved by anaerobic digestion, a process involving anaerobic bacteria to break down the organic matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This research explores the kinetic parameters required to effectively use anaerobic reactors for this process, with the objective of preventing the unwanted mixing of spoiled milk and effluent, which is potentially recyclable by other means. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The study determined optimal pH range for methane-producing bacteria (5-8), chemical oxygen demand, total solids, inoculum and retention time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall the optimized parameters and the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor used produced 70.4 liters of biogas per liter of spoiled milk. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The study concluded that optimization of the kinetic parameters and the use of an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor are important elements to consider in biogas production. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Portezuelo Formation in northern Patagonia is a region rich in fossil remains. This study reports the identification of 32 shed teeth discovered in the Portezuelo Formation and attributed to theropods, large bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The teeth, from the middle Turonian to late Coniacian, show different levels of preservation. They were identified as belonging to Megaraptoridae, Abelisauridae, Abelisauroidea and Alvarezsauridae. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The presence of a second, previously undocumented morphotype of megaraptorid and alvarezsaurid as well as the unusual denticle density of Morphotype 6, which suggests the existence of medium-sized abelisauroids, point towards a greater theropod diversity than previously reported and highlights the importance of future expeditions to Sierra del Portezuelo to fully explore this diverse ecosystem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Climate change is a very prominent topic, often discussed in relation to disappearing natural habitats and the risk of extinction of animal species, but what is its effect on the human body? It is increasingly being suggested that heat exposure can be linked to a multitude of health effects in vulnerable groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this study, the authors carried out a systematic review of the long-term effects heat exposure can have on the foetus. They found that heat exposure is associated with a detrimental effect on neurodevelopment and consequentially on associated socioeconomic and behavioural aspects. They also found this to be more prevalent in marginalised groups. While studies did not use widely accepted exposure indices when accounting for heat exposure, making data assessment challenging, this research highlights the need for further investigation into the effect of heat on the human body development. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Statistical measures related to infectious diseases were brought to the public’s attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Brain signals can be analyzed and translated into commands to external devices using systems called brain-computer interfaces.

<p><em>Nature</em> has retracted a 2002 paper from the lab of Catherine Verfaillie purporting to show a type of adult stem cell could, under certain circumstances, “contribute to most, if not all, somatic cell types.” </p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature00870">Pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult marrow</a>,” has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1024602878849692040">controversial since its publication</a>. Still, it has been cited nearly 4,500 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – making it by far <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/top-10-most-highly-cited-retracted-papers/">the most-cited retracted paper ever</a>.</p>



<p>In 2007, <em>New Scientist</em> reported on questions about <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325915-200-flawed-stem-cell-data-withdrawn/">data in the <em>Nature</em> paper</a> and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325964-600-fresh-questions-on-stem-cell-findings/">another</a> of Verfaille’s <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/98/9/2615/53471/Purification-and-ex-vivo-expansion-of-postnatal">articles in <em>Blood</em></a>. <em>Nature </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05812">published a correction</a> that year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The errors the authors corrected “do not alter the conclusions of the Article,” they wrote in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129437"></span>



<p>The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in Minneapolis, where Verfaillie worked when the <em>Nature</em> paper was published, in 2008 found the <em>Blood</em> paper <a href="https://archive.ph/20120712090732/http://jobs.chronicle.com/article/U-of-Minnesota-Panel-Says/41756/">contained falsified images</a>, but Verfaillie was not responsible for the manipulations. <em>Blood</em> <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/113/10/2370/24360/Reyes-M-Lund-T-Lenvik-T-Aguiar-D-Koodie-L">retracted the article</a> in 2009 at the request of the authors. </p>



<p>Verfaillie moved to KU Leuven, where she is now an <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00048658">emeritus professor</a>. She has not responded to our request for comment. </p>



<p>KU Leuven conducted an investigation of Verfaillie’s work in 2019-2020, after Elisabeth Bik posted questions about the data in her papers, including <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DF95522E3585E37663CAD1972E70BD#">the one from 2002 in <em>Nature</em></a>, on PubPeer. The <a href="https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/content/2020/ku-leuven-completes-research-on-possible-breach-of-research-integrity">university found</a> “no breach of research integrity in the publications investigated.” </p>



<p>Bik tweeted about the retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The notice mentions two image duplications Bik wrote about on PubPeer. Because the authors could not retrieve the original images, it states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>the Editors no longer have confidence that the conclusion that multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) engraft in the bone marrow is supported.</p>



<p>Given the concerns above the Editors no longer have confidence in the reliability of the data reported in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the notice, most of the authors, including Verfaillie, agreed with the retraction. She now has four retractions, by <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dVerfaillie%252c%2bCatherine%2bM">our count</a>.</p>

<p>Last December, Elsevier’s Scopus index <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/28/elseviers-scopus-deletes-journal-links-following-revelations-of-hijacked-indexed-journals/">deleted all links to journal homepages</a> in response to the widespread issue of journal hijacking, when a legitimate title, website, ISSN, and other metadata of a journal are taken over without permission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scopus has been a major target. I’ve cataloged <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24855">67 cases</a> since 2013 of hijacked journals penetrating the database.&nbsp; I found 23 profiles of journals that contained links to a cloned version, and 33 cases of content from the cloned version of a journal that had not been peer reviewed appearing in the profile of the legitimate journal, while 11 did both.</p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages">deletion of all homepage links</a> in the profiles of journals in Scopus, how journal hijackers would adapt their shady business practices has been unclear. We assumed they would continue hijacking new journals,&nbsp; would they continue to target Scopus, given they could index only unauthorized content?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, we have evidence hijacked journals remain in the database and continue to infiltrate it.</p>



<span id="more-129426"></span>



<p>Before Scopus deleted the links to journal homepages, the webpage in the profile of<em> Pakistan Heart Journal </em>directed to a cloned version of the journal. Later, unauthorized content from a cloned <em>Pakistan Heart Journal </em>&nbsp;appeared in Scopus, such as a paper titled “A new strategy for the genetic therapy of oral cancer: an update.” This title doesn’t correspond to the journal’s specialization in heart diseases, a mismatch typical for hijacked journals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXda9vQaIRn27zP2wBbHejcqKAerHlEEeQW4NIq2UGIsHzXN9cjFUvxK2RtDKcsu8PokL4SGgjc7akQCOs2H_pYXCn7RgTd7tm96QQb5b7GK81uDFhUXALiPDHYC9V5l-fHlXyaRZBQwuGNAWiKF7fh3e_E?key=4qYMo3mlZby2jMM1JAAwSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The cloned version of the <em>Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University</em> indexed some new content in the original journal’s Scopus profile, even after the index had previously deleted dozens of unauthorized papers. Screenshots of the publication list show papers from the original (above) and cloned journals (below) are indexed simultaneously. Two different papers are listed on the same pages of the same issue, which is impossible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd-ASaiWMXCbr3xVdEKG__7AxNOraYpeC3CGKuMAVZw5SZ4r_1GHDhnVzAKqiKkQzZU6SspClMcy9MfCMFzvhHNHdpIzngh80AQOxyE003vYInLOfykZsYcphlI5bNlBStczueh0qWczwyZzxyMwdyMD_BX?key=4qYMo3mlZby2jMM1JAAwSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Another suspicious case concerns <em>Obstetrics &amp; gynaecology forum</em> (ISSN 1029-1962) published in South Africa. <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ogf">Several</a><a href="https://www.obstetricsandgynaecologyforum.com/index.php/ogf"> webpages</a> related to the journal exist. While this<a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ogf"> link </a>is legitimate, I couldn’t confirm the authenticity of another <a href="https://www.obstetricsandgynaecologyforum.com/index.php/ogf">&nbsp;webpage</a> <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/obstetricsandgynaecologyforum.com">registered</a> in 2023 with the anonymous registrar GoDaddy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In house Publications,” which once published the journal, no longer does so, and the company did not respond to my queries about whether the journal had been transferred to another publisher.&nbsp; Neither the editor-in-chief nor the senior editors replied to my requests for information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problematic version of the journal has published three special issues including papers on medical topics unrelated to obstetrics and gynecology, including prostate cancer, ischemic stroke, minerals in different fruits, liver cirrhosis, and kidney diseases.</p>



<p>Eleven papers from the first special issue (nine co-authored by the same researcher) have been indexed in Scopus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXffzYes4iwphhcerQrBSPKkYoVjZsLIPtB6ziM00efD4N9d6hfS8Z1w3ZmkeqrbHO7wWVU7fBuVc6ZGxVXLwVEuSIwXCB2TE5RBHd9_S7Tjxsxur7QlMQTfcL0heczgKOA7S8N8uh88CmQRdhBitiZFO9sR?key=4qYMo3mlZby2jMM1JAAwSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>These cases show that hijacked journals and problematic journals still target Scopus to index unauthorized content. We have no reason to expect them to stop.</p>

<p>Two years after a journal told sleuths it wouldn’t retract flawed papers, it changed course and pulled them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/m-bolland">Mark Bolland</a>, a researcher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who is <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/20/the-notices-are-utterly-unhelpful-a-look-at-how-journals-have-handled-allegations-about-hundreds-of-papers/">no stranger</a> to unearthing academic wrongdoing, first sent complaints about one of the papers to <em>The International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics</em> (IJGO)&nbsp; in March 2021. He said the data on bone mineral density in “<a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.ijgo.2008.07.011">Isosorbide mononitrate versus alendronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis</a>,” which has been cited 26 times according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, were “impossible.”<br><br>Bolland said the data the researchers reported were not consistent with the reference values provided by the maker of the device used to measure bone density in the study. The normal ranges are 0.96 +/- 0.12 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas the experiment reported much lower values of 0.21-0.24 g/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Bolland’s colleague <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-grey">Andrew Grey</a> called the data “laughable, frankly.”</p>



<span id="more-129401"></span>



<p>A portion of the email Bolland sent to the journal reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The findings of this study which reported large effects of nitrates and alendronate are totally inconsistent with clinical trials from other groups, the lead author previously extensively plagiarized a report of another nitrate trial, and a systematic evaluation using the REAPPRAISED checklist raises a number of concerns about the integrity of the publication including concerns regarding trial ethics, participant recruitment and that the bone density baseline and outcome data are implausible or incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson from the journal assured Bolland three times in September 2021 they had reviewed the data and found them to be correct – only for <em>IJGO </em>to <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.15297">retract</a> the article two years later in December of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead author of the study, <a href="https://www.asu.edu.eg/staffPortal/en/staffProfile/9050">Ashraf Nabhan</a> of Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt, was editor for Contemporary Issues in Women’s Health and systematic reviews <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14824">until April of 2023</a>. His name <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/18793479/editorial-board/editorial-board">no longer appears</a> on the editorial board. He currently sits on the senior editorial board for <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, where 10 editorial board members<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/06/editorial-board-members-resign-from-obstetrics-journal-to-protest-handling-of-allegations/"> resigned earlier this year</a> because they felt the journal mishandled allegations of data fabrication. He didn’t respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But this wasn’t an isolated instance for IJGO. In&nbsp; March 2020, Grey notified the journal of issues with a second, unrelated article led by Indian researcher <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subrata-Seal">Subrata Seal</a>. The paper, “<a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.09.019">Randomized controlled trial of elevation of the fetal head with a fetal pillow during cesarean delivery at full cervical dilation</a>,” which has been cited 24 times, is part of a trio of papers by Seal published in different journals. Grey’s concerns included implausibly high reductions in relative risks for maternal outcomes, data discrepancies between study groups, and calculation errors.</p>



<p>The paper was used in a <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN150053.pdf">licensing document</a> for a medical device called a fetal pillow in 2017, which is still <a href="https://www.coopersurgical.com/brand/fetal-pillow/">available for purchase</a>. In his email to the journal, Grey raised concern about the device being used clinically, even after the retraction: “According to the manufacturer’s website, the fetal pillow is now used in more than 20 countries and in &gt;85 hospitals in the United Kingdom, and more than 26,000 devices have been used worldwide,” he wrote.</p>



<p><em>IJGO </em>&nbsp;responded in October 2020 that all concerns had been investigated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors provided responses to each of the concerns raised, and although they did concede that there were some errors in terms of timeline reporting, they gave satisfactory explanations regarding the different authors on the publications you mention, as well as the apparent discrepancy in study sites.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When Grey took the issue directly to the publisher, Wiley responded that it wanted to share his identity with the authors: “We feel this would be helpful in eliciting a&nbsp; more detailed response,” a representative said in December 2020. Grey did not respond, and didn’t hear anything for three years — until the paper was <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14924">retracted</a> in June 2023 for inconsistency in trial results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same spokesperson from the journal, Amy Goggins, told Retraction Watch that IJGO revisited the cases after appointing a <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijgo.14292">research integrity editor</a> in 2022. “We have re-opened investigation of some older cases where there was uncertainty over the outcome, in an effort to achieve consensus on these,” Goggins said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bolland said he was both surprised and not surprised that the original outcome was uncertain, “but they certainly never indicated any uncertainty in their correspondence with me- quite the opposite: they didn’t address the concerns we raised and simply dismissed them, without making any effort to engage with us about the concerns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Grey noted that the journal’s initial assessments were “extremely poor” for the articles. “Again, not unusual. The problems with the data and the publications were really obvious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">IJGO published an <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14664">expression of concern</a> in January of 2023 regarding the fetal pillow paper. They also contacted the FDA to re-evaluate its licensing. Goggins told Retraction Watch that IJGO had been contacted by the manufacturer of the pillow device, <a href="https://www.coopersurgical.com/">Cooper Surgical</a>, but didn’t share what the manufacturer said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from the FDA told Retraction Watch: “As a general matter, the FDA does not comment on potential or ongoing investigations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only were the cases similar — so were the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A portion of Nabhan’s retraction reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns were raised by a number of third parties regarding the authenticity of the data and results presented in this study. In light of these concerns, the authors were asked to provide the raw data for the study. The authors cooperated fully and provided the raw data. Following review of the raw data by the journal&#8217;s research integrity team, it was found that there were highly similar sequences of values of in the data for the two study groups, suggesting duplication of data. Since the data of are incompatible with randomisation, this invalidates the study results and gives rise to considerable uncertainty around the observed effect of the intervention. As a result, the journal is issuing this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A portion of Seal’s reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following the publication of an Expression of Concern on this article,<sup>1</sup> further concerns were emphasized by a number of third parties regarding discrepancies between the retrospective trial registration and the published article. Following further review by the journal&#8217;s research integrity team, it was found that there were a considerable number of inconsistencies in the results presented. Unfortunately, there is no patient data available to explain or clarify these inconsistencies. This gives rise to considerable uncertainty around the benefit of the treatment intervention. As a result, the journal is issuing this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One other paper in Seal’s trio, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443615.2024.2348431">Does elevating the fetal head prior to delivery using a fetal pillow reduce maternal and fetal complications in a full dilatation caesarean section? A prospective study with historical controls</a>,” was published in the <em>Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology</em> in 2014 and retracted in 2024. The third, “<a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0030-1248936">Outcome in Second- versus First-Stage Cesarean Delivery in a Teaching Institution in Eastern India</a>” published in the <em>American Journal of Perinatology,</em> has not been retracted. Seal did not respond to our request for comment. </p>



<p>As for Nabhan, he has already lost one paper on the same topic. “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/21/5/1320/987286">A randomized clinical trial of the effects of isosorbide mononitrate on bone formation and resorption in post-menopausal women: a pilot study</a>.” The paper was published in 2006 and, the same year, the journal made the “unusual decision” to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/21/10/2466/2915142">retract</a> due to “extensive plagiarism.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/jim.thornton">Jim Thornton</a>, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Nottingham in the UK, left comments <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9545234F42CD6AFB7BC5E84B75972B">on PubPeer</a> about <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.ijgo.2016.01.025">another paper</a> listing Nabhan as a contributing author, Thornton and his colleagues <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176DXOrdTFiqp1hY0Mpqdic4gBnecqa4x/view">released a manuscript</a> in October 2021 discussing the ethics of clinical trials led by Mohamed Sweed, a colleague of Nabhan.</p>
