              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-dwarf-planet-quaoar-ring">The Kuiper Belt’s dwarf planet Quaoar hosts an impossible ring</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dwarf planet Quaoar has a ring that is too big for its metaphorical fingers. While all other rings in the solar system lie within or near a mathematically determined distance of their parent bodies, Quaoar’s ring is much farther out.</p>



<p>“For Quaoar, for the ring to be outside this limit is very, very strange,” says astronomer Bruno Morgado of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The finding may force <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05629-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rethink of the rules governing planetary rings</a>, Morgado and colleagues say in a study published February 8 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>Quaoar is an icy body about half the size of Pluto that’s located in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-discovery-solar-system-planets-space">Kuiper Belt at the solar system’s edge</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/22). </em>At such a great distance from Earth, it’s hard to get a clear picture of the world.</p>



<p>So Morgado and colleagues watched Quaoar block the light from a distant star, a phenomenon called a stellar occultation. The timing of the star winking in and out of view can reveal details about Quaoar, like its size and whether it has an atmosphere.</p>



<p>The researchers took data from occultations from 2018 to 2020, observed from all over the world, including Namibia, Australia and Grenada, as well as space. There was no sign that Quaoar had an atmosphere. But surprisingly, there was a ring. The finding makes Quaoar just the third dwarf planet or asteroid in the solar system known to have a ring, after the asteroid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icy-rings-found-around-tiny-space-rock">Chariklo</a> and the dwarf planet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oddball-dwarf-planet-haumea-has-ring">Haumea</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/14</em>; <em>SN: 10/11/17</em>).</p>



<p>Even more surprisingly, “the ring is not where we expect,” Morgado says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h2>Far-out ring</h2>



<p>In this illustration, dwarf planet Haumea and asteroid Chariklo both have rings (white) that are close to their Roche limits (yellow), to the best of astronomers’ understanding. Quaoar, in contrast, has a ring that is clearly well beyond its Roche limit, an imaginary line beyond which rings aren’t thought to be stable.</p>

<p>Known rings around other objects lie within or near what’s called the Roche limit, an invisible line where the gravitational force of the main body peters out. Inside the limit, that force can rip a moon to shreds, turning it into a ring. Outside, the gravity between smaller particles is stronger than that from the main body, and rings will coalesce into one or several moons.</p>



<p>“We always think of [the Roche limit] as straightforward,” Morgado says. “One side is a moon forming, the other side is a ring stable. And now this limit is not a limit.”</p>



<p>For Quaoar’s far-out ring, there are a few possible explanations, Morgado says. Maybe the observers caught the ring at just the right moment, right before it turns into a moon. But that lucky timing seems unlikely, he notes.</p>



<p>Maybe Quaoar’s known moon, Weywot, or some other unseen moon contributes gravity that holds the ring stable somehow. Or maybe the ring’s particles are colliding in such a way that they avoid sticking together and clumping into moons.</p>



<p>The particles would have to be particularly bouncy for that to work, “like a ring of those bouncy balls from toy stores,” says planetary scientist David Jewitt of UCLA, who was not involved in the new work.</p>



<p>The observation is solid, says Jewitt, who helped discover the first objects in the Kuiper Belt in the 1990s. But there’s no way to know yet which of the explanations is correct, if any, in part because there are no theoretical predictions for such far-out rings to compare with Quaoar’s situation.</p>



<p>That’s par for the course when it comes to the Kuiper Belt. “Everything in the Kuiper Belt, basically, has been discovered, not predicted,” Jewitt says. “It’s the opposite of the classical model of science where people predict things and then confirm or reject them. People discover stuff by surprise, and everyone scrambles to explain it.”</p>



<p>More observations of Quaoar, or more discoveries of seemingly misplaced rings elsewhere in the solar system, could help reveal what’s going on.</p>



<p>“I have no doubt that in the near future a lot of people will start working with Quaoar to try to get this answer,” Morgado says.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Manal Helal will talk about a paper &quot;miRe2e: A Full End-to-End Deep Model Based on Transformers for Prediction of Pre-miRNAs&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA sequences with key roles in the regulation of
gene expression at post-transcriptional level in different species. Accurate
prediction of novel miRNAs is needed due to their importance in many biological
processes and their associations with complicated diseases in humans. Many
machine learning approaches were proposed in the last decade for this purpose,
but requiring handcrafted features extraction to identify possible de novo
miRNAs. More recently, the emergence of deep learning (DL) has allowed the
automatic feature extraction, learning relevant representations by themselves.
However, the state-of-art deep models require complex pre-processing of the
input sequences and prediction of their secondary structure to reach an
acceptable performance.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>In this work, we present miRe2e, the first full end-to-end DL model for
pre-miRNA prediction. This model is based on Transformers, a neural
architecture that uses attention mechanisms to infer global dependencies
between inputs and outputs. It is capable of receiving the raw genome-wide data
as input, without any pre-processing nor feature engineering. After a training
stage with known pre-miRNAs, hairpin and non-harpin sequences, it can identify
all the pre-miRNA sequences within a genome. The model has been validated
through several experimental setups using the human genome, and it was compared
with state-of-the-art algorithms obtaining 10 times better performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-algae-phytoplankton-symbiosis-backstab">Some ‘friendly’ bacteria backstab their algal pals. Now we know why</a></h4>

              
                <p>The photosynthesizing plankton <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em> has a dramatic relationship with its bacterial frenemies. These duplicitous bugs help <em>E. huxleyi</em> in exchange for nutrients until it becomes more convenient to murder and eat their hosts. Now, scientists have figured out how these treacherous bacteria decide to turn from friend to foe.</p>



<p>One species of these bacteria appears <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to keep tabs on health-related chemicals</a> produced by <em>E. huxleyi</em>, researchers report January 24 in <em>eLife. </em>The bacteria maintain their friendly facade until their hosts age and weaken, striking as soon as the vulnerable algae can’t afford to keep bribing them with nutrients. The finding could help explain how massive algal blooms come to an end.</p>





<p>The bacteria is “first establishing what we call the ‘first handshake,’” says marine microbiologist Assaf Vardi of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. “Then it will shift into a pathogen.”</p>



<p><em>E. huxleyi</em>’s partnership with these bacteria, which belong to a group called Roseobacter, might be best described as a love-hate relationship. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phytoplanktons-response-climate-change-has-its-ups-and-downs">single-celled alga</a> can’t produce the B vitamins it needs on its own, so it offers up nutrients to lure in Roseobacter that can (<em>SN: 7/8/16</em>). The trade is win-win — at least until the bacteria decide they’d be better off slaying and devouring their algal hosts than sticking around in peaceful coexistence.</p>



<p>Sometimes called the “Jekyll-and-Hyde” trait, this kind of bacterial backstabbery shows up everywhere from animal guts to the open seas. But it wasn’t clear before how Roseobacter decide it’s the right moment to murder <em>E. huxleyi</em>.<br><br>Vardi’s team exposed a type of Roseobacter that lives with <em>E. huxleyi</em> to chemicals taken from algae that were either young and growing or old and stagnant. The team also introduced the bacteria to extra doses of a certain health-signaling algal chemical.Looking at which genes the bacteria activated in the different experiments revealed how and why they switched from friend to foe.</p>



<p>The bacteria kill their algal pals when exposed to high concentrations of a sulfur-containing chemical called DMSP, the researchers found. <em>E. huxleyi </em>leaks more and more DMSP as it ages. This eventually cues its duplicitous microbial partners to go rogue, kill their aging host, and kick their genes for nutrient-grabbing proteins and flagella — whiplike tails used to swim — into overdrive.</p>



<p>It’s an “eat-and-run strategy,” says Noa Barak-Gavish, a microbiologist at ETH Zurich. “You eat up whatever you can and then swim away to avoid competition … [and] to find alternative hosts.”</p>



<p>DMSP isn’t the only figure in this deadly chemical calculus. <em>E. huxleyi</em> can sate its companion’s bloodlust with a bribe of benzoate, a nutrient that Roseobacter can use but most bacteria can’t.</p>



<p>While it’s clearer now what drives the bacteria to kill their hosts, their murder weapon remains a mystery. Vardi says his group has some hunches to follow up on.</p>



<p>This kind of frenemies relationship could be a key factor in controlling the boom and bust of massive algal blooms if other phytoplankton and bacteria have a similar dynamic, says Mary Ann Moran of the University of Georgia in Athens, who was not involved in the study. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forecasting-toxic-algae-blooms">Algal blooms can be toxic</a> (<em>SN: 8/28/18</em>). But they also “fix” enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into biomass and are a major source of organic carbon to the ocean.</p>

Such blooms are a major source of organic carbon to the ocean and an important part of the Earth’s carbon cycle.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121585">Suomi NPP/NASA and NOAA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Phytoplankton fix half of all the carbon on the planet, and probably 20 percent to 50 percent of what they fix … actually goes right to bacteria,” she says. So if this kind of relationship controls how carbon flows through the ocean, &#8220;that is something that we would really like to understand.”</p>

<p>Eric Ross was listening to a <a href="https://www.thecarlatreport.com/blogs/2-the-carlat-psychiatry-podcast">popular psychiatry podcast</a> one day last spring when &#8220;some pretty remarkable&#8221; research findings caught his attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A team of researchers in Egypt had shown that adding a cheap diabetes drug—metformin—to antidepressant therapy nearly doubled the treatment&#8217;s efficacy in people with moderate to severe depression. That meant the drug worked better than electric shock therapy,&nbsp; an option <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(03)12705-5.pdf">when antidepressants fail</a>. It was a breakthrough.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought, you know, wow, this is something that I&#8217;m comfortable prescribing that could make a huge difference for my patients,&#8221; said Ross, who at the time was doing his residency in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>



<p>But when he looked up <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-020-00878-7">the study</a>, he discovered several oddities. For instance, the number of patients who experienced an adverse event differed by exactly one for 17 out of 18 single events like fatigue or bloating. That seemed unlikely to have occurred by chance. And all of the scores of statistical tests the authors had done turned out just the way they would have wanted, a dream that rarely comes true in biomedical sciences.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126524"></span>



<p>Perhaps most damningly, many of the numbers in the paper showed a glaring similarity to the numbers in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.13731">a clinical trial</a> of another add-on drug that the authors had published—as if they had been &#8220;rather sloppily copy-pasted&#8221; with a digit changed here and there, Ross later wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That study also had impressive results, suggesting that in just a couple of years, the Egyptian researchers had discovered two treatments—metformin and cilostazol—that outperformed electric shock therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To Ross, there was no doubt the data was fake, although the corresponding author of the papers, Mahmoud S. Abdallah, a lecturer in clinical pharmacy at the University of Sadat City, vehemently denies this.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was fired up,&#8221; Ross, now an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont, told Retraction Watch. &#8220;I was really mad because this is the kind of thing that can immediately affect patient care.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">He decided to share his suspicions with the journals that had published the two studies, <em>Neurotherapeutics</em> and <em>CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Research misconduct is damaging in any field, but I am particularly disturbed by these articles,&#8221; he told them in an email from March 1, 2022, that Retraction Watch has seen. &#8220;Besides its harms to the research community, a fabricated clinical trial with clinically actionable conclusions has the potential to do real and immediate harm to patients.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cilostazol, for instance, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16838/cilostazol-oral/details">may cause</a> heart problems and stomach bleeding; metformin <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11285-7061/metformin-oral/metformin-oral/details">is not free of side effects</a> either. Whether or not the drugs work against depression, they can still cause harm.</p>



<p>A first-time sleuth, Ross also pointed to other studies by Abdallah that struck him as suspicious:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Most unfortunately, the corresponding author appears to be a serial fabulist: he has previously published papers with all the same odd tics (&gt;80% remission rate, multiples of ten evaluated/enrolled, identical numbers of patients discontinuing treatment, no loss to follow-up, and every outcome turning out perfectly) on pentoxifylline for depression (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30205379/) and metformin for rheumatoid arthritis (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33773207/).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In September, <em>Neurotherapeutics</em> pulled the first paper, &#8220;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-020-00878-7">The Antidiabetic Metformin as an Adjunct to Antidepressants in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Proof-of-Concept, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial</a>.&#8221; It has been cited 27 times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s web of Science.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-022-01291-y">retraction note</a> stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The response from the authors to these concerns has shown that there are serious issues with the ethical oversight, the reporting and the availability of audited data for this clinical trial. The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented. All authors disagree with this retraction.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Abdallah denied Ross&#8217; accusations of data fabrication. He added, &#8220;The journal retraction decision is based on speculations without any evidence that we have violated ethical oversight.&#8221;</p>



<p>Abdallah shared his correspondence with the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and Springer Nature, the publisher of <em>Neurotherapeutics</em>, in which he argued at length against the concerns about his research and also threatened legal action &#8220;to protect our reputation.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, no action has been taken on the cilostazol paper—&#8221;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.13731">Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study of the phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor cilostazol as an adjunctive to antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder</a>&#8220;—which has been cited three times.</p>



<p>Ross said he was told in January by Wiley, the publisher of<em> CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics</em>, that it would contact him &#8220;when there is progress.&#8221; In response to a request for comment we sent to the journal&#8217;s editorial office and its <a href="https://www.neurology.pitt.edu/people/xiaoming-hu-md">editor-in-chief</a>, a Wiley spokesperson said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are grateful to Dr. Ross for bringing this concern to our attention. We have initiated an investigation into these articles in accordance with COPE guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been almost a year at this point since I originally raised the issue,&#8221; said Ross. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this was one where it took a lot of, you know, complex sleuthing, like doing statistical analysis or anything like that, to be very suspicious about these papers. So I certainly would have hoped it would have been done a lot sooner.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/plos-and-plan-s/">PLOS and Plan S – We’ve got you covered!</a></h4>

              
                <p>As a <a href="https://plos.org/about/">fully Open Access (OA) publisher</a> since our founding, PLOS meets or exceeds all Plan S requirements and recommendations. In fact, we always have! That won&rsquo;t change as cOAlition S <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/coalition-s-confirms-the-end-of-its-financial-support-for-open-access-publishing-under-transformative-arrangements-after-2024/">moves forward with the next phase of Plan S implementation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A quick refresher: What is Plan S again? And what is its current status?</h2>



<p>Plan S requires that any research supported by one of the more than 25 <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/plan-s-funders-implementation/">signatory funders</a> be made available under an Open Access copyright license without delay or embargo&mdash;either in a fully Open Access (OA) journal, or by posting to a fully Open Access repository. To support these requirements, the cOAlition members agree that grants may be used to pay publication fees if needed.</p>



<p>Recently, cOAlition S reaffirmed their timeline for full implementation of Plan S. The policy, which began in January 2021, will come into full effect as planned in December 2024. Notably, in the recent announcement, cOAlition S confirmed plans to end support for &ldquo;<a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/plan-s-compliant-transformative-journals/">transformative agreements</a>&rdquo; at the end of 2024 as part of their larger effort to encourage Open Access. Transformative agreements facilitate a path to Open Access publishing in certain hybrid or subscription journals that intend to move to a fully Open Access model. By the 2024 deadline, authors may not be able to use grants to fund publications in journals still operating a hybrid model. <strong>As PLOS is and always has been a fully OA publisher, this will not affect APC funding or institutional deals for PLOS authors.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>While full implementation is still almost two years in the future, it&rsquo;s exciting to see the program moving forward. PLOS is very supportive of the next steps outlined by the cOAlition, and we are already prepared for this new phase of Plan S! Read on for more detail on how PLOS meets or exceeds Plan-S requirements.</p>



<h2>PLOS is Plan-S-ready&mdash;and then some!</h2>



<h4>Journal standards and Open licensing</h4>



<p>In order to qualify as an approved publication venue, Plan S requires that publishers and platforms meet certain standards for quality and ethics, transparent editorial guidelines, and of course, OA licensing and author copyright retention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At PLOS, everything we publish is Open, and always has been. We were founded in 2001 as an Open Access advocacy organization, and began publishing research in 2003 under a CC BY license. We are a <a href="https://oaspa.org/about/history/">founding member of OASPA</a>, and a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/10/oa-weeks-past/">co-founder of OA week</a>. Each of our journals upholds the very highest standards for scientific and research ethics, and are longstanding members of <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">COPE</a>.</p>



<h4>Transparent journal metrics and publication cost details</h4>



<p>Another key requirement of Plan S relates to transparent journal metrics, fair publication fees, and clarity around how Article Processing Charges (APCs) are allocated. Qualifying journals are also required to offer fully documented fee waiver and discount programs for authors based in lower- or middle- income countries, and those with demonstrable needs.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/price-transparency-update-2021">read our most recent journal statistics and cost details</a> on the Official PLOS Blog. We offer <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/">full waivers and discounts</a> to researchers based in Research4Life countries, as well as needs-based fee assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as important, we&rsquo;re working to make Open Access more equitable overall by moving beyond APCs. We&rsquo;ve established&nbsp; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-series">APC-alternative funding models</a> that help put OA publication within reach for all, whether funded by Plan S signatories or not. And because we&rsquo;re fully Open, our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">institutional partner agreements</a> will remain Plan S compliant, even after the transitional period ends in 2024.</p>



<h4>Technical specifications</h4>



<p>Plan S includes technical requirements to support discoverability, preservation, and meta-analysis, beginning with detailed machine-readable, and non-proprietary metadata. <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/">OpenAIRE</a> compliance and full text machine-readable downloads are both strongly encouraged. In addition, long-term preservation is of course required, and self-archiving recommended. Plan S also requires persistent digital identifiers for publications and strongly recommends identifiers for authors as well.</p>



<p><strong>PLOS journals offer all of these features! </strong>Authors can rest easy when submitting to PLOS, knowing their published articles will automatically be backed by high-quality JATS metadata, LOCKSS archiving, and be accessible in a downloadable version of our <a href="https://github.com/PLOS/allofplos">full corpus</a>. PLOS journals assign unique DOIs to all of our articles, with sub-DOIs to identify and link figures and Published Peer Review History. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/credit/">ORCID</a> is required for all corresponding authors, and is available to coauthors and reviewers as well. We also use the CRediT taxonomy to acknowledge each authors&rsquo; unique contribution to the work.</p>



<h4>Accessible data</h4>



<p>While not required, Plan S strongly recommends openly accessible data in line with ethical considerations, as well as links to data, code, and other supporting documentation.</p>



<p>For almost a decade, PLOS&rsquo; <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">sensible data policy</a> has required that the data underlying each study be made publicly available, so long as it does not pose a risk to vulnerable populations or patient privacy. Plus, we are experimenting with new tools to make data sharing and reuse easy and more visible. Our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">Accessible Data</a> feature highlights links to data repositories on our article pages, so readers can easily find and retrieve datasets associated with PLOS articles while our <a href="https://plos.org/dryad-data/">Dryad integration</a> for <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> enables data repository deposition through the Editorial Manager submissions system.</p>



<h2>Looking ahead to full Plan S implementation</h2>



<p>All this means that Plan-S-funded authors can submit to <a href="https://plos.org/your-journal-options/">any of our 12 journals</a> with confidence, now or after 2024, knowing that their articles will be Plan S compliant with no additional effort on their part. And, that any publication fees will be eligible for funding support, either through a PLOS partner institution, or through their Plan S funder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-hologram-physics-twisted-light">Physicists stored data in quantum holograms made of twisted light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Particles of twisted light that have been entangled using quantum mechanics offer a new approach to dense and secure data storage.</p>



<p>Holograms that produce 3-D images and serve as security features on credit cards are usually made with patterns laid down with beams of laser light. In recent years, physicists have found ways to create holograms with entangled photons instead. Now there is, literally, a new twist to the technology.</p>



<p>Entangled photons that travel in corkscrew paths have resulted in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/ac078Ye1I8b11c7329660e49f22a782a1ca503b66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holograms that offer the possibility of dense and ultrasecure data encryption</a>, researchers report in a study to appear in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>





<p>Light can move in a variety of ways, including the up-and-down and side-to-side patterns of polarized light. But when it carries a type of rotation known as orbital angular momentum, it can also propagate in spirals that resemble twisted rotini pasta.</p>



<p>Like any other photons, the twisted versions can be entangled so that they essentially act as one entity. Something that affects one of an entangled photon pair instantly affects the other, even if they are very far apart.</p>



<p>In previous experiments, researchers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-communication-takes-new-twist">sent data through the air in entangled pairs of twisted photons</a> (<em>SN: 8/5/15</em>). The approach should allow high-speed data transmission because light can come with different amounts of twist, with each twist serving as a different channel of communication.</p>



<p>Now the same approach has been applied to record data in holograms. Instead of transmitting information on multiple, twisted light channels, photon pairs with different amounts of twist create distinct sets of data in a single hologram. The more orbital angular momentum states involved, each with different amounts of twist, the more data researchers can pack into a hologram.</p>



<p>In addition to cramming more data into holograms, increasing the variety of twists used to record the data boosts security. Anyone who wants to read the information out needs to know, or guess, how the light that recorded it was twisted.</p>



<p>For a hologram relying on two types of twist, says physicist Xiangdong Zhang of the Beijing Institute of Technology, you would have to pick the right combination of the twists from about 80 possibilities to decode the data. Bumping that up to combinations of seven distinct twists leads to millions of possibilities. That, Zhang says, “should be enough to ensure our quantum holographic encryption system has enough security level.”</p>





<p>The researchers demonstrated their technique by encoding words and letters in holograms and reading the data back out again with twisted light. Although the researchers produced images from the holographic data, says physicist Hugo Defienne of the Paris Institute of Nanosciences, the storage itself should not be confused with holographic images.</p>



<p>Defienne, who was not involved with the new research, says that other quantum holography schemes, such as his efforts with polarized photons, produce direct images of objects including microscopic structures.</p>



<p>“[Their] idea there is very different . . . from our approach in this sense,” Defrienne says. “They’re using holography to store information,” rather than creating the familiar 3-D images that most people associate with holograms.</p>



<p>The twisted light data storage that Zhang and his colleagues demonstrated is slow, requiring nearly 20 minutes to decode an image of the acronym “BIT,” for the Beijing Institute of Technology where the experiments were performed. And the security that the researchers have demonstrated is still relatively low because they included only up to six forms of twisted light in their experiments.</p>



<p>Zhang is confident that both limitations can be overcome with technical improvements. “We think that our technology has potential application in quantum information encryption,” he says, “especially quantum image encryption.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammals-groups-longevity-genetics">Mammals that live in groups may live longer, longevity research suggests</a></h4>

              
                <p>For mammals, one secret to a long life may be spending it living with friends and family.</p>



<p>An analysis of the life spans and social lives of nearly 1,000 mammal species shows that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35869-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">species that live in groups, such as horses and chimpanzees, tend to live longer</a> than solitary beasts, like weasels and hedgehogs. The finding suggests that life span and social traits are evolutionarily entwined in mammals, researchers report January 31 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>The maximum life span of mammals ranges widely. The shortest-lived shrews, for example, survive about two years, while bowhead whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) can reach <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bowhead-whales-may-unlock-secrets-long-healthy-life">roughly 200 years of age</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>1/6/15</em>).</p>



<p>When evolutionary biologist Xuming Zhou of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing was studying the longest-lived mammals to understand the evolution of longevity, he took particular note of naked mole-rats (<em>Heterocephalus glaber</em>). The rodents are exceptionally long-lived, sometimes reaching over 30 years of age. They also live in huge, complex, subterranean societies. In contrast, other rodents like golden hamsters (<em>Mesocricetus auratus</em>), which are solitary, live to only about four years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some previous research on specific mammal species showed an effect of social behavior on longevity, Zhou says. For instance, female chacma baboons (<em>Papio ursinus</em>) with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210007219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong, stable social bonds live longer</a> than females without them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhou and his colleagues decided to see if there were any links between longevity and social habits shared across a wide range of mammal species.</p>



<p>The researchers compiled information from the scientific literature on the social organization of 974 mammal species. They then split these species into three categories: solitary, pair-living and group-living. When the researchers compared these three groups with data on the mammals’ known longevity, they found that group-living mammals tended to live longer than the solitary species — roughly 22 years compared with nearly 12 years in solitary mammals.</p>



<p>Zhou and his colleagues then accounted for body mass — bigger mammals tend to live longer than smaller ones — and the effect of social bonds held. A stark example comes from shrews and bats. Both are similarly tiny mammals, but the loner shrews live only a few years, while some far more social bat species can live for 30 or 40 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were so surprised, because individuals who live in groups also face a lot of costs, such as competition for potential mating partners and food,” Zhou says. Frequent social contact in group settings can also encourage the spread of infectious disease.</p>





<p>But there are benefits to living in a group too, he says, such as banding together for protection against predators. Living together may also reduce the risk of starvation if, for instance, group members increase foraging efficiency by finding and gathering food together. These factors may allow social mammals to live longer.</p>



<p>The evolution of a long life may also be more likely in group-living species: Living in a group allows animals to potentially aid the survival of their family members, which carry their genes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist Laurent Keller of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland lauds the study for the sheer size of the sampling effort. “But it would have been useful to be a bit more precise about different levels of sociality.” There are more variations of social organization within the three categories used in the study, he says, and the relative degree of sociality could influence any patterns you see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, fine tuning the social categories “is not an easy task,” Keller notes.</p>



<p>To get an idea of how genes might produce the link between longevity and group living, Zhou and his team took brain tissue samples from 94 mammal species and analyzed the transcriptome — the full complement of RNA — giving insights into different genes’ activity levels. This can reveal whether genes are turned on or off, or how much protein the genes may be instructing cells to produce.</p>



<p>The researchers found 31 genes whose relative activity levels were correlated with both longevity and one of the three prescribed social categories. Many of these genes appear to have roles in the immune system, which may have importance when countering pathogens spreading through the social group. Other genes were associated with hormone regulation, including some thought to influence social behaviors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In studying these genes in more detail, Zhou envisions uncovering more about how mammals’ social habits and life spans have evolved together.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Have you heard about hijacked journals, which take over legitimate publications’ </em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0"><em>titles, ISSNs, and other metadata</em></a><em> without their permission? We recently launched the </em><a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"><em>Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</em></a><em>, and will be publishing regular posts like this one to tell the stories of some of those cases.</em></p>



<p><strong>Hijacked journal: </strong><em>Linguistica Antverpiensia, New Series – Themes in Translation Studies</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What happened: </strong>The journal became a perfect target for hijackers when it expanded its title from “<em>Linguistica Antverpiensia</em>” and changed its<a href="https://lans-tts.uantwerpen.be/index.php/LANS-TTS"> web domain</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraudulent publishers hijacked the journal in 2021, re-registering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210619191725/https:/hivt.be/linguistica">the old, expired domain</a> under the original, shorter name <em>Linguistica Antverpiensia</em>.</p>



<span id="more-126513"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yzE8TYRvV0QfYEwXu3ScZROn2pr5WHkfUdAWxoHZ8oP7AhAOMl3f5BHCkcgNzsVcVUohLn3eAw1x07meYOtxkG9W92b5wph-OeyJ36oQVE5AhFEE_iWhls_pJYoQIV4k9Oh43TXox4biIA4i4BvJYP4" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Indexing: </strong>The original journal was indexed in Scopus, initially under the original (shorter) name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2021, the number of papers indexed that year under the journal’s original name reached 131. However, the majority – if not all – came from the hijacked journal. (Retraction Watch has<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/19/can-journals-get-hijacked-apparently-yes/"> written</a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/12/meet-the-hijacked-journal-that-keeps-rising-from-the-ashes/"> several</a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/09/01/how-did-content-from-a-hijacked-journal-end-up-in-one-of-the-worlds-most-used-databases/"> times</a> about hijacked journals successfully indexing papers in well-respected databases such as Clarivate’s Web of Science or Scopus, which many universities and countries use as a measure of quality.)</p>



<p>Once the legitimate journal staffers learned of the problem, they created a new profile in Scopus using their new, longer title. But the hijackers succeeded in indexing unauthorized papers there as well, as indicated by the titles of these papers being irrelevant to linguistics. (Hijacked journals tend to ignore subject matter or manuscript quality in their aim to publish as many papers as possible.)</p>



<p>Since June 2021, when the old-title journal was under investigation in Scopus, the unauthorized content of the hijacked <em>Linguistica Antverpiensia</em> was indexed seven times to the new profile of the journal in Scopus, for a total of 14 papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, the hijackers did it twice. In May, the hijacked journal indexed the paper “Subtitles of sex toy advertisements: Sexual expressions and translation techniques,” and in October, seven new papers were indexed, all of them co-authored by Russian and Kazakhstani authors (see screenshot below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In comparison, during this period the legitimate journal only once indexed 19 papers published in 2021.</p>

<p>All unauthorized<em> </em>articles from 2021 and 2022 no longer appear to be indexed in Scopus under the title of the legitimate journal.</p>



<p><strong>Spillover effects: </strong>Ten papers published in the hijacked <em>Linguistica Antverpiensia</em> were included in<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/16/who-covid-19-library-contains-hundreds-of-papers-from-hijacked-journals/"> a World Health Organization (WHO) database of papers about COVID-19</a> until they were eventually removedThe legitimate journal did take legal steps and the hijackers deleted all information from the original website hivt.be. But later they registered a new<a href="http://upa-editions.com/index.php/LANS-TTS"> web domain</a> hijacking <em>Linguistica Antverpiensia, New Series – Themes in Translation Studies</em> – and thus the scam continues.</p>

                Monday’s massive earthquake has triggered a swarm of aftershocks, which will make a humanitarian disaster even more devastating.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/turkey-syria-earthquake">What to know about Turkey’s recent devastating earthquake</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the early morning of February 6, a devastating magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck southern Turkey, near the border with Syria. Numerous aftershocks followed, the strongest nearly rivaling the power of the main quake, at magnitude 7.5. By evening, the death toll had climbed to more than 3,700 across both countries, according to Reuters, and was expected to continue to rise.</p>



<p>Most of Turkey sits on a small tectonic plate that is sandwiched between two slowly colliding behemoths: the vast Eurasian Plate to the north and the Arabian Plate to the south. As those two plates push together, Turkey is being squeezed out sideways, like a watermelon seed snapped between two fingers, says seismologist Susan Hough of the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>





<p>The entire country is hemmed in by strike-slip, or sideways-sliding, fault zones: the North Anatolian Fault that runs roughly parallel to the Black Sea, and the East Anatolian Fault, near the border with Syria. As a result, Turkey is highly seismically active. Even so, Monday’s quake, which occurred on the East Anatolian Fault, was the strongest to strike the region since 1939, when a magnitude 7.8 quake killed 30,000 people.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> talked with Hough, who is based in Pasadena, Calif., about the quake, its aftershocks and building codes. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: You </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SeismoSue/status/1622411773382115330" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>say on Twitter</strong></a><strong> that this was a powerful quake for a strike-slip fault. Can you explain?</strong><br><br><strong>Hough</strong>: The world has seen bigger earthquakes. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">Subduction zones generate the biggest earthquakes</a>, as much as magnitude 9 (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). But quakes close to magnitude 8 are not common on strike-slip faults. But because they’re on land and tend to be shallow, you can get severe … shaking close to the fault that’s moving.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Some of the aftershocks were very strong, at magnitudes 7.5 and 6.7. Is that unusual?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hough</strong>: As with a lot of things, there’s what’s expected on average, and there’s what’s possible. On average, the largest aftershocks are a full unit smaller than the main shock. But that’s just average; for any individual main shock, the largest aftershock can have a lot of variability.</p>



<p>The other thing people noted was the distance [between the main shock and some aftershocks over a hundred kilometers away]. Aftershock as a term isn’t precise. What is an aftershock isn’t something that seismologists are always clear on. The fault that produced the main shock is 200 kilometers long, and that’s going to change the stress in a lot of areas. Mostly it releases stress, but it does increase stress in some areas. So you can get aftershocks along that fault, but also some distance away. It’s a little bit unusual, but not unheard of.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: People have wondered whether Monday’s magnitude 3 earthquake near Buffalo, N.Y., might be related.</strong></p>





<p><strong>Hough</strong>: A magnitude 7.8 quake generates [seismic] waves that you can record all around Earth, so it’s technically disrupting every point on Earth. So it’s not a completely outlandish idea, but it’s statistically exceedingly unlikely. Maybe if a seismic wave passed through a fault that was just ready to go in just the right way, it’s possible.</p>



<p>An interesting [and completely separate] idea is that you might get earthquakes around the perimeter of the Great Lakes [such as near Buffalo] because as the lake levels go up and down, you’re stressing the Earth’s crust, putting weight on one side or the other. That’s a source of stress that could give you these pretty small quakes.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: The images emerging from this deadly disaster are devastating.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hough</strong>: It’s hard to watch. And it hammers home the importance of building codes. One of the problems that any place is up against is that building codes improve over time, and you’ve always got the problem of older structures. It’s really expensive to retrofit. I expect that earthquake engineers will be looking at the damage, and it will illuminate where the vulnerabilities are [in the area]. The hope is that with proper engineering, we can make the built environment safe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-recognize-photo-self-aware">Fish can recognize themselves in photos, further evidence they may be self-aware</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some fish can recognize their own faces in photos and mirrors, an ability usually attributed to humans and other animals considered particularly brainy, such as chimpanzees, scientists report. Finding the ability in fish suggests that self-awareness may be far more widespread among animals than scientists once thought.</p>



<p>“It is believed widely that the animals that have larger brains will be more intelligent than animals of the small brain,” such as fish, says animal sociologist Masanori Kohda of Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan. It may be time to rethink that assumption, Kohda says.</p>





<p>Kohda’s previous research showed that bluestreak cleaner wrasses can pass the mirror test, a controversial cognitive assessment that purportedly reveals self-awareness, or the ability to be the object of one’s own thoughts. The test involves exposing an animal to a mirror and then surreptitiously putting a mark on the animal’s face or body to see if they will notice it on their reflection and try to touch it on their body. Previously only a handful of large-brained species, including chimpanzees and other great apes, dolphins, elephants and magpies, have passed the test.</p>



<p>In a new study, cleaner fish that passed the mirror test were then able to distinguish their own faces from those of other cleaner fish in still photographs. This suggests that the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2208420120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fish identify themselves</a> the same way humans are thought to — by forming a mental image of one’s face, Kohda and colleagues report February 6 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>“I think it’s truly remarkable that they can do this,” says primatologist Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta who was not involved in the research. “I think it’s an incredible study.”</p>



<p>De Waal is quick to point out that failing the mirror test should not be considered evidence of a lack of self-awareness. Still, scientists have struggled to understand why some species that are known to have complex cognitive abilities, such as monkeys and ravens, have not passed. Researchers have also questioned whether the test is appropriate for species like dogs that rely more on scent, or like pigs that may not care enough about a mark on their bodies to try to touch it.</p>



<p>The mixed results in other animals make it all the more astonishing that a small fish can pass. In their first mirror test studies, published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, Kohda’s team exposed wild-caught cleaner fish in separate tanks to mirrors for a week. The researchers then injected brown dye just beneath the scales on the fish’s throats, making a mark that resembles the parasites these fish eat off the skin of larger fish in the wild. When the marked fish saw themselves in a mirror, they began striking their throats on rocks or sand in the bottom of the tank, apparently trying to scrape off the marks.</p>



<p>In the new study, 10 fish that passed the mirror test were then shown a photo of their own face and a photo of an unfamiliar cleaner fish face. All the fish acted aggressively toward the unfamiliar photo, as if it were a stranger, but were not aggressive toward the photo of their own face.</p>



<p>When another eight fish that had spent a week with a mirror but had not previously been marked were shown a photo of their own face with a brown mark on the throat, six of them began scraping their throats just like the fish that passed the mirror test. But they did not scrape when shown a photo of another fish with a mark.</p>





<p>Animals that recognize their reflection in the mirror most likely first learn to identify themselves by seeing that the movement of the animal in the mirror matches their own movement, researchers think. Because the cleaner fish were also able to recognize their own faces in still images, they, and possibly other animals that have passed the mirror test, may be able to identify themselves by developing a mental image of their own face that they can compare to what they see in the mirror or photos, the authors say.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a great next step,” says comparative cognitive psychologist Jennifer Vonk of Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., who wasn’t involved in the study. But she would like to see more research before drawing conclusions about what’s being represented in the mind of a nonverbal being like a fish. “As with most other studies, it still leaves some room for further follow-up.”</p>



<p>Kohda’s lab has more experiments planned to continue to probe what’s going on in the brain of the cleaner fish, and to try the new photo-recognition method on another popular research fish, the three-spined stickleback (<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em>).</p>



<p>Animal behaviorist Jonathan Balcombe, author of the book<em> What a Fish Knows</em>, is already convinced, describing the new study as “robust and quite brilliant.” People shouldn’t be surprised that fish could be self-aware given that they have already been shown to have complex behavior including tool use, planning and collaboration, Balcombe says. “It’s time we stopped thinking of fishes as somehow lesser members of the vertebrate pantheon.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/02/06/denoising-diffusion-models-for-neuroscience/">Denoising diffusion models for neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                <p>2022 was the year of generative AI models: DALL-E 2, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, and Imagen all showed that it’s possible to generate grounded, photorealistic images. These generative AIs are instances of conditional <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">denoising diffusion probabilistic models</a>, or DDPMs. Despite these flashy applications, DDPMs have thus far had little impact on neuroscience.</p>

<p>I want to change that! I think DDPMs are very cool models. Not only can they be used to generate oil paintings of cute sloth birthday parties, but they’re also useful, general-purpose generative models: tractable, and easy to train. Perhaps surprisingly, they’re also related to a lot of common models in neuroscience, like hierarchical Bayesian predictive coding models and Hopfield networks. They contain a lot of interesting ideas about how the brain might implement complex generative models, and I think they would benefit from being studied from a neuroscience perspective.</p>



<p>I wrote this article both for neuroscientists who want to keep up with the latest in ML, and for ML practitioners who are curious about neuroscience. First, I give a high-level overview of diffusion models, how to train them and how they compare and contrast to other generative models. I won’t get into the math but I’ll give references to tutorial introductions if you’re interested in that. I’ll discuss current applications in neuroscience, and speculate about some potential future applications. Finally, I’ll relate the structure of DDPMs to some common neuroscience models like Hopfield networks and Bayesian predictive coding. Let’s get started!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How DDPMs work</h2>



<p>DD<strong>PM</strong>s are generative <strong>P</strong>robability <strong>M</strong>odels: they learn a complex probability distribution p(<strong>x<sub>0</sub></strong>) from empirical data. Here <strong>x</strong> is a D-dimensional vector representing an image, sounds, time series, graphs, etc. To generate a new sample from a learned <strong>D</strong>DPM, you repeatedly apply a <strong>D</strong>enoiser – a deep neural network like a U-Net or a transformer – to noise vectors. Think of these noise vectors as the latent variables of the model. At the end of the process, a sample is generated. It’s a little bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">pareidolia</a> (seeing faces in clouds): if I present a bunch of noise stimuli (e.g. clouds) to a human, and ask them what they see, they’ll generate a probability distribution over familiar things (e.g. faces). This process thus maps noise to a learned probability distribution.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Training a DDPM</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><em>This section follows the exposition from Kevin Murphy’s second book, Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html" target="_blank">A free draft of the book is here</a>. Another great resource is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://calvinyluo.com/2022/08/26/diffusion-tutorial.html" target="_blank">Calvin Luo’s blog post</a>.</em></p>



<p>But how do you learn a DDPM? Rather than repeat all the math from other excellent tutorials, I will to give you a flavour of why DDPMs are built the way they are, how they’re trained, and give you a bit of wayfinding so you can learn independently.</p>

Data is on the left, noise on the right. We learn a denoising DNN <strong>μ</strong>(x<sub>t</sub>, t). From Kevin Murphy’s book.</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Training D<strong>D</strong>PMs involves two <strong>d</strong>iffusion processes. First, a word of warning: the diagram that you will see in every DDPM paper to illustrate these processes, by convention, has samples on the left (<strong>x</strong><sub>0</sub>), and noise on the right (<strong>x</strong><sub>T</sub>). I think that’s very confusing, because usually we’re going from noise to sample (right to left), and the diagram breaks expectations about how you should read it, so watch out for that.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>forward</strong> process first (left to right): Take any probability distribution and add a little bit of normal noise to it, while also rescaling it; if you repeat this process enough times, you will obtain a normal distribution. This is a consequence of the central limit theorem. This process is Markovian (q(x<sub>T</sub>) = <strong>Π</strong> q(x<sub>t</sub>|x<sub>t-1</sub>) q(x<sub>0</sub>)). Each of the probability distributions in this expression has a simple Gaussian functional form, save for q(x<sub>0</sub>).</p>



<p>Our goal is to learn the <strong>reverse</strong> process: going from noise to samples, right to left. We write another Markov chain, p(x<sub>0</sub>) = <strong>Π</strong> p(x<sub>t-1</sub>|x<sub>t</sub>) p(x<sub>T</sub>). If we want p(x<sub>0</sub>) to approximate q(x<sub>0</sub>), the diffusion kernel p(x<sub>t-1</sub>|x<sub>t</sub>) has to be different for different x<sub>t</sub>: it has to be a biased diffusion process, otherwise we’d just turn noise into noise. We keep the same functional form for the diffusion kernel – a normal distribution – but we make its mean depend on x<sub>t</sub> via a deep neural network <span style="text-align: start"><strong>μ</strong></span>(x<sub>t</sub>, t).</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem like we’ve accomplished much thus far, but here comes the magic: you can write down an expression for the likelihood of different samples (q(x<sub>0</sub>)) in terms of ratios of p’s and q’s. You can lower-bound these expressions using Jensen’s inequality – the ELBO, or evidence lower bound, the same trick used in VAEs – and now you’ve got an expression involving the KL divergences of different Gaussian distributions. All of these KL divergences can be calculated symbolically, a bunch of stuff cancels out, you’re left with a really simple expression for the ELBO. It turns out you can then optimize using this straightforward algorithm:</p>

<p>Here, ϵ(x) is a deep neural network (a U-Net or transformer) that takes a sample and predicts the noise that was added into it: the denoiser. The DDPM learning algorithm holds in five lines of pseudo-code. It’s quite accessible for us mere mortals: you can code and train a DDPM in an afternoon. Yet, the structure of a DDPM is quite rich, and it is very flexible. That’s a big reason why I find DDPMs so interesting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sampling</h3>



<p>Sampling is done by running the learned denoising process many times, starting from noise samples p(x<sub>T</sub>). You denoise, add a little bit of noise, denoise, add a little bit of noise, etc. until you have a sample. That can be pretty slow, but there are strategies to accelerate. The most common is probably DDIM (the I is for implicit), which removes the continuous addition of noise with a modified sampling chain. With DDIM, you only take one noise sample p(x<sub>T</sub>), and the rest of the chain is deterministic. It’s possible to take DDIM samples from a vanilla-trained DDPM; you can reduce the number of sampling steps from, say, 1024, down to a more manageable 16 or so without much loss in sample quality. Because DDIM sampling is deterministic after the initial noise injection, it preserves the latent structure of the model, so you can use it for things like latent space interpolation.</p>

<p>So far I’ve focused on unconditional DDPMs, but it’s just as easy to build a conditional DDPM. The most common way to condition during training and generation is to take the conditioning information, pass it through an MLP, and let it bias the denoiser every denoising iteration. The timestep <em>t</em> is also embedded in this way. Biasing can be done by changing the mean and scale of different feature maps of the U-Net, or by biasing attentional blocks. This mechanism is very flexible; to take a specific example, <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion">latent diffusion</a>, which drives Stable Diffusion, can condition on:</p>



<ul>
<li>text via a dense CLIP-based embedding</li>



<li>one-hot encoded image categories</li>



<li>segmentation masks</li>



<li>other images (e.g. for image-to-image translation or upsampling)</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional way of conditioning DDPMs only at generation time. This late-binding is a bit of a mindfuck so bear with me or skip to the next section. The DDPM likelihood (reverse chain) can be multiplied with other distributions (e.g. priors) easily. Because each diffusion step moves the distribution only a little, it turns out that multiplying by a prior ends up only changing the mean of each diffusion step (see Appendix Table 1 in Sohl-Dickstein 2015). That means you can add a late-bound generation “penalty” (the log of the prior) to bias the generation. This trick is used in both <a href="https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion">classifier-guided diffusion</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598">classifier-free guided diffusion</a> to improve visual quality of generation. Basically, they bias the generation process away from low-quality, easily confusable images towards canonical, visually striking poses.</p>

<p>This late binding opens up many possibilities: sometimes you need to generate images which are just slightly off of the image manifold. Here I show a toy example of using a late-bound critic to make a batch of samples more easily discriminable from each other. I trained a vanilla DDPM on Google Fonts to generate lowercase letters. Next, I used the intermediate layer of an AlexNet to generate a confusion matrix to determine how likely AlexNet is to confuse these letters (see <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010522">Janini et al. 2022</a> for background information). Then I nudged the generation so that letters are less confusable according to this critic, creating a modified font with improved readability in peripheral vision. This kind of late binding is very hard to do with other types of deep generative models.</p>

<p>It can be hard to keep track of all the deep generative architectures and all their plusses and minuses: when should you use one versus another? DDPMs are frequently used in lieu of a GAN or a VAE. Compared with GANs:</p>



<ul>
<li>DDPM samples, like those from GANs, can be of very high visual (or auditory…) quality</li>



<li>DDPMs can sample from the actual distribution of the data; GANs can suffer from mode collapse</li>



<li>It’s really easy to train a DDPM, unlike a GAN which can suffer from instability</li>



<li>You can calculate a likelihood lower bound for a given sample in a DDPM, unlike a GAN</li>



<li>However, DDPMs are slower to sample (though tricks like DDIM help)</li>
</ul>



<p>DDPMs are quite similar under the hood to hierarchical VAEs. Compared with vanilla VAEs however, DDPM samples are sharper.</p>



<p>Another thing that differentiates DDPMs is that they have some unusual capabilities out of the box. That means that, for instance, they can denoise images out of the box. Upsampling, inpainting and outpainting are also straightforward.</p>



<p>They do have one big drawback compared to GANs and VAEs: the latent space of a vanilla DDPM has the same dimensionality as the data (e.g. the number of pixels). This is different than GANs or VAEs which typically have compressed latents. For some applications, compression is the whole point: <a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/07/26/dimensionality-reduction-in-neural-data-analysis/">see my previous post on dimensionality reduction in neuroscience</a>. A notable exception to this rule is <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion">latent diffusion</a>, which uses a complex pipeline involving a VQ-GAN in addition to diffusion in the compressed space; but technically, it’s not the diffusion model that learns the compressed latent, it’s the GAN. That being said, as discussed above, while DDPMs don’t have compressed latents, they do have high-dimensional latents which can be manipulated and interpolated.</p>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> DDPMs are easy to train, they generate high-quality samples, and they have some unusual properties which allow them to be used in interesting scenarios. However, they don’t have compressed latents, so we can’t use them for dimensionality reduction. That’s unfortunate for us neuroscientists because we love dimensionality reduction. So what can we use them for?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are they good for (in neuroscience)?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Generating brain-data-conditioned samples</h3>



<p>There are neuroscience applications which require generating high-quality samples. Brain decoding is a good example: you attempt to back out what a person saw (or imagined, or even dreamt) from the pattern of their brain activity. Ideally, you’d like to generate natural-looking samples. Two recent papers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06956">Chen et al. 2022</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.abstract">Takagi &amp; Nishimoto 2022</a>), which <a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/01/01/2022-in-review-neuroai-comes-of-age/">I reported on in the last post</a>, demonstrate these ideas. They mapped fMRI data to the latents of a latent diffusion model to decode images from the brain. You could imagine doing this with single neuron data as well (e.g <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aav9436">Bashivan et al. 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419303915">Ponce et al. 2019</a>).</p>

(2022).</figcaption></figure>



<p>This Brain DALL-E idea is very cool, but you might think it’s a curiosity rather than a practical idea. However, there’s a domain where generating good, brain-conditioned samples is essential. Patients with ALS or brainstem strokes can end up in a locked-in state, where they’re unable to communicate despite remaining fully conscious. This was eloquently documented in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly">The Diving Bell And The Butterfly</a>, which was dictated, letter by letter, through a series of eyeblinks by the author Jean-Dominique Bauby. It’s been recently demonstrated that we can an invasive brain-computer interface can directly read attempted speech from a patient’s brain. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2027540">Moses et al. (2021)</a> demonstrated decoding brain activity in speech-motor cortex in a locked-in patient, classifying attempted spoken words and displaying them on a screen, thus allowing the patient to communicate.</p>



<p>You could imagine pushing this idea forward by making a custom voice box for the locked-in patient. First, capture a patient’s voice and intonation in a generative model, similar to the recent <a href="https://valle-demo.github.io/">VALL-E</a> (VALL-E is a VQ-VAE, but you could also do this with a DDPM). In the case of a neurodegenerative disease, it should be possible to record a patient’s voice after the diagnosis but before being locked-in. Then one could create a voice-box BCI that sounds like the patient’s own voice, which can be deployed once the patient is unable to communicate. It sounds like science-fiction, but I don’t think this is far off.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">MRI, medical images and data augmentation</h3>



<p>We’ve seen a number of papers applying DDPMs to medical imaging and MRI data. This is less neuroscience-proper and more neurology, but you can see how these ideas could be adapted and used as neuroscience tooling. Consider a compressed sensing scenario, where one wants to infer images from sparse measurements, for example to accelerate an MRI or PET scan. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03623">It’s easy to rig up a conditional diffusion model that takes, for example, an undersampled k-space representation of an MRI and spits out a plausible corresponding brain image</a>. Not only are these images visually plausible, they come with their own error bars! It’s indeed possible to run the diffusion process several times to get multiple samples from the posterior and figure out where the model is certain of its reconstruction and where the model is just spitballing. A related application is in denoising images, whether these images are MRIs, PET scans or microscopy images (including 2p-imaging).</p>



<p>Because we can evaluate the likelihood of an image through a diffusion model, we can do <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9857019/">anomaly detection</a>, for instance to determine whether there’s a tumour in an MRI. Another application area is label-efficient segmentation. The image-space diffusion process means that the network must learn foreground/background relationships or object boundaries implicitly (this is a bit of foreshadowing for our section on how DDPMs are brain-like). <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SlxSY2UZQT">Baranchuk et al. (2022)</a> show how you can use this to do label-efficient segmentation, which could be expanded to medical images or MRIs, which are normally extremely expensive to annotate.</p>



<p>Indeed, data augmentation is something that DDPMs excel at. Learn an unconditional generative model for segmentation masks, learn a conditional generative model for an MRI, and you’ve got yourself a sequence of models that can generate fake (segmentation, MRI) pairs, which you can then use for downstream classification, defining biomarkers, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why DDPMs might be a little brain-like</h2>



<p>We’ve covered sober applications of DDPMs for neuroscience. If DDPMs become just another tool in the toolbox of neuroscience, that’s a win for neuroscience. However, I’d like to go further and claim that DDPMs might be a little brain-like. This is still highly speculative (read: half-baked), but I think there’s a real opportunity to use DDPMs as a wedge to build new neuroAI models of the brain. I’m putting this out there not as a fully worked-out proposal but to make the community aware of the opportunity and find potential collaborators.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hierarchical Bayesian predictive coding</h3>



<p>Let’s consider the current state of visual neuroAI. Convolutional neural networks trained for image classification on ImageNet have been the de facto default models of the ventral stream of the visual cortex – V1, V2, V4 and IT – over the last decade. Self-supervised models have recently been shown to be just as good as supervised CNNs at explaining the ventral stream, and are more biologically plausible (<a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/12/31/2021-in-review-unsupervised-brain-models/">see previous post on this subject</a>). However, we know many ways in which the ventral stream is different than feedforward neural nets trained with supervised or self-supervised learning. Here are 4 facts we need to reconcile with the ventral stream:</p>



<ol>
<li>The ventral stream has feedforward, recurrent and feedback connections, while CNNs only have feedforward connections</li>



<li>The ventral stream (and all of the brain) is noisy, CNNs are deterministic</li>



<li>The ventral stream is involved in visual imagery during waking, and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1234330">in dreams</a>; I have no idea how to get a CNN to dream</li>



<li>The ventral stream and humans as a whole <a href="http://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/bayesianbook.html">seem to act <em>as though</em> vision is Bayesian</a>; it’s not clear to me that CNNs do the same kind of Bayesian inference</li>
</ol>



<p>We can add more features to a basic CNN to better match the ventral stream. For instance, recurrent connections allow computations to unfold in time. While there’s nothing wrong with empirically motivated additions to CNNs, it’d be nice for additions to be more theoretically grounded.</p>



<p>Prior to CNNs taking over the study of the ventral stream, a dominant view of the visual cortex was as a hierarchical Bayesian inference machine. A prototypical example is the proposal of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12868647/">Mumford and Lee</a> (2003):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Mumford and Lee’s model, the brain is Bayesian (point 4), it contains a generative model (point 3), and inference of the contents of an image from noisy measurements from the retina involves recurrent noisy algorithms (points 1 and 2). These recurrent noisy algorithms include particle filtering, loopy belief propagation, or MCMC. There was some early progress in scaling up this idea: the <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/18/7/1527/7065/A-Fast-Learning-Algorithm-for-Deep-Belief-Nets">restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) papers</a> from Bengio &amp; Hinton from the late 2000’s cite Mumford &amp; Lee. However, the idea fizzled as discriminative approaches to classification became popular. Generative approaches are currently not competitive in explaining the ventral stream compared to other image-computable models (<a href="http://www.brain-score.org/">Brain-Score</a> and the like; see also <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=i_xiyGq6FNT">Conwell et al. 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014196118">Zhuang et al. 2021</a>).</p>



<p>I think there’s an opportunity to resurrect and modernize this class of models using DDPMs. The most straightforward mapping to the ventral stream is to think of the first half of the denoising U-Net as equivalent to a feedforward pass up the ventral stream, the second half as a backward pass; the multiple iterations of the denoiser correspond to recurrent activity. The information communicated at every denoising step back to V1 is the delta between an image and its projection on the image manifold at this point in the process, producing a nice link to predictive coding models.</p>



<p>Regardless of the exact way in which we embody these ideas, DDPMs give us access to a lot of new machinery to work with, in both discrete &amp; continuous formulations. That’s on top of related ideas of denoising score matching on probabilistic graphic models and related progress in hierarchical VAEs (see Kevin Murphy’s book for more on these subjects).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Content addressable memories and the hippocampus</h3>



<p>DDPMs are also related to ideas about content addressable memories and the hippocampus. Consider the famous <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hopfield_network">Hopfield network</a>, a recurrent neural network which stores discrete memories inside of its weights. It can retrieve memories at will as the steady state of recurrent activity: starting from an incomplete pattern, it can complete the pattern by repeated application of a simple rule. Such a content-addressable memory is often a core component of computational models of the hippocampus, for instance the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742031388X#sec4.3.20.2">Tolman-Eichenbaum machine</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png"><img data-attachment-id="8156" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2023/02/06/denoising-diffusion-models-for-neuroscience/untitled-7-3/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png" data-orig-size="472,331" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="untitled-7" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=472" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=472" alt="" class="wp-image-8156" srcset="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png 472w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=150 150w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hopfield networks can fill in missing information to retrieve partial memories; so can DDPMs. <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/">From this excellent blog post</a> on modern Hopfield networks.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I like to think of DDPMs as continuous content-addressable memories. Corrupted images can be retrieved by the repeated application of the denoiser. Importantly, the network stores continuous memories: instead of representing discrete memories (mixture of Dirac deltas) like a Hopfield network, they represent an ensemble of memories (continuous distribution). DDPMs can recover from different corruptions, including additive noise and masking.</p>



<p>Lest we think that this analogy is a bit vacuous, DDPMs are capable of complex tasks traditionally ascribed to the hippocampus. A striking example is the recent work from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11495">Harvey et al. 2022</a>, who showed that you could train a DDPM to generate hour-long videos. They took videos of a car driving in a virtual environment, and let the DDPM learn conditional generation, for example predicting the next frame in a sequence from the previous 4. By repeating this process with different temporal horizons, the model could generate hour-long videos of a car driving through the town, starting from a random location hallucinated by unconditional sampling (<a href="https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/2022/05/20/flexible-diffusion-modeling-of-long-videos/">see samples here</a>).</p>

From Harvey et al. (2022)</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s really quite striking that this simple model learned to generate complex sequences from scratch. In fact, it’s possible to map back hallucinated sequences to locations within the virtual town where the sequence was generated, and in most cases, the sequences are spatially coherent. Occasionally, the denoiser gets confused and warps to a different part of the map, relying on landmarks to do its thing. I think it’s really interesting how the generative task learned by the DDPM coaxes it to memorize and navigate through an environment, and how this could relate to the hippocampus’ role in navigation and memory.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">As separate objects of study</h3>



<p>I hope to have convinced you that DDPMs are sufficiently analogous to the brain to advance the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03718">neuroAI research programme</a>. However, if it turns out, after careful study, that these machines are mechanistically quite different than the brain (Marr’s level 3), they might still contain some insights about the brain’s goals and potential algorithmic solutions (Marr’s levels 1 and 2). I think that neuroAI and AI itself would benefit from studying how DDPMs work and what they’re capable of. There are some really interesting potential insights into human visual cognition lurking inside these models.</p>

<p>For example, I’ve mentioned previously that DDPMs are useful for unsupervised segmentation. As part of their objective to model the distribution of natural images, they perform what appears to be implicit, approximate segmentation, propagating information about object relationships across long distances, all in the service of generating spatially coherent images. This opens up a number of follow-up questions, for example, are DDPMs susceptible to foreground/background illusions, like Kanisza squares? Can they solve Mooney images? More generally, do they follow Gestalt rules? We can take <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/5zf4s/">recent criticisms of feedforward CNNs as models of vision</a> as compendia of interesting phenomena that should be investigated in DDPMs.</p>



<p>Of key importance in these investigations is carefully controlling the natural image dataset DDPMs are trained on. ImageNet is not representative of what’s ecologically relevant to primates: it has too many dogs and not enough faces and body parts. Using ImageNet might be acceptable when the task is just a means to an end (e.g. learning good general-purpose features in a self-supervised manner), but not when the task is learning the manifold of images. We should carefully comparatively study DDPM behaviour trained on ImageNet or LAION vs. ecologically motivated datasets, e.g. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2011417118">EcoSet</a> and <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/opmi/article/doi/10.1162/opmi_a_00039/97495/SAYCam-A-Large-Longitudinal-Audiovisual-Dataset">SAYCam</a>.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>DDPMs are a class of conditional generative models that have found widespread use in generating images, sounds and time series. They strike a nice balance between complexity of implementation, flexibility, ease of sampling and evaluation. They may be useful in neuroscience where we need to generate fake data – for semi-supervised learning or for decoding. However, there’s a wider and more speculative horizon of possible links to neuroscience: hierarchical Bayesian models and content-addressable memories. It’ll be really interesting to break these models apart and figure out how they really work.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/green-infrastructure-inequity">Many plans for green infrastructure risk leaving vulnerable people out</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve noticed more lush medians and plant-covered roofs in cities, it’s not your imagination.</p>



<p>Incorporating more natural elements in urban landscapes is a growing management solution for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">the planet’s increasing climate hazards</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). Rain gardens, green roofs and landscaped drainage ditches are all examples of what’s known as green infrastructure, and are used to manage stormwater and mitigate risks like flooding and extreme heat. These strategies sometimes double as a community resource, such as a recreational space.</p>





<p>But a major problem with green infrastructure is that the planning processes for the projects often fail to consider equity and inclusion, says Timon McPhearson, an urban ecologist and director of the Urban Systems Lab in New York City, which researches how to build more equitable, resilient and sustainable cities. Without an eye on equity, plans might exclude those most vulnerable to climate disasters, which typically include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-united-nations-ipcc-report-people-nature">low-income communities or minority groups</a> (<em>SN: 2/28/22</em>).</p>



<p>There has been talk of fostering equity and inclusion in urban planning for some time, McPhearson says, but he wanted to know if there had been any follow-through. After analyzing 122 formal plans from 20 major U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Detroit and Sacramento, he and colleagues found that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204622002407#f0010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most government-affiliated green infrastructure plans are falling short</a>. The researchers focused on plans produced or directly supervised by city governments, as non-profit organizations tend to be more inclusive, the study says.</p>



<p>Over 90 percent of plans didn’t use inclusive processes to design or implement green infrastructure projects, meaning communities targeted for upgrades often didn’t have a chance to weigh in with their needs throughout the process. What’s more, only 10 percent of plans identified causes of inequality and vulnerability in their communities. That matters because without acknowledging the roots of injustices, planners are unable to potentially address them in future projects. And only around 13 percent of plans even defined equity or justice, the researchers report in the January <em>Landscape and Urban Planning</em>.</p>



<p>Such inadequate plans can perpetuate existing inequalities that are part of an “ongoing legacy of historically racist policies,” McPhearson says, including <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited access to heat- and pollution-relieving green spaces</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479721006149?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proper stormwater management</a>.</p>



<p>“We have an opportunity with green infrastructure to invest in a way that can help solve multiple urban problems,” McPhearson says. “But only if we focus it in the places where there is the most need.”</p>



<p>One reason behind poor urban planning practices is a lack of recognition that infrastructure can be harmful, says Yvette Lopez-Ledesma, the senior director for community-led conservation at The Wilderness Society in Los Angeles, who wasn’t involved in the study. For instance, when cities build stormwater channels but not bridges, locals are left without a way to safely cross. City planners also often lack the training and education to implement more inclusive methods.</p>



<p>But there’s hope. The researchers identified three areas that need more work. First, city planners need to clearly define equity and justice in planning documents to help guide their work. They also need to change planning practices to focus on inclusion by keeping communities informed and supporting their participation throughout the planning, decision-making and implementation processes. And plans need to address current and potential causes of inequality: For example, acknowledging <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/immigrants-pave-way-gentrification-black-neighborhoods">sources of gentrification</a> and identifying <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508036/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how green infrastructure could contribute to gentrification</a> further if officials aren’t careful (<em>SN: 4/18/19</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“If equity isn&#8217;t centered in your plans, then inequity is,” Lopez-Ledesma says. “You could be doing more harm.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prioritize-family-self-pandemic">We prioritize family over self, and that has real-world implications</a></h4>

              
                <p>A focus on family might be the key to personal well-being.</p>



<p>Surveys in the social sciences, such as those measuring happiness or health, tend to focus on the smallest unit: the individual. But two new studies, each surveying over 10,000 people worldwide, show that primary unit of analysis may need scaling up. One study suggests that people adhere to public health guidelines less to protect themselves than their loved ones. And the other study provides an explanation for why that may be the case: People the world over prioritize family happiness over their own.</p>





<p>Neither research team defined the term “family,” instead allowing respondents to interpret the term as they saw fit. As such, the results suggest that the exact nature of family, whether nuclear, blood-related or extended, does not matter.</p>



<p>The findings have important implications for society, says Karen Bogenschneider, a family policy expert at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was not involved with either study. That’s because policy makers occasionally rely on research findings to develop programs such as those aimed at reducing substance abuse or inequality. When researchers frame societal issues in terms of the individual or community, so too do policy makers. And those programs may be less effective as a result.</p>



<p>For instance, several studies in the past couple decades have shown that including family members in addiction treatment programs <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1533256X.2020.1870287" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowers the addict’s risk of relapse and improves family relationships</a>.</p>



<p>Moreover, these studies challenge the assumption that individualism has turned <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-catholic-church-may-have-helped-spark-western-individualism">the self into the most important unit of survival</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/19</em>).</p>



<h4>Family bonds drove individuals to adopt pandemic-related health behaviors</h4>



<p>The idea that policy makers can target family to change behavior comes as no surprise to Martha Newson, an anthropologist at Kent University in England. For years, Newson has studied <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-studies-explore-why-ordinary-people-turn-terrorist">a concept known as fusion</a>, where an individual becomes so enmeshed in a larger social unit that she or he is willing to sacrifice personal well-being, or even survival, for the group (<em>SN: 6/23/16</em>).</p>



<p>At the onset of the pandemic, Newson and her team began studying how social fusion might be influencing behavior around the world during the pandemic. </p>





<p>From March to May 2020, over 13,000 participants from 122 countries were shown a sequence of five pictures, each with two circles, one for the self and the other for a given group such as family, country or all of humankind. In the first picture, the circles are far apart, but in subsequent pictures they grow closer and closer together until they fully overlap. Participants had to select one of the five pictures to indicate their level of fusion with the group. A participant had to select the fully overlapping circles to be considered fused to the group.</p>



<p>Participants also filled out scales to indicate how much they had performed a given public health action, such as social distancing or masking, in the previous week.</p>



<p>Participants who were fused to family were overrepresented among those reporting <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add3715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong adherence to public health guidelines</a>, Newson and colleagues reported January 13 in <em>Science Advances. </em>For instance, despite representing roughly a quarter of the participant pool, participants with strong family bonds constituted three-quarters of those who reported following social distancing guidelines. And almost half of participants with strong family bonds reported frequent handwashing compared with about one-third of participants with weaker family bonds.</p>



<p>Humans evolved in small-scale societies, Newson says. “When we have crises … these smaller units remain very important.”</p>



<h4>On average, people value family happiness more than their own</h4>



<p>Meanwhile, another group of researchers had begun to question the widely accepted belief that many happy individuals sum up to a happy society. That idea originated in the West, and has often been treated as universal, says Kuba Krys, a cross-cultural psychologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.</p>



<p>But research over the years has indicated that non-Westerners may not value personal happiness as much as people in the West. For instance, outside the West, people tend to see <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness as more interdependent</a>, or grounded in harmony and balance with others, than independent, or grounded in the self<em>.</em></p>



<p>If happiness exists at least partially outside the individual, then Krys and his team wondered what unit researchers should study. They looked to family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team had roughly 13,000 participants from 49 countries indicate how much the perfect or ideal person would agree with statements in two commonly used surveys of well-being. Statements appeared both in the standard “I” framing and in a new family framing. For instance, participants reflected on how the ideal person would respond to both the statements, “In most ways, my life is close to ideal” and “In most ways, the life of my family is close to ideal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly half of the participants valued family well-being over personal well-being, while less than a third preferred their own happiness, the team reports in an upcoming paper in the <em>Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology</em>. Moreover, participants in even the most individualistic countries, including the United States, valued family, on average, more than self.</p>

<h3>Family first</h3>



<p>Cultural psychologists asked roughly 13,000 people from 49 countries to reflect on their ideal happiness. On average, people worldwide idealized family happiness over personal happiness, the team found. This pattern held true even in the individualistic United States, where almost half of the 446 total participants prioritized family over self.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The word “family” has become associated with conservativism, Krys says. But family remains central to people’s lives, regardless of geography or political affiliation. “The shape of family has changed but family as an idea, as a basic unit, has not changed,” he says. “I would advise progressives … not to be afraid of touching on family topics.”</p>



<p>Bogenschneider’s research backs up this point. In a study of more than 200 state legislators, she and colleagues found that while abortion and same-sex marriage remain highly polarized, policy makers tend to view other family issues, such as those involving domestic violence, juvenile crime or teen pregnancy, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32969679/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as largely bipartisan</a>.</p>



<p>This suggests that issues that aren’t typically centered around family, such as climate change or inequality, could be framed in terms of family to garner wider support, Bogenschneider says. Researchers who are seeking to translate their findings into policy and advocates who are advancing particular causes could, she adds, “elevate policy makers’ interest in those issues by focusing on families and family contributions.”</p>

<p>Anna Abalkina noticed something odd about a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcop.22664">psychology paper</a> on the “modern problems of youth extremism”: The corresponding author was affiliated with a university in Russia, but his email address had a domain name from India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The unusual domain name was part of a pattern Abalkina, of the Freie Universität Berlin, noticed in hundreds of papers that seemed to have been produced by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">paper</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/09/physics-publisher-retracting-nearly-500-likely-paper-mill-papers/">mills</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six of those papers, including the one on youth extremism, had been published in the <em>Journal of Community Psychology</em>, a Wiley title. Dorothy Bishop, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, conducted a detailed review of the six articles, along with the published referee reports and editorial correspondence on Publons, to see if anything else about them was amiss.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126509"></span>



<p>Bishop and Abalkina, who partners with us on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journals Checker</a><em>, </em>published their findings in a PsyAviv <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/2yf8z/">preprint</a> posted Sept. 5, 2022.</p>



<p>The six papers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcop.22664">were</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcop.22533">published</a> in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22597">2021</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22707">2022</a> and have received a total of five citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Topics included <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcop.22684">the psychology of human beings within urban environments</a>, and ways people <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22683">might exploit public opinion to manage their social lives</a>.</p>



<p>Besides the fishy email domains, other red flags in the articles included a disorganized structure that made it hard to follow the experiments described, and no attention to ethical review even of experiments involving human subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All six papers had serious flaws; we judged that none would be published if proper peer review and editorial scrutiny had taken place,” Abalkina and Bishop write.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Abalkina and Bishop submitted their preprint to the <em>Journal of Community Psychology</em> prior to posting it to PsyArxiv, as what they called a “stress test” to determine if their work would also be posted with little oversight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the contrary, they received a desk rejection from Michael B. Blank, the journal’s editor in chief. Blank, of the University of Pennsylvania, justified the rejection, in an email obtained by <em>Retraction Watch</em>, with a single sentence: “This is a weak paper based on cursory review of six publications.”</p>



<p>Three days after the preprint was posted, Michael Streeter, Wiley’s Director for Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics, wrote to Abalkina and Bishop to introduce himself and acknowledge the issues they raised. He promised a full investigation, adding: “We are grateful for your ongoing commitment to uphold the integrity of the scholarly record.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The journal retracted all six articles on January 28, citing Abalkina and Bishop’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notices are identical, except for inserting the different online publication dates of the various articles. A representative notice stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The above article published online on May 15, 2021 in Wiley Online Library (<a href="http://wileyonlinelibrary.com/">wileyonlinelibrary.com</a>), has been retracted by agreement between the Editor, Michael Blank, and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. Following publication, concerns were raised by a third party.1 Further investigation by the publisher revealed concerns about authorship and peer review. The Editor has determined that the article does not meet the required scholarly standards of the journal, and has therefore taken the decision to retract the article. The authors have been informed of this decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Writing to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, Bishop noted that Wiley’s retraction in January – based on information provided in September &#8212; was speedy: “this is a relatively prompt response compared to what we often see.”</p>



<p>She added, however, that this prompt redress does not resolve the question of how fraudulent papers appeared in the journal in the first place. She credited open peer review with enabling her and Abalkina to prove the fraud, as they could identify suspicious email addresses and also examine the published records of peer review to identify issues.</p>



<p>Blank and Streeter have not replied to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We wondered how Wiley informed the authors of the decision to retract, given that none of their email addresses worked when we attempted to contact them, and many author’s identities appear to be dubious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As part of our retraction process, which is aligned with COPE guidelines, we attempted to reach all corresponding and co-authors to communicate the retraction decision. Emails were sent on December 23, 2022 to email addresses in our submission system for the journal. We did not receive a reply from any of the authors that we contacted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The information that we found online for the authors does not match what is published in the articles. Sometimes the discrepancies are minor, such as a different middle initial. In other cases, we could not find any online presence for the authors at all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-animal-collaboration-dolphins-brazil">Here are 3 people-animal collaborations besides dolphins and Brazilians</a></h4>

              
                <p>We’ve all heard that dogs are a man’s best friend, but our canine companions don’t make up the entirety of humankind’s friend circle. Humans have cooperated with wild animals throughout our evolutionary history, forming reciprocally beneficial relationships known to biologists as mutualisms.</p>



<p>One particularly piscine partnership that made headlines recently can be found in Brazil, where fishers catch nets full of fish with the aid of the local bottlenosed dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus gephyreus</em>). </p>



<p>This team-up started over a century ago, probably when fishers first noticed that the presence of dolphins was a clue that fish were hiding in the murky water, says Mauricio Cantor, a behavioral ecologist at Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute in Newport.</p>





<p>“The dolphins are really good at detecting fish and herding them toward the coast,” he says, “and the fishers are really good at trapping the fish with their net.” Once the fish are mostly secured in the net, the dolphins are sure to snag a few for themselves.</p>



<p>In a study published January 30 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, Cantor and colleagues used long-term data to show that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207739120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dolphins and fishers respond to cues from the other</a>, and without experienced partners who know the right dance steps, the routine falls apart. “This is a really remarkable and impressive study,” says Pat Shipman, an anthropologist at Penn State University who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>This fishing partnership is an important part of the cultural identity of both the fishers and the dolphins, but Cantor and his colleagues’ work shows that <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the practice is in decline</a>. And among human-animal partnerships, it’s not alone. “Most of the historical cases are declining or already gone,” Cantor says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given their rarity and charm, let’s take a look at some of the other known examples of human-animal cooperation.</p>



<h4>People used to team up with orcas to hunt whales in southeastern Australia</h4>



<p>The bottlenosed isn’t the only dolphin that humans have formed beneficial arrangements with. In the 1800s, several hunters began working with a pod of orcas (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) to catch large whales. At Twofold Bay in southeastern Australia, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279302786992694#:~:text=These%20sources%20indicate%20that%20cooperative,beyond%20the%20acquisition%20of%20food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some orcas would find and harass a whale to tire it out, while others swam to alert whaling crews</a> (made up of Aboriginal Australians and Scottish immigrants) that they’d found prey.</p>





<p>Once the whalers arrived and harpooned the whale, they let the orcas eat the tongue — a delicacy in the killer whale culinary world — before taking the rest for themselves.</p>



<p>While the dolphins and fishers in Brazil were chasing the same prey — schools of migratory mullet (<em>Mugil liza</em>) — the orcas and whalers were mostly after different things. The key similarity, Cantor says, is that there’s enough prey for everyone, so that no competition arises to spoil the partnership.</p>



<p>This relationship ultimately ended when some settlers killed two orcas, which drove the cooperative pod away from the bay, seemingly never to hunt with humans again.</p>



<h4>These birds guide people to honey in Africa</h4>



<p>Sometimes, a name says it all. Such is the case for the greater honeyguide (<em>Indicator indicator</em>), which has been labeled in both English and Latin based on its most famous trait. These birds live in sub-Saharan Africa, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-birds-communicate-collaborate">cooperate with local honey hunters</a> to gain access to succulent beeswax (<em>SN: 7/21/16</em>).</p>



<p>Birds, like humans, don’t like to be stung by bees, so a honeyguide that’s hankering for beeswax will chirp at a person to signal that they should follow. The <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(22)01398-7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeyguide then leads the hunters to a bee nest</a> and lets them do the dirty work of harvesting it.</p>

<p>Like with orcas, honeyguides and humans are after different parts of the prize: Humans want the honey, while the birds want the wax. Honeyguides are so helpful for finding bee nests that the Borana people of East Africa blow a special whistle called a “fuulido<em>”</em> to summon them when it’s time for a honey hunt.</p>



<p>Similar to the dolphins in Brazil, the relationship with honeyguides is an important part of many African cultures. Legend even has it that a scorned honeyguide, if denied beeswax on prior hunts, will lead the hunters not to delicious honey but instead into the jaws of a dangerous predator, like a lion.</p>



<h4>Wolves and people were once on the same side when hunting big game</h4>



<p>To see the most extreme outcome of human-animal partnership, take a look at 39 percent of the country’s beds, couches and backyards. That’s about how many households in the United States own a dog. But it turns out a canine doesn’t have to be domesticated to get along with humans; Indigenous stories from peoples in North America describe cooperating with gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) to hunt big game like elk and mammoths.</p>



<p>The wolves would run down the prey until it tired, and humans would make the kill once they caught up. Because these prey items were so massive (like the large schools of mullet), it didn’t matter that <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-ethnobiology/volume-35/issue-2/etbi-35-02-262-285.1/Relationships-Between-Indigenous-American-Peoples-and-Wolves-1--Wolves/10.2993/etbi-35-02-262-285.1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans and wolves were after the same thing</a> — there was plenty to go around.</p>



<p>Though this furry friendship doesn’t exist anymore, wolves are still important in many Indigenous cultures. Some even still continue the practice of leaving some meat for the wolves after a hunt.</p>



<p>Though human-animal partnerships are rare and on the decline, they “give us an illustration of how positive our human interactions can be with nature,” Cantor says.</p>



<p>For Shipman, the urge to engage with other animals is a defining trait of humanity. “It’s in some ways as fundamental to humans,” she says, “as being bipedal.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/plos-price-transparency-update-2021/">PLOS Price Transparency Update 2021</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework 2021</h2>



<p><br>We encourage researchers to give transparent insight into their work for the benefit of community understanding and assessment and we want to give you the same insight into ours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the ways we do this is through the Plan S <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a>. PLOS has participated in the framework since its pilot phase in 2020<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> and we&rsquo;re pleased to once again <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">share our reporting</a> here to give our community insight into how our publication fees are used to support journal activities and operational costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Price Transparency data 2021</strong></p>



<p>Publishers completing the framework divide their Article Processing Charge (APC), per journal, into eight different services (you can find a description of these services in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/our-commitment-to-price-transparency/">last year&rsquo;s post</a>). Data for the framework is reported at the end of the following year meaning the data in the table below reflects our publication fee breakdown for the year 2021 based on the APC for a Research Article in each journal. You can find our full report from the framework in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BqQr6mGb8jedOX_ozavNT6IrfcWND1Kn/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=116331873531812821923&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Isn&rsquo;t PLOS moving beyond the APC?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! We recognize APCs are an imperfect solution for truly equitable Open Access opportunities and we&rsquo;ve been working with institutions to establish new models of Open Access support. Each of our journals offers APC-alternative models that can significantly reduce or entirely eliminate APCs for authors. In time, we believe we can entirely eliminate APCs &mdash; but there is more work ahead of us yet. By the close of 2021, PLOS had signed partnerships with 93 institutions and we&rsquo;re continuing to make this a priority. To give you a peek at our most recent data, those <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">partnerships nearly doubled in 2022</a> to include 181 institutions across 26 countries. We hope future iterations of the framework will enable us to represent this data alongside APCs. In the meantime, keep an eye on our blog for more announcements and updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>PLOS Computational Biology</td><td>PLOS Genetics</td><td>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</td><td>PLOS Pathogens</td><td>PLOS Biology</td><td>PLOS Medicine</td><td>PLOS ONE</td></tr><tr><td>2021 APC price</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$2,420</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$1,749</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for journal and community development</td><td>10%</td><td>12%</td><td>10%</td><td>11%</td><td>24%</td><td>23%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price from submission to first decision</td><td>12%</td><td>13%</td><td>10%</td><td>12%</td><td>26%</td><td>24%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for peer review management</td><td>13%</td><td>13%</td><td>10%</td><td>14%</td><td>20%</td><td>17%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services from acceptance to publication</td><td>21%</td><td>19%</td><td>18%</td><td>21%</td><td>9%</td><td>11%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services after publication</td><td>8%</td><td>7%</td><td>6%</td><td>8%</td><td>3%</td><td>4%</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for platform development</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>15%</td><td>8%</td><td>2%</td><td>7%</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for sales &amp; marketing to customers or of articles</td><td>18%</td><td>18%</td><td>21%</td><td>15%</td><td>13%</td><td>15%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for author and customer support</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>10%</td><td>2%</td><td>3%</td><td>8%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Differences in journal editorial structures and services drive variance in the percentages of the APC value allocated to each category. For PLOS, this difference is most apparent in&nbsp; <em>PLOS Biology</em>, <em>PLOS Medicine,</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em> which rely on in-house editorial teams. More detail on the operational differences of PLOS&rsquo; editorial models can be found in our original<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/"> transparency post</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may also remember 2021 as the year <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">PLOS launched new journals</a><em>. </em>Publication fee breakdown for those journals will be provided in the following year&rsquo;s report to reflect their first full year of publishing activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Comparisons to our 2020 data</strong></p>



<p>This year, we&rsquo;ve made adjustments to more accurately distribute costs previously reported in the &lsquo;Platform development&rsquo; category. Maintaining digital services that support peer review and article assessment, as well as marketing have been allocated accordingly. (The &ldquo;Platform Development&rdquo; category was introduced to the framework last year.) We&rsquo;ve also reported upper and lower bounds of institutional membership costs for our Community Action Publishing (CAP) model<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup>. CAP is a collective-action model for <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine </em>which equitably distributes the cost of highly selective publishing based on <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">several factors</a> to institutional members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there is also a natural fluctuation in the allocation of costs over time to provide further resources to specific areas of journal development. For <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em> for example, our shift to CAP required slightly higher spend to set up &lsquo;sales and marketing&rsquo; infrastructure that will enable us to expand institutional partnerships that eliminate author fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Investing in our communities</strong></p>



<p>As a nonprofit organization, our organizational activities are developed with the sole purpose of meeting the needs of researchers and reinvesting in the scholarly community in ways that support and further our <a href="https://plos.org/about/">mission</a>.</p>



<p>Many of those activities go beyond the breakdown you see here. Our highly regarded publishing ethics team works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards across the scholarly community, as well as developing policies and processes to further research integrity at our journals. We aim to help researchers increase the visibility and impact of their work by connecting authors to publication opportunities and career-building tools like our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/">Peer Review</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/">Writing Centers</a>, and through dedicated media promotion of their published articles. Staff across the organization are also passionately involved in researching, developing and implementing <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science practices</a> at scale, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">partnering with organizations</a> around the world to better understand researchers&rsquo; needs in order to make participation in the research ecosystem more transparent, efficient, and fair across all demographics, geographies, and disciplines.</p>



<p>For more information about our finances, PLOS provides an annual update on our <a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/">financial overview page</a>. We&rsquo;ve also shared our pricing information for our emerging business models in our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/faqs/">FAQs</a>. And of course, we&rsquo;ll always share updates on our work and important milestones like this one through our blogs network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-muscles-fold-mimosa-leaf">How plant ‘muscles’ fold up a mimosa leaf fast</a></h4>

              
                <p>Call them plant motors. Or plant muscles. Tiny bulges of specialized cells in a mimosa plant can fold its feathery leaflets together in seconds, then relax — and do it again.</p>



<p>A new look at these bulges on the <em>Mimosa pudica</em> plant has revealed more details of how a leaf manages its unusually fast folding, says biomechanist David Sleboda of the University of California, Irvine. “I think that these particular organs are really cool because their motion is reversible,” he says. “[W]hen people see plant motion that is reversible, it feels much more similar to animal motion.”</p>





<p>Scientists have already worked out the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.12.013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic chemistry that drives a little mimosa motor</a>, or pulvinus, he and colleagues write in a paper slated for the Feb. 6<em>&nbsp;Current Biology</em>. When a deer hoof or something else scary jostles a leaf, potassium and some other ions shift from one part of a pulvinus toward another. Water follows the swoosh of ions. Cells that lose water deflate and sag while those on the other side bloat. Distortions in multiple pulvini make the halves of a feathery leaf fold toward each other, like an invisible hand gently closing a book.</p>

<p>Instead of studying chemistry, Sleboda and colleagues looked at microscopic structural details in pulvinus cells that help create such useful distortions, he reported January 7 at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in Austin, Texas. One feature that makes plant-muscle cells bloat more efficiently is reinforcement with microscopic fibrils. They work like corsets, keeping cells from bulging out in all directions. Instead, the corset directs much of the swelling along the axis that will fold up the leaf halves.</p>



<p>Also, pulvinus cells that need to bulge fast have what look like wrinkles of easily expandable tissue for inrushing water, plus special highly porous zones called pit fields. The pits look as if water could sluice through easily in a tickled-leaf emergency. Cell arrangement itself looks specialized for expanding and shrinking. A pulvinus cross section reveals a pattern “like the bellows of a concertina,” Sleboda said.</p>

<p>The widespread <em>M. pudica</em>, or sensitive plant, is one of the better-known leaf flexors. Yet clusters of other plants in the same family, the legumes, also move their leaves, says botanist Thainara Policarpo Mendes of Universidade Estadual Paulista in Botucatu, Brazil. Some relatives close fast like <em>M. pudica</em>, but many are slower. What she also thinks about, though, is why leaves close at all. People have proposed a variety of advantages: discouraging animals from grazing on a plant that suddenly looks more sticklike, or even helping a plant lose less heat on very cold nights. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sleboda too can reel off proposed hypotheses but remains skeptical of all of them. “There’s not a ton of research,” he says. That, however, is fine with him. “My favorite thing about sensitive plants’ leaf closing,” he says, “is that we don’t know why they do it.”</p>

<p><strong>Early man in America takes a step backward</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/early-man-america-takes-step-backward"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 27, 1973 </p>



<p>“Early Americans lived among and hunted mammoth, camel, extinct horse and bison as far back as 15,000&nbsp;years. Now there is mounting evidence for a second breakthrough that will push the history of man in America back to 30,000 years — and possibly further.”</p>



<h4>Update<a id="_msocom_1"></a></h4>



<p>The question of when humans first set foot in the Americas is still hotly debated. Recent fossil and archaeological evidence suggests the first inhabitants arrived tens of thousands of years ago. For instance, humanlike <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">footprints in New Mexico date to about 20,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/21, p. 12</em>). And stone tools found in a cave <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">hint that humans resided in Mexico roughly 30,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 16</em>). Some archaeologists argue that stones caked with mastodon bone residue that were found in California were tools used by humans or their close relatives around 130,000&nbsp;years ago, although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stones-mastodon-bones-debate-america-first-settlers">that claim remains controversial</a> (<em>SN Online: 12/4/20</em>). Pinning down the timeline of human settlement could reveal how people spread across North and South America.</p>

<p>Two Korean journals last month pulled papers by a prominent cardiologist at Yonsei University, Professor <a href="https://esc365.escardio.org/person/6227">Hui-Nam Pak</a>, with one retraction notice citing “issues related to scientific misconduct.”</p>



<p>Commenters on PubPeer had raised <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/28550DDA06A74EF90C14099CDAC67C">several concerns</a> about data integrity, “mixed-up” data and “statistical nonsense” in “<a href="https://eymj.org/search.php?where=aview&amp;id=406858&amp;code=0069YMJ&amp;vmode=FULL">eNOS3 Genetic Polymorphism Is Related to Post-Ablation Early Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation</a>,” which was published in 2015 in <em>Yonsei Medical Journal</em>. The journal retracted the paper on January 19, noting that “we have recently become aware of a number of issues related to scientific misconduct.”</p>



<p>The article was coauthored by <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/patrick-t-ellinor">Patrick Ellinor</a>, acting chief of cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, and has been cited six times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126499"></span>



<p>The other paper, “Serological Predictors for the Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation After Electrical Cardioversion,” was pulled after a reader tipped the <em>Korean Circulation Journal</em> off that the authors had published a largely identical paper in a European counterpart.</p>



<p>“We received information from the reader that this article has been published in duplicate . . . in <em>EP Europace</em>. With regard to this, the corresponding author fully accepted responsibility of duplicate publication and requested” a retraction, the journal wrote in a January 11 <a href="https://e-kcj.org/search.php?where=aview&amp;id=752659&amp;code=0054KCJ&amp;vmode=FULL">notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article was published in 2010. Commenters on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/84DB8965E87DECBF05682EB8A5A5F0">flagged</a> the duplicate publication last year, noting that the two papers overlapped “significantly” in most sections. For example, the wording of the introduction in the articles is largely identical, and the conclusions have only minor changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In emails seen by Retraction Watch, a graduate of Yonsei University College of Medicine and former trainee under Pak alerted <em>EP</em> <em>Europace </em>to the redundant publication in August 2022 and the <em>Korean Circulation Journal</em> in November 2022. The person, whose name we are withholding because they fear retaliation, received replies from both publications saying they were investigating the issue.</p>



<p><a href="https://yigh.yuhs.ac/yigh/about/faculties.do?mode=view&amp;articleNo=122">Hui-Nam Pak</a>, the corresponding author on all of the papers, did not respond to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>It’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/08/10/youve-been-duped-results-so-nice-the-journals-published-them-twice/">not the first time</a> his work has been retracted. In 2016, the <em>Korean Circulation Journal</em> pulled a paper he coauthored, “Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Lead Extraction by Conventional Traction and Counter-Traction Technique”, which it had published twice “<a href="https://e-kcj.org/search.php?where=aview&amp;id=520277&amp;code=0054KCJ&amp;vmode=FULL">due to the editorial error occurred in our journal</a>.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-ice-amorphous-physics-chemistry">Water is weird. A new type of ice could help us understand why</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ice cubes float in water because they’re less dense than the liquid. But a newfound type of ice has a density <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq2105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly equal to what’s in your water glass</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 3 <em>Science</em>. If you could plop this ice in your cup without it melting immediately, it would bob around, neither floating nor sinking.</p>



<p>The new ice is a special type called an amorphous ice. That means the water molecules within it aren’t arranged in a neat pattern, as in normal, crystalline ice. Other types of amorphous ice are already known, but they have densities either lower or higher than water’s density under standard conditions. Some scientists hope this newly made amorphous ice could help solve the scientific mysteries that swirl around water.</p>





<p>To generate the new ice, scientists used a surprisingly simple technique. Called ball milling, it involves shaking a container of ice and stainless steel balls, cooled to 77 kelvins (nearly –200° Celsius). The researchers were motivated by curiosity; they didn’t expect the technique to produce a new amorphous ice. “It was a sort of Friday-afternoon idea we had, to just give it a go and see what happens,” says physical chemist Christoph Salzmann of University College London.</p>



<p>An analysis of how X-rays scattered from the frosty stuff suggested they’d created an amorphous ice. And computer simulations that mimicked the effects of ball milling revealed that a disordered structure could be produced by layers of ice sliding past one another in random directions, in response to the forces exerted by the balls.</p>



<p>“You have to be open, as a scientist, for the unexpected,” says chemical physicist Anders Nilsson of Stockholm University, who was not involved with the research. The ball milling technique, he says, “was quite innovative to do.”</p>

<p>Since the material was made by mashing up normal ice, its relationship to liquid water is unknown. It’s unclear whether it can be produced directly, by cooling liquid water. Not all amorphous ices share this connection with their liquid state.</p>



<p>If the new ice does have this link to the liquid, the ice might help scientists better understand water’s quirks. Water is puzzling because it flouts the norms for liquids. For example, whereas most liquids become denser upon cooling, water gets denser as it gets closer to 4° C, but becomes less dense as it is cooled further.</p>



<p>Many scientists suspect water’s weirdness is connected to its behavior as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stop-motion-experiment-reveals-supercooled-water-dual-nature">supercooled liquid</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>9/28/20</em>). Pure water can remain a liquid at temperatures well below freezing. Under such conditions, liquid water is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercooled-water-phase-critical-point-liquid-fluid">thought to exist in two different phases</a>, a high-density liquid and a low-density one, and that dual nature could explain water’s behavior under more typical conditions (<em>SN: 11/19/20</em>). But much remains uncertain about that idea.</p>





<p>Salzmann and colleagues suggest that the new ice could be a special form of water called a glass. Glasses can be made by cooling a liquid quickly enough that the molecules can’t rearrange into a crystal structure. &nbsp;The glass in a windowpane is an example of this kind of material, made by cooling molten silica sand, but other substances can form glasses, too.</p>



<p>If the new ice is a glass state of water, scientists would need to work out how it fits into that dual-liquid picture. And that could help scientists tease out what’s really going on at difficult-to-study supercooled conditions.</p>



<p>But some researchers are skeptical that the new material has any connection to the weird physics of liquid water. Physical chemist Thomas Loerting of the University of Innsbruck in Austria thinks that the ice is “closely related to very small, distorted ice crystals,” rather than the liquid form of water.</p>



<p>Still, earlier computer simulations have suggested that water could form glasses of a range of densities close to liquid water, says computational physicist Nicolas Giovambattista of Brooklyn College of the City University of New York. Those simulations produced structures similar to the ones seen in the computer simulation of ball milling ice, says Giovambattista, who was not involved with the new research. “It opens doors for new questions. It’s new, so what is it?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-silent-tanzania-species">A newfound ‘croakless’ frog may communicate via touch</a></h4>

              
                <p>A newfound species of frog doesn’t ribbit. In fact, it doesn’t make any sound at all.</p>



<p>Many frogs have unusual characteristics, from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-glass-frogs-blood-liver">turning translucent</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">being clumsy jumpers</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/22; 6/15/22).</em> The recently discovered amphibian lacks a voice. It joins a group of seven other voiceless frog species called spiny-throated reed frogs that reside in East Africa.</p>



<p>Instead of croaking, the spines on male frogs’ throats might help their female counterparts recognize potential mates via touch, sort of like braille, says conservation biologist Lucinda Lawson of the University of Cincinnati.</p>





<p>Lawson and colleagues spotted the little frog, only about 25 millimeters long, in 2019 while surveying wildlife in Tanzania’s Ukaguru Mountains. The team immediately recognized the animal, now named <em>Hyperolius ukaguruensis</em>, as a spiny-throated reed frog. But something seemed off.</p>



<p>“It [was] the wrong color,” Lawson says. Most frogs from this group are green and silver, but this one was gold and brown. Some quick measurements to check if the peculiar frog simply had trivial color variations or if it could be a new species revealed that its eyes were smaller than other spiny-throated reed frogs. The researchers agreed: “Let’s do some genetics,” Lawson says.</p>

<p>Each frog species in this voiceless group — including <em>H. ukaguruensis</em> — lives in its own isolated domain of forest. All seven of the previously known species are endangered or vulnerable. This seclusion makes it vital to distinguish species and get them added to the conservation priority list, Lawson says. Then, governments and organizations can begin protecting the region that the new, potentially endangered animal calls home.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-play-fighting-aggression-tell">Are your cats having fun or fighting? Here are some ways to tell</a></h4>

              
                <p>Are your cats play fighting or fighting fur real?</p>



<p>It turns out that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26121-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain behaviors in domestic cats could be telltale signs</a> that an interaction is friendly, aggressive or something in between, researchers report January 26 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>“It is a question we hear a lot from cat owners,” says cat behavior expert Mikel Delgado of Feline Minds, a cat behavior consulting company in Sacramento, Calif., who was not involved in the study. “So I was excited to see that researchers are taking on this topic.”</p>





<p>Scientists have studied cats’ social relationships — both with other cats and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-attachment-styles-people">humans</a> — but it can be tricky to tell whether two cats are playing or fighting, says veterinarian and cat behavior researcher Noema Gajdoš-Kmecová of the University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy in Košice, Slovakia (<em>SN: 9/23/19</em>). </p>



<p>Sometimes cat owners miss the signs of a tense relationship because they think their pets are just playing, which can lead to stress and illness in the animals, she says. Other times, owners rehome their cats after incorrectly assuming their pets are fighting.</p>



<p>To assess and categorize interactions, Gajdoš-Kmecová and colleagues watched about 100 videos of different cats interacting in pairs. After viewing around one-third of the videos, Gajdoš-Kmecová identified six types of behaviors, including wrestling and staying still. She then watched all of the videos and noted how often each cat exhibited one of the specified behaviors, and for how long. By running statistical analyses on the behaviors, she pinpointed three types of interactions between the cat pairs: playful, aggressive and intermediate.</p>



<p>To confirm the outcome, other members of the team also watched the videos and classified each interaction between felines.</p>



<p>Some clear connections emerged. Quietly wrestling, for instance, suggested playtime, whereas chasing and vocalizations, like growling, hissing or gurgling, implied aggressive encounters.</p>



<p>Intermediate interactions had elements of both playful and aggressive encounters, but especially included prolonged activity of one cat toward the other, such as pouncing on or grooming its fellow feline. These in-between encounters could hint that one cat wants to keep playing while the other doesn’t, with the more playful cat gently nudging to see if its partner wants to continue, the authors say.</p>





<p>This work provides initial insights into cat interactions, Gajdoš-Kmecová says, but it’s just the start. In the future, she plans to study more subtle behaviors, like ear twitches and tail swishes. Both Gajdoš-Kmecová and Delgado also stress that one contentious encounter doesn’t necessarily signal a cat-astrophic relationship.</p>



<p>“This is not just about one interaction,” Gajdoš-Kmecová says. Owners “really should look into the different, multiple interactions in multiple periods of life of the cats and then put it into context.”</p>

<p>We may never identify the earliest retracted paper. For the time being, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/14/what-did-retractions-look-like-in-the-17th-century/">this 1756 article</a> about Benjamin Franklin is the earliest one in our <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">database</a>. And here might be a runner-up, of a sort, from a friend of Franklin’s the following year. </p>



<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/">David Hume</a> is widely regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of his or any age. His writings on causality, reason, and empiricism, as well as his history of England, were considered masterpieces when they appeared in the 18th century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1757, Hume published a collection of previously released works under the title “Four Dissertations,” which helped – if that’s the right word – cement his reputation as one of the age’s leading skeptics about religion. </p>



<span id="more-126494"></span>



<p>Hume wasn’t known for holding his tongue, particularly about Christianity; his abundance of candor cost him academic positions and, occasionally, friendships (both Samuel Johnson and James Boswell decried his lack of piety).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177014/the-infidel-and-the-professor">The Infidel and the Professor</a>, a delightful 2017 book by <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/dennis-c-rasmussen">Dennis Rasmussen</a> about the close friendship between Hume and another famous Scottsman, Adam Smith, Hume was not immune to second thoughts. Missing from “Four Dissertations” were two earlier essays in which he’d questioned “the immorality of suicide and the immortality of the soul.” </p>



<p>Evidently, Hume had decided to withdraw the two articles from the collection at the urging of his friends because he feared they would spark outrage from the devout – that is to say, pretty much everyone in positions of authority in that era. In their place he substituted an essay on the less tendentious but non-trivial question of how to measure taste, sure to animate salons but hardly likely to trigger calls for excommunication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Rasmussen, a faculty member at Syracuse University, writes:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We do not know what exactly persuaded Hume to retract the essays. In 1772 he recalled having “repented” immediately after sending them to his publisher, declaring that “from my abundant Prudence I suppress’d” these pieces.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rasmussen notes in the event, Hume’s reputation as a heretic didn’t suffer. How could it with lines like:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Examine the religious principles, which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are any thing but sick men’s dreams: Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatic asseverations of a being, who dignifies himself with the name of rational. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Writes Rasmussen:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Once again, then, Hume’s response to a charge of impiety was to set about earning it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Of course, purists might quibble that Hume’s decision to drop the essays from his new collecting wasn’t technically a retraction – a distinction Rasmussen acknowledged to us in a recent email: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Maybe something like “omit” would have been better. Because … Hume wasn’t disavowing these pieces or saying that they were wrong; he just decided that it would be more prudent to leave them out. That probably doesn’t amount to a retraction in Retraction Watch’s sense. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perhaps not. But as the great thinker might have said, a thing with multiple potential causes can have the same net effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strontium-isotope-analysis-vikings-animals-england">Vikings brought animals to England as early as the year 873</a></h4>

              
                <p>Vikings brought horses and dogs to the British Isles from Scandinavia, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A chemical analysis of bone fragments from a cemetery in England provides <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first solid scientific evidence of animals traveling with Vikings across the North Sea</a>, scientists report February 1 in <em>PLOS ONE.</em></p>



<p>In the 1990s, researchers unearthed the cremated remains of a human adult and child as well as of a dog, horse and probable pig from a burial mound in a Viking cemetery in Derbyshire, England. In previous work, radiocarbon dating of femur, skull and rib fragments revealed that the inhabitants all died sometime between the eighth and 10th centuries. That date was narrowed down to the year 873, thanks to the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which records that a Viking army wintered near the site that year.</p>

<p>Where the animals came from has been a mystery. Norse raiders are known to have stolen horses from people in England around the time. And researchers have generally thought that Viking boats at the time were too small to allow for much transport of animals from Scandinavia to the British Isles. One entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes Vikings moving from France to England along with their horses in the year 892, but no physical evidence of such activity had been found before.</p>



<p>In the new work, Tessi Löffelmann and colleagues turned to certain forms, or isotopes, of strontium to unravel the individuals’ provenance. The element accumulates in bones over time through diet, leaving a distinct signature of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-hyksos-dynasty-conquered-ancient-egypt-marriage">where an individual has lived</a> (<em>SN: 4/2/19</em>).</p>





<p>Strontium ratios in the child’s remains matched those of shrubs growing at the burial site, suggesting the child spent most, if not all, of its life in England. The ratios of the adult and three animals, on the other hand, differed substantially from the local fauna, the team found. That suggests the individuals hadn’t spent much time in the country before they died. Instead, their ratios were similar to ones found in the Baltic Shield region in Norway, central and northern Sweden and Finland, suggesting a Scandinavian origin.</p>



<p>“One of the joys of isotope analysis is that you are able to really pinpoint things that previously we could discuss endlessly,” says Marianne Moen, an archeologist at the University of Oslo who was not involved in the study. Using strontium to analyze more cremated remains, which can elude common forms of isotope analysis including carbon and nitrogen, “is the next logical chapter for understanding prehistoric mobility.”</p>



<p>Isotope analysis helped reveal where these individuals lived and when they died, but it couldn’t answer why the dog, horse and pig made the journey to England in the first place. That’s where historical records can help, says Löffelmann, of Durham University in England and Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium.</p>



<p>For Löffelmann, the small sizes of early Norse ships combined with the fact that the animals and people were buried together suggest Vikings may have initially brought animals with them for companionship, not just function.</p>





<p>“It could have only been selected animals that made that journey,” she says. “They were important to what the person was.… They went through life together, and now they’re going through death.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about his work &quot;An Isotonic Model of Neuron Swelling Based on Co-Transport of Salt and Water&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neurons spend most of their energy building ion gradients across the cell
membrane. During energy deprivation the neurons swell, and the concomitant
mixing of their ions is commonly assumed to lead towards a Donnan equilibrium,
at which the concentration gradients of all permeant ion species have the same
Nernst potential. This Donnan equilibrium, however, is not isotonic, as the
total concentration of solute will be greater inside than outside the neurons.
The present theoretical paper, in contrast, proposes that neurons follow a path
along which they swell quasi-isotonically by co-transporting water and ions.
The final neuronal volume on the path is taken that at which the concentration
of impermeant anions in the shrinking extracellular space equals that inside
the swelling neurons. At this final state, which is also a Donnan equilibrium,
all permeant ions can mix completely, and their Nernst potentials vanish. This
final state is isotonic and electroneutral, as are all intermediate states
along this path. The path is in principle reversible, and maximises the work of
mixing.</p>

<p>Clues came from analyses of chemical residue inside vessels from the only known Egyptian embalming workshop and nearby burial chambers. Mummification specialists who worked there concocted <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05663-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific mixtures to embalm the head, wash the body, treat the liver and stomach, and prepare bandages that swathed the body</a>, researchers report February 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“Ancient Egyptian embalmers had extensive chemical knowledge and knew what substances to put on the skin to preserve it, even without knowing about bacteria and other microorganisms,” Philipp Stockhammer, an archaeologist at Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, said at a January 31 news conference.</p>





<p>The findings come courtesy of chemical residue inside 31 vessels found in an Egyptian embalming workshop and four vessels discovered in an adjacent pair of burial chambers. Writing on workshop vessels named embalming substances, provided embalming instructions (such as “to put on his head”) or both. All the artifacts — dating from Egypt’s 26th dynasty which rose to power between 664 B.C. and 525 B.C. — were excavated at a cemetery site called Saqqara in 2016. Archaeologist and study coauthor Ramadan Hussein, who died in 2022, led that project.</p>



<h4>Newfound mummy embalming mixtures</h4>



<p>Five of the vessels had the label <em>antiu</em>. The substance was thought to have been a fragrant resin called myrrh. The <em>antiu</em> at Saqqara, however, consisted of oil or tar from cedar and juniper or cypress trees mixed with animal fats. Writing on these jars indicates that <em>antiu</em> could have been used alone or combined with another substance called <em>sefet</em>.</p>



<p>Three vessels from the embalming workshop bore the label <em>sefet</em>, which researchers have usually described as an unidentified oil. At Saqqara, <em>sefet</em> was a scented, fat-based ointment with added ingredients from plants. Two <em>sefet</em> pots contained animal fats mixed with oil or tar from juniper or cypress trees. A third container held animal fats and elemi, a fragrant resin from tropical trees.</p>



<p>Clarification of the ingredients in <em>antiu</em> and <em>sefet</em> at Saqqara “takes mummification studies further than before,” says Egyptologist Bob Brier of Long Island University in Brookville, N.Y., who was not part of the research.</p>



<p>Egyptians may have started <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/origins-egyptian-mummy-making-may-predate-pyramids">mummifying their dead as early as 6,330 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/14</em>). Mummification procedures and rituals focused on keeping the body fresh so the deceased could enter what was believed to be an eternal afterlife.</p>





<p>Embalming and mummification procedures likely changed over time, says team member Maxime Rageot, a biomolecular archaeologist also at Ludwig Maximilians University. Embalmers’ mixtures at Saqqara may not correspond, say, to those used around 700 years earlier for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/king-tut-tutankhamun-tomb-discovery-archaeology">King Tutankhamun</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/22</em>).</p>



<h4>Mummy embalming instructions</h4>



<p>Outside surfaces of other vessels from the Saqqara embalming workshop and burial chambers sported labels and, in some cases, instructions for treatment of the head, preparation of linen mummy bandages, washing the body and treating the liver and stomach. Inscriptions on one jar referred to an administrator who performed embalming procedures, mainly on the head.</p>



<p>Chemical residue inside these pots consisted of mixtures specific to each embalming procedure. Ingredients included oils or tars of cedar and juniper or cypress trees, pistachio resin, castor oil, animal fats, heated beeswax, bitumen (a dense, oily substance), elemi and a resin called dammar.</p>



<p>Most of those substances have been identified in earlier studies of chemical residues from Egyptian mummies and embalming vessels in individual tombs, says Egyptologist Margaret Serpico of University College London. But elemi and dammar resins have not previously been linked to ancient Egyptian embalming practices and are “highly unexpected,” notes Serpico, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Elemi was an ingredient in the workshop mixtures used to treat the head, the liver and bandages wrapped around the body. Chemical signs of dammar appeared in a vessel from one of the burial chambers that included remnants of a range of substances, indicating that the container had been used to blend several different mixtures, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Specific properties of elemi and dammar that aided in preserving dead bodies have yet to be investigated, Stockhammer said.</p>



<h4>A far-flung trade network for mummy embalming ingredients</h4>



<p>Elemi resin reached Egypt from tropical parts of Africa or Southeast Asia, while dammar originated in Southeast Asia or Indonesia, Rageot says. Other embalming substances detected at Saqqara came from Southwest Asia and parts of southern Europe and northern Africa bordering the Mediterranean Sea. These findings provide the first evidence that ancient Egyptian embalmers depended on substances transported across vast trade networks.</p>



<p>Egyptian embalmers at Saqqara took advantage of a trade network that already connected Egypt to sites in Southeast Asia, Stockhammer said. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supply-chains-3000-years-bronze-age-shipwreck">Other Mediterranean and Asian societies also engaged in long-distance trade</a> during ancient Egypt’s heyday (<em>SN: 1/9/23</em>).</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that ancient Egyptians imported embalming ingredients from distant lands, Brier says. “They were great traders, had limited [local] wood products and really wanted these substances to achieve immortality.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insects-fall-outside-protected-areas">76 percent of well-known insects fall outside protected areas</a></h4>

              
                <p>The existing boundaries of national parks and other habitat preserves aren’t enough to protect <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.12.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than three-quarters of the world’s well-studied insects</a>.</p>



<p>The finding, reported February 1 in <em>One Earth</em>, shows that people who design nature preserves “don’t really think about insects that much,” says coauthor Shawan Chowdhury, an ecologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig.</p>



<p>That’s a problem because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-crisis-book-threats-population-decline-problem">insect populations around the globe are plummeting</a>, a growing body of research suggests, probably due to climate change and human development (<em>SN: 4/26/22</em>). For instance, insect abundance in Puerto Rico has dropped by up to 98 percent over the last 35 years.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Threats to insect survival could have ripple effects on plants and other animals. Insects help form the foundation for many ecosystems: They pollinate around 80 percent of all plant species and serve as a staple in the diets of hundreds of thousands of animals (and the occasional carnivorous plant).</p>



<p>One way to avert insect extinctions is to set aside the land they need to survive. But scientists know the ranges for only about 100,000 of the estimated 5.5 million insect species. To determine how well existing protected areas may be aiding insect conservation, Chowdhury and colleagues mapped the known habitats of about 89,000 of those species and compared the ranges with the boundaries of preserves from the <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Database on Protected Areas</a>.</p>



<p>Overall, these spaces don’t safeguard enough habitat for 67,384 insect species — about 76 percent of the species included in the study — the team found. Roughly 2 percent of species do not overlap with protected areas at all.</p>



<p>Conserving insects, Chowdhury says, will mean setting aside more insect-friendly spaces in the years ahead.</p>

<p>A group of cancer researchers once all based at Harvard have earned a retraction after acknowledging data duplication “errors” in an article published more than eight years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1417015112">Synthetic lethality of combined glutaminase and Hsp90 inhibition in mTORC1-driven tumor cells</a>,” was published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) </em>in December 2014. It has been cited 52 times, according to <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000347447100007">Clarivate’s Web of Science</a>. The study informed a clinical trial from <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/details/clinical_trial/NCT01362400">Infinity Pharmaceuticals</a> on a drug for people with lung cancer, according to Dimensions, a scientific research database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in November 2020, the paper drew scrutiny from commenters on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83120D8F11244924EFD9B7219AC31F?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer</a>. The posts include claims of duplications in several of the paper’s figures; none of the authors has responded to the 10 comments on the site.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126484"></span>



<p>Pseudonymous critic Claire Francis drew attention to these concerns in a November 2020 email to editors at <em>PNAS,</em> as well as academic and legal representatives from Harvard, Cornell, the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. That email received no response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 6 this year, <em>PNAS </em>published the following <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220405120">retraction notice</a> for the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The undersigned authors note, “We are retracting this article due to the following errors in the preparation of several of the published figures. The same data appear to be presented in the +Rapa/+17AAG/48h panel of Fig. 2A and in the BPTES + 17AAG + NAC (72h) panel of Fig. 5D.

<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/john-blenis">John Blenis</a>, now at <a href="http://www.blenislab.org/">Weill Cornell Medicine</a>, did not respond to our requests for comment. Nor did May Berenbaum, the editor-in-chief at <em>PNAS</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>PNAS </em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2112628118">issued a correction</a> last August for <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.202476899">another paper</a>, from 2002, on which Blenis was the corresponding author, saying that it had omitted data. The authors wrote that the removal of the data “in no way compromises the conclusions of the paper.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>PNAS</em> wrote in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Thank you for your message. We have nothing further to add to the published statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The 2014 article was funded in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health to Blenis as PI that totaled more than $1.1 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/biochemistry/about-us/department/faculty-members/sonenberg">Nahum Sonenburg</a>, guest editor of the retracted paper and a biochemist at McGill University, for his take on what happened. He said he was too busy to re-read the paper closely&nbsp; but said it was “unfortunate” it was retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked whether any duplicated data were flagged in his initial edit of the paper, he wrote in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am almost sure that the issue did not come up, as I would have absolutely remembered it, because it is extremely troublesome, and would have precluded the publication.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is not the first time a paper by Blenis has been marred by data duplication. In 2021, <em>Cell</em> <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00433-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867421004335%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">issued a correction</a> for a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)01157-8">2005 paper</a> of which Blenis is the corresponding author. The paper was found to have a duplication in the results that did “not compromise the conclusions of the paper.”</p>



<p>Duplicated and omitted data in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00506-2">2003<em> </em>article in<em> Current Biology</em></a>&nbsp;on which Blenis was a co-author received<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982222000380"> a correction</a> last February. Again, editors wrote that “overall conclusions derived from this experiment are not affected.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/01/31/arxiv-announces-new-policy-on-chatgpt-and-similar-tools/">arXiv announces new policy on ChatGPT and similar tools</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Note: This post was edited on Feb. 7, 2023 to add links to the most current policy</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent release of AI technology that generates new text has raised serious questions among the research community. For one, &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can ChatGPT be named an author of a research paper?&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resounding answer from arXiv leaders and advisors is, “No.” A computer program cannot, for example, take responsibility for the contents of a paper. Nor can it agree to arXiv’s terms and conditions. </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00107-z"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other organizations agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this issue, arXiv has adopted a <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/index.html#policy-for-authors-use-of-generative-ai-language-tools">new policy</a> for authors regarding the use of generative AI language tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial policy is:</span></p>
<h3><b>arXiv policy for authors’ use of generative AI language tools </b></h3>
<p><strong>January 31, 2023 (please see the <a title="https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/index.html#policy-for-authors-use-of-generative-ai-language-tools" href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/index.html#policy-for-authors-use-of-generative-ai-language-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-safelink="true" data-linkindex="0" data-loopstyle="link">arXiv moderation page</a> for the most current policy)</strong><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv recognizes that authors of scientific works use a variety of tools to do the science on which they report, and to prepare the report itself, from simple ones to very sophisticated ones. Community opinion on the appropriateness of such tools may be varied and evolving; AI powered language tools have in particular led to significant debate. We note that tools may generate useful and helpful results, but also errors or misleading results; therefore, knowing which tools were used is relevant to evaluating and interpreting scientific works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In view of this, we </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to require authors to report in their work any significant use of sophisticated tools, such as instruments and software; we now include in particular text-to-text generative AI among those that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">should be reported consistent with subject standards for methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remind all colleagues that by signing their name as an author of a paper, they each individually take full responsibility for all its contents, irrespective of how the contents were generated. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, it is the responsibility of the author(s).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generative AI language tools should not be listed as an author; instead authors should refer to (1).</span></li>
</ol>

                <p><em>Note: this post  was originally published on the <a href="https://latitude.plos.org/2023/01/EarthArXiv-live">PLOS Latitude Blog</a></em></p>



<p></p>



<p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://latitude.plos.org/2022/12/plos-and-eartharxiv/">planned integration</a> between PLOS and the <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/">EarthArXiv</a> preprint server is now live!</p>



<p>Beginning today, authors submitting to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/s/preprints"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/s/preprints"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/s/preprints"><em>PLOS Water</em></a> will have the option to automatically forward their manuscript to EarthArXiv, right from our submission system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation is easy. During submission, authors will indicate whether their manuscript has been posted as a preprint already. If it has, we&rsquo;ll ask for the DOI. If it has not, authors can check a box to opt-in to this new service. Once received by EarthArXiv, each manuscript will be <a href="https://eartharxiv.github.io/moderation.html">screened for suitability</a>, including checks for scope, appropriateness, and potential dual use research of concern. Most preprints will appear on the server within a week.</p>



<p>In fields related to our environment, the timely and thorough exchange of knowledge is vital. Preprints empower researchers to take control of their scientific communications and share research when it&rsquo;s ready. PLOS authors use preprints to establish priority, share results more efficiently, seek community feedback, and build their careers.</p>



<p>Preprints also support more inclusive scientific communications, opening opportunities for collaboration and feedback, and allowing everyone to participate on their own terms. Including more of the research community deepens and expands both the scientific record and the network of expert peer reviewers, forging new connections and supporting high-quality research. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">Learn more about the benefits of preprints on our website</a>.</p>
