<p>Web of Science, Clarivate’s influential database of abstracts and citations, has paused indexation of new content from the open-access journals <em>Heliyon</em> and <em>Cureus</em>, apparently due to concerns about the quality of their articles.</p>



<p>Indexation in WoS or Scopus, another major bibliometric database owned by Elsevier, has become an important stamp of approval for scholarly publications worldwide and can make or break a journal.</p>



<p>WoS is “making a big call here, taking aim at two of the mega-journals that have grown massively in recent years,” said <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Nick Wise</a>, a scientific sleuth and a researcher at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. “WoS appears to be one of the only organisations with the power to compel big publishers to act. I don’t think that’s a sign of a healthy academic publishing system, but it’s how things are currently.”</p>



<span id="more-130124"></span>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/mohammed-o-al-amr/">Mohammed Al-Amr</a> noted the news about <em>Heliyon</em> <a href="https://x.com/mohd_alamr/status/1840056824931737892">over the weekend</a> on X.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, which in addition to owning Scopus is also the parent company of Cell Press, the publisher of <em>Heliyon</em>, told us it is “investigating” but would not elaborate. According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/heliyon">its website</a>, “<em>Heliyon</em> considers research from all areas of the physical, applied, life, social and medical sciences.”</p>



<p>Graham Parker-Finger, director of publishing and customer success at <em>Cureus</em>, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Obviously, we are disappointed by this news and are waiting for information about why Clarivate has chosen to take this step. We are absolutely committed to the integrity of our journal, investigating all concerns that are raised with us as well as acting proactively, and we expect to be able to resolve this situation in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We have reported <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cureus/">frequently</a> on <em>Cureus</em> in the past. The journal, a Springer Nature title that prides itself on speedy publication, has drawn flak for <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/24/cureus-its-reviewing-and-its-scholarly-impact-quotient/">publishing low-quality studies</a> and hosting “channels” that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">allow questionable organizations to hand-pick their own editors</a>. Earlier this year, it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/26/journal-retracts-more-than-50-studies-from-saudi-arabia-for-faked-authorship/">retracted 55 papers</a> from Saudi Arabia for dubious authorship.</p>



<p>Wise noted:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It is very interesting that WoS have put Cureus and Heliyon on hold on grounds of quality (if I’m reading the journal master list correctly). The Cureus ‘academic channels’ appear purpose-built to be abused by papermills, whilst no article is out of scope at Heliyon. The journals are set up so that they can never be removed from the list for publishing articles that are out of scope, as others have been previously.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lonni Besançon, an assistant professor of visualization at Linköping University in Sweden and a scientific sleuth, said he worried the fast peer-review process at <em>Cureus</em> could undermine quality. He highlighted a study of the use of <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/111851-regular-use-of-ivermectin-as-prophylaxis-for-covid-19-led-up-to-a-92-reduction-in-covid-19-mortality-rate-in-a-dose-response-manner-results-of-a-prospective-observational-study-of-a-strictly-controlled-population-of-88012-subjects#!/">ivermectin to prevent COVID-19</a> that was later <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.10.23293924v2">found to be flawed</a>.</p>



<p>“Overall, I’d say that I’m happy that [<em>Cureus</em> and <em>Heliyon</em>] are put on hold and that, perhaps, there is something that is going to be done about potentially problematic journals or groups,”<em>&nbsp;</em>Besançon told us.<em> </em>He added he was “wondering if we could have more transparency on the process and what prompted this move” by WoS.</p>



<p>A pop-up box on <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/home">Clarivate’s website</a> defining the on-hold status states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been raised about the quality of the content published in this journal. The journal is being re-evaluated according to our selection criteria; new content will not be indexed during the course of the re-evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rachel Scheer, director of external communications, academia and government, at Clarivate, told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When the evaluation is complete, the publisher will be informed of the outcome and the journal will either be removed from coverage if it no longer meets the quality criteria or remain covered if it continues to meet the quality criteria.<br><em><br></em>The freely accessible Master Journal List is updated monthly and should be considered the authoritative source for Web of Science coverage.   </p>
</blockquote>



<p>James Butcher, the author of the newsletter <a href="https://ck.journalology.com/">Journalology</a>, wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7246207958466932737/">a September 29 LinkedIn post</a> about the new developments:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We should assume innocence until we hear otherwise. We don&#8217;t know what aspects of the journals the Web of Science team is investigating. <br><em><br></em>However, other fast growing journals have fallen foul of Web of Science indexing criteria.<br><em><br></em>IJERPH (MDPI) was delisted last year [Ed: see <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fast-growing-open-access-journals-stripped-coveted-impact-factors">more coverage here</a>] for publishing articles that were out of scope and output plummeted as a result.</p>

                <p>Building microscopes in the lab is a skill that is rarely taught at university. It is no coincidence that most people who have learnt to build microscopes have done so in the lab from other researchers or engineers. Usually, one needs to be lucky to find pieces of knowledge in random papers, in discussions with experts, or when browsing blogs like the one you&#8217;re currently reading. A part of the problem is that most papers that describe the novel design and construction of microscopes are often challenging to translate into practice even for experts because they describe the ideas and concepts and do rarely provide precise assembly instructions together with the rationale behind.</p>



<p>In their manuscript on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.612766v1">An open-source two-photon microscope for teaching and research</a> by Schottdorf et al., the authors go a different route. Instead of presenting a novel microscope design that shall be used for future experiments, they describe the rationale and principles behind a microscope design that was already used, tested and refined over many years in a very successful systems neuroscience lab.</p>

<p>The paper includes many interesting and useful pieces of knowledge. Among those, I would like to highlight only a few:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The assembly instructions and rationale for a custom scan lens and tube lens based on off-the-shelf components (see the Results section, but also the Discussion with comments on ideas from astronomy and photography).</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A similar design suggestion and analysis for the detection path.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A discussion why an axial FWHM of 5 μm is, in the view of the authors, a pragmatic compromise for <em>in vivo</em>-imaging with movement artifacts.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The interesting side-note that ±28 V instead of ±24 power supply specifications are advantageous for galvo scanner performance.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The measurement of the dispersion for this specific two-photon system, which can be considered typical for two-photon microscopes (approx. -20000 fs<sup>2</sup>).</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, the manuscript comes with a very nice <a href="https://github.com/BrainCOGS/Microscope/tree/main">documentation on Github</a> that includes a detailed assembly protocol, a list of parts including prices of laser, objective, shutter, power meter, PMTs, etc.</p>



<p>Altogether, a great resource that is definitely worth a look.</p>

<p>A paper that claimed to show a homeopathic intervention improved quality of life and survival for people with advanced lung cancer has received an extensive correction two years after a research integrity watchdog asked the journal to retract the article over concerns about manipulated data, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two scientists who sounded the alarm on the paper are not satisfied with the correction, they told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article/25/12/e1930/6444088">Homeopathic Treatment as an Add‐On Therapy May Improve Quality of Life and Prolong Survival in Patients with Non‐Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Prospective, Randomized, Placebo‐Controlled, Double‐Blind, Three‐Arm, Multicenter Study</a>,” appeared in <em>The Oncologist</em> in November 2020. <a href="https://www.ordination-frass.at/en/about-me">Michael Frass</a>, the lead author of the paper, is a homeopathic practitioner who was working at the Medical University of Vienna, at the time the work was published.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130110"></span>



<p>The paper has been cited 18 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and was included in a German medical organization’s <a href="https://www.awmf.org/leitlinien/detail/ll/032-055OL.html">guideline</a> about complementary treatment for cancer patients.&nbsp; Many homeopathy organizations posted about the study on X as evidence of the approach’s benefit, helping propel the article to the <a href="https://oxfordjournals.altmetric.com/details/91734115#score">top 5%</a> of all research articles for which Altmetric, a publication data company, has tracked online attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The article also attracted the notice of <a href="https://netzwerk-homoeopathie.info/en/dr-norbert-aust/">Norbert Aust</a>, a retired mechanical engineer who started the Homeopathy Information Network in Germany, and Viktor Weisshäupl, a retired anesthesiologist now working on the <a href="http://www.initiative-wissenschaftliche-medizin.at/">Initiative for Scientific Medicine</a> in Austria. The pair undertook an analysis of the study protocols and data posted to ClinicalTrials.gov.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They found several differences between the initial registration posted in January 2012, a protocol dated January 2011 but uploaded in July 2019, and the published paper. These differences included the number of participants, study arms, exclusion criteria, follow-up time, and cancer types included in the study. Aust and Weisshäupl also noted the study protocol said the software the authors used to analyze their data was a version not yet available in 2011.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In conclusion, it seems likely that the substantial modifications of crucial study parameters that occurred after the study had been started and results had become available biased the results in favor of homeopathy,” Aust and Weisshäupl wrote in a <a href="https://edzardernst.com/2021/06/a-thorough-analysis-of-prof-m-frass-recent-homeopathy-trial-casts-serious-doubts-on-its-reliability/">description of their findings</a> on Edzard Ernst’s blog in June 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to another <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2023/05/homeopathy-research-hits-new-low/">article</a> Aust and Weisshäupl published in <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em> in 2023, the pair reported their findings to the Medical University Vienna, which referred the matter to the <a href="https://oeawi.at/en/about-the-oeawi/">Austrian Agency for Scientific Integrity</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/attachment1727195445883.pdf">report dated September 2022</a> and obtained by Retraction Watch, the Austrian watchdog said its investigation “found numerous manipulations,” and asked <em>The Oncologist</em>’s editor in chief Susan Bates to retract the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the findings:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The presentation of the study as double-blind placebo controlled is untrue.” </li>



<li>“Substantial” changes to the study protocol while it was running, including to the primary endpoint, that were not mentioned in the publication, “​​suggestive of data manipulation.” </li>



<li>“Many patients were excluded post-hoc, which is suggestive of data manipulation.” </li>



<li>“Fully implausible” survival data, “compatible with selective deletion of records.” </li>



<li>“The patients in the homeopathy group report a quality of life that is much higher than that of the general population known from other surveys. For patients with stage four non-small cell lung cancer this is highly implausible.” </li>
</ul>



<p><em>The Oncologist</em> published an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article/27/12/e985/6782256">expression of concern</a> in October 2022 citing “credible information from the Austrian Agency for Research Integrity about potential data falsification and data manipulation in this article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While <em>The Oncologist</em> editorial team investigates and communicates with the corresponding author, the editors are publishing this Expression of Concern to alert readers that, pending the outcome and review of a full investigation, the research results presented may not be reliable,” the notice stated.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On Tuesday, the journal published an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/advance-article/doi/10.1093/oncolo/oyae253/7766098">extensive correction</a> to the article, stating:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Additional details not included in the original publication have since been provided by the authors and reviewed by the editors to clarify these concerns. These omissions do not affect the results of this study.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Frass told us he and his team were “pleased that after a profound and thorough investigation by <em>The Oncologist</em> it has now been proven that the paper is correct. The Commission&#8217;s allegations are unsubstantiated and completely unfounded.” He provided a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MDapfYpiFyYpvhMA0RgaAaFK20ZjiVY1/view?usp=drive_link">diagram</a> he and a friend made which he said showed “all allegations could be refuted adequately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the correction, the journal published an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/advance-article/doi/10.1093/oncolo/oyae252/7766099">editorial</a> by Bates and another editor describing how <em>The Oncologist</em> published the paper in a section dedicated to the results of clinical trials that might not otherwise be posted. It concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The Oncologist</em> and its CTR section hope that—by turning to the laboratory to determine whether any fraction of a homeopathic remedy holds a thread of promise—science identifies what is in these mixtures and that, in turn, potential anticancer compounds are then developed through conventional pathways.</p>



<p>We reached out to Bates for comment, and received the following response from a spokesperson for Oxford University Press, the journal’s publisher:&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022 The Oncologist received a letter about “Homeopathic Treatment as an Add-On Therapy May Improve Quality of Life and Prolong Survival in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Prospective, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Three-Arm, Multicenter Study” from the Commission for Research Integrity of the Austrian Agency for Research Integrity (OeAWI) and the journal issued an expression of concern. The journal has since conducted a thorough investigation and based on guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), determined that a correction is the appropriate response to the concerns raised. The accompanying editorial provides further context. The correction and editorial are the journal’s full response.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The correction doesn’t address the issues Aust, Weisshäupl, and the Austrian Agency for Scientific Integrity found with the study, Aust <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mail-to-Ellie.pdf">told us</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They explain some trifles,” he said, “but the elephant in the room is not mentioned.” He also wondered why a letter to the editor he and Weisshäupl submitted in 2021 had not been published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editorial’s question of whether some components in the homeopathic intervention could be therapeutic “is completely irrelevant,” Aust said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If some results are obtained by data manipulation and falsification, then it is pointless to argue if there might have been some effect by the preparations that were administered,” he said. “The data are not valid and it is wrong, unethical and might cause harm for patients if they stay published like solid outcomes of some rigorous trial.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/starting-at-university">Starting at University</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Off to university for the first time this year? A bit nervous about what to expect or how to make the most of your time there? Not to worry - Rachel&apos;s here to share all of her tips and tricks from life at university!</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As the leaves are beginning to blush with the colours of autumn, the time is almost here for students across the country to fly the nest to university, many for the first time. Starting a university course marks a new chapter in the life of a young person, an experience that truly shapes their life. Flexing the wings of freedom often brings a complicated miasma of emotions - a strange blend of anticipation of the adventure and trepidation about the unknown. Some of you may be setting off to a new city, relatively far from home comforts. When I began my university degree in Natural Sciences, aged 19, I switched from my life in a quiet Welsh village to the towering spires, bustling tourism and thriving student community of Cambridge. I couldn’t tell whether the butterflies that I couldn’t shake were ones of excitement or anxiety. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">If you’re going through something a little like this right now, rest assured you are not alone. You’re about to embark on a life-changing journey on the road to independence - for very few of us graduate as the same people we were when we arrived. Now, writing to you a few years down the line (I am now at the end of my PhD), I have a few words of wisdom to share with anyone about to start their university course. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Mental Mapping</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_80826d56a32542feb850f91e75e1d7d7~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_415,h_552,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Anyone for a punting tour? "></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As you unpack your belongings in your new ‘home-away-from-home’, your mind may be racing in an attempt to take it all in. It’s a big change, to move from a place where you know where everything is, to one you need to actively find your way around. For a while you might need to sneak a peek at Google Maps to track down a pharmacy, a grocery store or somewhere for a bite to eat. I promise you that the unfamiliarity doesn’t last long. Take some time to just wander around your campus and local area. If you happen to be studying neuroscience (which I highly recommend!), you may come across the hippocampus in your course – the ‘place cells’ in this brain region will be building a cognitive map of your surroundings that you can call upon for navigation. Go and play being a tourist for a while, and before long you’ll be just as qualified as a tour guide yourself. I felt quite a sense of pride when, several months after starting, my family visited me at Cambridge and I could identify almost all of the buildings they asked about (with a few fun facts to go alongside).  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Breaking the Ice</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Joining you on this adventure will be thousands of other students from across the country, maybe even the world. You may not know anyone where you’re heading. If you’re anything like me, you might be intimidated by the idea of forming a new group of friends, especially bonds as close as those with your school friends. If you’re from a close-knit community and feel very connected to your home area, you may also feel the pangs of homesickness and start thinking about when your family should first come to visit. My advice? Take a deep breath and dive right in. You will be so glad that you did. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_0d32dbd8d8e644edbcbfd5abbb451fe2~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_472,h_622,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Taste the rainbow – Getting creative with flavours at Smoothie Society"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Be a little bold and strike up a conversation with the person in front of you in the queue to collect your keys or to order a coffee. Maybe offer to help someone moving into a room near you. One interaction may lead seamlessly to another – that person whose potted plant you’re holding may ask you to join them and a mate for dinner that evening. Whether you’re a natural social butterfly or prefer a closer friendship group, there’s no right or wrong. You’re all crewmates in the same boat. Universities offer a wide range of events, large and small, to support socialisation and interaction in those early days. I think it’s a common misconception that university friendships can only be forged over a pint or something stronger, but there is absolutely no pressure to drink if it’s not your cup of tea. Some of my fondest memories of early university days, after all, are of sipping our latest creations at the Smoothie Society. The events programmes offer something for everyone – the budding sports stars, the creative spirits and the pub quiz nerds alike. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Try a New Hobby</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Speaking of societies, there’s also no better time to experiment with new hobbies than at the beginning of university. Extra-curricular activities help anchor you and provide some much-needed opportunities to get your mind away from academia. You’ll be inundated with opportunities as university societies launch their campaigns and make their pitches. If there’s a ‘Freshers Fair’ or something similar, be sure to go along. Amble along the stalls and stop at any that even slightly pique your interest. My advice would be to sign up for any that there is even a remote chance you’ll interact with – it’s easier to leave a mailing list than find it again and, worst comes to worst, jotting down your new university email address will help you remember it! </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_3686bd7a87d74a00a6ab2433382b909a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_550,h_703,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Slippery sports memories from the Snapchat archives"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">You might be a total beginner at whatever you’re trying, but that’s all part of the fun as you’ll certainly be in good, equally inexperienced, company. Even if it doesn’t quite turn out to be your kind of thing, you may create some fun memories or anecdotes to take away – did I mention the time I played a lacrosse match in the snow, stumbled through a Cuban salsa routine or tried to juggle in a park? But maybe you’ll hit upon some new sport or activity that is just right for you. After all, I never would have thought that turning up to a magazine launch for Bluesci (the science communication society at Cambridge) would one day lead to me being its President!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">A New Way of Learning</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As you start your new course, you’ll likely have to adapt to a different style of learning. Pre-university courses provide the essential groundwork that sparks your initial interest, but university will give you access to the next level of knowledge in your field of study. I was fascinated when a new piece of information made the pieces of the puzzle fit together in my mind and I understood a difficult concept – in neuroscience, this could be the first time you </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">really </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">get to grips with the ways neurons communicate through action potentials (spoiler alert – it’s more complicated than they tell you at school, but much more awesome!). Not only that, but depending on your subject, you may be able to engage hands-on, to an extent, that schools just cannot offer. Practical labs give you the chance to put your newfound knowledge into action. It wasn’t long before I was recording electrical activity directly from nerve fibres! Although some universities are transitioning more fully into the post-pandemic rhythm of hybrid lectures, I strongly recommend going in person - you’ll get so much more from your course that way, from engaging deeper in the content course and also giving you more chances to interact with friends. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It is all too easy to feel overwhelmed at the beginning of all this. You may feel that the lectures are too fast-paced, or things aren’t clicking quite as easily in your mind as you are used to. This is normal. Be kind to yourself and give yourself the time you need to get used to university-style teaching. Don’t expect to get everything right the first time, even if this is what you’re used to. The first few essays I wrote involved some late-night library sessions and were handed back to me slathered in red ink comments, but it wasn’t long before I was confidently sending off written work without concern. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_bdd22d91e2284b67a778a31c8ccda4c5~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_609,h_809,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="The early bird gets the beautiful College library to herself"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Time management is also an asset to your skillset, so take the time to develop a working rhythm that works for you. Don’t let your working hours be influenced by those you see around you - someone may look like they’re buried in a textbook, while secretly scrolling through their Instagram feed. Use your newfound freedom to find a pattern of study that works for you, as all our internal clocks are tuned a little differently (another of my favourite course topics was, coincidentally, how our ‘circadian clocks’ tick to regulate our daily rhythms). I was always a stronger contender to be the first in the library and switch off a little earlier than my friends, whose minds sharpened more towards the afternoon. Even now as a PhD student, my lab mates and I are all working to slightly different daily schedules. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Acts of Kindness</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Last, but by no means least, I would like to place a big emphasis on taking care of yourself. I mean that both in the physical sense (keep active, don’t skip meals and get plenty of sleep) and in your mental wellbeing. I can’t say in all honesty that university is a stress-free ride, so finding ways to buffer the challenging times is an essential skill. I certainly felt a strong pang of imposter syndrome in the first few weeks. It can take some time to get a handle on independent living if you’re not used to it. It took me longer than I’m proud to admit to operate the washing machine the first time I ran laundry. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Take note of the support network you have around you to turn to if you ever need a friendly face or a listening ear. These could be your fellow students, the pastoral staff or even your friends and family from back at home (the pandemic may be over, but Zoom is as useful as ever). Despite their ill-founded reputation as hardcore academics, your tutors and lecturers are often willing to chat to a student and review a particular topic. Take regular breaks during study sessions, especially because taking your mind away from a challenging task can often allow you to see a problem in a new light. If you’re feeling a little stressed, why not head to the library with a friend and feel the benefit of group study? Ultimately, no matter what may be thrown your way, academically or otherwise, there will always be a source of support. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Flourishing Freshers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Even after reading this and (of course) believing every word I write, you’ll likely not be able to completely shake the nerves when the time comes. But be proud of yourself for making the leap and having the courage to take your education and possibilities one step further. Enjoy every moment, for before you know it, it’ll be time to don the graduation cap and move on to the next big adventure. The memories of my time as an undergraduate are some of the best of my life, and I went into my PhD as a more confident, strong and resilient person for all of my experiences. Sure, it was no picnic and I worked extremely hard to graduate with a First, but I do not have a single regret. To the Freshers of 2024, I send the very best of wishes.</span></span></p>

<p>Some journal articles on the Taylor &amp; Francis website now bear a pop-up notification stating the papers are “currently under investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher began adding the notices to articles <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/016164109X12478302362491">such as this one</a> in June, according to a spokesperson, as a way to inform readers about an ongoing investigation “so that they can exercise appropriate caution when considering the research presented.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like the “editor’s notes” posted on Springer Nature articles under investigation, Taylor &amp; Francis’ pop-ups only appear on the publisher’s website, not in databases where researchers might be searching for papers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130099"></span>



<p>The company’s publishing ethics and integrity team decides which articles it’s investigating get such a notification and when, according to a <a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-your-research/after-publication/what-to-expect-when-raising-a-concern/">new web page</a> describing the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The pop-up will be added on a case-by-case basis where there are significant concerns about the academic integrity of an article,” the spokesperson said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will be particularly valuable in cases with a risk of harm, such as when medical decisions could be made based on the research article under investigation. The notification is less likely to be used where the issues raised are quite minor or before we have assessed the credibility of concerns submitted by a third party. As we have only recently started to label some articles in this way, we continue to test our criteria for doing so and will adjust as and when necessary.</p>



<p>The publisher’s website states the pop-up notifications are temporary, appearing only while the investigation is ongoing, as opposed to permanent notices like expressions of concern, retractions, or corrections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because formal expressions of concern “remain on the scholarly record permanently,” according to Sabina Alam, director of Publishing Ethics &amp; Integrity at Taylor &amp; Francis, “they can only really be used when an investigation has established very strong grounds for concern, typically several months after we first identify a potential problem.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This new ‘under investigation’ notification will keep readers informed earlier in the process and enable us to remove the message once the investigation has been completed, whatever conclusion it comes to,” Alam said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other publishers add expressions of concern or other notices to papers while undertaking investigations that could take some time to resolve. <em>Science</em>, for example, has begun adding such notices after learning of problems with papers and then later <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/27/science-rescinds-expression-of-concern-issued-last-month/">rescinding them</a> when <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adm8238">publishing</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj9995">corrections</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientific sleuths who report concerns with papers to publishers such as Taylor &amp; Francis had mixed reactions to the new notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think it is a good development,” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">Elisabeth Bik</a> said. “I welcome any &#8216;flag&#8217; on a paper for which serious concerns were raised, and the sooner after the concerns were raised, the better.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bik suggested the publisher add a time stamp to the notification, as well as more detail about what aspect of the paper the publisher was investigating.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/28/first-time-scientific-sleuths-prompt-nine-retractions-for-neurosurgery-group/">Rene Aquarius</a> agreed the notifications would be better with a short statement about what the publisher was investigating or a link to PubPeer. He also suggested Taylor &amp; Francis somehow notify readers of the outcome of an investigation. But he called the pop-ups “a fantastic development” for “increased transparency.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wish all publishers would follow their example,” Aquarius said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://undark.org/2024/09/11/the-rise-of-the-science-sleuths/">Kevin Patrick</a> said he had difficulty seeing the notifications because he uses ad blockers. If the flags don’t end up in databases, “they have a limited audience,” he said, only for people looking at articles on the publisher’s website.</p>



<p>“Meh,” he said. “Certainly it is better than nothing.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2009, a now highly-cited study found an average of around 2% of scientists admit to have falsified, fabricated, or modified data at least once in their career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fifteen years on, a new analysis tried to quantify how much science is fake – but the real number may remain elusive, some observers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://osf.io/5rf2m/">analysis</a>, published before peer review on the Open Science Framework on September 24, found one in seven scientific papers may be at least partly fake. The author, James Heathers, a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-expose-shoddy-and-questionable-research">long-standing scientific sleuth</a>, arrived at that figure by averaging data from 12 existing studies — collectively containing a sample of around 75,000 studies — that estimate the volume of problematic scientific output.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130075"></span>



<p>“I have been reading for years and still continue to read this 2% figure which is ubiquitous,” Heathers, an affiliated researcher in psychology at Linnaeus University in Vaxjo, Sweden, said. “The only minor problem with it is that it’s 20 years out of date,” he added, noting that the last dataset that went into the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005738">2009 study</a> was from 2005. </p>



<p>So Heathers tried to come up with a more up-to-date estimate of scholarly literature containing signs of irregularities. “A lot has changed in 20 years,” he said. “It’s been a persistent irritant to me for a period of years now to see this figure cited over and over and over again.”</p>



<p>Past studies predominantly focussed on asking researchers directly if they had engaged in dishonest research practices, Heathers said, “which I think is a very bad approach to being able to do this.” But he noted that it was probably the only method available to use when the research was conducted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think it’s pretty naive to ask people who are faking research whether or not they’ll honestly answer the question that they were dishonest previously,” Heathers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heathers’ study pulls data from 12 different analyses from&nbsp; the social sciences, medicine, biology, and other fields of research. All those studies have one thing in common: The authors of each used various online tools to estimate the amount of fakery taking place in a set of papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a really persistent commonality to them,” Heathers said. “The rough approximation for where we end up is that one in seven research papers are fake.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heathers said he decided to conduct his study as a meta-analysis because his figures are “far flung.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“They are a little bit from everywhere; it’s wildly nonsystematic as a piece of work,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniele Fanelli, a metascientist at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland who authored the 2009 study, is not convinced by the new analysis. “Metascience research is sometimes not metascientific,” he says, arguing that the study falsely labels studies with some problem as definitely being a fake and incorrectly lumps together different studies measuring different phenomena.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The papers are all different, they’re all over the place in highlighting all sorts of different problems in all sorts of different contexts using all sorts of different methods,” Fanelli says. “That’s not a rigorous way to get an estimate of anything.”</p>



<p>Fanelli said the study will draw unnecessary negative media attention: “It’s not the kind of attention that science either deserves or will benefit from.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think it’s entirely wrong but I think that it can be slightly misleading,” said Gowri Gopalakrishna, an epidemiologist at the Maastricht University in the Netherlands who <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02035-2">co-authored a 2021 study</a> that found 8% of researchers in a survey of nearly 7,000 scientists in the Netherlands confessed to falsifying or fabricating data at least once between 2017 and 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gopalakrishna said fabrication and falsification may be more prevalent in some fields than others so grouping them together may not be helpful. “If you want to get the attention of the government and try to shake things up, putting them all together and saying look how big the problem is probably useful in that way but I really do think that it’s important to drill down,” she said.</p>



<p>Heathers acknowledged those limitations but argued that he had to conduct the analysis with the data that exist. “If we waited for the resources necessary to be able to do really big systematic treatments of a problem like this within a specific area, I think we’d be waiting far too long,” he said. “This is crucially underfunded.”</p>



<p>Heathers said he decided to pursue coming up with a figure for the average percentage of fakery in science because few such estimates are available. “Even if you do something that’s an incredibly systematic review in a very formal sense, I strongly suspect you’ll get the same estimate that I’ve got,” he said.</p>
