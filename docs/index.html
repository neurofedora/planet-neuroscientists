<p>After reading a recent study about GLP-1 treatment in the <em>International Journal of Obesity</em>, David B. Allison immediately became skeptical about the paper’s analysis. The article, published in May 2024, found people who combined a GLP-1 therapy with another weight loss drug lost more weight than patients on GLP-1 therapy alone.  </p>



<p>“I could not really comprehend exactly what analysis they did,” Allison, chief of nutrition and director of the Children&#8217;s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told Retraction Watch. “And more so, I could not comprehend how the analysis they did would give results that would be informative of the conclusions they drew. So I was scratching my head a little bit.”</p>



<p>The <em>IJO</em> paper was a retrospective cohort study of adults with obesity who had been prescribed a GLP-1 therapy, specifically Saxenda and Ozempic. The study compared patients who received a GLP-1 alone with those receiving the GLP-1 therapy and then bupropion/naltrexone added to their regimen. <a href="https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2014/takeda-and-orexigen-announce-fda-approval-of-contrave-naltrexone-hci-and-bupropion-hci-extended-release-tablets-for-chronic-weight-management/">The Food and Drug Administration</a> approved bupropion/naltrexone in 2014 for chronic weight management in obese adults.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134222"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01526-2">The study found</a> the combination regimen resulted in a small but significant extra weight loss for patients, resulting in roughly 4% additional total body weight loss over six and 12 months.</p>

<p>Allison, who has worked for a decade on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/530027a">correcting statistical errors</a> in the nutrition literature, asked some of his mentees to see if they “could make sense” of the paper’s analysis, he said. But the group also had trouble understanding it, he said.&nbsp; With the authors’ cooperation, Allison’s team reviewed the raw data associated with the findings, ultimately concluding the results were not fully reproducible, said Allison, who serves as a statistical editor for the journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After looking into Allison’s findings, <em>IJO</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-025-02006-x">retracted the article</a> in December.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer confirmed it launched an investigation into the article after “a member of the journal’s editorial board raised concerns about the validity of its conclusions,” Maria Hodges, publishing director for biomedicine at Springer, said by email.</p>



<p>“This involved an assessment of the article’s original data by one of the journal’s statistical editors and members of their research team, in addition to consultation with the article’s authors, independent experts, the journal’s Editors<strong>&#8211;</strong>in<strong>&#8211;</strong>Chief, and the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group,” Hodges told us. “Following this, the Editors-in-Chief concluded that the main finding of this article is not substantiated and that retraction was the appropriate editorial action to take.”</p>



<p>All authors disagreed with the retraction, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-025-02006-x">retraction notice states</a>.</p>



<p>Nadia Khan,&nbsp; a clinician scientist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and the principal investigator on the study, told us she and her colleagues&nbsp; “felt they couldn’t accept a retraction unless they had more information on what the specific issues were, and whether the issues constituted enough of a departure to warrant a retraction.” Khan and two other authors also practice at <a href="https://www.revolutionmedicalclinic.com/ourteam">Revolution Medical Clinic</a>, a Vancouver clinic that provides obesity and metabolic disease treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Khan said the authors were “forthcoming with immediately supplying all raw data and all statistical codes to the journal,” when asked. She declined to answer further questions, but said authors are preparing a reply letter in defense of their study to submit to the journal.</p>



<p>The <em>IJO</em> paper garnered some attention when it came out, including at least <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/163241704/news">six news</a> summaries and about <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/163241704/twitter">40 posts</a> on X. The study has been cited eight times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>In addition to unverifiable results, Allison said his team found “further things that seemed questionable.” He declined to go into detail about what those things were, but said his team has summarized the specifics in a report that will be published in the journal.</p>



<p>Allison added the <em>IJO</em> paper is related to the idea of “treatment response heterogeneity,” a growing field of study. <a href="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/EVIDe2400054">Heterogeneity of treatment</a> effect is the nonrandom variability in treatment effects for patients within a population.</p>



<p>“I do think the field needs to up its game in terms of getting people to understand what are reasonable and legitimate methods for studying treatment response heterogeneity,” he said.</p>



<p>Allison said he was pleased with how <em>IJO</em> handled the concerns about the article, especially considering the “tremendous variability” among journals in their willingness to fix reported errors, correct or retract articles, and take prompt action, he told us.&nbsp; Another paper his group critiqued in <em>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine </em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/9829387">was retracted</a> more than three years after his team first raised concerns about the paper. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/18/prompt-and-decisive-editor-says-obesity-study-will-be-retracted-after-critique/">other cases</a>, editors have taken <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02601060241254944">swifter action</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m very pleased with the <em>IJO </em>journal editors that they&#8217;re taking matters seriously, and I think it would be good if more journal editors followed their example,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Update, Feb. 23, 2026: The first paragraph of the article was edited to clarify the two treatment groups.</em></p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/medicine-eoc-registry.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/medicine-eoc-registry-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-134207" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/medicine-eoc-registry-1024x576.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/medicine-eoc-registry-300x169.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/medicine-eoc-registry-768x432.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/medicine-eoc-registry.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>What started as a small editorial conundrum several years ago has turned into an <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/11070/expression_of_concern__study_protocols.160.aspx">expression of concern for dozens of papers</a> in a medical journal, thanks to the work of an Australian physician and scientific sleuth.</p>



<p>In February 2022, we wrote about the decision by publisher Wolters Kluwer <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/22/journal-retracts-a-paper-it-published-with-a-missing-table-after-author-fails-to-provide-it/">to retract a table</a> that was missing in <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/abstract/2020/09110/tranexamic_acid_reduces_blood_cost_in_long_segment.35.aspx">a paper</a> in <em>Medicine</em>. In the end the journal <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/Fulltext/2022/02110/Tranexamic_acid_reduces_blood_cost_in_long_segment.36.aspx">pulled the whole article</a>, which described a protocol for a clinical trial, because its authors had “not responded to multiple requests.”</p>



<p>The story left one reader intrigued. “I&#8217;ve never seen anything like that before,” said <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/10/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-led-to-the-identification-of-hundreds-of-fraudulent-papers/">John Loadsman</a> of the University of Sydney, an anesthesiologist and journal editor. “I thought, I&#8217;ve got to have a look.”</p>



<span id="more-134209"></span>



<p>The online version of the retracted paper contained links to several related articles, Loadsman discovered. After a few hours of following links, he had found dozens of study protocols that all looked like they’d been cast in the same mold.</p>



<p>One common feature was that all of the studies, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2020/05150/gap_balancing_versus_measured_resection_in_primary.19.aspx">even retrospective ones</a>, had been registered in <a href="https://www.researchregistry.com/">a database</a> created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riazagha/">Riaz Agha</a>, a plastic surgeon and publishing entrepreneur in London who is also the editor-in-chief of several Wolters Kluwer titles.</p>



<p>Loadsman searched papers in <em>Medicine </em>that included the text “researchregistry” – a reference to Agha’s database, the Research Registry – and “protocol.” Up came 127 publications by researchers in China, including the retracted paper; 117 of those articles had been submitted to the journal in 2020.</p>



<p>There were many red flags. Most of the studies had been registered on the same day <em>Medicine</em> received the manuscripts. In some registrations, the dates of first and last participant enrollment <a href="https://www.researchregistry.com/browse-the-registry/#home/registrationdetails/5f2be9e983bd1d0017eab4fb/">were the same</a>. And for many studies with different authors, the user who registered them was listed as “qsw erre.” The abstract of <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2020/09040/comparison_of_ropivacaine_plus_sufentanil_and.106.aspx">a paper</a> on analgesia in women giving birth contained the sentence: “One hundred sixty full-term protozoa are included in this work.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/protozoa.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/protozoa-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-134208" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/protozoa-1024x576.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/protozoa-300x169.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/protozoa-768x432.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/protozoa.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A sentence from the abstract of a paper on pain management during labor. <em><a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2020/09040/comparison_of_ropivacaine_plus_sufentanil_and.106.aspx" data-type="link" data-id="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2020/09040/comparison_of_ropivacaine_plus_sufentanil_and.106.aspx">Source</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither Agha nor the authors listed on the protozoa paper responded to emails seeking comment.</p>



<p>All of the protocol papers had been accepted for publication after no more than a few days, sometimes within just hours of being submitted, Loadsman found.</p>



<p>“I think protocol papers became an easy target for paper millers,” he told us. “Paper mills saw this as an opportunity: ‘We&#8217;re just going to write protocol papers and get authors to pay for them and we&#8217;re going to publish them and nobody will care two hoots about it.’”</p>



<p>In March 2022, Loadsman sent <em>Medicine </em>a spreadsheet listing the suspect articles. The journal, which charges publication fees ranging from <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/Pages/Instructions-for-Authors.aspx#OA">US$1,750 to US$2,250</a>, was slow to act. So every six months or so, Loadsman would inquire about the case.</p>



<p>Then, in November of last year, the journal issued <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/11070/expression_of_concern__study_protocols.160.aspx">an expression of concern</a> stating it was investigating the 126 articles. “It took them three and a half years to actually do anything about it,” Loadsman said.</p>



<p>Wolters Kluwer would not answer questions about the case.</p>

<p>An online peer support group for people overcoming addiction to pornography has filed a lawsuit against the authors of a paper critical of the group, as well as the publisher Taylor &amp; Francis, in an attempt to get the article retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01639625.2023.2280795">2023 study</a>, published in <em>Deviant Behavior</em>, found the Reddit channel for the group NoFap had a higher rate of posts containing violent language compared with two similar subreddits.</p>



<p>Study coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nprause/">Nicole Prause</a>, a bioinformatics programmer with the University of California, Los Angeles, and clinical psychologist <a href="https://www.davidleyphd.com/">David Ley</a> are named defendants in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gov.uscourts.pawd_.325932.9.0.pdf">the lawsuit</a>, filed December 30. <a href="https://nofap.com/about/">NoFap</a> and the group’s founder, Alexander Rhodes, are plaintiffs in the suit, which alleges the authors manipulated the data to make the subreddit seem uniquely violent.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134199"></span>



<p>The suit says Taylor &amp; Francis, which publishes <em>Deviant Behavior</em>, “aided and abetted” the authors in a “disinformation campaign” by publishing the paper. It also accuses the publisher of intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy and racketeering, along with eight other claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over a year before filing its lawsuit, NoFap asked Taylor &amp; Francis to pay $20 million to avoid being named as codefendant, according to emails Retraction Watch has seen.</p>



<p>At the end of January, the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Ley-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">two</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Prause-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">authors</a>, along with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TF-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">Taylor &amp; Francis</a> and the other defendants — which include UCLA and the pornography website Pornhub — filed motions to dismiss the suit. At publication time, the judge for the case had not yet ruled on the motions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first legal battle between Prause and Rhodes. In 2019, Rhodes filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.pawd.261025/gov.uscourts.pawd.261025.1.0_1.pdf">defamation lawsuit</a> against Prause, which they settled in 2021. The terms included a non-disparagement agreement specifying Prause could not make any “negative or offensive statement” about Rhodes, “his websites or products or services, companies or organizations owned by him,” according to the settlement. Although the settlement was sealed, the full agreement was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Settlement-Agreement-rhodes-prause-liberos.pdf">submitted as a supplement</a> in the 2025 suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prause’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Prause-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> for the new lawsuit states it covers many of the same claims from the 2019 suit. Meanwhile, NoFap claims in the new lawsuit that five other papers Prause has written that name the group violated the previous non-disparagement agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the research papers appeared in the Sage journals <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13634607231157070"><em>Sexualities</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26318318221116354"><em>Journal of Psychosexual Health</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-023-00780-8">two</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-023-00732-2">in</a> Springer Nature’s <em>International Journal of Impotence Research </em>and one, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article/20/Supplement_1/qdad060.023/7164868">a meeting abstract</a>, appeared in <em>The Journal of Sexual Medicine</em>, published by Oxford University Press. The articles were published online between the end of 2022 and October 2023.</p>



<p>Prause pointed to a stipulation in their earlier settlement that said: “Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Dr. Prause from criticizing the purported scientific claims of NoFap LLC or its users or followers in a professional context such as a professional journal, subject to the nondefamatory restrictions herein.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It would not be science to agree to ‘only say nice things’ about the subject of a study. That is absurd,” Prause told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">NoFap requested Taylor &amp; Francis retract the paper in November 2023, according to a series of emails the group forwarded to us. When asked who we could attribute statements and correspondence to, NoFap declined to give a name, citing a need to maintain anonymity of the group members.</p>



<p>According to the emails, Taylor &amp; Francis responded on Dec. 8, 2023, stating they were looking into the matter. On Feb. 12, 2024, the publisher sent a letter to the group, affirming the paper had undergone double-blind peer review and received the proper ethics approval from UCLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Regarding the data sampling, the authors’ methodology and explanations for cleansing their data set was reviewed by the Editors and found to be in line with the journal’s expectations,” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TF-Response-to-NoFap-via-email.pdf">the letter reads</a>.</p>



<p>Taylor &amp; Francis also hired a “third-party defamation expert” to review the article and were “comfortable with its content,” they wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group also claimed the authors didn’t disclose several relevant conflicts of interest with the research. Among these were Prause’s past encounters with Rhodes, which included the 2019 lawsuit, and Prause accusing Rhodes of attempted murder. The suit also accuses the authors of collaborating with and receiving financial compensation from pornographic websites and adult industry organizations, like PornHub and the <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/">Free Speech Coalition</a>, to “sway the public narrative about problematic pornography use.”</p>



<p>In response, Taylor &amp; Francis <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01639625.2024.2316534">corrected the article</a> in February 2024, updating the disclosure statement to add a sentence about Ley’s consulting work with the <a href="https://sexualhealthalliance.com/">Sexual Health Alliance</a>, a sex therapy educational organization where he currently serves on the board.</p>



<p>“This concludes our investigation and actions for this article, unless new evidence should be forthcoming,” the publisher said in their letter to the NoFap group.</p>



<p>NoFap’s lawyer <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lawyer-response-to-TF.pdf">informed the publisher</a> on Aug. 22, 2024, that NoFap was planning to name Taylor &amp; Francis as a codefendant in a lawsuit against Pornhub, according to a letter NoFap sent us. The letter stated Rhodes and NoFap were demanding the retraction of the article and a published apology by the publisher, as well as a compensation of $20 million, if the publisher “would like to avoid the expense and burden of litigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Prause told us the issues raised about conflicts of interest and data integrity were addressed while the paper was under review at the journal.</p>



<p>“There are [American Psychological Association] requirements for how to disclose conflicts of interest,” Prause told us, which she said she had fulfilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also denied connections with xHamster, Pornhub and the Free Speech Coalition, and said Rhodes “just fabricated some of it in the hopes that something might stick or sound bad.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawsuit accuses Prause of creating her own violent posts in the subreddit, and claims the authors manipulated data to exacerbate the difference in violent posts between the control group and r/NoFap, making the latter seem more violent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked what she thought about the allegations of data falsification, she said: “That’s fraudulent. Full stop.”</p>



<p>Prause told us the authors “were completely confident and remain completely confident” in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study data included 421 violent posts across the three subreddits, 397 of which came from r/NoFap. The lawsuit alleged the authors included a “whopping 156” posts with violent content that had been deleted from r/NoFap prior to the study. However, Prause told us she wouldn’t have been able to access deleted posts with the software she used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also pointed to a line from the study: “As these data were made public in the [Open Science Framework] database, r/NoFap began deleting the posts. Carefully preserve data when studying r/NoFap,” the authors wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper has been cited five times, including once by its correction, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Rhodes told us the main aim of the lawsuit was to call out instances of Prause’s failure to abide by the non-disparagement agreement, including publishing several articles that name NoFap directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Deviant Behavior</em> paper was an “egregious violation of the contract,” Rhodes said, and called it “mind-boggling” the publisher didn’t retract it. “We thought [Taylor &amp; Francis] made an error” when it was published, he said.</p>



<p>Rhodes told us the other five papers were primarily included in the suit as examples of Prause violating the terms of the settlement, and he would be happy if the papers were corrected to remove NoFap, as he felt this would satisfy the non-disparagement agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors “should probably make some amendments to remove any contract breaching statements,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An unnamed representative for NoFap told us the lawsuit is a “last resort measure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lawsuit is not to litigate science (there is nothing scientific about the Taylor &amp; Francis paper), but to enforce contractual non-disparagement obligations and to stop a coordinated campaign of harassment and disinformation that has harmed our website and dozens of other targets,” NoFap wrote.</p>



<p>The motion to dismiss filed by Taylor &amp; Francis said the publisher “did nothing more than publish a scholarly article in one of its academic journals.” In addition to refuting each of the claims made against them, the motion argues Taylor &amp; Francis is “immune from liability,” since the claims made against them are based on “protected public expression.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher declined further comment on the suit or the paper.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><br>A Quickening took place sometime between the end of 2025, when Claude Sonnet Opus 4.5 dropped, and February 5, 2026 when Codex 5.3 was released. On Tuesday February 3rd, I downloaded Claude Opus 4.5 for the first time. My first experiment was to try a port of <a href="https://github.com/pachterlab/sleuth">Sleuth</a>, which my former PhD student Harold Pimentel <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in 2017</a>. Sleuth was written in R, and I figured it would be useful to have it Python, since then it could be adapted to single-cell RNA-seq and work seamlessly with the popular Python-based <a href="https://scverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-cell ecosystem</a>. Within an hour I was able to port Sleuth to Python and replicate <em>exactly</em> the results in R. I was stunned by the ability of Claude, so I figured I should try something even more ambitious. During a discussion with my former student <a href="https://www.sina.bio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sina Booeshaghi</a>, he suggested I tackle <strong><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edgeR</a>, </strong>which consists of 14,808 lines of code across 136 files (117 in R and 19 in C).</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Thursday February 5th I started working on edgePython. This was not just a port for the sake of performing a port. I had three specific goals in mind: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I wanted an edgePython that could interact seamlessly with AnnData objects, so that differential analysis could proceed without exporting the data and reading it back in from R. Seamless is a key word. Along with an <a href="https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnnData</a> interface, I resolved that the port should stick to Python (possibly with Numba), but not incorporate C.</li>



<li>Python has become the <em>de facto</em> standard for single-cell genomics with a huge ecosystem of methods and tools (<a href="https://tomsing1.github.io/blog/posts/anndataR/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the extent that R users are converting Seurat objects to AnnData</a>), so I wanted to use the edgeR port to develop a new single-cell differential analysis method. The approach for single-cell differential in edgePython seemed obvious: port the single-cell <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02146-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEBULA method</a>, and then incorporate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Empirical Bayes</a>, which has been a hallmark feature of edgeR.</li>



<li>To be useful, the port would have to be comprehensive, covering most of edgeR&#8217;s functionality, and it would have to be similar in speed. The latter did not seem to be a trivial goal; I checked and edgeR is 39% C code (so it is really edgeRC), and I wasn&#8217;t sure Python could match it. </li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>It took me about a week to achieve these three goals</strong>, and a few extra days to write up a manuscript with the details. The edgePython code is here: <a href="https://github.com/pachterlab/edgePython">https://github.com/pachterlab/edgePython</a>. A preprint describing the work is here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.02.16.706223">https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.02.16.706223</a><br><br>The sport of predicting dystopian vs. utopian futures of human civilization in light of recent advances in AI is a strange one, where games inevitably result in a loss for both sides. Thus, I won&#8217;t play, but I will offer some observations on the impact of AI on my corner of science right now:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A Python port of edgeR has been attempted twice before, to my knowledge. <a href="https://github.com/r-bioinformatics/edgePy">One effort did not succeed</a>. The other, part of the <a href="https://inmoose.readthedocs.io/en/stable/edgepy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inMoose project</a>, did result in a partial port after years of work by multiple individuals. The difficulty in porting edgeR stems from a complex codebase: Of the 14,808 lines of code, 39% are written in C, and a lot of the code relates to complex numerical statistical algorithms. A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/9/btad547/7260507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python port of DESeq2 was published in 2023</a>. This port, while functional, was also <a href="https://pydeseq2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incomplete</a>. I performed my initial port with Claude Opus 4.5 and 4.6, and more recently worked on finishing off several pieces with Codex GPT-5.3. I find it remarkable that these tools were able to produce an essentially complete Python port in a week. Remarkably, the running time of the Python port is comparable to that of edgeR (in some cases the port is faster). The port does use Numba, but it does not rely on any C code. While I had to work closely with the Claude and Codex tools to make the port work, and some of my contribution was non-trivial (thanks to Sina Booeshaghi for some major assists along the way), it seems to me that much of my involvement could be automated in the future. The acceleration of computational biology is increasing. I would say that even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth,_fifth,_and_sixth_derivatives_of_position">snap</a> is positive.<br></li>



<li>A Python implementation of edgeR is valuable because of the single-cell genomics ecosystem that has been developed in Python, largely around AnnData objects which is part of <a href="https://scverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scverse</a>. Now, with edgePython, differential analysis can be performed directly on AnnData objects without the need for expensive export / import, not to mention the hassle and burden of maintaining a full R/Bioconductor stack and its dependencies. For several of my own project, edgePython has lowered the barriers to adoption of some of the edgeR algorithms.<br></li>



<li>I was able to simultaneously extend to two different programs: NEBULA and edgeR, to enable single-cell differential analysis with Empirical Bayes. Of course, this extension could have been implemented in R, but the Python single-cell ecosystem makes this method much more likely to be used now that it&#8217;s part of edgePython. I find it remarkable that I was able to build on two programs in this way; while they are both open source, the &#8220;open&#8221; aspect of the codebases has, in many cases, until now been literally true but practically insufficient. To build on a tool such as edgeR, which is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/1/139/182458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16+ years in the making</a> and consists of a complex codebase with thousands of lines of code, would previously have required years of study and effort to be able to confidently alter the codebase. That is why many bioinformatics tools have effectively &#8220;remained lab-bound. Automated programming democratizes all such projects.<br></li>



<li>I have many ideas for further extensions of edgePython. Isoform-level quantification is essential for accurate differential analysis, even for gene-level differential analysis (see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pimentel <em>et al</em>., 2017</a>), and while edgeR recently implemented an approach for differential transcript usage based on inferential uncertainty of isoform quantifications, an idea developed in sleuth (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/3/e13/7460324?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldoni <em>et al., </em>2024</a>), there is much work to be done on further methods development. I was also able to fix minutiae in the edgeR implementation, albeit details with serious implications. For example, in reviewing the edgeR code I discovered that the authors handicapped kallisto but not implementing import of kallisto HDF5 files, which is essential for utilizing kallisto bootstraps for isoform quantification. edgePython fixes this.<br></li>



<li>Thinking about isoforms and their role in differential analysis led me to the following hypothesis: a major challenge that will have to be addressed (by humans) in the near term is how to avoid a proliferation of suboptimal tools (and therefore suboptimal results derived from them). Frequently in computational biology the majority opinion is wrong (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for an example see the use of UMAPs</a>). Pushing back against the majority can be difficult for scientists, but it is possible. The empowerment of the majority with accelerants may serve to massively amplify flawed approaches, making it much harder for the minority opinion to prevail, even if it is correct.<br></li>



<li>Working with Claude and Codex has been exhilarating. Being able to code up ideas quickly and effectively opens up wide vistas for everyone. This is already resulting in a deluge of publications (see, e.g. <a href="https://blog.neurips.cc/2025/09/30/reflections-on-the-2025-review-process-from-the-program-committee-chairs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NeurIPS 2025 which received more than 21,000 submissions</a>). I don&#8217;t believe that current publication systems, whether for preprints, conference proceedings, or journals, can withstand the onslaught of work that is already in progress, let alone the amount of material that is to come. This is an opportunity to think of novel ways to distribute and communicate science. I think that machine readability, at least for part of it, will be one aspect of a potential solution (see <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.30.702911v1">Booeshaghi, Luebbert, Pachter., 2026</a>).<br></li>



<li>There is one barrier to exploring ideas with our newfound machine tools: cost. As Doron Zeilberger predicted, it will not be possible to try <em>every</em> idea, because even if costs are lowered, as long as they are nonzero, we will face the problem that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+c++n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+c++n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+c++n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;lim_{n &#92;to &#92;infty} c  n" class="latex" /> diverges when <em>c &gt; 0</em>. In other words, we will face not just the reality of what Zeilberger calls semi-rigorous mathematics, but more generally semi-rigorous science. This may require an adjustment in habits and expectations.<br></li>



<li>I said I wouldn&#8217;t play the prediction game but I will step onto the field just for a moment&#8230; while working on this project I thought of recent comments I&#8217;ve heard such as &#8220;Subject X will be the first to go&#8221;. This is folly. Nothing is going anywhere. Science is about to get better and it will proceed faster than at any time in history. But if someone is going to insist on looking up their integrals by hand in <a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cbm/aands/abramowitz_and_stegun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abramowitz and Stegun</a>, they may find that the scientific enterprise leaves them behind (although artisanal science may be a satisfying hobby for sure).</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Highlander Quickenings are not free. The knowledge and power gained by one immortal comes at a loss for another. Scientists should think long and hard about where the coding superpower they have just received comes from (tl;dr: the enormous corpus of computer code written by software engineers over the past 50+ years, much of it informed by hard work in the sciences). We should all strive to ensure that fruits from the labor of others are turned into meaningful profit for society and not for empty vanity.</p>
