                <p>In a <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/">Tablet Magazine</a> article titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-gaza-health-ministry-fakes-casualty-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How the Gaza Ministry of Health Fakes Casualty Numbers</a>&#8221; posted on March 6, 2024, Professor of Statistics and Data Science <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ajw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abraham Wyner</a> from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania argues that statistical analysis of the casualty numbers reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health is &#8220;highly suggestive that a process unconnected or loosely connected to reality was used to report the numbers&#8221;.</p>



<p>In the post, he shows the following plot </p>

<p>which he describes as revealing &#8220;an extremely regular increase in casualties over the period&#8221; and from which he concludes that &#8220;this regularity is almost surely not real.&#8221; </p>



<p>Wyner&#8217;s plot shows cumulative reported deaths over a period of 15 days from October 26, 2023 to November 10, 2023. The individual reported deaths per day are plotted below. These numbers have a mean of 270 and a standard deviation of 42.25:</p>

<p>The coefficient of determination for the points in this plot is <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.233.

Why does the same data look &#8220;extremely regular&#8221; one way, and much less regular another way? <br><br>If we denote the deaths per day by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7B15%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7B15%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7B15%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="x_1,&#92;ldots,x_{15}" class="latex" />, then the plot Wyner shows is of the cumulative deaths <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3Dx_1%2Cy_2%3Dx_1%2Bx_2%2Cy_3+%3D+x_1%2Bx_2%2Bx_3%2C%5Cldots%2C+y_n%3Dx_1%2B%5Ccdots%2Bx_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3Dx_1%2Cy_2%3Dx_1%2Bx_2%2Cy_3+%3D+x_1%2Bx_2%2Bx_3%2C%5Cldots%2C+y_n%3Dx_1%2B%5Ccdots%2Bx_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3Dx_1%2Cy_2%3Dx_1%2Bx_2%2Cy_3+%3D+x_1%2Bx_2%2Bx_3%2C%5Cldots%2C+y_n%3Dx_1%2B%5Ccdots%2Bx_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y_1=x_1,y_2=x_1+x_2,y_3 = x_1+x_2+x_3,&#92;ldots, y_n=x_1+&#92;cdots+x_n" class="latex" />.

<p>In the plots above,  the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Bres%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Bres%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Bres%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="SS_{&#92;mbox{res}}" class="latex" /> are roughly the same, however <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Btot%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Btot%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Btot%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="SS_{&#92;mbox{tot}}" class="latex" /> is much, <em>much</em>, higher for the <em>y<sub>i</sub></em> in comparison to the <em>x<sub>i</sub></em>. This is always true when transforming data into cumulative sums, and is such a strong effect, that simulating reported deaths with a mean of 270 but increasing the variance ten-fold to 17,850, still yields an &#8220;extremely regular increase&#8221;, with <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.99:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monarch-caterpillar-milkweed-butterfly-binge">Big monarch caterpillars don’t avoid toxic milkweed goo. They binge on it</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maybe science has misunderstood the dining style of big monarch butterfly caterpillars. What insect watchers have called defense against the toxic latex a milkweed plant oozes may not be avoidance at all. Instead of dodging the plants’ sticky, white toxic goo, the plump, older caterpillars could be gorging on it.</p>



<p>Monarch caterpillars (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) hatch and feed on milkweeds, which fight back when bitten and ooze milky toxin-rich latex. Monarchs evolved their own counter-chemistry for surviving the toxins. Yet that plant latex can still kill by sheer gooeyness, explains ecologist Georg Petschenka of University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany.&nbsp; Very tiny, recently hatched caterpillars can get fatally stuck with mouthparts clogged.</p>



<p>Caterpillars, however, can get around milkweed sticky traps by nipping leaf stalks and then waiting for the latex channels to bleed out. A swath of killer leaf becomes a harmless vegetable.</p>



<p>For older caterpillars strong enough to risk glue, Petschenka argues, those bleed-out cuts can do more than disarm a leaf. By this stage, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.2721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the monarch caterpillars feast on the latex</a> itself. Offering them a pipette loaded with latex to suckle showed they drink it readily and build up their own defensive reserves of milkweed toxins, he and entomologists Anja Betz and Robert Bischoff, also at Hohenheim, reported February 21 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>The older caterpillars dip their mouthparts in latex “like a little cat drinking milk,” Petschenka says.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Age makes a big difference in monarch caterpillars&#8217; willingness to drink the defensive toxin-rich &#8220;milk&#8221; that wells up from wounds in milkweed plants, lab experiments show. It&#8217;s dangerously gluey for the youngest and tiniest stage of monarch caterpillars. As the caterpillars grow up through five stages, they eventually switch from rejecting a pipette of it to eager drinking, as seen in this video.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Usually, the toxins, called cardenolides, attack an animal enzyme that’s crucial to cells for keeping potassium and sodium concentrations in balance. Monarch caterpillars, however, can convert some of the milkweed cardinolides into less toxic forms. These build up as lifelong deterrents against predators such as birds.</p>



<p>It was thought that monarchs gain most of that protection from nibbling the leafy greens, not going for milkweed’s vascular system. But the idea that the bigger caterpillars might be harvesting latex as protection has floated around now and then, perhaps starting with the early 20th century British pioneer of chemical ecology, Miriam Rothschild. Another idea has been that caterpillars working on leaf cuts will drink latex “to get the sticky noxious fluid out of the way,” says insect ecologist David Dussourd, at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway, who has noticed the latex licking before.</p>



<p>But it’s not obvious behavior. “I have never seen monarch caterpillars drinking beads of latex sap from milkweed, but now after reading this finding, I am going to pay more attention to what they are doing,” says ecologist Sonia Altizer of the University of Georgia in Athens.</p>



<p>What triggered Petschenka’s curiosity was noticing that he didn’t see latex left at a wound after big caterpillars ate. “We would expect this to flow out and then maybe to dry up,” he says. So maybe those cuts were not made to avoid mouthfuls of cardenolide toxins but to find some.</p>



<p>He and his team found a variety of evidence supporting the idea that older monarch caterpillars are toxin-loading. For instance, the researchers saw them now and then just settling down to feed on a leaf instead of making a preliminary bite and waiting for latex to drain. That never happened with comparison caterpillars of a <em>Euploea</em> species that will eat milkweed but not stash its toxins. These non-sequestering diners always drained latex from lab leaves before dining.</p>



<p>Also, the young monarch caterpillars themselves offered a monarch-to-monarch comparison. The very young ones avoided latex, but when older, they shifted to “eager drinking,” the researchers say.</p>



<p>These findings and others in the paper got a hard look from evolutionary biologist Anurag Agrawal of Cornell University. Even though he admires Miriam Rothschild and had supervised Petschenka’s Ph.D., Agrawal for years dismissed caterpillar latex-sipping as “a necessary evil.” The only way for a caterpillar “to successfully deactivate the pressurized latex was to suck it up,” he wrote in his 2017 book <em>Monarchs and Milkweed</em>. Now, however, he says, “the study changed my mind.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-longest-goodbye-astronaut-mental-health-documentary">‘Space: The Longest Goodbye’ explores astronauts’ mental health</a></h4>

              
                <p>NASA engineers must quantify everything. But no matter how many equations they use to calculate launch windows, estimate exposure to cosmic radiation or create flight trajectories, there’s one thing they can’t quantify: the mental health of astronauts.</p>



<p>And for a while, NASA could get away with it. Early astronauts certainly faced mental challenges — worries over mission failures, the fear of the unknown. But it wasn’t until the arrival of space stations that astronauts began spending months away from home. In 1994, with the building of the International Space Station under way, NASA formed a psychological unit.</p>



<p>Now, NASA astronauts may soon embark on even longer trips into deep space. Long-distance relationships are hard enough on Earth. On a three-year, round trip <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rigors-mars-trip-make-teamwork-priority">trek to Mars</a>, navigating the unparalleled separation from home could be one of the biggest challenges to a successful mission (<em>SN: 11/14/14</em>).</p>



<p><a href="https://greenwichentertainment.com/film/the-longest-goodbye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Space: The Longest Goodbye</em></a><em>, </em>a documentary directed by Ido Mizrahy, follows the journey of mentally preparing astronauts for such an unprecedented trip and reflects on the history of the NASA psychological unit. It premieres in theaters on March 8, as well as on Apple TV, Amazon and other streaming services.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch the trailer for <em>Space: The Longest Goodbye</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The film primarily follows astronauts Kayla Barron — a member of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">NASA’s Artemis program</a>, which aims to send people to the moon and then Mars (<em>SN: 11/16/22</em>) — and Cady Coleman, who spent over 100 days aboard the space station. The film is not just about these two astronauts going to space; it’s also about the families they leave behind.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most poignant narrative is Coleman’s. In 2010, she entered space for the third time, leaving her son, Jamey, when he was in fourth grade. Spotty video chats show Jamey’s growing anguish as his mom orbited Earth for several months. Coleman wipes tears that float away in zero gravity, which emphasizes her own homesickness.</p>



<p>But longing for loved ones isn’t the only psychological challenge astronauts face. Coleman also details the near-constant surveillance she was under while aboard the space station, from cameras following her every move to regular check-ins with psychological evaluators. The endless scrutiny caused her to take careful stock of how many feelings she could reveal to avoid being deemed unfit for life in space and then grounded, literally.</p>

<p>The film also tackles the range of external strategies devised in collaboration with the NASA psychological unit in preparation for long-term space travel, from the development of a friendly robot intended to avert loneliness to desert simulations designed to study interpersonal conflict in extreme isolation. There is an astonishing, and frankly, overwhelming number of ideas being tested for the Artemis astronauts. Woven between long, wide shots of the vast emptiness of space, these vignettes of strategies provide respite for the viewer who begins to vicariously experience the loneliness of space.</p>



<p><em>Space: The Longest Goodbye </em>is terrifying and hopeful, wistful and thrilling, reflective and overwhelming, all the contradictions present in the reality of being an astronaut.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/grumbach.png?ssl=1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/grumbach.png?resize=200%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128891" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Isabella Grumbach</figcaption></figure></div>


<p class="has-drop-cap">On Sept. 2, 2021, a professor at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, emailed a biochemistry journal asking to correct a paper she had published the previous year. An experiment had “unintentionally” been omitted from a figure, <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/isabella-grumbach">Isabella Grumbach</a> explained, and a comparison of experimental groups contained “a minor error in the degree of statistical significance.” A correction ensued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the problems with the article, “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31711984/">Inhibition of CaMKII in mitochondria preserves endothelial barrier function after irradiation,</a>” appear to have been more deep-rooted than the email suggested. An anonymous commenter on PubPeer hS first <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B9CF167BD697C8F000E02ECC74F52B">raised concerns</a> about the article, which had appeared in <em>Free Radical Biology and Medicine (FRBM),</em> in July 2021, more than a year after it was published. The commenter claimed error bars between two figures were vastly different, even though they were meant to be related data points. </p>



<span id="more-128890"></span>



<p>Grumbach, the corresponding author of the paper, promised to investigate. A month later, she wrote to Rafael Radi, an editor<em> </em>at the journal,<em> </em>Rafael Radi, saying she had omitted an experiment from the paper by mistake, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-Re_-Your-manuscript-FRBM_2019_1387_R1-has-been-accepted.pdf">according to documents Retraction Watch obtained</a> through a public records request. But, she noted, “the data interpretation or overall conclusion<em> </em>from these data are not impacted by this error.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach, who is <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/isabella-grumbach">interim chair of internal medicine</a> at the Carver College of Medicine at the University of Iowa, said the repeated analysis had strengthened the paper’s conclusions and requested a corrigendum. The correction was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34587565/">published in November 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that didn’t make the problem go away. Within a month of the correction, another comment appeared on PubPeer claiming the revision didn’t explain the errors the first comment had flagged. Again, the commenter requested the authors share the raw data. This time the authors did not respond to the post.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Then, in January 2022, a sleuth <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lFKLBxBk7cv8KhQFh6PvrYZ_SBtI5Emc/view?usp=sharing">contacted the editor-in-chief of <em>FRBM</em></a>, Kelvin J. A. Davies, claiming:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All figure in this paper have data and statistic method that is manipulated or falsified. Paper say &#8220;independent experiment&#8221; but honestly data not from independent experiment. Actually data show replicate reading of same sample from same experiment. This false statistic analysis make very small error bar so statistic significance is reached. If data points from independent experiment analyze then there is big variation and no statistic significance so major conclusions of paper not valid.</p>



<p>Check original data and see how statistic falsified to reach desired conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email was appended with the comments from PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month later, the chair of the journal’s ethics committee, Giovanni E. Mann, wrote to Grumbach saying the committee had reviewed the case following the sleuth’s email. Mann noted the authors did not respond directly to the commenter’s request for raw data. He also flagged statistical concerns and added, “We do need to see the individual data points on which these figures and statistics were based.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach said she would perform a comprehensive review and prepare a reply to the queries. In her email, she also wrote, “we have seen a very unusual increase in activities regarding the manuscripts from a select group of investigators in the Dept. of Internal Medicine.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach did not respond to our queries about the “unusual increase in activities.” She is listed as an author on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=grumbach">two other papers</a> that were called out on PubPeer around the same time. One was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35131484/">issued an erratum</a> and another <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.v63retraction1">an expression of concern</a>, both related to the inclusion of duplicate data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of <em>FRBM</em>, said the editors were not aware of the PubPeer comments before the sleuth’s email, and made the decision to publish a correction “based on mistakes raised by the author.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In April 2022, Grumbach <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iDBEony7DBlwjyJm1NlaQWvA4Dt_VYrw/view?usp=sharing">officially requested to retract the paper</a>, which has been cited 14 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. She told Davies: “I analyzed these data and inaccurately pasted the data into the analysis software, leading to an incorrect grouping of the data. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please advise me on the next steps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice, published online in May 2022, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Authors and Editor-in-Chief.</p>



<p>Some of the data presented in Figure 6C, F and G of the above-titled paper were reported incorrectly in the published article. After being contacted by the Journal, the authors discovered an unintentional error in how the original data were analyzed that could affect the accuracy of the subsequent analysis. The raw data were incorrectly grouped in the analysis software, thereby altering the comparisons. Therefore the authors wish to retract the paper and will recollect and reanalyze the data appropriately. The authors apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice added that the authors would “recollect and reanalyze the data appropriately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach declined to be interviewed for this story but a spokesperson passed on a statement from her:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I take research integrity very seriously, which is why I asked for a retraction of this paper when I realized there were errors in the data and analysis after I had submitted an erratum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since its retraction, the paper has also been included among the references in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.317869">another paper by the group</a>, although that “manuscript was drafted and submitted for initial review before the retraction,” according to the university spokesperson.</p>

                <p><strong>Meghna Solanki explores the life and work of Rita Levi-Montalcini, a 'trailblazer' in the field of neuroscience, renowned for her discovery of nerve growth factor.</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong>"...let us continue to honour her memory by fostering an inclusive environment where all scientists...can thrive and make meaningful contributions...</strong><strong>"</strong></blockquote><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_7d01c048ee0f4fc9a1348a51b16eda16~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_240,h_361,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Rita Levi Montalcini (cnr.it)" ></figure><p>In the archives of neuroscience, Rita Levi-Montalcini's name shines brightly as a beacon of innovation, resilience, and gender equality. Born on April 22nd, 1909, in Turin, Italy, Rita defied societal norms and overcame numerous obstacles to become one of the most influential neuroscientists of the 20th century. Her remarkable journey and groundbreaking discoveries not only revolutionised our understanding of the nervous system, but also inspired generations of female scientists to pursue their passions, despite adversities. </p>

<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini's early years were marked by a fierce determination to pursue her scientific interests in a male-dominated field: "At 20, I realised that I could not possibly adjust to a feminine role as conceived by my father and asked him permission to engage in a professional career." Despite facing opposition from her traditional family, she pursued her education, obtaining a degree in Medicine and Surgery from the University of Turin in 1936. However, her journey as a female scientist was fraught with challenges: discrimination and prejudice against women in academia were rampant, yet Rita refused to be deterred. She persevered, determined to make her mark in the scientific world. She published the groundbreaking paper titled "Effects of mouse tumour transplantation on the nervous system" in 1951, which laid the foundation for her later work on nerve growth factor.</p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_6e0d56cb98b2413881b3b3aabe005225~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_253,h_363,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Rita Levi-Montalcini receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1986 (imsvintagephotos.com)" ></figure><p>One of Rita Levi-Montalcini's most significant contributions to neuroscience was her discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the early 1950s, alongside colleague Stanley Cohen. Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered NGF using a pioneering method, which involved studying the effects of mouse tumour transplantation on the nervous system. She observed that the tumours stimulated the growth of nearby nerve fibres, which led to the identification and isolation of NGF. This groundbreaking discovery - for which she and Stanley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986 -  fundamentally transformed our understanding of how nerve cells develop, grow and function, laying a foundation for modern neuroscience. NGF's role in promoting the survival and growth of neurones paved the way for countless studies relating to neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. </p>
<blockquote><strong>"Her life story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of diversity and inclusion"</strong></blockquote>
<p>Beyond her scientific achievements, Rita Levi-Montalcini's legacy as a woman in neuroscience is equally profound. She shattered glass ceilings and paved the way for future generations of female scientists to thrive in a field historically dominated by men. Through her tenacity, brilliance, and unwavering dedication to her craft, she inspired countless women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Her life story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of diversity and inclusion in scientific research, highlighting the invaluable contributions that women can make to advancing our understanding of the world.</p>

<p>In addition to her scientific endeavours, Rita Levi-Montalcini was a fervent advocate for education, gender equality, and social justice. She used her platform and influence to champion causes close to her heart, tirelessly advocating for the rights and empowerment of women in STEM fields. Her philanthropic efforts, including the establishment of the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation, continue to support scientific research and education initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the scientific community.</p>

<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini's contributions to neuroscience, and as a woman in STEM, are nothing short of extraordinary. Her groundbreaking discoveries, unwavering determination, and advocacy for gender equality have not only advanced our scientific knowledge, but also inspired countless individuals, particularly women, to pursue careers in science and medicine around the world. As we celebrate her legacy, let us continue to honour her memory by fostering an inclusive environment where all scientists, regardless of gender, can thrive and make meaningful contributions to advancing human knowledge and understanding by breaking barriers and stereotypes along the way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caecilian-egg-laying-amphibian-feed-milk-animal">This is the first egg-laying amphibian found to feed its babies ‘milk’</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the middle of the night in a humid coastal rainforest, a litter of pink, hairless babies snuggle with their mother. They stir and squeak for milk, their mother obliges, and they are sated. But these are no puppies or cubs. They are snake-shaped amphibians, far closer to frogs than foxes.</p>



<p>These <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi5379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ringed caecilian moms feed their hatchlings a kind of “milk”</a> brewed in the reproductive tract, researchers report in the March 8 <em>Science</em>. The long, cylindrical creatures are the first egg-laying amphibians known to feed hatchlings this way. The discovery suggests the evolution of parental care across animal life is more diverse than researchers thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an animal with so few discernable external features, caecilians are a fount of strange biology. Caecilians are elusive, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/new-fossils-shake-history-amphibians-no-legs">legless</a>, burrowing amphibians that are nearly blind (<em>SN: 6/19/17</em>). Some species, like the ringed caecilian (<em>Siphonops annulatus</em>) in the new study, have poisonous slime, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caecilians-amphibians-venomous-bites">may be venomous</a> and feed their own skin to their young (<em>SN: 7/3/20</em>).</p>



<p>Herpetologist Carlos Jared of the Instituto Butantan in São Paulo and his colleagues have been studying these eccentric animals for years. In previous studies, the team noticed that ringed caecilian hatchlings, which live their first two months out of the egg in their mother’s care, spent much of their time around the end of her body near the shared opening of the reproductive, digestive and urinary systems — an anatomical part called the vent. The female would periodically expel a thick fluid from the vent, which the young would enthusiastically feed on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Some [young] even stuck their heads inside this opening,” Jared says.</p>



<p>In the new work, the team collected 16 females and their newly hatched litters from Bahia state in Brazil, bringing them into the lab for observation. There, the researchers recorded the amphibians’ interactions, accumulating over 240 hours of video footage. The team recorded 36 feedings, which often involved the babies wriggling and nibbling at their mother’s vent while making high-pitched noises. Mom would then raise that end of her body and release the fluid. This happened up to six times per day and appeared to be in response to the babies’ pleas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The squeaking and begging is a particularly fascinating observation, says Mark Wilkinson, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London, because the adults are thought to be sensitive only to lower sound frequencies.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch as a female ringed caecilian (<em>Siphonops annulatus</em>) feeds her young a fat-rich, milk-like fluid. Her babies (smaller caecilians) nuzzle near the opening to her reproductive system. Soon after, the mother releases the nutritious fluid produced in her oviduct. This video is 600 times faster than the original.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The team also examined the internal anatomy of some of the adult female caecilians and analyzed the nutritional and biochemical makeup of the nutritional fluid. It is secreted by glands in the mother’s oviduct that enlarge while raising her hatchlings. It’s also rich in fats, much like mammal milk. This nutritious resource may help explain how the hatchlings grow so fast — bulking up their mass by up to 130 percent, an additional 0.27 grams, in the first week out of the egg — despite not leaving their mother’s side and feeding on her skin only once every few days.</p>



<p>Isabella Capellini, an evolutionary biologist at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, wonders if there is&nbsp;conflict between squiggly siblings for milk access and how that competition might play out. She’d also be curious to know more about how milk production affects the mother caecilian.</p>



<p>“In mammals, lactation is the most expensive stage of reproduction for the mother,” she says. “It would be useful to study whether milk production is as expensive in caecilians too. How is the mother impacted in the short- and long-term?”</p>



<p>It’s not known how these amphibians have evolved their version of “milk.” The substance is relatively rare in animals. Outside of mammals and some caecilians, it’s found only in certain spiders, fishes, cockroaches and birds, as well as two amphibians that give live birth.</p>



<p>In these egg-laying caecilians, the oviducts are behaving similarly to those of live-bearing caecilian species, which sometimes feed their babies a milky substance while in the womb, but do not feed them after they’re born.</p>



<p>“That makes it easier to conceive of how [live-bearing] could have evolved from [egg-laying] species that already used their oviducts to produce food,” Wilkinson says. “We really have learned a lot about caecilians in the last few decades, but we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>. The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. This is the fourth blog in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/">5-part series.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Dr. David Blumenthal, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit&auml;t, Faculty of Engineering, Department Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering</p>



<p>Disease association databases (DisGeNET [1], OMIM [2], DrugBank [3], etc.) containing disease-gene, disease-symptom, or disease-drug links are used extensively in various subfields of data-centric biomedicine. However, in such databases, diseases are annotated using our current mainly organ- or symptom-based disease definitions (UMLS concept unique identifiers (CUIs), MONDO identifiers, ICD-10 codes, etc.), which are often umbrella terms for several yet unknown causal molecular mechanisms with similar phenotypic effects [4]. Consequently, widely used large-scale disease association databases are systematically biased towards reproducing our current disease ontologies and are hence of limited use for data-driven precision medicine approaches which aim at a more fine-grained understanding of disease subtypes [5].</p>



<p>In view of this bias, one option would be to simply not use large-scale disease association databases for data-centric precision medicine. However, given the vast amount of aggregated knowledge contained therein, this is very unsatisfactory. In the proposed project, we will hence aim at salvaging large-scale disease association databases for precision medicine by disentangling the associations for ill-defined umbrella disease terms into subsets of associations for which there is solid evidence that they indeed describe endotypes corresponding to disjoint molecular mechanisms.</p>



<p>Consider the example of DisGeNET &ndash; an extremely widely used database containing associations between diseases and genes and disease and genetic variants. In DisGeNET, diseases are annotated using UMLS CUIs and disease links are defined mainly via aggregation of the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Yet, for mechanistically ill-defined &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; CUIs that do not correspond to distinct molecular mechanisms, the underlying aggregated GWAS were most likely investigating patients suffering from distinct unknown disease subtypes. In DisGeNET, genetic associations for all of these different subtypes are merged under the set of associations for the umbrella CUI.</p>



<p>In the proposed project, our aim is to develop a network-based computational approach to reverse such unspecific aggregations, which affect virtually any large-scale disease association database. As input, the envisaged algorithm will accept a set of (at least two) disease association databases containing different types of association data (e.g., disease-gene and disease-symptom associations) and a potentially ill-defined disease term D contained in all input databases. As output, it will return subsets of the term&rsquo;s associations in the input databases and a P-value which quantifies the evidence that these subsets indeed contain associations corresponding to distinct (possibly unknown) subtypes of the input disease D. Instead of starting with the unspecific associations for disease D, downstream precision medicine approaches can then make use of the uncovered subsets, potentially leading to more specific and promising hypotheses about molecular mechanisms driving complex diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/air-pollution-hard-pollinators-find-flowers">How air pollution may make it harder for pollinators to find flowers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Air pollution may blunt the signature scents of some night-blooming flowers, jeopardizing pollination.</p>



<p>When the aroma of a pale evening primrose encounters certain pollutants in the night air, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adi0858?af=R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pollutants destroy key scent molecules</a>, lab and field tests show. As a result, moths and other nocturnal pollinators may find it difficult to detect the fragrance and navigate to the flower, researchers report in the Feb. 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The finding highlights how air pollution can affect more than human health. &#8220;It&#8217;s really going deeper … affecting ecosystems and food security,” says Joel Thornton, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. &#8220;Pollination is so important for agriculture.&#8221;</p>



<p>Increasing industrialization has pumped ozone, nitrogen oxides and other pollutants into the air. During the day, sunlight typically breaks down ozone. But at night, the pollutant accumulates and reacts with nitrogen dioxide to produce nitrate radicals. These reactive molecules can affect plant fragrances, research has suggested, but the details weren’t clear. </p>



<p>Thornton and colleagues collected scent molecules from a pale evening primrose (<em>Oenothera pallida</em>) and released the fragrance into a wind tunnel containing hawk moths. The scientists could see the moths “easily flying upwind and tracking the odor,” says biologist Jeff Riffell of the University of Washington.</p>

In lab, they analyzed the composition of the fragrance and identified molecules that are degraded by air pollution.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3137273">Jeremy Chan/University of Washington, Seattle</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But it was a different story when the researchers added pollutants like ozone and nitrogen dioxide to the mix. Then, the hawk moths flew in zigzag patterns, often searching fruitlessly for scent cues.</p>



<p>Exposing hawk moth antennae to each of the molecules in the fragrance pinpointed the primary cues that the moths use to find flowers: two types of<br>aromatic compounds called monoterpenes. Molecular analysis revealed that<br>the compounds break into pieces when they encounter nitrate radicals, stripping the primrose of most of its aroma.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was surprising [that] a seemingly subtle change in concentration of only two compounds — out of more than 20 — was sufficient to eliminate the flower’s attractiveness,” Riffell says.</p>



<p>The effect is akin to putting a blindfold on someone and then asking them to go fetch a cup of coffee, says Jose Fuentes, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To test the findings in nature, ecologist Jeremy Chan, now at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy, planted a field of real and faux primroses about<br>280 kilometers east of Seattle. Some of the fakes emitted lab-made primrose<br>fragrance, while others released the fragrance as well as chemicals that react in the air to make nitrate radicals. Cameras recorded the number of times moths visited the experimental buds.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nocturnal pollinators like this hawk moth rely on scent cues to find flowers. Using faux flowers, researchers tested the insect’s ability to locate night-blooming flowers that are normally fragrant and those whose scent is degraded by pollutants. Here, the moth easily finds a fake bloom emitting the scent of a pale evening primrose. But when certain air pollutants that can build up at night were added to the mix, moths had trouble homing in on the blooms.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Moths usually visited real and fake flowers that emitted unsullied primrose scent two to three times a night. For fake flowers with polluted fragrances, the average number of nightly visits was less than one, the team found.</p>



<p>Scientists need to learn how the observed insect behavior may impact<br>foraging, Fuentes says. If insects are becoming more confused in places<br>where air pollution is getting worse, “it will impact pollination, crop productions [and] health of native plant species.”</p>

<p>Following criticism from scientists around the world, a virology journal has retracted a paper describing the first test in humans of an Iran-made vaccine against COVID-19.</p>



<p>Iran licensed the home-grown Noora vaccine for emergency use in 2022 and has <a href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1101482/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85%DB%8C-%DB%B2-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85">reportedly administered millions</a> of doses to its citizens.

<p>In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28731">a commentary</a> last year in the same journal, <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=2934">Donald Forthal</a>, chief of infectious diseases at the University of California, Irvine, raised several concerns about the article, titled “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28097">Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant receptor-binding domain-based protein subunit vaccine (Noora vaccine<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) against COVID-19 in adults: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported in October, Forthal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/26/publisher-looking-into-covid-vaccine-paper-with-serious-flaws/">questioned the efficacy</a> of the vaccine and expressed surprise “a manuscript containing so many serious flaws would have been accepted for publication following peer review, and given these issues, a retraction may be in order.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s editor-in-chief, Shou-Jiang Gao, said at the time the paper had undergone two rounds of “rigorously [sic] review by experts of the field” before it was published. The authors had responded to Forthal’s critique, Gao told us, and their response had “already undergone 3 rounds of review, each with 2 reviewers”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The last decision was made on October 24, 2023 and deadline for submitting the revision is November 23, 2023. So, we are waiting for the authors to submit the last revision before accepting and publishing it. This should fully address the issues that are raised.  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the response was never published. Meanwhile, in January, <a href="https://westernsydneydiabetes.com.au/staff-profiles/gideon-meyerowitz-katz/">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, an epidemiologist in Australia, flagged <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/179DB7875D6760293758F6CBD3900D#3">additional problems</a> in the paper on PubPeer, including several “impossible” and “contradictory” numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 2, the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.29509">announced</a> the paper had been retracted, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction has been agreed due to concerns raised by third parties regarding issues with the data presented in the article. Several inconsistencies concerning the information provided about the analyzed subjects were additionally identified. Furthermore, the authors failed to disclose the presence of potential conflicts of interest that may have affected the interpretation of the results presented. Accordingly, the editors consider the conclusions of this manuscript to be invalid. The authors have been informed of the decision to retract but did not agree with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corresponding author Hassan Abolghasemi of Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, in Tehran, told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Retraction of our article was a political decision not a scientific decision because there was a pressure on journal based on [apartheid] scientific issue. Our response to the comment never accepted by [PubPeer] and journal to be published.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Two days after the retraction, another group of researchers published <a href="https://iji.sums.ac.ir/article_49904.html">a study</a> in mice comparing the effect of four COVID-19 vaccines used in Iran.</p>



<p>“Our results indicate significant immunogenicity and neutralization efficacy induced by PastoCovac Plus and Sinopharm, but not by Noora and SpikoGen,” the team wrote in the article, which cited the now-retracted paper. “This suggests the need for additional comparative assessment of the potency and efficacy of these four vaccines in vaccinated subjects.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forests-neutrino-detectors-physics">Forests might serve as enormous neutrino detectors </a></h4>

              
                <p>Neutrino detectors don’t grow on trees. Or do they? Forests could one day be used to spot ultra-high-energy neutrinos, a physicist proposes.</p>



<p>Trees<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;could act as natural antennas</a>&nbsp;that pick up radio waves produced by certain interactions of the difficult-to-detect subatomic particles, astroparticle physicist Steven Prohira proposes in a paper submitted January 25 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“It is a very exciting idea,” says physicist Amy Connolly of the Ohio State University in Columbus, who was not involved with the study. “This could be … a natural solution that may have been sitting there under our noses.”</p>



<p>Neutrinos typically demand large, sensitive detectors. That’s especially true for detectors designed to snag the rarest, highest-energy neutrinos that shower down on Earth from space. Building such enormous detectors from scratch is a major hurdle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But high-energy neutrino physicists are known for building inventive detectors in natural settings. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-space-rain-down-all-directions">searches for neutrino interactions</a>&nbsp;using a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice, and the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope, KM3NeT, currently under construction, will search for neutrinos interacting in the Mediterranean Sea (<em>SN: 4/10/14</em>).&nbsp;These detectors have large enough volumes to make catching rare high-energy neutrinos possible.</p>



<p>To study neutrinos of even higher energies, scientists aim to spot one particular neutrino variety, called a tau neutrino. When such a neutrino passes inside the Earth, it can interact and produce a particle called a tau lepton. If that tau lepton escapes from the ground into Earth’s atmosphere, its decay can produce a shower of charged particles that generate radio waves. To detect these radio waves, scientists have proposed detectors such as the massive&nbsp;<a href="https://grand.cnrs.fr/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GRAND</a>&nbsp;experiment, which would use a total of 200,000 antennas divided into 20 separate arrays around the world.</p>



<p>Given the enormous undertaking involved in building that type of detector, “it dawned on me that it’d be cool if the antennas were already there,” says Prohira, of the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Previous research had shown that trees can pick up radio waves. Detecting those radio waves would require nailing a wire into each tree or wrapping a coil of wire around each tree’s trunk and connecting that to electronics to read out the signals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many questions still need to be answered to determine if the technique is plausible, Prohira acknowledges. Scientists would need to study how the trees performed for very high frequency radio waves, the range in which neutrino detectors of this type operate. And traditional radio antennas can be precisely built, allowing a detailed understanding of how they respond to different types of radio signals. Trees, of course, can’t be. For example, it’s not clear how trees would respond to the polarization of the radio waves, the orientation of their wiggles. Plus, the effect of foliage and, for deciduous forests, the seasonal dropping of leaves, needs to be investigated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the idea is inspiring, says physicist Eric Oberla of the University of Chicago, “it&#8217;s unclear if supplanting manufactured antennas with trees will solve more problems than it might create, and these detector-design challenges would need to be further addressed.”</p>



<p>Any impact the detector would have on the forest would also need to be understood. “Such a detector,” Prohira writes in the paper, “must be built in harmony with, and with respect for, nature; otherwise, this idea is not worth trying.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bmc-pregnancy-childbirth.jpeg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" width="110" height="156" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bmc-pregnancy-childbirth.jpeg?resize=110%2C156&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128876" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>


<p>A group of 10 members of the editorial board of <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> have resigned to protest the journal’s failure to respond to allegations of data fabrication.</p>



<p>Last week, in an email obtained by Retraction Watch, the editors wrote to Tovah Aronin, the managing editor of the journal, regarding “concerns about the publication of fraudulent research in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth and BMC Women’s Health in 2023.”</p>



<p>The allegations about two papers had been sent to the journal on Jan. 29, 2024, by Ben Mol, an obstetrician-gynecologist who has <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research">earned a reputation as a sleuth</a> for his efforts to clean up the literature in the field:</p>



<span id="more-128874"></span>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05728-w">Comparative study between oxytocin and combination of tranexamic acid and ethamsylate in reducing intra-operative bleeding during emergency and elective cesarean section after 38 weeks of normal pregnancy</a>,” published in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</li>



<li>“<a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-023-02549-z">Oxytocin versus a combination of tranexamic acid and ethamsylate in reducing intraoperative bleeding during abdominal myomectomy: a randomized clinical trial</a>,” published in BMC Women’s Health</li>
</ul>



<p>Mol told the editors he was puzzled by, among other things, the mean ages of the women in both studies, which contrasted sharply with data in other papers from the same period in the same medical center. <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/jim.thornton">Jim Thornton</a>, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Nottingham in the UK, left a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E44334B9748976BD99706983134EA1">similar comment</a> about one of the papers on PubPeer.</p>



<p>Mohamed Abdelmonem Kamel of Fayoum University in Egypt, the corresponding author of both papers, has not responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The editors said Mol’s evidence:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>strongly suggests this research is fabricated. While some issues are concerning, such as a zero loss to follow up, which is almost impossible in a real-world study, other issues, such as the indication for Caesarean section in a myomectomy paper, are extremely worrying.</p>



<p>Given the seriousness of the allegations, we would have expected the journal to respond immediately by placing a note of concern on these papers and asking the authors for their original data so that an investigation could be carried out. However, the journal has not even replied to Prof Mol (who is himself a leading clinical trialist in maternity care).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We cannot continue to serve on the editorial board of BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth unless the journal responds to serious, substantiated allegations of research fraud. Fraudulent research endangers women and babies by supporting ineffective treatments. We cannot allow this to go unchallenged and therefore feel that we cannot continue to serve as members of the editorial board. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>They left the door open to reversing themselves:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We would be happy to rejoin the Editorial Board if there is a strong and immediate response to raise concerns about the published manuscripts, and to retract papers where research fraud is proven. In addition, we believe that authors of proven fraudulent research should be banned from future submissions to the journal and from serving on the editorial board. For now, we can no longer justify being an editor of BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth.</p>



<p>We have long supported BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, submitting our own research and facilitating peer review of others’ research. It devalues our research and that of the majority of authors to allow fraudulent research to remain in the public domain unchallenged. We urge you to act to preserve the integrity of the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Aronin told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to assure you that investigations of Ben Mol’s accusations are ongoing. We have been remiss in proper communication with the Editorial Board regarding these accusations and our investigations and we are planning on sending communications to them soon, and I hope that we will be able to reassure them that there is no need to resign.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Mol, he has so far flagged nearly 900 papers, of which 155 have been retracted and 72 have received expressions of concern. Most of the rest are in limbo, with no known outcome. Mol added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have flagged only 10% of what should be flagged. The big problem is the lack of response from the field.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3d-animal-anatomy-openvertebrate">See 3-D models of animal anatomy from openVertebrate’s public collection</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frog entrails, lizard scales and mouse tails, oh my.</p>



<p>These creatures are among <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/biosci/biad120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 13,000 museum specimens that had their innards CT scanned</a> as part of a six-year mission to create 3-D digital reconstructions. The effort, called openVertebrate, or oVert, aims to make vertebrate specimens freely available online. Such specimens typically have been kept in storage until put on display for the public or pulled for examination by a specialist, researchers report March 6 in <em>BioScience</em>.</p>



<p>Online replicas not only make museum collections accessible to more folks but also give people a peek inside animals without the need for scalpels or other dissection equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The best part of that is the weird, wonderful things that you weren’t expecting to see that jump out,” says evolutionary biologist Edward Stanley of the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Those things include parasitic infections, last meals and new insights into animal anatomy.</p>



<p>CT scans of pumpkin toadlets’ inner ears, for instance, revealed that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">amphibians crash-land their hops due to misshapen ear tubes</a> (<em>SN: 6/15/22</em>). And images that Stanley and colleagues took of spiny mice showed that the animals’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiny-mice-armadillo-armor-tails">tails are covered in bony armor</a> like an armadillo (<em>SN: 5/24/23</em>).</p>



<p>As part of oVert, Stanley and researchers across 25 institutions took CT scans of fluid-preserved specimens representing more than half of all known vertebrate genera, lighting up the skeletons of chameleons, frogs, bats, lizards, snakes, eagles and more. Some animals were soaked in iodine so that internal organs and muscles were visible.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A peek inside</h3>



<p>As part of the openVertebrate project, researchers created an online repository of CT scans of more than 13,000 museum specimens. The goal was to make such collections more widely available to researchers without the need for travel or shipping precious specimens, as well as the public. Here’s a tiny sample of what those scans revealed.</p>

<p>Each specimen was mounted inside a tube. The tube then rotated around a fixed X-ray scanner that captured a complete picture of the animal’s body. But few vertebrates are tube-shaped, so the team had to pack the cylinder with materials that could hold the specimen in place without interfering with the scan.</p>



<p>“It turns out bubble wrap, packing peanuts, plastic Coke bottles, that sort of thing, that’s the magic,” Stanley says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technology could help digitize additional organisms tucked away in natural history collections including invertebrates and plants, the researchers say. Some scanners may even work for living vertebrates.</p>

<p>A Springer Nature journal has issued an expression of concern for a 16-year-old paper by Carlo Croce, the cancer researcher – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/26/law-firm-sues-osu-cancer-researcher-for-900000-in-unpaid-fees-following-failed-libel-suit/">and noted art collector</a> – at The Ohio State University three years after the publication had received a correction for problematic images and roughly 20 months after the news division at <em>Nature </em>reported on a pair of institutional investigations into problems with Croce’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/22/papers-in-croce-case-with-blatantly-obvious-problems-still-arent-retracted-after-misconduct-investigation-sleuth/">we and others have reported</a>, those investigations concluded Croce had not committed misconduct but had overlooked the misdeeds of others in his lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-024-02989-3">the notice</a> for the paper, “MicroRNA signatures of TRAIL resistance in human non-small cell lung cancer,” which <em>Oncogene </em>published in 2008:</p>



<span id="more-128872"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief would like to alert the readers that following the Correction [1] of this article [2] to address the concerns raised regarding the western blot loading controls presented in Figs. 4c and 7a, further issues have been noted:</p>



<p>The western blot loading controls presented in Figs. 4d and 7c appear highly similar.</p>



<p>The U6 panel of Fig. 3b appears highly similar to the U6 panel of Fig. 4c of another article from the same author group that was submitted and published within a similar time frame [3].</p>



<p>The western blot loading controls presented in Fig. 5b and the originally published version of Fig. 7a appear highly similar to the control lanes 1 and 2 (flipped horizontally) of Fig. 3a of [4], which as also submitted and published within a similar time frame.</p>



<p>The authors have stated that the images used in the other articles [3, 4] are incorrect, and are issuing Corrections to replace them with the appropriate data. However, due to the number of concerns raised, readers are advised to interpret the presented data with caution.</p>



<p>M. Garofalo has stated on behalf of all authors that they do not agree to this editorial expression of concern.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article has been cited 229 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, of which 20 have come since the correction (which itself has received two citations).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">David Sanders, a data sleuth and biologist at Purdue University who raised issues about the papers – and who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">successfully defended himself</a> in a defamation suit Croce launched against him – told us last week he first notified Oncogene about the problematic articles in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the correction appeared in January 2021, Sanders contacted the journal again with concerns about the statement, including:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Why is there no indication that there had been image duplication in the correction?  How do you know that Figures 5b and 6a are correct? </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five months later, he raised still more questions about the article – but never heard back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In violation of COPE rules, they have never contacted me about the resolution of this issue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sanders also pointed to evidence of plagiarism in the article, which OSU documents in one of its reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Springer Nature to explain the lag – and why the journal felt an expression of concern was more appropriate than retraction in this case. The response from a spokesperson:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After a careful and thorough investigation, the Editors concluded that publishing an Editorial Expression of Concern was the most appropriate editorial action to take.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Oncogene </em>has issued a double correction for another of Croce’s papers, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1209323#change-history">Fhit modulation of the Akt-survivin pathway in lung cancer cells: Fhit-tyrosine 114 (Y114) is essential</a>,” originally published in 2006.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781645030058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Countdown</a><br><em>Sarah Scoles</em><br><em>Bold Type Books, $30</em></p>



<p>The United States is on a mission to modernize its aging nuclear weapons stockpile. And physicists have feelings about it — and the future of nuclear weapons more broadly.</p>



<p>In <em>Countdown</em>, science writer Sarah Scoles dredges up all the feels in interviews with physicists at the national laboratories dedicated to maintaining the U.S. nuclear stockpile and with researchers, activists and others who orbit that lab system. The researchers grapple with the legacy of their field’s most infamous invention and their roles as stewards of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-bomb-physics-fission-hiroshima-anniversary">the planet’s most destructive weapons</a> (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>To work on nuclear weapons, Scoles’ conversations reveal, is to embrace seemingly contradictory ideas. The weapons promote peace by deterring countries from attacking each other, but the weapons also make possible the destruction of civilization. The researchers see their work — on a variety of topics, from computer simulations of nuclear weapons to nonproliferation research — as necessary and even find beauty in it, but some also dream of a world without these bombs.</p>



<p>The United States has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-atom-matter-particle-nuclear-power-neutron">not tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s</a>, when it signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (<em>SN: 4/8/21</em>). To maintain confidence in its roughly 3,700 nuclear weapons, the country aims to replace the steadily degrading nuclear material at their hearts. These bowling ball–sized pits are hollow spheres of plutonium that kick off the nuclear explosion when a bomb detonates. Currently, the United States is stuck with its aging pits, but by 2030, the plan is to produce 80 pits per year.</p>



<p>Yet some activists oppose the pit production and other modernization efforts — the details of which are classified and thus unknown to the public. While proponents see updating the weapons as essential to shore up the deterrent, others think the deterrent is effective as is and worry modernizing could kick off a dangerous arms race.</p>



<p><em>Countdown</em> also delves into the history and culture of the national labs focused on nuclear work. While some of it seems like inside baseball — this or that management change — there is serious tea spilled. One scientist says Los Alamos “is in a 1950s bubble,” lamenting the lab’s seeming focus on the “cult of genius” — the outdated model in which a lone researcher transforms a field. And Scoles recounts drama from decades prior, of employees at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/los-alamos-laboratory-atomic-bomb-wildfire">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California rebelling against management the best way they knew how: angry blog posts and at least one snarky limerick (<em>SN: 6/6/22</em>).</p>



<p>With witty attention to detail, Scoles inserts moments of levity, pointing out the small absurdities surrounding this otherwise heavy topic. (She meets a scientist at Los Alamos’ Hot Rocks Java Cafe, “a place whose name suggests the 1990s came up with it.”) And the scientists’ passion for their field shines through, like the feeling of exhilaration that comes with taming plasma, a feral state of matter consisting of electrically charged particles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At times the book leaves the reader craving more scientific details, perhaps unavoidable when dealing with a classified subject. But some topics are glossed over more than necessary. The discussion of quantum computing — a technology that might eventually be useful for simulating nuclear weapons — is so abbreviated as to be confusing.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, Scoles highlights the deep connections that run between basic scientific research and nuclear applications. The conditions in an atomic bomb are similar to those elsewhere in the universe, such as in exploding stars. That means that even physicists who set out to reveal basic features of the universe might inadvertently advance knowledge about nuclear weapons. Like it or not, physics and nuclear weapons are inseparable.</p>



<p>The researchers Scoles profiles hope that, by understanding nuclear weapons better, we might protect ourselves from them. One research team aims to improve the detection of nuclear blasts, making it easier to verify that other countries aren’t setting them off. But such knowledge could also teach a government how to hide its own tests from prying eyes. Like so much else in nuclear weapons research, there are two sides.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-hubble-universe">Did the James Webb telescope ‘break the universe’? Maybe not</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reports that NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope broke the universe may have been exaggerated.</p>



<p>In its first images, JWST captured <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">what appeared to be gargantuan galaxies in the early universe</a> — ones much too big to be explained by current cosmological theories (<em>SN: 2/22/23</em>). But a new analysis of old data from the Hubble Space Telescope suggests that those alleged behemoths <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.061002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably have more prosaic explanations</a> fitting in with our standard understanding of the universe, cosmologist Julian Muñoz and colleagues report in the Feb. 9 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“James Webb is giving us a new dictionary to translate the language of the early universe,” says, Muñoz, of the University of Texas at Austin. “Before we say, ‘Hey, we need to throw away everything we knew in cosmology,’ we should understand this language.”</p>



<p>The trouble began almost as soon as JWST <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first pointed its eyes at the distant universe</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). Not only did some of its initial images contain enormous numbers of galaxies — far more than astronomers expected — but a good handful of those galaxies appeared to be monstrously massive, up to 100 times weightier than theories had predicted. These were dubbed “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-distant-galaxies-surprises-space">universe breakers</a>,” because they flew in the face of scientists’ assumptions about cosmic evolution (<em>SN: 8/20/23</em>).</p>



<p>The problem has to do with dark matter. Under the standard model of cosmology, dark matter collapsed into gargantuan clumps known as halos within the first few hundred million years of the universe. Ordinary matter was then gravitationally attracted to these halos, eventually forming stars and galaxies. The standard model also predicts the existence of far fewer dark matter halos than could account for JWST’s census of big galaxies.</p>



<p>But, Muñoz says, perhaps researchers simply need to be more careful when interpreting what they’ve been seeing.</p>



<p>He and his colleagues used existing data from Hubble to do a gut check on JWST’s results. Though the older telescope can’t see quite as far back in time as its successor, there is an era between roughly 450 million and 750 million years after the Big Bang where both instruments can capture light from galaxies, albeit in different wavelengths. JWST sees them in infrared, whereas Hubble can snag their ultraviolet light.</p>



<p>“If there were 10 times more dark matter structures [than expected], there would be 10 times more galaxies in James Webb, but there would also be 10 times more galaxies in Hubble,” Muñoz says. This is not what the Hubble data show.</p>



<p>The researchers tallied how many the old telescope saw across a wide range of brightnesses. Then they calculated how different populations of dark matter halos would have altered that census, for example, leading to a surplus of bright galaxies in the Hubble data. Any change in the number of halos big enough to match JWST’s observations, the team found, sharply contrasts with the Hubble data.</p>



<p>While JWST is the more powerful telescope — and therefore capable of simply seeing more galaxies than Hubble in a given epoch — Hubble has been staring at the universe for much longer, Muñoz notes. That means, he says, that, right now, Hubble’s observations are a more representative sample of what’s out there. For that reason, he and his colleagues suggest that researchers should turn to more conventional explanations for JWST’s odd galaxies.</p>



<p>It could be that environmental conditions in the early universe were different than in later epochs, allowing gas and dust to turn into stars much more efficiently than expected. Such high star formation rates could create the unusually bright objects JWST sees.</p>



<p>Star formation <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf85a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might have also been more episodic</a>, with large numbers of supernovas periodically going off. In that case, JWST might simply be capturing some galaxies at these moments of intense brightness, making them look weightier than they truly are.</p>



<p>Finally, it’s possible that some of the light JWST sees in these early galaxies comes from the blazingly bright regions around gorging supermassive black holes rather than stars, meaning the primordial galaxies aren’t quite as massive as presumed.</p>



<p>Outside researchers are impressed by these findings. “It&#8217;s very clever to look at the overlap region [between Hubble and JWST],” says Priyamvada&nbsp;Natarajan, a theoretical astrophysicist at Yale University.</p>



<p>But others point out that the cosmos isn’t entirely safe yet. JWST is currently making observations of the original handful of “universe breakers” that will pin down whether they actually existed in an era where they’re too big to explain. “If even one — especially one of the really massive ones — is there, it is a problem,” says Erica Nelson, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was part of the team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05786-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that first identified the anomalous objects</a>.</p>



<p>As astronomers become more familiar with JWST’s views of the early universe, they will likely learn how to better understand what they’re seeing, Muñoz says. “We&#8217;re doing this translation in a land where we don&#8217;t speak the language,” he says. “But you never know if your language skills are good enough.”</p>

<p>An August 2023 report on research integrity by consulting firm KPMG, commissioned by an Australian government agency, contains a made-up reference, Retraction Watch has discovered.</p>



<p>Reference 139 of the report, “<a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/attachments/Committee/International-Policy-Scan-Report.pdf">International Research Integrity Policy Scan Final Report: Compilation of information about research integrity arrangements outside Australia</a>,” reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Gunsalus CK, Marcus AR, Oransky I, Stern JM. Institutional and individual factors that promote research integrity. In: Macrina FL, editor. Scientific Integrity: Text and Cases in Responsible Conduct of Research. 4th ed. Washington, DC: ASM Press; 2018. p. 53-82.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Scientific+Integrity:+Text+and+Cases+in+Responsible+Conduct+of+Research,+4th+Edition-p-9781683673514">book with that title</a> exists, but the four authors listed did not contribute a chapter, and the 2018 edition does not appear to contain a chapter with that title. We – Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky – have indeed <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2675025">published with CK Gunsalus</a>, but nothing resembling this reference.</p>



<span id="more-128866"></span>



<p>We spot-checked about 20 of the other references in the book, and while there are some punctuation errors, the rest of the citations we reviewed exist. So this seemed to be a single error of unclear provenance. We wanted to let KPMG know, and find out what they would do about it.</p>



<p>We contacted KPMG Australia’s press team on Jan. 28. They acknowledged receipt of our email the same day, but when we didn’t hear back a week later, we followed up. On Feb. 6, we sent some questions we wanted on-the-record answers to, and waited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although as journalists we prefer to speak directly with people involved, none of this was unusual in seeking comment from companies and government agencies.</p>



<p>On Feb. 12, we followed up to check on progress, and were told scheduling had been difficult, and that answers would be forthcoming. We followed up on Feb. 14 and received no response. We then followed up again on Feb. 18 to say we were getting the impression the company had decided not to respond but that we would be publishing soon.</p>



<p>We have not heard back since. Which is puzzling – if there’s a clumsy error in a single reference, why not just acknowledge that, explain it, and move on?</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), which commissioned the document, thanked us for raising the issue with them, and said the agency “will work with KPMG to correct the report.” The consulting firm had not yet contacted NHMRC, the spokesperson said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-biomarkers-blood-paxlovid">The blood holds clues to understanding long COVID</a></h4>

              
                <p>When I talk to immunologist Paul Morgan,&nbsp;he’s on the hunt for potentially life-altering drugs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s got a call with a pharmaceutical company planned in the next half hour.&nbsp;His goal: persuade the company to supply his lab with a drug that might — maybe, hopefully, someday — ease some of the unrelenting symptoms of long COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morgan’s lab at Cardiff University in Wales has been studying people with the disease, including the first waves of patients, some of whom have been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/health-risks-persist-2-years-covid-19">living with long COVID for more than two years</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 8/21/23</em>).&nbsp;The&nbsp;“very long haulers,” he calls them. Their symptoms can include brain fog, fatigue, breathlessness and joint and muscle pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morgan and his colleagues have pinpointed an immune system anomaly in the blood of some of these long haulers. A drug that targets that quirk might be one way to treat their disease. He’s quick to tell me that this research is in its early days. First, his team needs to get its hands on a drug. Then they need to do a clinical trial — at this stage, it’s still proof-of-concept.&nbsp;“Actual treatments are still some way off,” he says.</p>



<p>But the work is one in a surge of studies mining the blood for long COVID clues, potential biomarkers of the disease. A growing cadre of labs are starting to sketch out some of the shrouded figures at play in the once-seemingly inscrutable disease.&nbsp;It’s as if there’s a&nbsp;“picture that’s being revealed from the fog,” says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Yale University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That picture features a motley cast of molecular and cellular characters that could point scientists toward potential tests and treatments — both are currently lacking. Still, the full long COVID landscape is unquestionably complicated. Assorted actors tangle together in an immunological thicket that can make the disease seem impenetrable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Iwasaki thinks researchers can crack long COVID’s mysteries.&nbsp;In fact, recent work in the field has her feeling pretty excited.&nbsp;Yes, investigating long COVID is complex, she says.&nbsp;“But it’s definitely worth doing because many people are suffering.”</p>



<p>I spoke with Iwasaki, Morgan, and other researchers about long haulers and current work to illuminate the disease — and to get clarity on the less severe but still vexing symptoms that stuck around for months after my own COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Long COVID is not a single disease, which makes diagnosis and treatment difficult&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Some 5 to 20 percent&nbsp;of COVID-19 cases develop into long COVID, though the exact number is hard to pin down. One formidable challenge is diagnosis. Does a person with bone-deep exhaustion and trouble concentrating on the pages of their book have the disease? There’s no test or nasal swab doctors can use to provide a definitive answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For diseases like diabetes and prostate cancer, scientists look for biomarkers in the blood — molecules that can serve as telltale signs of illness.&nbsp;But&nbsp;“we are not likely to come up with one biomarker or even one set of biomarkers to distinguish everyone with long COVID,”&nbsp;Iwasaki says.</p>



<p>The difficulty is that long COVID is not just one disease. It’s likely a collection of many diseases, she says, with varying sets of symptoms and triggers. Even defining long COVID is complicated. Last spring, researchers developed&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2805540#:~:text=1-,Postacute%2520sequelae%2520of%2520SARS%252DCoV%252D2%2520infection%2520(PASC),clinical%2520and%2520public%2520health%2520concern." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a long COVID scoring system that factors in a dozen signature symptoms</a>. But more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-patients-symptoms-doctors-research-clinics-brain-fog-fatigue">200 symptoms have been tied to the disease</a>, and cases can vary greatly from person to person&nbsp;<em>(SN: 11/17/22)</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, in many doctors’ offices and clinics, homing in on a diagnosis means first ruling out other conditions.&nbsp;For example, after months of feeling wrung out and faded, with unexpected pain in my legs following a COVID-19 infection last year, my doctor ordered a slew of blood tests. She was looking for signs of rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme disease, thyroid hormone abnormalities and a handful of other conditions.&nbsp;Everything was negative. It’s called a&nbsp;“diagnosis of exclusion,”&nbsp;Morgan says.&nbsp;&#8220;You test for everything else, and when nothing comes back positive, you say,&nbsp;‘well, it must be [long COVID], then.’”</p>

<p>He compares it to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, another debilitating condition that also lacks clear diagnostic tests.&nbsp;“Many physicians don’t take it very seriously at all because of that.”&nbsp;That concern is even listed on the&nbsp;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html#:~:text=Most%2520medical%2520schools%2520in%2520the,seriously%2520by%2520some%2520healthcare%2520providers." target="_blank" rel="noopener">ME/CFS Web page</a>.&nbsp;And it’s true of long COVID, too, says Wolfram Ruf, an immunologist at&nbsp;University Medical Center Mainz in Germany.&nbsp;“There’s still some misconception that this is just a psychological disease.” A 2022 survey found that a third of long COVID patients felt as if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9448633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical professionals dismissed their illness</a>. And stories from frustrated long haulers continue to appear in the news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Better diagnostics mean people suffering from long COVID’s myriad symptoms could put a firm label on their condition.&nbsp;That’s important, Morgan says.&nbsp;But tests that spot long COVID biomarkers in the blood could also do far more.&nbsp;“If those tests actually lead you to a mechanism and to a treatment,” he says,&nbsp;“then that’s transformational.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A complicated cast of immune and other characters may contribute to long COVID&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Morgan’s lab and others have zeroed in on immune proteins that defend us from bacteria and viruses. These proteins, part of a defense called complement, circulate in the blood, and get chopped up during an infection.&nbsp;The resulting fragments sound a&nbsp;“we’re under attack” alarm and help form a molecular machine that busts pathogens.</p>



<p>Once the infection clears, the fragments fade away. But in some people with long COVID<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.23297597v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.23297597v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(24)00041-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the alarm-raising fragments can linger in the blood,</a>&nbsp;Morgan’s team reported February 14 in&nbsp;<em>Med</em>. That’s a sign that the defense system is still whipping up inflammation — in some cases, even years after a person’s initial COVID-19 infection. In January, a different group reported something similar in&nbsp;<em>Science</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a study of 113 COVID-19 patients</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not everyone with long COVID will have complement abnormalities.&nbsp;Even in the patients Morgan studies,&nbsp;“there will&nbsp;be some people who have no changes in their complement markers at all.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for those who do, it can be a double-edged sword, he says.&nbsp;Turning complement on briefly can knock out some bugs, but keeping it on chronically can damage your cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s an ever-growing list of other blood-borne anomalies, too. A protein found in the brain can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak out into the blood in people with brain fog</a>, scientists found in February. And long COVID patients can have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low levels of the stress hormone cortisol</a>, Iwasaki’s team reported in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>&nbsp;in September.&nbsp;In some patients, she and others have also spotted other suspicious signs, like long-slumbering herpes viruses that reawaken and start infecting cells again.&nbsp;“Whether this is a cause or effect [of long COVID],” Iwasaki says,&nbsp;“we don’t know.” Usually, the immune system keeps these viruses under control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some people with long COVID, powerful immune players called T cells also seem to go out of whack.&nbsp;Scientists in England analyzing the blood of long COVID patients found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi9379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T cells that release high levels of an alarm signal called interferon-gamma</a>. That signal could serve as a potential biomarker in some patients, the study’s authors suggested.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Perhaps there’s SARS-CoV-2 somewhere in the body that can’t be cleared.” </p><cite><em>Nadia Roan</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>At&nbsp;the University of California, San Francisco, virologist and immunologist Nadia Roan’s team is also taking a look at T cells. In some long COVID patients,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01724-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T cells that recognize SARS-CoV-2 can become exhausted</a>, her team reported in&nbsp;<em>Nature Immunology</em>&nbsp;in January. And scientists know that tired-out T cells can have trouble&nbsp;wiping out infection.</p>



<p>“Perhaps there’s SARS-CoV-2 somewhere in the body that can’t be cleared,” Roan says.&nbsp;If a hidden reservoir of virus lurks in people’s tissues long-term, certain T cells might gather there for continued attack, eventually wearing&nbsp;the cells down.&nbsp;Last summer, a different team&nbsp;found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.27.23293177v1.full-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viral traces in some people’s guts nearly two years after their initial infection</a>. Scientists have also&nbsp;spotted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9839201/#:~:text=Several%2520reports%2520have%2520pointed%2520towards,stool%2520and%2520urine55–60." target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs&nbsp;of SARS-CoV-2 in other body tissues</a>, including brain, lung and liver. These traces may be enough to irritate the immune system long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Residual virus isn’t likely to explain everything.&nbsp;“Different mechanisms may drive different forms of the disease,” Roan says. But together, work from her lab and others paints a portrait of an immune system under enduring duress. And as the pictures comes into focus, scientists are starting to explore new experiments, trials and treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clinical trials will test whether antiviral drugs can ease long COVID symptoms&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Iwasaki and her colleagues are nearly done recruiting 100 people with long COVID for a randomized clinical trial of the antiviral drug Paxlovid. A similar trial by the National Institutes of Health is also in the works. That study aims to enroll 900 people and should conclude testing by this summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An idea targeted by both trials is that SARS-CoV-2 persists in the body, triggering symptoms. Scientists will follow participants as they take Paxlovid for 15 or 25 days. (For COVID-19 infection, the typical treatment length is five days.)</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-aligncenter">

<p>Iwasaki’s team also plans to scan participants’&nbsp;blood for molecules that might predict a person’s response to Paxlovid. Suppose participants who improve after Paxlovid had high levels of certain blood molecules prior to treatment. Scientists could then measure those molecules in other people with long COVID to see if they might be good candidates for the drug.&nbsp;“There’s not one drug cure-all,” Iwasaki says,&nbsp;“but even knowing who might benefit is a huge thing.”</p>



<p>And though Morgan’s complement work is still at an early stage, he considers it a&nbsp;“strong lead to a potential therapy.” One bright spot is the number of complement-targeting drugs that already exist. Doctors currently use the drugs to treat certain blood disorders and other rare conditions. Morgan and other scientists have tried using some of these drugs to treat&nbsp;severe cases of acute COVID-19 infection, but large-scale trials didn’t pan out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, he wants to repurpose those drugs for long COVID patients whose complement system has gone out of control. Dialing down those defenses might help quench the fire of chronic inflammation.</p>



<p>So far, Morgan hasn’t seen much interest from pharmaceutical companies. Repurposing generic drugs isn’t a big money maker.&nbsp;And Morgan’s team doesn’t envision long COVID patients needing to use the drugs long-term&nbsp;— another financial disincentive for companies. But when I email him later, he says his call after our interview went well. Morgan&#8217;s not naming the company yet&nbsp;but he knows that patients are standing by, waiting day after day for anything that will offer some relief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For me, lingering symptoms turned the once-easy tasks of everyday life into energy-sucking feats performed while my body’s battery blinked down to zero. If I miscalculated and walked too fast or moved too much, I’d pay for it later and crash on the couch or in bed, sometimes taking days to recover. That symptom is known as post-exertional malaise and it’s common for people with long COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I was never officially diagnosed with the disease. Keeping up with doctors’&nbsp;appointments felt daunting, and I wasn’t sure how much my doctor would be&nbsp;able to help. There may be many people who fall into this category, Morgan says — people who have long-term symptoms but lack clear-cut answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though white women like myself are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/05/long-covid-19-symptoms-reported.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely to be diagnosed with the disease</a>,&nbsp;in a survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanic and Black people were more likely to report long-lasting symptoms. Access to care could be one factor in the diagnosis discrepancy. Previous data have shown that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/health-coverage-by-race-and-ethnicity/#:~:text=(Figure%202).-,Nonelderly%20AIAN%20and%20Hispanic%20people%20had%20the%20highest%20uninsured%20rates,their%20White%20counterparts%20(6.6%25)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">people from these groups are less likely to have health insurance</a>. Another factor may be the changeling nature of the disease itself.&nbsp;Long COVID can show up differently in different groups of people, scientists have found.</p>



<p>I’m lucky because my symptoms started improving after about six months. I knew I was mostly recovered the first time I went grocery shopping and carried my bags into the house by myself, without crashing afterwards. But so many others continue to struggle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morgan sees that firsthand.&nbsp;Since his paper came out,&nbsp;“I’ve been absolutely deluged by letters from patients,” he says.&nbsp;They ask to be tested and if he has drugs that can treat them. For Morgan, those letters show the depth of the problem.<br><br>“I reply to them all,” he says.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Deepak Panday will talk about his paper in the presentation entitled &quot;CEPS: An Open Access MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Analysis of Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Background: We developed CEPS as an open access MATLAB® GUI (graphical user interface) for
the analysis of Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals (CEPS), and demonstrate
its use with an example data set that shows the effects of paced breathing (PB) on
variability of heart, pulse and respiration rates. CEPS is also sufficiently adaptable to
be used for other time series physiological data such as EEG (electroencephalography),
postural sway or temperature measurements. Methods: Data were collected from a convenience
sample of nine healthy adults in a pilot for a larger study investigating the effects on
vagal tone of breathing paced at various different rates, part of a development programme
for a home training stress reduction system. Results: The current version of CEPS focuses
on those complexity and entropy measures that appear most frequently in the literature,
together with some recently introduced entropy measures which may have advantages over
those that are more established. Ten methods of estimating data complexity are currently
included, and some 28 entropy measures. The GUI also includes a section for data pre-
processing and standard ancillary methods to enable parameter estimation of embedding
dimension m and time delay τ (‘tau’) where required. The software is freely available
under version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3) for non-commercial
users. CEPS can be downloaded from Bitbucket. In our illustration on PB, most complexity
and entropy measures decreased significantly in response to breathing at 7 breaths per
minute, differentiating more clearly than conventional linear, time- and frequency-domain
measures between breathing states. In contrast, Higuchi fractal dimension increased during
paced breathing. Conclusions: We have developed CEPS software as a physiological data
visualiser able to integrate state of the art techniques. The interface is designed for
clinical research and has a structure designed for integrating new tools. The aim is to
strengthen collaboration between clinicians and the biomedical community, as demonstrated
here by using CEPS to analyse various physiological responses to paced breathing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urinary-tract-infection-pain-uti">Here’s why pain might last after persistent urinary tract infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>Urinary tract infections are painful, inconvenient and incredibly common. For decades, doctors haven’t had any leads on why, even after several rounds of antibiotics, UTI pain can linger. Now they do.</p>



<p>Nerve growth from <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adi5578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune responses to the infection might be to blame</a>, researchers report March 1 in <em>Science Immunology. </em>Understanding immune and nerve responses to persistent UTIs, the team says, could possibly lead to new, antibiotic-free forms of treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749018/#:~:text=Around%2050%E2%80%9360%25%20of%20women,causes%20UTIs%20in%20most%20patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over half of women will have a UTI</a> in their life, and around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502976/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quarter of infections come back within six months</a>. The pain from these infections can be quite difficult to treat, says Marcus Drake, a neurological urologist at Imperial College London. “It’s a ‘<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heartsink situation</a>’ for the patients, and it’s a heartsink situation for the doctors, because there isn’t much that you can do.”</p>



<p>Puzzled by why pain persisted after UTI-related bacteria were wiped out, immunologist Soman Abraham of Duke University and colleagues collected urine samples from women with recurring infections. Compared with samples of women without recurring UTIs, these showed signs of nerve activation.</p>



<p>To better understand what was happening at the tissue level, the team induced multiple UTIs in mice. Compared with uninfected mice, “we saw a tremendous growth of nerves,” Abraham says. But that only confirmed what the team suspected about humans. The researchers still wanted to know what spurred the nerves to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abraham knew that when the urinary tract is infected, one of the bladder’s first defenses is to shed a tissue layer to remove bacteria. But in this process, nerves are sloughed off, which jolts nerve-growing immune cells into action. A close look at the bladder tissue of the mice with repeat UTIs revealed an abundance of two kinds of immune cells.</p>



<p>Specifically, there were high levels of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/role-change-mast-cells-show-anti-inflammatory-side">mast cells</a>, which are stored in bladder tissue and produce a substance called nerve growth factor (<em>SN: 9/5/07</em>). And there were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/not-so-dispensable-spleen">monocytes</a>, blood-based immune cells that rush to the site of infection to produce even more nerve growth factor (<em>SN: 7/30/09</em>). Similar to respiratory infections, the more often the body has to fight off bladder infections, the better it gets at it; monocytes and mast cells get faster at their job with each UTI. “The unfortunate part is [it becomes] an overzealous response,” Abraham says.</p>



<p>Pain continues because nerve growth factor doesn’t just generate nerve growth; it also lowers the threshold at which nerve pain and pressure receptors activate. Even after no infection-related bacteria remained, the mice in the study had frequent urination and showed signs of lingering pain. “The slightest, innocuous volume of urine was enough to trigger the voiding response,” Abraham says. But with antihistamines and blockers of nerve growth factor, the mice were able to feel some relief.</p>



<p>Right now, persistent pain in UTIs in humans is usually treated with anti-inflammatory or other pain-reducing drugs, including antihistamines, but all of these are a bit unsatisfactory, Drake says. The researchers hope that understanding how nerves grow with recurrent UTIs can lead to more effective pain relief treatments in the future.</p>

<p>A cardiologist in Pakistan has been selling coauthorship of his research papers to scientists, particularly medical students, who were not involved in the work, Retraction Watch has learned. Several of his articles were published after the journal learned of his underhand activities.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jahanzeb-malik-61ba36159_i-will-be-giving-a-talk-on-international-activity-6971470075463634944-5IZX?trk=public_profile">Jahanzeb Malik</a>, of the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, publishes in a variety of journals,&nbsp;including <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em> and <em>Cardiology in Review</em>, with a number of co-authors on each study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, not all of these authors contributed to the work. Malik, who is also a member of the <a href="https://archive.fo/pdj0L">Cardiovascular Analytics Group</a>, an international network of researchers, runs a WhatsApp messaging group titled &#8220;Research Associates,&#8221; where he posts about articles he is working on and offers authorship &#8220;slots&#8221; in exchange for money, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.05-PM.jpeg">messages</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.06-PM.jpeg">shown</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.07-PM-1.jpeg">to</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.07-PM.jpeg">Retraction</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.08-PM.jpeg">Watch</a> reveal. He has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/533203374144644/posts/1514936009304704/">advertised on the “United States Medical Licensing Examination Pakistan” Group Facebook page</a>, writing that he runs the group to &#8220;help students and other doctors in doing medical research and writing research papers.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going by the username &#8220;Darklord&#8221; on WhatsApp, Malik <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image1-1.jpeg">charges up to $300</a> for a first-author position. Less prominent positions on the manuscript can be bought for around $150. Malik has since changed his username to &#8220;Dr. Jahanzeb Malik&#8221; on the app.</p>



<span id="more-128848"></span>



<p>Asked about his response to these allegations, Malik told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are not selling author positions; all my coauthors are contributing according to the ICMJE criteria. Junior authors write all papers so they can learn and move ahead in manuscript writing. We only share funding when opting for an open-access journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This type of group, known as a &#8220;paper mill,&#8221; has become increasingly common as academics and medical students have faced pressure to publish. A six-month Retraction Watch investigation <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">published last month</a> suggested the dean of the faculty of health sciences at Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias in Spain, Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas, bought his way onto nearly all of the papers he published last year.</p>



<p>Among more than 40 of the scientific articles advertised in Malik’s WhatsApp group over the past year, at least 13 have been published. The researcher appears as a coauthor on more than half of these, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014628062300542X?via%3Dihub">Safety and Efficacy of Ferric Carboxymaltose in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Iron Deficiency</a>; <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em></li>

<li><a href="https://journals.lww.com/cardiologyinreview/abstract/9900/coronary_stent_infection__a_systematic_review_of.180.aspx">Coronary Stent Infection: A Systematic Review of Literature</a>; <em>Cardiology in Review</em></li>
</ul>



<p>A source who requested anonymity to avoid potential backlash from the authors in the papers learned about the group through a friend. After joining, the source reported Malik&#8217;s behavior to the editor-in-chief of <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em>, Hector O. Ventura, as well as its publisher Elsevier on October 15, 2023. Josie Liu, an associate publisher at Elsevier, wrote back saying the team took the concerns seriously and asked to allow &#8220;some time to closely investigate the issue.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, however, Malik has published four papers in the Elsevier title <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em>. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0146280623005820">One of them</a> matches a paper “Darklord” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.11-PM-1-1.jpeg">advertised on WhatsApp</a>.</p>



<p>Liu told the whistleblower on January 15 that Elsevier&#8217;s ethics team has been investigating the case and would &#8220;flag Dr. Jahanzeb Malik in the submission system.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked for comment, an Elsevier spokesperson told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are aware of the situation and our ethics and research integrity teams are indeed investigating. It is our policy to not comment on on-going investigations.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dune-planet-climate-plausible-science-sandworms">The desert planet in ‘Dune’ is plausible, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frank Herbert’s science fiction novel <em>Dune</em> has been praised for its worldbuilding. Herbert created complex societies, religions and economic systems all with rich histories.</p>



<p>Most famous of Herbert’s worlds is the desert planet Arrakis, nicknamed Dune, with its harsh climate and giant sandworms. The planet is the setting for most of the novel and movies based on the book. The second installment of the latest imagining from director Denis Villeneuve, <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, opens in theaters March 1.</p>



<p>Not only did Herbert create a rich fantasy world, he also built a plausible planet, says Alexander Farnsworth, a climate modeler at the University of Bristol in England.</p>



<p>A few years ago, Farnsworth and colleagues made <a href="https://theconversation.com/dune-we-simulated-the-desert-planet-of-arrakis-to-see-if-humans-could-survive-there-170181" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a computer simulation of the climate on Arrakis</a>. People could live on the desert planet, the team concluded, but Herbert probably should have relocated his cities closer to the equator than the poles.</p>



<p>As for the giant sandworms that can swallow mining equipment whole, they push the boundaries of what biology might achieve, says vertebrate paleontologist Patrick Lewis, of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> asked the experts what life on Arrakis might really be like and whether humans living on the planet would need to worry about being eaten by a giant worm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Building Arrakis</h2>



<p>For their Arrakis climate simulation, which you can <a href="https://climatearchive.org/dune.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore at the website Climate Archive</a>, Farnsworth and colleagues started with the well-known physics that drive weather and climate on Earth. Using our planet as a starting point makes sense, Farnsworth says, partly because Herbert drew inspiration for Arrakis from “some sort of semi-science of looking at dune systems on the Earth itself.”</p>



<p>The team then added nuggets of information about the planet from details in Herbert’s novels and in the <em>Dune Encyclopedia.</em> According to that intel, the fictional planet’s atmosphere is similar to Earth’s with a couple of notable differences. Arrakis has less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than Earth — about 350 parts per million on the desert planet compared with 417 parts per million on Earth. But Dune has far more ozone in its lower atmosphere: 0.5 percent of the gases in the atmosphere compared to Earth’s 0.000001 percent.</p>



<p>All that extra ozone is crucial for understanding the planet. Ozone is a powerful greenhouse gas, about 65 times as potent at warming the atmosphere as carbon dioxide is, when measured over a 20-year period. “Arrakis would certainly have a much warmer atmosphere, even though it has less CO<sub>2</sub> than Earth today,” Farnsworth says.</p>



<p>In addition to warming the planet, so much ozone in the lower atmosphere could be bad news. “For humans, that would be incredibly toxic, I think, almost fatal if you were to live under such conditions,” Farnsworth says. People on Arrakis would probably have to rely on technology to scrub ozone from the air.</p>



<p>Of course, ozone in the upper atmosphere could help shield Arrakis from harmful radiation from its star, Canopus. (Canopus is a real star also known as Alpha Carinae. It’s visible in the Southern Hemisphere and is the second brightest star in the sky. Unfortunately for <em>Dune</em> fans, it isn’t known to have planets.)</p>



<p>If Arrakis were real, it would be located about as far from Canopus as Pluto is from the sun, Farnsworth says. But Canopus is a large white star calculated to be about 7,200° Celsius. “That&#8217;s significantly hotter than the sun,” which runs about 2,000 degrees cooler, Farnsworth says. But “there&#8217;s a lot of supposition and assumptions they made in here, and whether those are accurate numbers or not, I can&#8217;t say.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A livable yet inhospitable world</h2>



<p>The climate simulation revealed that Arrakis probably wouldn’t be exactly as Herbert described it.</p>



<p>For instance, in one throwaway line, the author described polar ice caps receding in the summer heat. But Farnsworth and colleagues say it would be far too hot at the poles, about 70° C during the summer, for ice caps to exist at all. Plus, there would be too little precipitation to replenish the ice in the winter. High clouds and other processes would warm the atmosphere at the poles and keep it warmer than lower latitudes, especially in the summertime.</p>



<p>Although Herbert’s novels have people living in the midlatitudes and close to the poles, the extreme summer heat and bone-chilling −40° C to −75° C temperatures in the winters would make those regions nearly unlivable without technology, Farnsworth says.</p>



<p>Temperatures in Arrakis’ tropical latitudes would be relatively more pleasant at 45° C in the warmest months and about 15° C in colder months. On Earth, high humidity in the tropics makes it far warmer than at the poles. But on Arrakis, “most of the atmospheric moisture was essentially removed from the tropics,” making even the scorching summers more tolerable. The poles are where clouds and the paltry amount of moisture gather and heat the atmosphere.</p>



<p>But the tropics on Arrakis pose their own challenges. Hurricane force winds would regularly sandblast inhabitants and build <a href="https://theconversation.com/dune-how-high-could-giant-sand-dunes-actually-grow-on-arrakis-171902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dunes up to 250 meters tall</a>, the researchers calculate.</p>



<p>It doesn’t mean people couldn’t live on Arrakis, just that they’d need technology and lots of off-world support to bring in food and water, Farnsworth says. “I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a very livable world, just a very inhospitable world.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s hard to be a giant sandworm</h2>



<p>While humans could possibly get by with some help, the planet would probably not be survivable for its most famous residents: the gargantuan sandworms. “It&#8217;s hard to envision such a species with thermal tolerance [to live] in such a climate in such an ecosystem,” Farnsworth says.</p>



<p>Gigantic sandworms would also have other problems, says Lewis, the vertebrate paleontologist at Sam Houston State. At up to 400 meters long, the sandworms would be nearly 10 times the length of the biggest dinosaurs. That would be unusual for an animal with a long body, like a worm or snake. “The worm body plan is really common. It has evolved many times over the last 600 million years,” Lewis says. “But none of them have ever been very big.”</p>



<p>For invertebrate worms, the problem is oxygen, Lewis says. Worms often absorb oxygen through their skin to permeate their bodies. The larger the animal, the harder it would be to get oxygen to their internal organs.</p>



<p>Lewis figures that Dune’s giant sandworms must be vertebrates <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.25321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like <em>Zygaspis</em> worms from sub-Saharan Africa</a>. The species that he studies are considerably smaller: about 20 to 30 centimeters long and up to 7 millimeters thick. But that didn’t stop him from imagining what a <em>Dune</em>-sized vertebrate worm might be like.</p>



<p>Worms with bones and muscles could be bigger and stronger than invertebrates, Lewis says, but they would be limited by gravity. Whales can be big because they live in water, where buoyancy can do a lot of the heavy lifting. “But if you&#8217;re going to be on the surface, then you have to be able to fight gravity,” Lewis says. To reach more than about 150 meters long, “you would basically have to be a big ball of bone to keep from crushing under your own weight.”</p>



<p>Perhaps if Arrakis’ worms had skeletons made of superlight material that’s unknown on Earth, they could grow to such enormous size. But that poses a problem for moving around. “The bigger you get, the relatively weaker the muscles are, and so you&#8217;d need monstrously strong muscles” and “unbelievably thick bones” to attach them to, Lewis says. And muscles generate a lot of heat.</p>



<p><em>Zygaspis </em>worms can tolerate 45° C temperatures in the Kalahari Desert because they are small and have lots of surface area relative to their tiny size to shed heat, he says. But a giant sandworm wouldn’t be able to dump heat so readily: The bigger an animal is, the more volume it has to generate and store heat relative to the surface area it has to cool it. Combine the geometry problem with the weather and that spells trouble for colossal worms. “If you&#8217;re a giant worm, a hot climate is not your friend,” Lewis says.</p>



<p>If you’re a <em>Dune</em> fan contemplating the realities of life on Arrakis, you’re in luck. The planet would be a feasible, if harsh, place for humans to live. And the bonus is that you probably wouldn’t have to worry about getting eaten by a giant sandworm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tortoise-migration-galapagos-invasive-trees">Giant tortoise migration in the Galápagos may be stymied by invasive trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>After trudging upslope for weeks, a giant tortoise slows its hundreds of cumbersome kilograms to a stop. Dense woods defended by barbed wire–like blackberry bushes block its path. After a brief foray into the painful prickles, the tortoise backs out and plods on, searching for a way out of the woods.</p>



<p>These blackberry-lined forests of Spanish cedar trees (<em>Cedrela odorata</em>) are invasive in the tortoise’s island home in the Galápagos. If they can, these titanic turtles <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay clear of the new, troublesome habitats</a> on their seasonal uphill treks to find food, researchers report in the February <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>. If the <em>Cedrela</em> forests one day manage to block the shelled reptile’s migration altogether, the consequences for the tortoises and the surrounding island ecosystem could be dire, researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wildlife biologist Stephen Blake and his colleagues have been studying the movements of Western Santa Cruz tortoises (<em>Chelonoidis niger porteri</em>) since 2009. Tracking the reptiles’ positions with GPS tags and other mobile instruments previously revealed that some tortoises embark on weeks-long migrations to the highlands of Santa Cruz Island — as much as 400 meters above sea level over two to four weeks — and back. These traveling tortoises tend to be large and thus potentially vulnerable to food shortages: They lumber uphill during the dry season to feed on the higher-elevation vegetation that flourishes under a moist cloud bank.</p>



<p>“They’re basically doing the same thing that Serengeti wildebeest or Canadian elk do,” says Blake, of Saint Louis University in Missouri. “They follow the green.”</p>

<p>Years into the tortoise tracking project, Blake noticed that the reptile’s migration corridors appeared to line up with gaps in the highly invasive Spanish cedars that were visible in satellite images on Google Earth. The next logical question: Were the forests a problem for the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/9026/82777132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critically-endangered</a> tortoises?</p>



<p>The researchers analyzed about 10 years of migration data from 25 tagged adult tortoises, and overlaid 140 migration routes atop a map of Spanish cedar forests on the island. Most tortoises favored funneling into small gaps between <em>Cedrela</em> stands, one of which is only about 140 meters wide at its narrowest and two others around a kilometer and half a kilometer wide each. This is fairly slim compared with the island’s 40-kilometer width, especially when considering how thousands of &nbsp;tortoises might converge on these strips between July and November each year to march uphill. Only 12 trips made by three tortoises went through large patches of forest, and five tortoises consistently stopped their migration either right inside or at the blackberry border of a forest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve seen a few tortoises sort of bludgeon their way in through these thick patches of blackberry and can’t move,” Blake says. Some turn around and walk back out. For those that make it through, the cedar forest interior is well shaded, which Blake and his colleagues think makes it harder for the tortoises to stay warm. There’s also little food in there. “It&#8217;s just not an environment that they want to be spending a week trying to walk through,” he says.</p>

<p>This map shows 140 migratory paths (gray and black tracks) taken by Western Santa Cruz tortoises in the southwestern corner of Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos over 10 years. Most of the tortoises avoided cedar forests (green patches): Gray paths show segments walked outside of the forests and black mark segments walked within the forest. Tortoises mainly traveled through three small gaps (A, B and C) in the forest.</p>

<p>It’s still unknown if the available corridors through cedar patches could be closed by the trees’ spread. But if migration routes are choked off, the tortoises might be forced to eat a suboptimal diet, which could hurt the animals’ growth, health and reproduction, Blake says. The tortoises also spread seeds, turn up soil, bulldoze vegetation and create microhabitats wherever they shamble. Disrupting their travels may constrain their ecological influence.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be the first time invasive species <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-ant-lion-dinner-trees-ecosystem">precipitated reverberations throughout an ecosystem</a> (<em>SN: 1/25/24</em>). Specifically, plant invasions can have major impacts on animal behavior, says Peter Stewart, an ecologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland who published <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a literature review</a> of these effects in 2021. Invasive plants can alter “the ways that animals communicate, where they build their nests and lay their eggs, how they hunt for prey or avoid their own predators, and more,” Stewart says. “These behavioral changes can have some quite profound consequences for the animal species, as well as for the wider ecosystem and for people.”</p>



<p>Countering the <em>Cedrela</em> invasion is a thorny task. Removing the trees could just allow a sea of blackberries to take their place, Blake points out, creating new problems. Additionally, the trees’ high-value timber is important to the local economy. Somewhat paradoxically, the invasive trees are considered <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/32292/68080590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerable to extinction</a> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in their native ranges in Central America, the Caribbean and much of mainland South America.</p>



<p>The trees now grow throughout the Galápagos and are generally “devastating” to native ecosystems, Blake says. More research on where and how fast the cedars are spreading — and if they can be effectively removed — is crucial.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/obesity-1-billion-people-world">More than 1 billion people worldwide are now estimated to have obesity</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s no secret that global obesity rates have been rising over the past few decades. But a new analysis quantifies the upsurge.</p>



<p>More than <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02750-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion people worldwide were living with obesity</a> as of 2022, researchers report February 29 in the <em>Lancet</em>. That’s about one-eighth of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/world-population-8-billion-humans-earth">global population</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>11/15/22</em>). For comparison, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32129-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 800 million people had obesity in 2016</a>, according to the World Health Organization, or WHO.</p>



<p>Obesity is “defined by the presence of excess body fat that impairs health,” says obesity expert Arya Sharma of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who was not involved in the study. The chronic disease can raise the risk for conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-obesity-risk-factor">vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19</a>, and can also limit mobility and negatively affect mental health (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>Global health researcher Majid Ezzati and colleagues examined more than 3,600 population-based studies published over the last several decades encompassing 222 million participants across nearly 200 countries and territories. The researchers divided each participant’s reported weight by their height squared to find their body mass index, or BMI.</p>



<p>Analyzing the trends suggested that in 2022, almost 900 million adults worldwide had a BMI of 30 or above, classifying them as having obesity. In children and adolescents ages 5 to 19, nearly 160 million were estimated to have the chronic disease, defined as BMI above a certain point on the <a href="https://www.who.int/tools/growth-reference-data-for-5to19-years/indicators/bmi-for-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHO&#8217;s growth reference curves</a>, which account for age and sex.</p>



<p>From 1990 to 2022, the prevalence of obesity <a href="https://www.ncdrisc.org/double-burden-paper-media-link-A1h31/obesity-prevalence-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly doubled in women, tripled in men</a> and <a href="https://www.ncdrisc.org/double-burden-paper-media-link-A1h31/obesity-prevalence-map-ado.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quadrupled in children and adolescents</a>. At the same time, global rates of those who were underweight fell. “We shouldn’t be thinking about [underweight and obesity] as two separate things, because the transition from one to the other has been very rapid,” says Ezzati, of Imperial College London.</p>



<p>The estimated obesity rates should raise alarms, he says. “Governments and societies need to deal with this” through prevention and medical care. Despite <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023">new anti-obesity medications</a> like Wegovy showing incredible results, Ezzati adds, their high costs and lack of incorporation in worldwide medical guidance will make them inaccessible to most people for the near future (<em>SN: 12/13/23</em>).</p>



<p>Ezzati notes that one of the biggest driving factors of obesity’s increased prevalence is limited access to and the unaffordability of healthy foods. Sharma adds that societal-level lifestyle changes — such as getting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americans-are-sleeping-less-they-were-13-years-ago">less sleep</a>, increased stress levels and spending less time at home — can also lead to eating more <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-ultraprocessed-food-weight-gain-nutrition-studies">processed foods</a> and overconsumption (<em>SN:</em> <em>12/21/18</em>;<em> SN: 5/16/19</em>).</p>



<p>“When you look at appetite, there’s a complex biology behind it,” Sharma says. “And that biology is affected by environmental changes.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>. The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. This is the third blog in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=einstein-awards-program">5-part series</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Global South, comprising a majority of the world&rsquo;s population, lives in knowledge production ecosystems which are not fully captured in formal institutions. Universities are not necessarily at the heart of knowledge creation in the South. Academic institutions often suffer from political capture, limited academic freedom, resource constraints and little access-to-networks to develop long term research expertise. Much of the knowledge mobilization happens outside the academe&ndash;through actors like nonprofits, think tanks, activists, local communities, and social movement activists. Much of this knowledge remains disaggregated, inaccessible and anecdotal. The net result then is its unrecognized potential for building general models for understanding the world, and longer gestation period for existing models to translate into policy action.</p>



<p>If one considers for instance, informal markets. More than 90 percent of Indian workforce is informal in nature, and yet, the modern economics is built around the assumption of formal contract and property rights in place, with informal contracts relegated to some footnotes, rendering invisible much of what the Global South studies experiences in their day-to-day experience. Consider another instance of programs for economic reform and debts. The bulk of the university or institutional top down research tends to focus on macroeconomic implications and ignore household debts. For many borrowers, loan recovery is done through the full force of criminal laws, something expressly prohibited under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. Yet countries as diverse as India, Nigeria and Egypt all lean on similar approaches to debt recovery&ndash;with women being particularly disadvantaged. A third example includes knowledge production around Climate Change. It is an intensely political subject in some Global North contexts such as the USA; and globally, Climate Change is enmeshed with democratic and other social movements. . Studying its effects, therefore, cuts across disciplines, and the formal and informal divide of where knowledge is located. The absence of frameworks to holistically understand the Global South experiences leads to knowledge production models and systems with hugely inefficient outcomes. Focusing solely on the the university-centric model, &nbsp;therefore, gives us an incomplete picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our project studies and aims to offer a comprehensive global platform and network to unify some of the different sites through which knowledge is produced, mobilized and disseminated in the South. Academics in the South wear multiple hats &ndash; they work in traditional research spaces but also practice and connect with local knowledge centers, activists and community actors and organizations, and even governments. The overlaps and exchanges between these actors generate knowledge, mobilize it, and drive calls to action. These knowledge stakeholders could be called as scholactivists. They innovate models of knowledge production and mobilization by integrating or strengthening the links between formal knowledge and the tacit knowledge gained through experience of actors on the ground.</p>



<p>We propose to work through a range of methods to build knowledge/data from the ground up through the local/informal sites of knowledge production and connect them to formal institutional networks.&nbsp;There is a need to introduce diverse and plural perspectives into the mainstream and dominant knowledge models. The dominant model of knowledge creation has indeed been built around assumptions about a simple transfer from North to South. This approach pushes formal models that work in the North, into the South for reform projects without taking into consideration context, culture, history and politics. The Global South, therefore, provides fertile grounds to study how we can unify knowledge systems and make them more resilient in larger and real-world contexts.&nbsp;The project is therefore about recognizing the plural sites of knowledge production, something that will integrate and transform knowledge globally.</p>



<p>The project has two components, namely (a) curation (with online repository, regulatory mapping, and resources for scholars at risk), and (b) research component (with global and regional workshop and supporting communities within and outside academia). One of our hopes is that this project helps build legacies and shapes alternative futures. In the Global South, where we are claiming knowledge resides in the intersection of overlapping, dynamic and often informal fields, legacy building becomes challenging. Knowledge is neither systematized, nor institutionalized, or carried forth.&nbsp;Building knowledge systems takes generations and the task ahead of us is intergenerational to build knowledge commons and reinforce the power of community.</p>

<p>A recent review article whose authors included two assistant professors at universities in the United States was written by a physician in India who is running a paper mill, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/13/10/926">Current Status and Emerging Trends in Colorectal Cancer Screening and Diagnostics</a>” appeared last year in a special issue of <em>Biosensors</em>, an MDPI title. The article came to our attention because <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/23/exclusive-mayo-florida-profs-among-authors-of-article-tied-to-indian-paper-mill/#comments">it matched an ad</a> posted by the Indian paper mill iTrilon, as we reported earlier this year;&nbsp; some of the author names appeared on other iTrilon publications as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two assistant professors – <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/liu-yuguang-ph-d/bio-20503555">Yuguang Liu</a> of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and <a href="https://floridapoly.edu/directory/faculty/ajeet-kaushik.php">Ajeet Kaushik</a> of Florida Polytechnic University in Lakeland – have not previously been tied to paper-mill publications and denied any knowledge of the ad.</p>



<span id="more-128846"></span>



<p>According to MDPI, the link between the review and iTrilon was too weak to warrant investigation – a stance the publisher has since revised. New evidence we obtained and shared with MDPI shows the paper’s first author, <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-shreya-singh-60a4331a8">Shreya Singh Beniwal</a>, is no stranger to the seedy haunts of scholarly publishing. (Beniwal lists her affiliation as Lady Hardinge Medical College, in Delhi, on her papers, although <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dr._Shreya_Singh_-_Lady_Hardinge_Medical_College_-_Bayern_Tyskland_LinkedIn_-_2024-02-25_21.36.31-scaled.jpg">her LinkedIn page</a> states she left the school in 2021.)</p>



<p>As evidenced by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RPReplay_Final1708765610.mp4">a video</a> shared with us by an anonymous tipster, Beniwal manages a sprawling network of groups and communities on the messaging platform WhatsApp. There, she and a colleague peddle author slots on research papers for between $50 and $500 each.</p>



<p>On Dec. 18, 2023, for instance, Beniwal posted an ad for “Paper 301” to one of her WhatsApp communities – “Research Projects: Review Articles, systematic Review And Meta-analysis Community 1” –&nbsp; promising acceptance in a Scopus-indexed journal within a month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authorship of the article, which was titled “Assessment of effects on cardiovascular system in systemic hepatocellular carcinoma therapy: A meta analysis,” came with a price tag of 38,000 Indian rupees (about $460) for the first position, dropping to 29,000 Indian rupees ($350) for the tenth.</p>



<p>The paper mill operation seems tied to a murky, fee-based membership organization called <a href="http://web.archive.org/save/https:/www.thegara.co.in/">The Global Achievers Research Academy</a> (GARA), which is also managed, at least in part, by Beniwal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a document shown in the video, members get access to support and training related to research, networking and scientific writing. Some apparently are eligible for an upgrade with extra perks. In an announcement posted to her WhatsApp community “Research Ambassadors,” Beniwal congratulated “Our Ambassadors Who Have Reached Team Milestones!” and invited them to join the community where the ad for “Paper 301” appeared.</p>



<p>Beniwal, who goes by the username “Dr.” on the messaging app, also welcomed the “research ambassadors” to a network called “ExquisiteGARA: The Gateway to Advanced Research and Analysis.” Participation came with such benefits as “designations like ‘Senior Ambassador’ or ‘Coordinator’” and “free participation and potential authorship for recruiting new members.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She proceeded to list “Our Recent Publications,” which counted the <em>Biosensors</em> review and <a href="https://archive.fo/aON4t">an earlier paper</a> of hers that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">precisely matched an iTrilon ad</a> and has since been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/25/journal-pulls-papers-following-retraction-watch-investigation/">quietly withdrawn</a>, as we reported in January.</p>



<p>In a notice posted later to the community where the ad for “Paper 301” appeared, Beniwal explained that “Participants at ExquisiteGARA” would need to pay two separate fees: a non-refundable “participation fee” as well as publication charges to be “equally shared among all members involved in the project.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we embark on various exciting research projects at ExquisiteGARA, it is crucial for all participating members to clearly understand the financial aspects associated with these projects,” the notice stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beniwal deactivated the community featuring the “Paper 301” ad in January, shortly before the publication of a six-month Retraction Watch investigation in <em>Science</em> that focused on how iTrilon and other paper mills had <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.zrjehzt">infiltrated journals across the globe</a>. But she and a colleague with the WhatsApp handle “Education” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Beniwal-replay-2.mp4">continue the authorship trade</a> elsewhere on the platform.</p>



<p>In WhatsApp and email exchanges with Retraction Watch, Beniwal denied selling authorship. “And there was not any selling regarding my [<em>Biosensors</em> review] paper. All authors worked ethically and we have worked on it for months. There must be some misunderstanding regarding it,” she told us.</p>



<p>She said of her and her coauthors:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We connected with each other with the help of LinkedIn and WhatsApp groups with friends and colleague&#8217;s [sic] help and connections&#8230;&#8230; also I have got connections with corresponding author in the same way. Most of the paper was written by me including few figures and initial 5 sections and remaining task was handled by corresponding author by adding other members&#8230;.. as they also contributed in writing some parts and final revisions were done after that depending upon revision related comments by journal. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>ExquisiteGARA, Beniwal added, is not a “platform to sell the papers. That is for workshops.” In the video we received “the good things are hidden and are being misinterpreted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked about her affiliation with Lady Hardinge Medical College, Beniwal dodged the question and responded angrily, “Why I am even talking to you here. I am not answerable to your silly questions.”</p>



<p>A representative of MDPI told us on behalf of <em>Biosensors’</em> editorial office:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Thank you for providing us with further details. We have also conducted a comprehensive investigation internally via our Research Integrity department. As a result, we have identified and confirmed Dr. Shreya Singh Beniwal involvement in certain unethical activities and situations related to paper mills and authorship selling activities. The published article is presently under investigation as well, and in terms of future actions, we will keep adhering to COPE guidelines and recommendations. Each submission will be meticulously evaluated on a case-by-case basis, employing standard checks and screening procedures. We will maintain high level of vigilance, particularly when dealing with suspicious activities associated with paper mills that have been previously identified through online records. We will engage in thorough discussions with the journal&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief and members of the Editorial Board to address this matter effectively.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-soil-hurricane-land-brown-ocean-effect">Waterlogged soils can give hurricanes new life after they arrive on land</a></h4>

              
                <p>Once a hurricane makes landfall, it’s usually the beginning of the end for the storm. But a <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/104ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/440195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tropical cyclone passing over warm, waterlogged ground</a> can get a jolt of energy that refuels its fury, researchers reported in January at the American Meteorological Society’s meeting in Baltimore.</p>



<p>This phenomenon, called the brown ocean effect, mimics how the ocean fuels tropical cyclones by giving the storms a ready supply of water and heat. Understanding this effect, researchers say, could help forecasters warn residents that an inland hurricane might counterintuitively strengthen.</p>



<p>Using satellite measurements of wind speeds, rainfall and soil moisture, geologist Dev Niyogi and colleagues examined how this effect was at play for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-climate-change-fueling-hurricane-florence">Hurricane Florence, a relatively weak storm when it made landfall</a> in the Carolinas in September 2018 (<em>SN: 9/13/18</em>). The data revealed a powerful feedback mechanism: As Florence passed over already-soaking soil, its rains intensified, ultimately leading to record-breaking rainfall and flooding.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s one of the first observational confirmations of this long-hypothesized phenomenon, says Niyogi, of the University of Texas at Austin. The brown ocean effect can also help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-hurricanes-landfall-lingering-longer-staying-stronger">some storms stay strong longer</a> as they travel over land, he says, allowing them to penetrate deeper inland before dissipating (<em>SN: 11/11/2020)</em>.</p>



<p>The idea of the brown ocean effect was described in 2013 by atmospheric scientist Marshall Shepherd and geographer Theresa Andersen, prompted in part by the very strange evolution of Tropical Storm Erin in 2007. The storm was weak and disorganized when it made landfall, but as it drifted northwest toward Oklahoma, it encountered flooded ground due to heavy rains that year. The storm suddenly strengthened, puzzling scientists as it even formed an eye for the first time.</p>



<p>Computer simulations have long suggested that wetter soils can intensify monsoon rains as well as cyclones. “Water evaporates from the ocean as water vapor, but when it gets into hurricanes, it condenses,” says Shepherd, of the University of Georgia in Athens. As the water changes from gas to liquid, it also releases heat — a jolt of storm-strengthening energy.</p>



<p>In Anderson’s dissertation work at the University of Georgia, she identified at least a dozen storms between 1997 and 2008, including Tropical Storm Erin, that were probably strengthened by this effect post-landfall.</p>



<p>And now, Shepherd says, there’s a growing body of scientific studies hunting for — and finding — the fingerprints of this effect in specific storms. “Tropical storms are not intelligent,” he says. “They don’t know the difference between wet soils, oceans and wetlands” as sources of energy.</p>



<p>The new study is among that body of work. Niyogi and colleagues used high-resolution satellite data on soil moisture, temperature and changes in rainfall before, during and after Hurricane Florence’s arrival on land. “As the storm system was moving, you could trace the source of moisture, see rainfall maxima,” Niyogi says.</p>



<p>The data revealed a powerful positive feedback between bursts of intense rain and soil moisture, the team found. How long the soils were wet before the storm passed over them also made a difference, they calculated: The heaviest rains occurred over soil that had already been saturated for about three days. That’s about how long evaporation from the soaked soil helped keep the atmosphere just above the ground nice and humid — ideal for feeding energy to a storm.</p>

<p>Saturated soil isn’t the only criterion — soil temperature was also key, the team determined. When the soil reaches a certain threshold temperature — one that’s yet to be determined, Niyogi says — the conditions are especially right to spin up a storm. The team’s findings <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were also reported in 2023 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em></a>.</p>



<p>Shepherd coauthored a separate study, also presented at the American Meteorological Society’s January meeting, that detailed how the effect contributed to <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/104ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/433146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flash floods inundating Texas during 2015’s Tropical Storm Bill</a>.</p>



<p>And perhaps the most striking recent case of this effect came in 2021, when Hurricane Ida roared ashore in Louisiana, at almost the same location as 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. However, <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/103/10/BAMS-D-21-0240.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ida lingered much longer</a> before dissipating — probably fueled by days of rain soaking the ground and increasing the humidity ahead of its landfall, researchers reported in 2022 in the <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</em>.</p>



<p>What these data show, Niyogi says, is that “the brown ocean effect exists, if you look for it.”</p>



<p>Shepherd agrees: These studies confirm that the brown ocean effect “is real,” and that computer weather models need to incorporate the influence of land as well as ocean and atmosphere on tropical storms. That’s particularly important when it comes to forecasting the danger these storms might pose to inland residents, he says. “If a storm moves inland, the model needs to capture that there’s wet soil there.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Reinoud Maex will talk about his work in the presentation entitled &quot;An analytical model of the energy of ion mixing in the brain&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neurons store energy in the ionic concentration gradients they build between their cell
interior and the extracellular space. They can subsequently use this energy to do work,
such as charging their membrane capacitor, transporting metabolites across their cell
membrane, etc. During hyperactivity or energy deprivation the ions mix and the neurons
swell. In this presentation I will show how a single principle, namely that neurons try to
maximize the energy stored, can explain three unrelated phenomena: a) why extracellular
space occupies a volume fraction of about 20%, b) why neurons swell during energy
deprivation, and c) why calcium ions are so heavily buffered.</p>

<p>Erick Jones, the dean of engineering at the University of Nevada in Reno, appears to have engaged in extensive plagiarism in the final report he submitted to the National Science Foundation for a grant, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1939762&amp;HistoricalAwards=false"> $28,238 grant</a> partially supported a three-day workshop that Jones and his wife, Felicia Jefferson, held for 21 students in Washington, DC, in April 2022 titled “Broadening Participation in Engineering through Improved Financial Literacy.” Jefferson received<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1939739&amp;HistoricalAwards=false"> a separate award for $21,757</a>.</p>



<p>Jones submitted his final report to the agency in May 2023. Retraction Watch obtained a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1939762-Final.pdf">copy of that report</a> through a public records request to Jones’s previous employer, the University of Texas at Arlington, and identified three published sources of extended passages he used without citation or quotation marks.</p>



<span id="more-128836"></span>



<p>Jones, who<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/11/engineering-deans-journal-serves-as-a-supply-chain-for-bizarre-articles/"> has been criticized</a> for publishing “bizarre” and “incoherent” articles in the journal he founded, the <em>International Supply Chain Technology Journal</em>, did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, a student at his university launched a petition to <a href="https://thisisreno.com/2024/02/unr-faculty-students-call-for-engineering-deans-resignation/">demand his resignation</a> which has now garnered more than 200 signatures.</p>



<p>The report to NSF also mentioned the forthcoming publication of a book by Jones and two coauthors titled “Broadening Participation of Financial Literacy in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM),” which Retraction Watch was unable to locate.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Under the National Science Foundation’s grant<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/pappg_12.jsp#:~:text=RESEARCH%20MISCONDUCT%20means%20fabrication%2C%20falsification,research%20results%20funded%20by%20NSF."> policies</a>, “fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing or performing research funded by NSF, reviewing research proposals submitted to NSF, or in reporting research results funded by NSF” is considered a form of research misconduct.</p>



<p><a href="https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/mitchelo/">Olivia Mitchell</a>, an economist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, whose work was cut and pasted into Jones’s grant report called his borrowing “unbelievable” after she was made aware of it by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>“He has directly copied my words written in a published article with my coauthor and he presented the paragraph verbatim, and without attribution, as his own work without my permission,” she wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. “I condemn this practice and consider it to be a breach of academic integrity.”</p>



<p>Below is a comparison between text in Jones’s 2023 grant report and three published articles.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odysseus-moon-mission-lunar-lander-end">Odysseus’ historic moon mission comes to an end, for now</a></h4>

              
                <p>Odysseus has exceeded engineers’ expectations during its odyssey on the moon. NASA confirmed that the spindly solar-powered robotic lander, built and operated by the Houston-based&nbsp;private U.S. company Intuitive Machines, has been alive and collecting data since it touched down, and toppled over, on the lunar surface on February 22.</p>



<p>“What a magnificent job that lander did,” said Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus during a NASA news briefing on February 28. “So much data and information and science. It&#8217;s just an incredible testament to how robust that little spacecraft is, so we&#8217;re really happy with that.”</p>

<p>The spacecraft, which carried payloads from universities, industry and NASA, was the first American spacecraft<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-odysseus-moon-landing"> to perform a soft landing</a> on the moon in more than 50 years (<em>SN: 2/22/24</em>). Odysseus, or Odie as it’s nicknamed, is slowly running out of power, and scientists expect to put it into sleep mode February 28, after roughly six days on the lunar surface. They will try to reawaken Odie in about three weeks when the sun hits the lander’s solar panels again.</p>



<p>Much like its namesake, the epic hero from the Greek classic <em>The Odyssey</em>, the spacecraft Odysseus underwent trials and tribulations in its journey. Its autonomous landing system’s laser range finder malfunctioned, causing engineers to scramble for a solution that involved two extra hours in orbit and reconfiguring a couple backup lasers on a NASA payload. After a nail-biting descent, Odysseus’s landing gear caught on the sloped ground or possibly a crevice, breaking the gear and sending the spacecraft gently tipping over on its side.</p>



<p>Despite the mishap, “our navigation system landed us with precision and the shock absorbers took the load,” Altemus said. “The landing gear did what it was supposed to do and protect the lander as it landed on the surface.”</p>



<p>The spacecraft was originally supposed to operate for about a week, though during a Feb. 23 briefing with reporters mission director Tim Crain, chief technology officer of Intuitive Machines, said that under the best case scenario it might last for nine to 10 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, after six days on the moon, the lander was expected to run out of power. “We&#8217;re going to tuck Odie in for the cold night of the moon,” Crain said during the Feb. 28 briefing. “We are going to leave the computers and the power system in a place where we can wake it up … once it gets power again.”</p>



<p>The main limiting factor to whether Odysseus comes back online will be its batteries; their chemistry-based technology will struggle with the extreme temperature plunge of lunar night. “We&#8217;re confident that when the sun comes back up, the solar arrays will energize and they&#8217;ll send power,” said Crain. “The real question is, ‘Are the batteries there to receive that power and pass it on?’”</p>



<p>Odysseus, which stands about 4 meters tall and 1.5 meters wide, came down at a site roughly 300 kilometers away from the lunar south pole on the slope of a crater called Malapert A. Astronauts with NASA’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-mission-new-diverse-crew-astronauts-moon"> crewed Artemis</a> program may land at a similar site or nearby in the coming decades (<em>SN: 12/1/22</em>).</p>



<p>Some of the spacecraft’s various payloads have had their own little adventures during the mission. For instance, a camera built by students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla., was supposed to detach during descent and take pictures as the spacecraft touched down. Due to the problems with landing, the camera, known as EagleCam, was not deployed, but Crain said he and others are working on getting it ready for ejection.</p>

<p>But the International Lunar Observatory Association, a private company based in Kamuela, Hawaii, has received images from a telescope it sent on Odysseus named ILO‐X. The instrument is a precursor to a larger telescope the company hopes to deploy at Malapert A in the future and is intended to conduct scientific observations of the Milky Way from the moon. The association confirmed that ILO-X was able to snap images during the mission, which show portions of the lunar landscape, the sun and the Odysseus lander. The images are expected to be released February 29.</p>



<p>All of the NASA instruments that Odysseus carried have been transmitting useful data, said Sue Lederer, project scientist for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Engineers were able to troubleshoot initial problems with the spacecraft’s antenna that prevented full transmission, and have since received a flood of data.</p>



<p>“We went from basically a cocktail straw of data coming back to a boba-tea-sized straw of data,” Lederer said. “We&#8217;ve gotten over 15 megabytes of data.” This will be useful for understanding the spacecraft’s touchdown sequence as well as informing future missions to the moon and Mars, she said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-parasite-humans-apes-tail-loss-evolution">A genetic parasite may explain why humans and other apes lack tails</a></h4>

              
                <p>A genetic parasite may have robbed humans and other apes of their tails.</p>



<p>Around 25 million years ago, this parasite, a small stretch of repetitive DNA called an Alu element, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07095-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended up in a gene important for tail development</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 29 <em>Nature</em>. The single insertion altered the gene <em>Tbxt</em> in a way that seems to have sparked one of the defining differences between monkeys and apes: Monkeys have tails, apes don’t.</p>



<p>“It was like lightning struck once,” says Jef Boeke, a geneticist at New York University Langone Health, and ape behinds ultimately became bare.</p>



<p>The genetic tweak may also give insight into why some babies are born with spinal cord defects such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/database-provides-peek-human-embryo-first-weeks">spina bifida</a>, when the tube that holds the cord doesn’t close all the way (<em>SN: 12/6/16</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alu elements are part of a group of genetic parasites known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-genes-play-big-role-what-makes-us-human">transposons or jumping genes</a> that can hop across genetic instruction books, inserting themselves into their hosts’ DNA (<em>SN: 5/16/17)</em>. Sometimes, when the gene slips itself into a piece of DNA that is passed down to offspring, these insertions become permanent parts of our genetic code. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Transposons, including more than 1 million Alu elements, are found throughout our genome, says geneticist and systems biologist Bo Xia of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Researchers once thought of transposons as genetic garbage, but some have central roles in evolution. Without transposons, the placenta, immune system and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-retrovirus-myelin-speedy-nerves-evolve">insulation around nerve fibers</a> may not exist (<em>SN: 2/16/24</em>).</p>



<p>And humans might still have tails.</p>



<p>To find out how apes lost their tails, Xia, then at NYU Langone Health, Boeke and colleagues analyzed 140 genes involved in vertebrate tail development. The team found that in monkeys, including baboons and rhesus macaques, the <em>Tbxt</em> gene was missing a chunk of DNA that’s found in humans, chimpanzees and other apes. It was a “eureka moment,” Boeke says. The insertion may have appeared around the time apes diverged from African and Asian monkeys, around 25 million years ago.</p>



<p>But the missing chunk was in a part of the gene called an intron, a bit of genetic material that isn’t made into proteins. “So why would that even matter?” he asks. A close look at the gene’s structure provided a plausible explanation: The missing bit tweaked <em>Tbxt </em>so that the gene makes a different form of the protein in apes than in monkeys.</p>



<p>Experiments in mice seemed to confirm the hypothesis. Mice, like monkeys, make normal versions of the Tbxt protein and have full-length tails. But when genetically engineered to make shortened versions of the Tbxt protein like apes do, the mice had shorter tails or none at all. Some mice also had spinal cord defects similar to spinal bifida, suggesting that there may be drawbacks to tail loss.</p>

<p>Other genes may also be involved in tail loss. Many more Alu elements are scattered among human introns that could have yet-to-be-known effects on other aspects of human evolution, Boeke and Xia say.</p>



<p>The new findings do begin to unravel how apes lost their tails, says Gabrielle Russo, a biological anthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York. But why it happened, she says, is a much harder question to answer. Research from the early 1900s linked tail loss to muscle changes that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">helped human bodies move upright</a>, but shifts in posture, as well as learning to walk on two feet, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-steps-book-bipedalism-human-evolution-anatomy-behavior">didn’t happen until millions of years later</a> (<em>SN: 9/15/21; SN: 4/14/21</em>). So, it’s unlikely the new findings will shed light on these human traits, Russo says.</p>



<p>A natural next step, Russo says, is exploring whether the genetic underpinnings of tail loss in apes also happened in other mammals with shortened tails or none at all such as koalas, capybaras and bears.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-large-language-model-understanding">Why large language models aren’t headed toward humanlike understanding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Apart from the northward advance of killer bees in the 1980s, nothing has struck as much fear into the hearts of headline writers as the ascent of artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>Ever since the computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, humans have faced the prospect that their supremacy over machines is merely temporary. Back then, though, it was easy to show that AI failed miserably in many realms of human expertise, from diagnosing disease to transcribing speech.</p>



<p>But then about a decade ago&nbsp;or so, computer brains — known as neural networks — received an IQ boost from a new approach called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep learning</a>. Suddenly computers approached human ability at identifying images, reading signs and enhancing photographs — not to mention converting speech to text as well as most typists.</p>



<p>Those abilities had their limits. For one thing, even apparently successful deep learning neural networks were easy to trick. A few small stickers strategically placed on a stop sign made an AI computer think the sign said “Speed Limit 80,” for example. And those smart computers needed to be extensively trained on a task by viewing numerous examples of what they should be looking for. So deep learning produced excellent results for narrowly focused jobs but couldn’t adapt that expertise very well to other arenas. You would not (or shouldn’t) have hired it to write a magazine column for you, for instance.</p>



<p>But AI’s latest incarnations have begun to threaten job security not only for writers but also a lot of other professionals.</p>



<p>“Now we’re in a new era of AI,” says computer scientist Melanie Mitchell, an artificial intelligence expert at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. “We’re beyond the deep learning revolution of the 2010s, and we’re now in the era of generative AI of the 2020s.”</p>



<p>Generative AI systems can produce things that had long seemed safely within the province of human creative ability. AI systems can now answer questions with seemingly human linguistic skill and knowledge, write poems and articles and legal briefs, produce publication quality artwork, and even create videos on demand of all sorts of things you might want to describe.</p>



<p>Many of these abilities stem from the development of large language models, abbreviated as LLMs, such as ChatGPT and other similar models. They are large because they are trained on huge amounts of data — essentially, everything on the internet, including digitized copies of countless printed books. Large can also refer to the large number of different kinds of things they can “learn” in their reading — not just words but also word stems, phrases, symbols and mathematical equations.</p>



<p>By identifying patterns in how such linguistic molecules are combined, LLMs can predict in what order words should be assembled to compose sentences or respond to a query. Basically, an LLM calculates probabilities of what word should follow another, something critics have derided as “autocorrect on steroids.”</p>



<p>Even so, LLMs have displayed remarkable abilities — such as composing texts in the style of any given author, solving riddles and deciphering from context whether “bill” refers to an invoice, proposed legislation or a duck.</p>



<p>“These things seem really smart,” Mitchell said this month in Denver at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>



<p>LLMs’ arrival has induced a techworld version of mass hysteria among some experts in the field who are concerned that run amok, LLMs could raise human unemployment, destroy civilization and put magazine columnists out of business. Yet other experts&nbsp;argue that such fears are overblown, at least for now.</p>



<p>At the heart of the debate is whether LLMs actually understand what they are saying and doing, rather than just seeming to.&nbsp;Some researchers have suggested that LLMs do understand, can reason like people (big deal) or even attain a form of consciousness. But Mitchell and others insist that LLMs do not (yet) really understand the world (at least not in any sort of sense that corresponds to human understanding).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor.”</p><cite>Melanie Mitchell</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In a new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08955" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted online</a> at arXiv.org, Mitchell and coauthor Martha Lewis of the University of Bristol in England show that LLMs still do not match humans in the ability to adapt a skill to new circumstances. Consider this letter-string problem: You start with abcd and the next string is abce. If you start with ijkl, what string should come next?</p>



<p>Humans almost always say the second string should end with m. And so do LLMs. They have, after all, been well trained on the English alphabet.</p>



<p>But suppose you pose the problem with a different “counterfactual” alphabet, perhaps the same letters in a different order, such as a u c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t b v w x y z. Or use symbols instead of letters.&nbsp;Humans are still very good at solving letter-string problems. But LLMs usually fail. They are not able to generalize the concepts used on an alphabet they know to another alphabet.</p>



<p>“While humans exhibit high performance on both the original and counterfactual problems, the performance of all GPT models we tested degrades on the counterfactual versions,” Mitchell and Lewis report in their paper.</p>



<p>Other similar tasks also show that LLMs do not possess the ability to perform accurately in situations not encountered in their training. And therefore, Mitchell insists, they do not exhibit what humans would regard as “understanding” of the world.</p>



<p>“Being reliable and doing the right thing in a new situation is, in my mind, the core of what understanding actually means,” Mitchell said at the AAAS meeting.</p>



<p>Human understanding, she says, is based on “concepts” — basically mental models of things like categories, situations and events. Concepts allow people to infer cause and effect and to predict the probable results of different actions — even in circumstances not previously encountered.</p>



<p>“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor,” Mitchell said.</p>



<p>She does not deny that AI might someday reach a similar level of intelligent understanding. But machine understanding may turn out to be different from human understanding. Nobody knows what sort of technology might achieve that understanding and what the nature of such understanding might be.</p>



<p>If it does turn out to be anything like human understanding, it will probably not be based on LLMs.</p>



<p>After all, LLMs learn in the opposite direction from humans. LLMs start out learning language and attempt to abstract concepts. Human babies learn concepts first, and only later acquire the language to describe them.</p>



<p>So LLMs are doing it backward. In other words, perhaps reading the internet might not be the correct strategy for acquiring intelligence, artificial or otherwise.</p>
