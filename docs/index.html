<p>Last September, NASA steered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">the DART spacecraft into Dimorphos</a>, a moonlet of the larger asteroid Didymos, to test a strategy for knocking any future Earth-bound asteroids off course (<em>SN: 10/11/22</em>). About three months after the impact, the Hubble Space Telescope spied <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ace1ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a halo of 37 previously unseen objects</a> accompanying the space rock duo in their orbit around the sun, researchers report in the July 21<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters.</em></p>





<p>The boulders probably aren’t bits that were pulverized from larger rocks during the impact. Instead, simulations suggest they were likely intact when they were blasted off Dimorphos and could have been launched off the moonlet’s rubble-covered surface by the energy of either the collision or the seismic waves bouncing around inside it in the wake of the impact.</p>



<p>Still, “there’s a lot of uncertainty in such simulations,” planetary astronomer David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Based on the brightness of the new objects, some of the dimmest ever spied by Hubble in our solar system, Jewitt and colleagues estimate that these boulders may be as wide as 7 meters. At least 15 are larger than 4 meters across. Together, the researchers calculate, the boulders probably weigh just over 5 million kilograms — roughly the weight of 300 dump truck loads of gravel.</p>



<p>Repeated observations by Hubble reveal that, on average, the boulders are drifting away from Dimorphos and Didymos at about 1 kilometer per hour — a little faster than the escape velocity for the double asteroid system. So, Jewitt says, the boulders, as well as a presumed multitude of rocks too small and dim for Hubble to see, will eventually break away from the asteroid system’s orbit and circle the sun on their own.</p>

<p>Sage Publishing is retracting 37 articles from an engineering journal after finding “indicators of third party involvement” in the peer review process. </p>



<p>The publisher’s investigation continues, and more papers may be retracted, a spokesperson for the company told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A single <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09544089231188713">retraction notice</a> lists the links of the 37 papers to be retracted from <em>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E: Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering</em>. The notice states: </p>



<span id="more-127573"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After an internal investigation Sage became aware that the peer-review process for these articles had been compromised and contains indicators of third-party involvement.</p>



<p>As these were accepted because of a peer-review process that did not meet Sage’s expectations of high quality and ethical peer-review, the publisher cannot uphold the integrity of the research. In line with COPE guidelines and Sage policies, these articles are retracted.</p>



<p>The authors have been informed of this decision using the email addresses provided at submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00713">Ooi Kim Tiow</a>, the journal’s editor in chief and an associate provost at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only one of the papers has attracted notice on PubPeer. In June of last year, sleuth Alexander Magazinov <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F62C83E94CD638BD4744AA87C727DB#1">commented</a> that “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09544089221082489">Applications of fractional derivatives in MHD free-convective oscillating flow of a blood based CNTs nanofluid across a porous medium</a>” contained “A hollow sentence with a bulk citation to the benefit of a certain YM Chu.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early this year, Sage became aware of concerns with the journal’s content after one article “showed indicators of third party activity and compromised peer review,” a spokesperson said. The publisher began an investigation and reviewed “all submissions that showed indicators of suspicious activity. We asked which article tipped off the investigation, but Sage was not able to share the title by our deadline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sage is deeply committed to research integrity and righting the academic record. We have recently expanded our Research Integrity Group and have a full dedicated team who are actively working to guard against ethical misconduct – strengthening our use of tools and technology to undercover suspicious activity in papers, improving policies, and identifying journals where there may be similar issues. As a result, we anticipate further retractions to come as we uncover and address potential misconduct. We will continue to support our Editors and Assistant Editors in peer review best practices, and we have provided them with additional guidance on how to identify suspicious activity in journal submissions.</p>

<p>Sage was one of the first publishers to recognize large-scale peer review manipulation and begin retracting papers in bulk nine years ago. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/08/sage-publications-busts-peer-review-and-citation-ring-60-papers-retracted/">wrote</a> back in 2014 that a batch of 60 retractions involved in a peer review and citation ring “deserves a ‘wow.’” In recent years, however, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/20/new-record-major-publisher-retracting-100-studies-cancer-journal-fake-peer-reviews/">publishers</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/20/journal-retracts-more-than-400-papers-at-once/">have been</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/exclusive-plos-one-to-retract-more-than-100-papers-for-manipulated-peer-review/">retracting</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/23/publisher-retracts-350-papers-at-once/">even more</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">papers</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">at once</a> for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/20/deplorable-imaging-journal-to-retract-nearly-80-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">similar reasons</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the Sage spokesperson what’s changed since 2014, and if the systems put in place to catch such problems needed updating. The response:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve increased our investment in correcting the academic record and this is a sign of those efforts. We have recently put together a full team whose main purpose is to investigate these issues using new technology to help them along the way and then to improve policies and processes for the future. We have more than 1,100 journals so this can take time but we are very committed.</p>

<p>Other publishers have <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/21/research-misconduct-journals-hiring-research-integrity-czars/">long had such teams</a>, some for well over a decade.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-body-mapping-technique-mouse-organ">With a new body mapping technique, mouse innards glow with exquisite detail</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mouse’s entire nervous system lights up in psychedelic hues. Clumps of immune cells attacking tumors give off a ghostly glow. The vessels that make up the body’s sewer system flare brightly.</p>



<p>These and other images are shining a new light on the inner workings of mice, thanks to a new technique <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01846-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that makes whole body imaging cheaper and faster</a>, researchers report July 10 in <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>.</p>



<p>See-through mice <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/clearing-anatomy-see-through-mouse">are nothing new</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/14</em>). But existing techniques to image their insides can be expensive, time-consuming or don’t hit the right target. Now, a study shows that chemically removing cholesterol — an essential component of cell membranes — from dead mice creates spongelike holes in tissues without destroying them. That means tailored antibodies can move through the holes to infiltrate every corner of the body and bind to proteins of interest to make entire anatomical features visible under fluorescent light.</p>





<p>The technique, dubbed wildDISCO, gives scientists an extraordinarily thorough peek under mouse skin to create body-wide anatomical atlases. It’s a bit like Google Maps, says Ali Ertürk, a neuroscientist at Helmholtz Munich. But in place of cars driving around to record every street, antibodies act as streetlamps to illuminate scientific landmarks.</p>



<p>Such maps could help researchers train artificial intelligence programs to simulate bodily processes in mice. The algorithms would aim, for example, to simulate how a drug travels through blood vessels, or predict the path of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">genetically engineered immune cells</a> for cancer therapy, Ertürk says (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>). Computational simulations of biology may help researchers move away from doing animal experiments, he says.&nbsp;</p>

Mai <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Biotechnology </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To make the mice glow, Ertürk and colleagues pumped cholesterol-removing chemicals along with antibodies tagged with fluorescent molecular markers into the dead animals via the heart and blood vessels, a proven tactic that allows liquids to traverse the entire body. Then the team made all the tissues transparent, and the mice were ready for their close-ups.</p>



<p>One of the resulting maps depicts a comprehensive view of the network of nerves that runs beneath the skin and around organs. Another shows off the lymphatic system, an open network of organs and lymphatic vessels that helps fight off pathogens and transport cellular waste for removal.</p>



<p>These blueprints yielded some scientific nuggets.</p>



<p>Images taken of the nervous systems, for instance, showed that mice with no microbes in their bodies had underdeveloped nerve networks in their guts compared with normal mice, suggesting that the gut microbiome plays an important role in helping nerves develop.</p>



<p>And in mice with cancer, the team documented clumps of immune cells inside and near the tumors. The role that these clusters play in controlling cancer is unclear, Ertürk says. But wildDISCO offers scientists a way to investigate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>wildDISCO might also help with studies that focus on animals other than mice, says Yijun Su, an imaging specialist at Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va., who was not involved in the work. Scientists working with fruit flies, frogs or zebra fish might use a similar “recipe,” he says, to take clearer snapshots of their anatomy.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780226824918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Next Supercontinent</a><br><em>Ross Mitchell</em><br><em>Univ. of Chicago, $30</em></p>



<p>Today, there are seven continents. Some 200 million years from now, there will be just one. In <em>The Next Supercontinent</em>, geophysicist Ross Mitchell previews what the world might look like when Earth’s continents amalgamate into a single landmass.</p>



<p>Although Mitchell’s destination is the distant future, don’t be fooled. His book is as much a romp through the past as it is a look ahead, complete with references unique to the present (like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson helming a speedboat as it crests a highly improbable tsunami that ravages the Golden Gate Bridge in the movie <em>San Andreas</em>).</p>





<p>On the journey back in time, Mitchell visits how the continents came together in the past to form the previous supercontinents. He begins about 300 million to 200 million years ago with lush, dinosaur-laden Pangaea, which was centered on present-day Africa. He then goes back to a billion years ago to barren Rodinia, whose center consisted of much of today’s North America plus Greenland. Two billion years ago, there was what some scientists call Columbia — the Siberia-centric first supercontinent.</p>



<p>Tracking the paths of today’s continents through history takes some serious scientific sleuthing. This often begins with fieldwork to collect samples that constrain when a rock formed and its latitude at that time. To give readers a taste of such (mis)adventures, Mitchell shares how he lost half his right thumb in the Australian Outback while unearthing some of Rodinia’s mysteries, and when he and a colleague were nearly stranded with their samples on a frigid lake in Canada’s Northwest Territories.</p>



<p>Clues as to why supercontinents form in the first place and what causes their repeated rending also reside in an entirely different field of study — one in which scientists simulate how the “solid but pliable” mantle might have behaved to coax continents along. The mantle regulates the relationship between the crust and Earth’s core, which stores primordial heat. The supercontinent cycle, Mitchell argues, is linked to mantle movement that transfers Earth’s interior heat upward so the crust can release it.</p>



<p>As heat rises, scientists suspect, continents drift toward regions where the mantle is cold. These cold spots exist where oceanic plates subduct, or sink below more buoyant tectonic plates, into the mantle. Inch by inch, subducting ocean will disappear and bring continents closer together, resulting in a collision that will eventually culminate in a new supercontinent. Mantle simulations suggest that after the supersized landmass has formed, the incessant inward pull ceases as new subduction zones initiate at the coastlines of the supercontinent. Somewhere in the interior of the supercontinent, hot mantle rises, eventually causing the supercontinent to tear, forming new oceans and beginning another cycle.</p>



<p>Using the past to predict the future and understanding the mechanics of the mantle, Mitchell presents his vision of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">Amasia — the next supercontinent</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/17, p. 18</em>). Some researchers have suggested it will form from either the closing of the Pacific or Atlantic oceans. But he posits Amasia will form via the disappearance of the Arctic Ocean as the Americas and Eurasia meet near the North Pole, dragging the other continents along for the ride.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, Mitchell’s clear explanations and carefully chosen images help make sense of even the most complicated concepts (take it from a trained geologist who always had trouble with the particulars of the study of Earth’s past magnetic field — paleomagnetism — which often drive supercontinent reconstructions).</p>



<p>But whether Mitchell’s predictions are correct is something no reader will live long enough to find out, though maybe our descendants will. That will require humankind to survive far longer than any other known mammal. But given all our achievements as a species, Mitchell is hopeful we can beat the odds. “While such longevity may seem far-fetched,” he writes, “doesn’t it also sound a lot like us?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nature-exercise-happiness-psychology">Time in nature or exercise is touted for happiness. But evidence is lacking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Go on a run, hike through nature and meditate, and you’re basically guaranteed a happier life. At least, that’s what scores of listicles might lead you to believe. But a new review of hundreds of studies on happiness questions just how strong the evidence is for some of these happiness hacks.</p>



<p>The finding comes in the wake of the “replication crisis” in psychology, where the results of dozens of key psychological studies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-results-evaporate-upon-further-review">haven’t been able to be repeated</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/15</em>). In response, scientists have reassessed reams of old studies and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">doubled down on the best practices</a> for ensuring that new studies will hold up under scrutiny (<em>SN: 8/27/18</em>).</p>





<p>To find studies of happiness that applied these best practices, psychologists Dunigan Folk and Elizabeth Dunn of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver combed through hundreds of papers. The team focused on research that studied a large sample of people, which helps tease out real effects, and studies that were pre-registered, meaning that researchers outlined how they were going to conduct a study before starting it. That way, they can’t tweak it midway; it’s the scientific equivalent of calling your shot in pool.</p>



<p>Although studies of happiness were plentiful, studies that met these high standards were relatively scarce. And the evidence they offered, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01651-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially for exercise, meditation and time in nature</a>, was weaker than one might expect, the researchers report July 20 in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Dunn to discuss happiness, how we can get better at studying it and what science says works — and doesn’t — to build a happier life. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Why study happiness?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Science has given us our most essential human advances. It&#8217;s because of science that we got to the moon, that we have substantially increased longevity, that we have COVID vaccines. The scientific method is what solves our greatest challenges, and so I want to apply that method toward understanding happiness.</p>



<p>I think of happiness as being kind of the ultimate outcome measure. You know, whatever else we might be interested in, what ultimately matters is: “Are people leading happy lives?”</p>



<p>For me, understanding happiness is one of the fundamental mysteries and challenges of human existence.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>SN: </em>What gave you the idea to look into these past studies of happiness?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn: </strong>This research actually started with a question from a journalist who asked, ‘’These things we hear about in the media as being really important for happiness, like meditation and nature, how rigorous is the research behind those kinds of claims?”</p>



<p>I realized I didn&#8217;t know. We were inspired to go look at the scientific literature, really comb through it to understand how good the evidence is underlying commonly recommended strategies. We didn&#8217;t go in with an agenda, but rather just an open curiosity.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>So where did you start?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> First, we wanted to identify what strategies were most recommended to the public. So we googled phrases like “how to be happy” and identified media stories providing recommendations. Then we said, OK, these five strategies [practicing gratitude, meditating and being mindful, spending time in nature, being social and exercising] are really commonly recommended to the public as ways to be happier.</p>



<p>And then we combed through the literature and found every experiment that we could testing the effectiveness of these strategies for happiness. We wanted to look for studies that hold up to modern standards of what constitutes good evidence. We found over 500 studies examining these strategies, but fewer than 60 of them actually met contemporary standards for rigor.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>What did you find?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> The key takeaway here is that some of the strategies that have been widely recommended to the public as ways of improving happiness are not actually supported by very rigorous evidence.</p>



<p>What’s shocking to me is when we reviewed the literature on meditation, exercise and nature, of the hundreds of studies that we looked at, 95 percent of them didn&#8217;t include enough people that we would trust these studies by contemporary standards.</p>



<p>[Take exercise. Dunn and Folk found no study that both had a sufficiently large sample size and was pre-registered. They did find a dozen studies that included enough people to have meaningful conclusions. Five of those studies “found evidence that people feel happier after a single bout of exercise, but only in comparison with rather boring activities, such as sitting in silence or watching a documentary on bookbinding,” the researchers write in the paper. Similarly, the researchers found only four experiments that supported the happiness benefit of spending time in nature and had large enough sample sizes, though none were pre-registered either.]</p>



<p>Importantly, we&#8217;re certainly not saying that this is all snake oil. There are good reasons why these strategies should work. It&#8217;s just that there isn&#8217;t all that much rigorous evidence to show that they actually do work.</p>



<p>If something works for you, great. I&#8217;m not saying you should stop. It&#8217;s important to emphasize that if you&#8217;re, for example, dealing with an anxiety disorder and your therapist is recommending meditation, you know, we&#8217;re not saying ignore this advice. All we&#8217;re saying is that, for the average person trying to get a little bit happier, the evidence is maybe not there yet.</p>



<p>This is really a call to action to say, hey, we as researchers and as a society need to better understand these topics because they have been so widely embraced by the public and so widely disseminated by the media. We built our castles in the sky; you really need to get some foundations under them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Assessing happiness studies</h3>



<p>Of the hundreds of studies that experimentally tested common recommendations for happiness, only a handful met the gold standard for rigor (larger samples and pre-registered, in blue). Some have one or the other, and the majority didn&#8217;t have large sample sizes and weren&#8217;t pre-registered.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Even if there’s limited evidence, what’s the harm in, say, going for a walk in nature?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn: </strong>Most of these behaviors, like going for a nature walk or meditating, require time and effort. And as somebody who has a child and job, I can tell you time and effort are not in super strong supply.</p>



<p>Particularly for people who are working multiple jobs and have a lot of family responsibilities, finding even 20 minutes on a typical Tuesday where they can do something purely for themselves that they think will make them happy [can be hard]. How they use that 20 minutes really matters.</p>



<p>And they should be getting the best scientific guidance you can possibly give them about how to make the most of that scarce resource of time and of energy.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also a potential danger that people could [needlessly] feel like they failed. If they are like, “Well, nature and meditation make everybody happier, and they don&#8217;t work for me. I guess there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s gonna make me happier.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important that we not overstate the strength of the evidence behind these things.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Did any strategies seem to work in making people happier?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Gratitude comes out looking pretty good, and also chatting with strangers and acting more extroverted. I would always like for the evidence to be even stronger, but those are the strategies I would probably feel the best about recommending from our current review.</p>



<p>[There is “consistent evidence that people in diverse cultural contexts benefit from making gratitude lists,” Dunn and Folk write in the review paper. The researchers also found two studies that had large enough sample sizes and were pre-registered that found talking to strangers boosts mood. Another study that included enough people but wasn’t pre-registered had a similar finding.]</p>



<p>We have another paper in process where we looked at the best studies on happiness, meeting the modern gold standard. From that, there&#8217;s also pretty good evidence that spending money on others promotes happiness. And there&#8217;s good evidence that giving money to poor people makes them happier.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that [psychologists] know nothing about happiness. We do. It&#8217;s just that some of the strategies that have been so widely touted and disseminated are not actually among the sort of best and brightest to emerge from our field.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Do you have personal practices that help you be happier?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> [My past research has shown a link between] generosity and happiness. One thing that I&#8217;ve done with a group of friends was privately sponsor a family of Syrian refugees. Without really intending it this way, it was the perfect application of all of my research, and was probably the most rewarding experience I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>



<p>I also work out every day. It does put me in a really good mood. But this research has given me perhaps some humility in recognizing that that was the case for me. It&#8217;s not like other people would experience necessarily the same benefit as I do from that experience.</p>

<p>Florida State University last week terminated a criminology professor accused of research misconduct, Retraction Watch has learned, capping a years-long, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-criminologist-accused-of-cooking-the-books/">highly</a> <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/14/florida-state-university-under-fire-eric-stewart-a/">publicized</a> <a href="https://www.theflstandard.com/fsu-criminology-professor-abruptly-leaves-after-accusations-of-cooking-race-data/">saga</a> the school says has caused almost &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; damage to its standing.</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Final-Termination-Letter-7.13.23.pdf">termination letter</a> obtained by Retraction Watch, the university accused the former professor, Eric A. Stewart, of &#8220;extreme negligence and incompetence.&#8221; It also asserted that, due to Stewart’s actions, &#8220;decades of research&#8221; once believed &#8220;to be at the forefront of&#8221; criminology has &#8220;been shown to contain numerous erroneous and false narratives.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The details of problematic data management, false results, and the numerous publication retractions have negatively affected the discipline on a national level,&#8221; FSU Provost James J. Clark wrote in the letter, dated July 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clark added that the debacle had also affected recruitment of faculty and students and caused the university&#8217;s researchers to worry about their chances of getting papers into top journals.</p>



<span id="more-127564"></span>



<p>&#8220;The damage to the standing of the University and, in particular, the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice and its faculty approaches the catastrophic and may be unalterable,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>Stewart, whose work focuses on racial disparities in the criminal justice system, could not be reached for comments. He was hired by FSU in 2007.</p>



<p>The misconduct allegations date back to 2019, when one of Stewart&#8217;s coauthors, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/scj/faculty/justin-pickett">Justin Pickett</a>, suggested in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stewart-Data-7.23.19_Redacted.pdf">emails to the university</a> that Stewart had &#8220;falsified data and findings.&#8221; Pickett grew suspicious of his former collaborator following an email from a “John Smith” outlining problems with five of Stewart&#8217;s papers. A <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9b2k3/">27-page article</a> that Pickett posted to a preprint server later that year <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/17/criminologist-posts-27-page-article-explaining-why-he-asked-for-one-of-his-papers-to-be-retracted/">detailed his concerns</a> about <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00225.x">one of the studies</a>, as we reported at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the five papers, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/09/criminology-researcher-to-lose-sixth-paper/">along with a sixth</a>, have since been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/19/criminologist-to-have-four-papers-retracted-following-months-of-scrutiny/">retracted</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to terminate Stewart, which he called &#8220;arbitrary and capricious&#8221; in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ERICST2.pdf">long response</a> (with an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ERICST2.pdf">appendix</a>) to FSU earlier this year, comes after years of bitter feuding. As revealed by dozens of internal documents obtained by Retraction Watch and made public here for the first time, the researcher vehemently defended himself against his critics. At one point he told colleagues in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ERICST2.pdf">an email</a> (p. 88) that &#8220;Justin Pickett has essentially lynched me and my academic character, thereby severely impacting my career, credibility, and professional advancement&#8221; &#8212; a particularly stinging charge, given that Stewart is Black.</p>



<p>On <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hello-Diana.pdf">another occasion</a>, Stewart claimed that the &#8220;baseless allegations&#8221; against him &#8220;serve as a means of harassment, as well as waste time and resources.&#8221;</p>



<p>To investigate, FSU conducted <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Final-Inquiry-Report.pdf">three</a> <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Final-Inquiry-Report-1.pdf">preliminary</a> <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Inquiry_Report_Final.pdf">probes</a> over as many years. While Stewart&#8217;s work contained several problems and statistical mistakes, the probes found no clear signs of research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inquiry committees all recommended against doing a full investigation, a decision that has drawn criticism from <a href="https://areomagazine.com/2020/02/20/how-universities-cover-up-scientific-fraud/">Pickett</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/14/florida-state-university-under-fire-eric-stewart-a/">others</a>. Pickett also argues that the university ignored its own conflict-of-interest rules by <a href="https://areomagazine.com/2020/02/20/how-universities-cover-up-scientific-fraud/">appointing two of Stewart&#8217;s coauthors to one of the inquiry committees</a>.</p>



<p>While the termination letter stops short of accusing Stewart of research fraud, it does point out that he has not been exonerated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The misconduct claims were not rejected, but in all inquiries into the matter, there was found to be insufficient evidence to support a full investigation into research misconduct which is defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Reached for comments, Amy Farnum-Patronis, director of News and Digital Communications at FSU, said: &#8220;The termination letter speaks for itself. We have nothing to add.&#8221;</p>



<p>One problem facing the inquiry committees was that Stewart&#8217;s raw data had gone missing. Allegedly, he handed over three data files to the university in July 2019. But the school since lost the files, as one of its lawyers explained in an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ERICST2.pdf">email this year</a> (p. 90ff) to the U.S. National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General, which investigates grant fraud.</p>



<p>However, Stewart later admitted that he had not handed over the raw data to the university as he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Eric-Stewart-FSU-Response-Document-FINAL_marked_Redacted.pdf">had not been asked to do so</a> (p. 28)</p>



<p>In addition, the hard drive on which Stewart kept his data crashed in December 2019, he explained in an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-Peer-Panel-Documents-Stewart_Redacted.pdf">investigatory interview last year</a> (p. 96ff). He had no backup, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;A data file that is &#8216;lost&#8217; while it is under investigation is particularly peculiar,&#8221; Thomas G. Blomberg, dean of the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at FSU, wrote in a series of <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-Peer-Panel-Documents-Stewart_Redacted.pdf">comments on Stewart&#8217;s statements</a> (p. 110ff). &#8220;Three outcomes are potentially possible. First, the data could have been lost (least likely explanation). Second, the data may have never existed. Third, the data existed in some format but were destroyed to prevent others from accessing them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Blomberg, who did not respond to a request for comment, also questioned what Stewart described as his &#8220;pretty extensive&#8221; training in statistics:</p>



<p><em>If his training in statistical analysis was extensive, then there is no way that he would have created the errors that he did in his studies. Calculating the standard deviation, for example, is something that is taught in middle and high schools and yet he repeatedly miscalculated and/or misreported the standard deviation.</em></p>



<p>In an overview of Stewart&#8217;s research, Blomberg <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-Peer-Panel-Documents-Stewart_Redacted.pdf">listed 16 studies</a> (p. 106) published over 17 years that all had indicators of &#8220;impossible results and erroneous statistics&#8221;:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These were no errors that could be explained away by human error or analytical decisions as they were detected across multiple studies using different data and that employed a variety of methodological and statistical approaches. In short, the problematic indicators were found to be pervasive in his studies, were not confined to just a single problematic indicator, and were detected across a lengthy stretch of his academic career providing compelling documentation of flagrant research incompetence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some of these studies are linked to federal grants, according to <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Inquiry_Report_Final.pdf">one of the inquiry reports</a>. That probe concluded that, based on available evidence, &#8220;there is little reason to believe the anomalous [standard deviations] are due to research misconduct as opposed to honest error.&#8221;</p>



<p>In March, after Stewart received a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stewart-Intent-to-Terminate-JC2-3-10-2023.pdf">letter describing the university&#8217;s intent to terminate him</a> and he was put on administrative leave, he requested that his case be reviewed by a university peer panel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the three members of that panel, only <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stewart-Letter-Marks.pdf">one supported his termination</a>. Another <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Peer-Panel-Review-on-Dr.-Eric-Stewart-By-Sobanjo.pdf">recommended less severe punishment</a>, while the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Salazar-Letter_Stewart-Case43.pdf">third found disciplinary action unwarranted</a>.</p>



<p>In the termination letter, Clark said Stewart had &#8220;distorted some important facts&#8221; in the information he had shared with the panel, which could have swayed some members in his favor.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Clark wrote, &#8220;I do not see how you can teach our students to be ethical researchers or how the results of future research projects conducted by you could be deemed as trustworthy. Therefore, I am proceeding with a termination.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newton-gravitational-constant-physics">Centuries on, Newton’s gravitational constant still can’t be pinned down</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">There was a secret inside the envelope in the hands of Stephan Schlamminger, one of the world’s leading experts in experimental tests of gravity. He appeared to be on the verge of opening the envelope during a presentation at the April 2022 meeting of the American Physical Society, to read a number that would reveal whether his latest efforts in a lifelong passion had been a success.</p>



<p>Schlamminger, of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., sought to <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR22/Session/S16.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure Newton’s gravitational constant</a>. The secret number in the envelope was a kind of code — an intentional and specific error inserted into his NIST experiment to obscure the measurement as it progressed. Only one person knew the number. And that person was not Schlamminger.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">

Schlamminger wants to settle discrepancies in recent measurements from labs around the globe.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129747">JENNIFER LAUREN LEE/NIST</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Without access to it, he couldn’t know what the experiment had found. Schlamminger had imposed the secrecy on himself to protect against bias in the experiment, including the unconscious bias that can beset even the best experimentalists. It was extra precaution to ensure the integrity of an experiment that could help untangle mysterious discrepancies in measurements of the constant, known as G, that have crept up over the last few decades.</p>



<p>G, often called “big G” (to distinguish it from “g,” which depends on G and is the special case of the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth), reflects the strength of gravity between any things with mass. It determines the orbits of planets and galaxies, and describes the force that pulls you to the ground. Nobody knows how to predict from theory what the actual value of G should be, says Clive Speake, a physicist at the University of Birmingham in England who developed the instrument that Schlamminger is using at NIST.</p>





<p>It’s also very difficult to measure. After two centuries of improved precision, recent measurements of G are troubling. A handful of labs around the world have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/explanation-gs-imprecision-stumbles">turned up values that disagree</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/30/15</em>). The scattered values could be a sign of trouble with the measurement techniques among various groups, or there might be a more intriguing aspect.</p>



<p>“There’s this haunting elephant in the room which suggests that maybe there’s something going on that we don’t understand,” Speake says. “If the measurements are right, then it could be the greatest discovery since Newton.”</p>



<p>Like so many science presentations in the time of COVID-19, Schlamminger’s reveal was set to be virtual. Presumably other physicists and science reporters around the world were, like me, hunched over screens waiting to see what the secret number would tell us about G.</p>



<p>The time had come to tear open the envelope. But the video feed stopped. The big reveal had been canceled. Puzzling discrepancies in the measurements meant the numbers could not be trusted. The envelope would remain sealed for at least another year as Schlamminger went back to the lab to take another shot at one of the most challenging measurements in physics.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is Newton’s gravitational constant?</h4>



<p>Newton’s gravitational constant is a misnomer. Though Isaac Newton developed his theory of gravity in the 17th century, he didn’t think in terms of G. He was primarily interested in how the force moved objects. Apples falling, planets in orbit and the surprisingly squashed shape of the Earth are just a few of the countless phenomena that Newton’s theory explained, all without explicitly mentioning G. The constant, named for Newton two centuries later, was instead wrapped into the masses involved.</p>



<p>We now know that Newton’s theory is only an approximation of Einstein’s more encompassing version of gravity, the general theory of relativity. It took Einstein’s theory to explain the intense gravity of black holes and the warping of space and time. Still, back here on Earth, it’s Newton’s theory of gravity that concerns Schlamminger and others wanting to measure G.</p>



<p>The force of gravity depends on three factors: the masses involved, the distances between the masses and G. While the masses and distances differ depending on whether you’re considering the forces between you and the Earth, for example, or a planet orbiting the sun, G is always the same. Along with the masses of elementary particles, the charge on an electron and the speed of light, G is one of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/units-measure-are-getting-fundamental-upgrade">dozens of constants crucial to science today</a> (<em>SN: 11/12/16, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>G, though, stands out from the rest. It’s one of the oldest recorded constants — only the speed of light was measured earlier. Yet despite hundreds of elegant experiments since British physicist Henry Cavendish first measured it 225 years ago, G remains among the least precisely known of the fundamental constants.</p>



<p>And in a way, our understanding of G has only worsened in recent decades as new, incompatible measurements have come in.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Recent measurements of big G don’t agree</h4>



<p>When Cavendish performed his first measurements of the force of gravity in a lab, he relied on a set of lead spheres. Two of them were hanging at either end of a rod 6 feet (about 2 meters) long, and the whole contraption was dangled from a wire. He then placed larger lead balls nearby and measured the forces between the spheres by tracking how the hanging rod twisted on the wire. Although Cavendish was primarily interested in figuring out the Earth’s density, a little manipulation of his results shows that he effectively measured G for the first time. He got a value about 1 percent higher than today’s generally accepted value.</p>



<p>Many of the modern-day G experiments are refined versions of Cavendish’s setup. That includes the one Schlamminger uses. Instead of lead spheres, Schlamminger’s system has precisely machined copper cylinders. Four 1.2-kilogram cylinders, known as test masses, rest on a disk that hangs from a metallic ribbon. The gravitational attraction between the suspended cylinders and four larger, roughly 11-kilogram copper cylinders nearby causes the disk to rotate on the ribbon. Schlamminger calls the heavy cylinders source masses. He’s also done the experiment with a set of source masses made of sapphire crystal to see if G depends on the materials involved (it shouldn’t). Where Cavendish used a large wooden box to protect his apparatus from stray breezes, Schlamminger relies on a vacuum chamber to eliminate the air almost entirely.</p>



<p>Conceptually, the experiment running at NIST is the same as the one Cavendish used. But modern experiments offer much higher precision.</p>



<p>Cavendish’s experiments returned a value of 6.74 x 10<sup>-11</sup> cubic meters per kilogram-second squared. The number is correct to about one part in 100. These days, the accepted value is 6.67430 x 10<sup>-11</sup> with an uncertainty of about a part in 50,000, which means an error of plus or minus 0.00002 x 10<sup>-11</sup>. Some experiments have reached similar precision by relying on pendulums swinging near heavy masses instead of twisting wires.</p>



<p>But as precision increased, a new problem came along. Measurements over the last 20 years from various groups don’t agree. It’s as if G is slightly different in different places and at different times in a way that experimental error can’t account for. Schlamminger’s apparatus is on loan to NIST from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, or BIPM, in Sèvres, France, where researchers came up with a value of 6.67554 x 10<sup>-11</sup>, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/notorious-big-g-gets-little-larger">clear deviance from the accepted value</a> (<em>SN Online: 9/12/13</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The original G test</h3>



<p>Many modern tests of G are based on Henry Cavendish’s original torsion balance design (shown), developed more than two centuries ago. Cavendish hung two small lead spheres at either end of a long rod that was also hanging from a wire. He placed larger lead spheres nearby (inset). How the hanging rod twisted on its wire revealed the force of attraction between the smaller and larger lead spheres. Instead of lead spheres, an ongoing experiment at NIST uses copper cylinders.</p>

<p>The most likely reason for the discrepancies is that there’s something about each experimental system that’s unique. Researchers are keen to track down these sorts of systematic errors. But measuring gravity is tough, both because it’s the weakest of the fundamental forces (gravity is so weak that some modern experiments use tons of material to home in on G) and because everything with mass has gravity. There’s no way to shield the experiments from other sources of gravity, so researchers must attempt to account for the outside influences.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the discrepancies in G could have something to do with where the experiments are taking place. Perhaps the value of G in Sèvres really is 0.04 percent higher than the value of G recently measured in Boulder, Colo., for example. None of the experts contacted for this story think that’s a likely scenario. But in borrowing the BIPM gravity experiment and moving it to NIST’s campus in Maryland, Schlamminger’s efforts should help confirm that G doesn’t vary from place to place. That’s assuming he can work out whatever threw a wrench in his April 2022 reveal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why do we care about the precision of big G?</h4>



<p>Why do scientists need to measure G to perpetually higher precision anyway?</p>



<p>According to some experts, they don’t. “From a practical point of view, there isn’t a huge benefit to be derived from knowing G better,” says physicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville. Other constants, like the charge on an electron and the speed of light, “play a huge role in all kinds of important technology, whereas G doesn’t, because gravity is so darn weak,” Will says. “By the time gravity matters, on scales ranging from planets to the universe, what matters is G times mass.”</p>



<p>Physicist Claudia de Rham of Imperial College London has a different view. “G governs the strength of the gravitational force. In Newtonian gravity, it tells us how two massive bodies are gravitationally attracted to one another, but in Einstein’s theory of general relativity, this constant communicates how anything in our universe curves the fabric of spacetime.” Getting a better handle on G, she says, might help explain why gravity is so much weaker than electromagnetic forces or the strong nuclear force, which holds the parts of atoms together.</p>



<p>Although general relativity has proved to be one of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">most successful and revolutionary theories in history</a>, de Rham points out that its description of gravity may not be complete (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 16</em>). “Testing G to higher precision allows us to understand how constant and universal G really is and if there couldn’t be something else beyond Einstein’s theory of general relativity,” de Rham says.</p>



<p>Some researchers speculate that precise measures of G might one day help uncover the solution to one of the deepest mysteries in science: Why doesn’t gravity fit in with quantum physics? The standard model of particle physics is a quantum theory that describes just about everything in the universe, except gravity. Understanding G better, de Rham says, might lead to a quantum version of gravity, which is necessary to blend gravity into the standard model. Such a “theory of everything” has been a dream of physicists since at least Einstein.</p>



<p>For Schlamminger, the motivation is multi­faceted. “It’s mostly pure curiosity. And right now, there’s salt in the wounds that the agreement [between experimental groups] is so bad.” The thrill of pushing an extraordinarily difficult experiment just a bit further drives him too. “Why do people climb Mount Everest?” Schlamminger says. “Because it’s there.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other approaches to measuring big G</h4>



<p>One perennial challenge with Cavendish-style experiments is the wires. To interpret what’s going on with G, researchers have to know how the suspending wires respond to twisting or swaying, and how they change as they age.</p>



<p>Some researchers choose to do away with the pesky wires altogether, instead dropping or tossing things to see how they respond to the pull of nearby masses. The most precise versions of those experiments so far toss supercooled clouds of atoms up in a tower and then allow them to fall back down again. By doing the tossing with various configurations of heavy objects nearby, researchers can see how the gravitational force exerted by those objects affects the atoms’ trajectories. So far, the experiments have come up short of the most precise suspended-mass experiments by a factor of around 10, achieving a precision of one part in 5,000.</p>



<p>A recent experiment designed with other purposes in mind also dispensed with wires. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA, Pathfinder mission was a proof-of-principle test for a different type of gravity experiment. It was designed to show that it’s possible to precisely measure the distance between objects in space — key to building a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/lisa-pathfinder-pave-way-gravitational-wave-detection">space-based gravitational wave detector</a> (<em>SN Online 12/3/15</em>).</p>



<p>LISA Pathfinder managed to measure the distance between objects well enough to find G to within about one part in 15. That’s crude compared with Cavendish’s precision of one in 100, and much worse than other modern measurements. But it shows that an experiment in space, free of the complication of wires and nearby massive objects like the Earth, has potential to measure G in an entirely new way.</p>

This proof of concept suggests G can be measured without the interference of Earth’s gravity.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129750">ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another shortcoming of Cavendish-like experiments is that they measure forces between objects that are either moving slowly or standing completely still. These experiments can’t say much about whether G stays constant when things are moving quickly.</p>



<p>In experiments deep inside a mountain in Switzerland, mechanical engineering researcher Jürg Dual of ETH Zurich is replacing static masses with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-strength-big-g-newton-gravitational-constant">vibrating beams or rods rotating</a> like helicopter blades (<em>SN Online: 7/11/22</em>). The motions result in changes in distance between the moving parts and a beam that acts as a detector, which in turn changes the gravitational forces the detector beam feels. The detector beam vibrates like a tuning fork, and the size of those vibrations offers a measure of G.</p>



<p>Unlike conventional experiments, this one could detect whether G depends on motion, which “might be something quite spectacular actually,” Dual says. As for how likely that is, “I’m completely open,” he says.</p>



<p>For now, though, Schlamminger and others using hanging masses much as Cavendish did 225 years ago are still providing the most precise measurements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There’s no clear answer yet</h4>



<p>Schlamminger’s lab on the NIST campus is well below his office. “It’s about four stories underground,” he says. “There is less vibration, it’s easier to stabilize the temperature and the lab floor does not tilt as much. Usually buildings tilt with varying wind load. That is not a problem underground.”</p>



<p>On my visit to NIST a month after the canceled reveal, we head down several flights of stairs and take a walk through a vacant hall before entering a room that has a sticky mat just inside. It’s there to clean dust from your shoes as you go in. Even so, Schlamminger switches to a dedicated pair of shoes he stashes in the lab and gives me covers to slip over the soles of my shoes. Then we pass through another, airtight door to see the gravity experiment on loan to NIST. Things must be tidy when you’re trying to do something as difficult as measuring G.</p>



<p>Dust interfering with the tips of measurement probes could throw off readings of the positions of the cylinders. “A second concern, albeit smaller,” Schlamminger says, “is that dust settling on the source masses will change their mass.”</p>



<p>The G experiment is smaller than Cavendish’s pioneering design. You could fit it on a modest dining table. Here, it sits on a massive slab that minimizes the vibrations that manage to make it down to the lab. The vacuum chamber hides some of the moving parts of the apparatus from view.</p>



<p>Schlamminger is between runs at the moment, but four copper source masses, each about the diameter of a 2-liter soda bottle, are at the ready for the next G measurement. The source masses ride on a carousel outside the vacuum chamber, while the test masses sit on the disk suspended inside the chamber.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="636" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1.jpg" alt="A photo of lab equipment from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to study the gravitational constant." class="wp-image-3129746" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-620x383.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-729x450.jpg 729w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-301x186.jpg 301w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-768x474.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-939x580.jpg 939w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129746">In a lab at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, scientists are using an updated version (shown) of a centuries-old experiment to try to determine the precise value of Newton’s gravitational constant.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129746">JENNIFER LAUREN LEE/NIST</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the experimental mode that most closely mimics Cavendish’s experiment, tracking the rotation of the disk as it twists on the suspending ribbon offers a measure of the force between the source and test masses, revealing G. In another mode, Schlamminger determines G by finding the force it takes to prevent the disk from rotating.</p>



<p>A set of sapphire crystal source masses that are the same size as the copper ones are in a case nearby. They can take the place of the copper ones on the carousel to confirm that G is a true constant that doesn’t depend on the materials involved. At roughly twice the mass of the sapphire cylinders, the copper versions provide a better measure of G. Precisely how much each of the source masses weigh, though, Schlamminger doesn’t know. That’s because of the secret number tucked away in the sealed envelope.</p>



<p>“The big M, which is the masses of my big copper masses,” he says, “I have basically asked this mass group at NIST who has measured them to add a random factor.” Any studies he makes of G will be slightly off due to the random factor added to the true masses. Just how far off the measurement is won’t be clear until he opens the envelope. So why didn’t he open it in April 2022?</p>



<p>“I measured big G for like three months solid,” Schlamminger says, before popping open the vacuum chamber to check the placement of the cylinders. “Then I did another big G run, and the number was different. And that’s why I did not open the envelope, because I figured there’s something that I don’t understand.”</p>



<p>It turns out he had prerecorded his talk and expected to reveal the answer in real time at the meeting. He changed his mind before the presentation streamed, which is why the audience was left wondering.</p>



<p>There are hints that changes in the quality of the vacuum that come with opening and closing the experimental chamber are related to the measurement shifts. It’s another factor that Schlamminger says researchers will have to keep in mind if they’re to understand the discrepancies in measurements of Newton’s gravitational constant. </p>



<p>These days, Schlamminger is back at it with <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/B14.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another experimental run</a>. But one year on, at the 2023 American Physical Society meeting in Minneapolis, he still wasn’t ready to open the envelope. “I’m very, very careful with it because you can’t unopen the envelope.”</p>

<p>The editor in chief of a Wiley journal has resigned, saying the publisher recently has “seemed to emphasize cost-cutting and margins over good editorial practice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the journal’s associate editors are in the midst of a work stoppage protesting the same issues. After Wiley responded to the associate editors in a way they found “troubling,” the editors <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/07/14/betterpublishing-jbiogeography-i/">replied</a> with a list of 12 demands, and a deputy editor in chief tendered her resignation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Editorial boards of at least three other journals have recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/editors-of-public-health-journal-resign-over-differences-with-publisher/">resigned</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/26/editors-in-chief-of-aging-journal-resign-en-masse-after-impasse-with-the-anatomical-society-and-wiley/">en masse</a>, or <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/second-elsevier-journal-board-threatens-mass-resignations">threatened to resign</a>, amid similar disputes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MNDlab/status/1671563509593939968">Michael Dawson</a>, editor in chief of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652699"><em>Journal of Biogeography</em></a>, published a <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/06/21/chiefeditor-resign-jbiogeography/">blog post</a> announcing his resignation on June 21. In it, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127548"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is becoming increasingly hard to stave off the undesirable consequences of the primary motivations of the the for-profit scientific publishing industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He listed several concerns from his resignation letter, including proposed growth targets, equity issues in adopting an open access model in which authors pay fees to publish their work, and compensation for the editors. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In trying to initiate discussions with Wiley about these issues, and being rebuffed multiple times, I came to the conclusion that the opportunities for improvement at the journal that appeared available until late-2022, had receded. What Wiley has failed to understand is that our interests are their interests. These issues seemed symptomatic of larger problems with the for-profit scientific publishing industry. I concluded I could do more by leaving than by staying.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In mid-October of 2022, Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">paused</a> the publication of special issues for Hindawi, the open access publisher it acquired in 2021, because of quality issues. The pause ended in January and cost the company $9 million in lost revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">About a week after Dawson’s resignation, another <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/06/29/associateeditors-workstoppage-jbiogeography/">blog post</a> announced the work stoppage by about 85% of the journal’s associate editors, citing “an unresolved dispute” with Wiley. The editors said they would continue to work on manuscripts under review or being revised, but would not take on work for new submissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors’ letter to Wiley, reproduced in the blog post, detailed three issues that triggered their protest: opposition to switching the journal to a full open access model, a proposed increase to the journal’s output, and automatic referral of rejected manuscripts to other Wiley journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They proposed a deadline of July 31 to reach a compromise with the publisher, and indicated they would be willing to resume working or resign their positions, depending on the outcome. The editors’ letter to Wiley concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please note that as Associate Editors, we work without any remuneration or compensation, and our ultimate goal is to advance the field of biogeography by supporting high-quality, peer-reviewed, cutting-edge research. The Journal of Biogeography has a proud history as a thought leader in our discipline, and we are firmly against any development of a business model that maximises profit but places in jeopardy the academic quality of the Journal of Biogeography.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The same day as the associate editors announced their work stoppage in the blog post, Ceridwen Fraser, a deputy editor in chief, tweeted that she had resigned over Wiley’s response to the editors’ concerns:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have also just tendered my resignation (with 6mo notice) as Deputy Editor in Chief of the Journal of Biogeography, following a response letter from Wiley to the AEs. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BetterPublishing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BetterPublishing</a> <br><br>As I state in my resignation letter: <a href="https://t.co/XyKR8dgjCE">pic.twitter.com/XyKR8dgjCE</a></p>&mdash; Ceridwen Fraser (@CeridwenFraser) <a href="https://twitter.com/CeridwenFraser/status/1674533366727843840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Fraser told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My resignation was spurred after a year or so of back-and-forth with Wiley over their efforts to increase revenue – without increasing investment and at the cost of the quality and equity of what our journal publishes.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one of those emails, Fraser wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is disheartening to feel that our efforts are sometimes not fully appreciated by Wiley, when we all certainly put in more time than we are compensated for, and do it for the greater good of science communication – it seems that Wiley’s focus is increasingly on profit over quality / equity. I read some of Wiley’s recent shareholder reports and they were very depressing, lauding monstrous revenues while reassuring shareholders that all efforts are being made to further increase profits and reduce costs through trimming manpower and services, and growing outputs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another email, she wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The response letter shows that Wiley is remaining defensive and non-transparent on a number of issues. For example, we have had a quite strong indication in meetings with you and others from Wiley that the intention has been to shift more towards OA funded by APC or transformational agreements – and in those discussions, we asked lots of questions about equity issues related to OA that were not well answered – yet this letter makes it sound like our concerns about that have come from nowhere. Furthermore, the letter does not reference our concerns about exploitation of authors (inexplicably high OA charges that don’t seem to relate to the level of service provided), reviewers (no recompense), Associate Editors (no recompense), or even senior editors (honoraria that do not fully match the time investment or expertise required) by a company that continues to make impressive profits from our labour.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The associate editors replied to Wiley in a <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/07/14/betterpublishing-jbiogeography-i/">blog post</a> last week that disputed claims the editors said the publisher made in its response, such as there being no plans to make the journal fully open access, and that Wiley greatly values the work of the associate editors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors listed 12 “actions needed to resolve the current dispute.” These points included reducing the journal’s open access fees and offering waivers for authors who cannot afford to pay, increased investment from Wiley in the journal and biogeography research community, reversing cuts to editors’ honoraria and rewards, and removing nondisclosure clauses from editorial contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The blog post concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It will be particularly important for Wiley to show its re-investment in the journal, in the biogeography community, and in the future; to demonstrate that Wiley actually does respect editors, reinvest in the journal, and is committed to equitable access. All of which is currently unapparent. Such will reassure the community that JBI (and Wiley in general) is a reliable partner for our work and service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson sent us the following comment:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We were disappointed to receive the work stoppage notice for the Journal of Biogeography and that our response did not fully mitigate the editors’ concerns. We appreciate the concerns shared by members of the editorial team and acknowledge that there are not always perfect solutions. We thank all of the editors for their work and are looking at ways to better invest in the journal and the communities it serves. We are working on plans for the future of the journal and our priority is to continue delivering research that serves the biogeography community.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">What’s causing this summer’s extreme heat waves?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dog days of summer are upon us. Brutal heat waves are roasting regions around the globe, smashing records with unrelenting severity.</p>



<p>In the southwest United States and northern Mexico, devastating heat has been scorching the region for weeks. For 19 straight days and counting, temperatures in Phoenix have reached above 43.3° Celsius (110° Fahrenheit), surpassing a record streak from 1974. The Texas city of El Paso has endured an unprecedented 33 consecutive days of temperatures reaching over 37.8° C (100° F), and that streak is only expected to continue. And just after midnight on July 17, Death Valley, Calif., may have sweltered under the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere for that time: 48.9° C (120° F).</p>





<p>China has also been enduring extreme heat for weeks. On July 16, the township of Sanbao broke not only the national record with a temperature of 52.2° C (126° F), but also the record for highest temperature above 40˚ N latitude. Meanwhile, southern Europe is in its second heat wave in a week, with Rome recording a new all-time high of 42.9° C (109.2° F) on July 18 while a town in Catalonia, Spain set a new record for the region, 45.3° C (113.5° F).</p>



<p>What’s concocting these bouts of extreme heat? It’s partly because the world has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">exceptionally warm</a> this year, thanks to the compounding of human-caused climate change with a natural climate phenomenon called El Niño, whose influence is known to temporarily warm our planet (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>).</p>



<p>But it’s not just that Earth’s a hotter stovetop; the cooks have been busy. The jet streams, powerful ribbons of wind that control much of the planet’s weather, have been meandering and getting stuck, holding bulges of hot air over many parts of the Earth. While that’s not unusual, some scientists have suggested that climate change may be altering the dynamics of the consequential winds.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we know about how climate change is impacting extreme heat and how these potentially dangerous events occur.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Extreme heat waves are becoming more likely</h4>



<p>Let’s start with that hot stovetop. Humans have been warming the planet for decades by emitting climate-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That’s made extreme heat waves more common, many researchers say.</p>



<p>Since 2004, scientists have conducted <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attribution studies</a> to estimate how much climate change may have influenced the probability and severity of a specific bout of extreme weather. These studies essentially simulate the world with and without climate change to compare how often certain types of extreme weather events occur.</p>



<p>The work of the <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Weather Attribution initiative</a> has repeatedly indicated that climate change has made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-storms-deadly-africa-early-2022">extreme weather</a> events like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">heat waves</a> more likely and more severe (<em>SN: 4/11/22</em>; <em>SN: 7/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>A May report concluded that an <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-humid-heat-in-south-asia-in-april-2023-largely-driven-by-climate-change-detrimental-to-vulnerable-and-disadvantaged-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April heat wave in South Asia</a> — during which locations in Thailand and Laos set new national temperature records of 45.4° C and 42.9° C, respectively — was made at least 30 times more likely due to climate change.</p>



<p>Another study suggested that a different heat wave in northern Africa and southwestern Europe, which subjected some areas to temperatures <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-april-heat-in-spain-portugal-morocco-algeria-almost-impossible-without-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 degrees C higher than is normal</a> in April, was at least 100 times more likely due to climate change.</p>





<p>Climate change is pushing heat waves in general to have higher temperatures, but it’s having a particularly strong impact on the frequency of the most extreme events, says atmospheric scientist Noboru Nakamura of the University of Chicago.</p>



<p>“What used to be once every 1,000 years might now occur every 20 years,” he says. “It’s still a rare event, but … you can actually feel that in our daily lives.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How heat waves form</h4>



<p>What’s actually whipping up these summer scorchers, and why are only certain regions getting roasted?</p>



<p>The answer lies roughly 8 to 14 kilometers high in the sky. There, the jet streams flow at about 177 kilometers per hour on average, though they can reach speeds of more than 400 kilometers per hour — faster than a Shinkansen bullet train.</p>



<p>These powerful winds control much of Earth’s weather by transporting high- and low-pressure systems around the world.</p>



<p>Jet streams develop where large masses of air with different temperatures meet, flowing faster where the temperature contrast is stronger. When jet streams are blowing strong, they tend to orient themselves more parallel to the equator, says atmospheric scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Mass. “But when those winds get weaker … then we tend to see the jet stream take these bigger meanders.”</p>



<p>When the jet stream meanders, it forms broad waves, with crests and troughs that reach north and south for hundreds of kilometers. Jet streams in the northern and southern hemispheres typically undulate more during their respective summers. Due to Earth’s axial tilt, polar regions receive more warming sunlight during their summers, weakening their temperature contrast with the tropics. As the waves become amplified, high- and low-pressure systems in the crests and troughs encroach farther north and south. Sometimes these pressure systems become stuck over one spot for days to weeks, causing weather to persist over a region.</p>



<p>When a high-pressure system gets stuck over an area, it pushes air down toward the surface, compressing and warming the air. The high pressure also pushes clouds away, clearing the sky for the hot sun to beat down unabated. These factors compound to produce a heat dome, a phenomenon that scorches and often dries landscapes.</p>

<p>An exception is when heat domes form by coastlines — such as the one that has formed by the U.S. Gulf Coast. Since warmer air can carry more moisture, heat domes near the ocean can make for weather that is both hot and humid, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">potentially lethal combination</a> for humans (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>It’s a bit of a mystery why pressure systems become stuck, Nakamura says, making the phenomenon difficult to predict. It may occur when jet streams become especially wavy, he and a colleague reported in 2018 in <em>Science</em>. The waves may get stuck like cars in a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat0721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traffic jam</a>, causing weather to idle in place.</p>



<p>But this explanation is a theoretical one, and more evidence is needed to validate it, Nakamura says. Until then, he says, the underlying mechanics of those jams will remain elusive.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The jet streams’ uncertain future</h4>



<p>A related, but similarly unresolved, problem is how climate change may affect the dance of the jet streams in the future. In 2012, Francis and a colleague proposed climate change could <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make the powerful winds more wobbly</a>.</p>



<p>“The Arctic is warming about four times faster than the globe as a whole,” Francis says. “That means that the north-south temperature difference has been getting weaker and weaker.” As a result, jet streams may be becoming more unstable, she says, and more prone to meandering.</p>



<p>But that’s still “a very hotly contested hypothesis,” Nakamura says, pointing out that some climate simulations have suggested that in the Northern Hemisphere, the jet stream may actually become less wavy. “There is not a widely accepted consensus on this,” Nakamura says.</p>



<p>Even if the fate of the jet streams remains up in the air, one thing seems clear: Extreme heat waves aren’t going anywhere.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/open-science-is-better-science/">Open Science is better science</a></h4>

              
                <p>At the heart of the Open Science movement is the conviction that <strong><em>Open Science is better science</em></strong>. More rigorous. More inclusive. More efficient. More trustworthy. More reproducible. And more impactful for society.</p>



<p>The different aspects of Open Science practice&mdash;from open methods and data, to preprints, to ORCID and CRediT, to published peer review&mdash;are all part of a mutually reinforcing cycle. Each component works in tandem, and as adoption rises the benefits increase, spiraling ever outward, reshaping our research system and, ultimately, producing <strong><em>better science</em></strong>.</p>



<p>At PLOS, our mission is to lead that transformation. We believe we can best accomplish that by empowering researchers to engage in fundamental Open Science practices on a large scale, by:</p>



<ol><li>Offering Open Science options that serve researchers&rsquo; goals and priorities, as well as those of the public, and</li><li>Removing barriers and expanding access to Open Science to all researchers.</li></ol>



<p>So far, it has worked. PLOS helped to demonstrate the feasibility of Open Access journals beginning in 2003 with <em>PLOS Biology</em>, and put Open Access within reach for more researchers than ever before with <em>PLOS ONE</em> in 2009. Our pioneering 2014 data availability policy has reset the standards for data sharing industry-wide. Our streamlined and collaborative approach to preprints reduces the administrative burden on researchers, normalizes early sharing, and increases access to new science.</p>



<p>This work continues today, through key projects designed to better understand researcher needs, incentivize Open behaviors to improve research quality and reliability, and increase access to Open publishing options. Read on for a short summary of some of our current efforts.</p>



<h2>Open Science Indicators (OSIs)</h2>



<p>In order to increase the prevalence of Open Science practices, we need to be able to reliably measure Open Science practices. Until recently, there was no easy way to do so, other than having an expert review and assess individual articles. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-indicators-update-q1-2023/">Open Science Indicators (OSIs)</a> use Natural Language Processing to identify and quantify Open Science behaviors in the published literature, and to compare rates of generation and adoption across discipline, region, and other factors. This enables PLOS to better understand and meet researcher needs; by making the dataset publicly available, we hope to support efforts outside PLOS as well. Currently, the OSI dataset includes data sharing, code sharing and preprints. We aim to include additional indicators in the future.</p>



<h2>Accessible Data</h2>



<p>Readers rely on raw scientific data for understanding, verification, replication and reanalysis, and to inform future investigations, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. But researchers can only access and use data if they are aware it exists. PLOS&rsquo; Accessible Data feature is an experimental functionality which increases the visibility of data posted in select public repositories on PLOS article pages. By highlighting publicly available data in this way, we hope to facilitate access and reuse, save readers time searching for public data online, and learn from user behavior. After a successful first year, the Accessible Data functionality was recently expanded from the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">original three servers</a> to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">nine.</a></p>



<h2>Moving beyond APCs</h2>



<p>Article Processing Charges (APCs) have demonstrated that Open Access is viable, and allowed Open publishing to become a force in our industry. But APCs are also exclusionary and inequitable; burdensome for authors and time consuming for publishers to administer; and tend to create incentives that privilege volume over other considerations. At PLOS, we&rsquo;re moving beyond APCs to new funding models that distribute the costs of publication more fairly and reduce expenses for everyone involved, including <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">institutional agreements</a>. To date, we&rsquo;ve partnered with over 280 universities, libraries, and other institutions in 28 countries to help bring Open Science within reach for all.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We hope you&rsquo;ll join us in this important work in whatever ways make sense for you. When serving on search and tenure committees, consider candidates&rsquo; Open contributions alongside other qualifications. When communicating your own research, share as much as possible as early as you can within ethical boundaries. Choose mission-driven, Open Access publication venues when you have the opportunity. Let your institutions and funders know that you support APC-alternative funding. Together, we can reshape the scientific research system to serve <em>all </em>researchers, and produce the highest quality research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/granite-moon-surface-volcanism">Granite likely lurks beneath the moon’s surface</a></h4>

              
                <p>Watch out Yosemite — the moon has its own impressive rock display.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06183-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enormous chunk of granite</a>, measuring roughly 50 kilometers wide, may be buried beneath the lunar surface, researchers reported July 5 in <em>Nature</em>. Finding such a behemoth, by far the largest granite structure spotted beyond Earth, is a surprise given that forming this type of rock typically requires plate tectonics or abundant water.</p>



<p>When Apollo astronauts landed on the moon in the 1960s and 1970s, they encountered vistas dominated by basalt. The igneous rock is run-of-the-mill stuff on both the moon and our planet, says Matthew Siegler, a planetary scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson. “Everything starts as basalt.”</p>





<p>But over time, with enough heat and pressure, basalt can melt and morph into more durable granite. Plate tectonics and water, both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">mainstays on Earth</a>, often help facilitate that transformation: Tectonic forces can help drag rocks down deep, where it’s hotter, and water, acting like a salt, helps rocks melt at lower temperatures (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>Because the moon has no plate tectonics and very little water, finding copious amounts of granite there would be unexpected, Siegler says. Indeed, out of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">roughly 380 kilograms of moon rocks</a> (about the heft of a large bear) brought back to Earth by Apollo astronauts, just a handful of millimeter-sized pieces are granite (<em>SN: 7/15/19</em>). “That’s our whole inventory,” Siegler says.</p>



<p>But Siegler and his colleagues now have strong evidence that a massive piece of granite might be lurking under the moon’s surface. The team analyzed microwave data collected from the farside of the moon by China’s Chang’e-1 and Chang’e-2 lunar orbiters and discovered a geothermal hotspot roughly 9 degrees Celsius warmer than expected. Elevated temperatures are often an indicator of granite, Siegler says, because uranium and thorium — radioactive elements that decay over time and release heat — tend to aggregate within the rock. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To estimate how large a piece of granite could be lying beneath the region, known as the Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex, the researchers ran computer simulations of different sizes of granite buried at different depths. The team concluded that an ellipsoidal hunk of granite roughly 50 kilometers wide and 25 kilometers tall capped by a smaller ellipsoid of granite, all buried four kilometers below the lunar surface, best explained the Chang’e-1 and Chang’e-2 observations.</p>



<p>The big question is how such an edifice formed. One idea that Siegler and his colleagues propose is that a mantle plume — a column of molten rock — once persisted under the Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex. That plume would have turned some of the region’s basalt into granite.</p>



<p>On Earth, mantle plumes famously combine with tectonic plate movement <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-volcanoes-share-split-personality">to create island chains like Hawaii</a>, Siegler says (<em>SN: 9/19/11</em>). But on the moon, where there is no plate tectonics, a mantle plume would just continuously heat one region, he says. “You get a single spot of the crust that keeps getting roasted.”</p>



<p>This is an intriguing discovery that should be followed up with a lunar mission, says Brad Jolliff, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved with the new study. “It’s ripe for a robotic mission that has a small rover that can test some of these properties up close.”</p>



<p>In the next few years, scientists plan to do just that. NASA’s Lunar Vulkan Imaging and Spectroscopy Explorer mission, or Lunar-VISE, which is slated to launch by 2027, will land on the summit of one of the <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/482/a-lunar-mystery-the-gruithuisen-domes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gruithuisen domes</a>. Located on the moon’s nearside, these volcanic features are believed to also contain granite. Lunar-VISE will be able to take a closeup look at the region’s chemical composition, says the mission’s principal investigator Kerri Donaldson Hanna, a planetary geologist at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.</p>



<p>That’s important because it’s often difficult to capture small details from orbit. Landers like Lunar-VISE can shed light on the moon’s geology, says Donaldson Hanna. “We need new observations.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milking-umbilical-cord-help-sick-newborns">‘Milking’ umbilical cords may help some sickly newborns</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giving birth to a child who is unresponsive or struggling to breathe is a harrowing experience. The medical team must quickly cut the umbilical cord and then rush the baby to aid. But taking a few seconds to squeeze blood from the cord into an infant’s abdomen before cutting the cord could help with the infant’s recovery, two recent studies suggest.</p>



<p>The practice, known as umbilical cord milking, is relatively unknown and not without some controversy. But if its promise holds up, it may help protect some of the most at-risk newborns, researchers say.</p>





<p>During fetal development, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/public-private-cord-blood-banks-caveats">the umbilical cord</a> brings nutrients from the placenta, which also serves as a reservoir for blood, iron and stem cells (<em>SN: 4/4/18</em>). At birth, the infant is still connected to this reservoir, and the <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2020/12/delayed-umbilical-cord-clamping-after-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard recommendation</a> is to wait at least 30 seconds to a minute before clipping that connection, allowing the baby to take in more of those essential nutrients.</p>



<p>Some studies suggest that for healthy babies, delayed cord clamping can improve some aspects of health, such as iron levels or fine motor skills, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6544813/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for months</a> or <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2296145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even years</a>.</p>



<p>For babies born with urgent health problems, however, there’s no time to wait. In these cases, quickly milking the cord might provide similar benefits as delayed cord clamping. But the jury is still out on if or when to use the technique. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, said that there is “insufficient evidence to support or refute umbilical cord milking” in its 2020 <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2020/12/delayed-umbilical-cord-clamping-after-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidelines</a>, which the group reaffirmed earlier this year.</p>



<p>In one of the new studies, researchers randomly assigned 10 medical centers in three countries to one of two groups. If an infant was born limp, with difficulty breathing or bluish skin, the cord was immediately clamped and cut in one group. In the other, the umbilical cord was milked four times before being cut. The hospitals then switched practices halfway through the study.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937822006494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzing outcomes for over 1,700 infants</a>, researchers found that babies who had had their umbilical cords milked were less likely to need extra oxygen or other breathing assistance. The newborns were also less likely to suffer from a brain injury called hypoxic encephalopathy that’s caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain before or shortly after birth, the team reported in the February <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>.</p>



<p>In a follow-up analysis of <a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(23)00179-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood flow in over 200 of the infants</a>, published in the June <em>Journal of Pediatrics</em>, the researchers found that these improved outcomes were probably due in part to increased blood volume and blood flow to the heart, lungs and brain in the infants who received the cord milking. These newborns also had slightly higher levels of hemoglobin, the protein which carries oxygen in human blood, than babies whose cords were quickly cut.</p>



<p>“We saw dramatic differences in the babies that have this extra blood,” says Anup Katheria, a neonatologist at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women &amp; Newborns in San Diego.</p>



<p>The new research adds key evidence in favor of umbilical cord milking, says Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in England who has collaborated with Katheria but wasn&#8217;t involved in the two studies. The findings offer important assurance to obstetricians who might be hesitant to adopt the practice, she says. “It should really be getting into standard of care.”</p>



<p>The intervention is quick, simple and does not require equipment, meaning it might be readily adopted in places with limited medical resources.</p>



<p>But the practice could harm some infants’ health. Another study lead by Katheria ended early in 2019 after it found that umbilical cord milking increased the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2755614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likelihood of brain bleeding</a> in very preterm infants, those born at less than 32 weeks of pregnancy.</p>





<p>Based on the recent studies, umbilical cord milking “shows promise” in infants born in poor health at or near term, says Sarah McDonald, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the studies. But more research is needed before the practice is recommended for use, even in emergency situations. And for most infants, she and Katheria agree, delayed cord clamping will likely remain the best course of action.</p>

<p>An engineering researcher has stepped down from an editorial board at the request of a journal’s leadership following a sleuth’s comment on a Retraction Watch post linking him to paper mill activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://research.iaun.ac.ir/pd/afrand/">Masoud Afrand</a>, an assistant professor of engineering at the Islamic Azad University in Iran, was, until recently, on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-analysis-with-boundary-elements/about/editorial-board">editorial board</a> of the journal <em>Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements</em>. He also was listed on the website of <em>Scientific Reports</em> as a member of the journal’s editorial board in the subject of mechanical engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He now has neither position. He has not responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127540"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">our original story</a> with Undark, Alexander Magazinov, a scientific sleuth and software engineer based in Kazakhstan, said Afrand “was likely part of a paper mill operation for a special issue in <em>Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences</em>, where Afrand was cited over 130 times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov had cited Afrand’s association with <em>Scientific Reports</em> as an example of researchers seemingly associated with paper mills attaining editorial roles with reputable journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following our reporting, <em>Scientific Reports</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/">removed Afrand</a> from the webpage with its editorial board members. Rafal Marszalek, its chief editor, told us that the journal had “parted ways” with Afrand in March 2022, after an internal audit uncovered “irregularities” in how he handled papers. Afrand had still been listed on the webpage “due to an oversight,” and the journal updated the page after our story brought attention to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#:~:text=July%2012%2C%202023%20at%201%3A22%20am">comment</a> on our post about <em>Scientific Reports</em>’s move, Magazinov elaborated on the suspicious citation activity he’d found in the special issue that had cited Afrand extensively, calling it “a pattern of a citation farm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#comment-2174179">separate comment</a>, he asked, “Why Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements hired Afrand as editor in March 2023?”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Earlier this week, Alexander Cheng, the editor in chief of <em>Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements</em>,” responded with a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#comment-2175490">comment</a> on the post, stating the journal had asked Afrand to resign due to the “serious accusation” of “unethical publication conduct.” The researcher “kindly agreed,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cheng’s comment elaborated on the findings of the journal’s investigation into Afrand’s citations and the work he did as a guest editor for a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-analysis-with-boundary-elements/special-issue/10QV09LJ40D">special issue</a> of the journal. “Scanning the first 10 papers” of the 56 in the special issue uncovered a “not out of the ordinary” number of citations of Afrand’s papers, Cheng said. Cheng also said he had monitored Afrand’s editorial work and “did not find any irregularities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cheng continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In conclusion, concerning Afrand’s editorial work for EABE, the special issue was not an effective way for him to boost his citations, particularly in view of his very high citation record. His editorial conduct has been honorable, and I find no fault in it. The journal regrets that due to the bad publicity, justified or unjustified, we have asked Afrand to step down. He gracefully agreed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Cheng confirmed he had submitted the comment, and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As these are serious accusations and can destroy careers, we need to be careful in delivering the punishment to whom is due. I am neutral in the process. I only comment on the journal&#8217;s relation with Afrand.</p>

Others had received even more citations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rain-electrons-mercury-xray-auroras">A rain of electrons causes Mercury’s X-ray auroras</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mercury’s auroras are perfectly in character. While temperate Earth gets heavenly light shows over its poles, hellish Mercury gets invisible ribbons of X-ray radiation that cling to its sun-blasted surface.</p>



<p>But as alien as they may appear, Mercury’s X-ray auroras have a lot in common with Earth’s polar lights, and with auroras throughout the solar system.</p>



<p>Scientists have now directly shown that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39565-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fluctuations in Mercury’s magnetic field can fling electrons toward the planet</a>, where they eventually rain down and cause auroras of X-ray light. This process, called electron precipitation, now appears to be practically universal in the solar system: It causes auroras on every planet with a global magnetic field except Neptune, researchers report July 18 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Even Mars, which has only localized magnetic fields, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-aurora-high-altitude-dust-clouds-surprise-scientists">auroras caused by raining electrons</a> (<em>SN: 3/19/15</em>).</p>





<p>For Mercury, “this is really the first time to detect these electrons directly,” says space plasma physicist Sae Aizawa of the University of Pisa in Italy.</p>



<p>Electron precipitation usually happens because of interactions between planets’ magnetic fields and the solar wind — a stream of charged particles spewed from the sun’s upper atmosphere.</p>



<p>Buffeted by the solar wind, the sun-facing side of a planet’s magnetic field gets squished while the night side is swept out into a long “magnetotail” that extends behind the planet. Eventually, the magnetotail stretches so much that its formerly mostly-parallel magnetic field lines snap and reconnect, sending some field lines flying off behind the planet and others back toward it.<s></s></p>

<p>“The magnetic field lines sort of break and form new ones,” says space physicist Ryan Dewey of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved in the study. “And in that process, a lot of energy is released.”</p>



<p>All that energy sends packets of electrons flying planetward, spiraling in corkscrew-like trajectories along magnetic field lines. When these electrons hit the planet or its atmosphere, they release energy as light.</p>



<p>The light’s wavelength depends on what the electrons encounter as they rain down. Earth’s auroras shine in visible wavelengths because incoming electrons excite molecules of uncharged gases in the atmosphere like oxygen and nitrogen, which release visible light when they relax back to their normal states. Mercury’s auroras shine in X-ray wavelengths because electrons decelerate as they smack the planet’s rocky surface. The lost energy is released as X-rays.</p>



<p>Researchers first spotted <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012JE004118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercurian X-ray auroras</a> in data beamed back from the MESSENGER probe, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/messenger-mission-ends-crash-landing-mercury">orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/15</em>). But while scientists reasoned that electrons must rain down on Mercury to cause its X-ray glow, MESSENGER didn’t have the right instruments to measure the precipitating particles.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s BepiColombo spacecraft does. Analyzing data from the probe’s first flyby of Mercury in 2021, Aizawa and her colleagues spotted telltale signs of the process.</p>



<p>One clue was that as BepiColombo flew through Mercury’s magnetosphere, it observed surges of fast-moving, high-speed electrons followed by several subsequent waves of progressively slower, lower-energy electrons. “This is exactly what we’d describe as a precipitating signature,” says Aizawa, who did the work while at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France.</p>





<p>To Dewey, the new discovery is a tantalizing sneak peek at the discoveries waiting to be made at Mercury once BepiColombo enters orbit in 2025. By then, it will have been a decade since scientists last had a probe continuously orbiting Mercury.</p>



<p>“To me, it&#8217;s very exciting to see just how much we can learn from even just a short pass through the magnetosphere,” he says. “It’s a glimpse.”</p>

<p>Laughter yoga is a type of complementary therapy which promotes deliberate laughter in combination with yoga breathing practices and yoga stretching poses. Intentional laughter can provide benefits equal to those of spontaneous laughter derived from jokes or humor programs, releasing a rush of stress-busting hormones.</p>
<p>In this randomized clinical trial, the authors investigate the effects of laughter yoga on health-related quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The intervention group received laughter yoga for four sessions at one-week intervals. The patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was evaluated using the Quality of Life Questionnaire European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. The study questionnaires were completed before and after the laughter yoga sessions by the cancer patients, through interviews, meanwhile the control group received a self-care training education.</p>
<p>The findings of the study showed that laughter yoga contributed to improvements in emotional and physical functioning, reduction of fatigue, pain and sleep disturbance, and enhanced quality of life compared to the control group. Laughter yoga comes with many advantages as it is an easy, cost-effective, and affordable method that can be also taught to patients so that they can practice this by themselves, increasing their self-care management.</p>

<p>Degenerative meniscal tear (DMT) is common in adults over 35 years of age. Unlike the acute meniscal injury that is associated with acute trauma, DMT often shows up spontaneously and it is usually considered atraumatic. The first management approach for patients with symptomatic DMT, includes exercise, physiotherapy and pain medication.</p>
<p>In this qualitative study, the authors investigated the general practitioners&#8217; (GPs) experiences of managing patients with knee pain attributed to a DMT. Seventeen GPs were recruited in the South and Mid-West of Ireland and data were collected using semi-structured interviews. The findings showed that the GPs sometimes found difficulties in facing patient’s treatment expectations, which are often oriented toward a ‘quick fix’ or passive treatment, such as surgery or injection. Furthermore, some GPs expressed their concerns about the limited access to public physiotherapy and orthopedic services within the Irish healthcare setting.</p>
<p>This study highlights the importance of filling the gap between patients’ expectations and best practice in the management of DMT.

<p><em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito is the primary vector of dengue fever, which is the most widespread vector-borne infectious disease. The state of California has an active mosquito-monitoring program since 1917, although only sporadic specimens of <em>Aedes aegypti</em> were detected for decades near airports. Since 2013, breeding populations have been reported in different cities, indicating that the mosquito has now become established and is spreading throughout large areas of California.</p>
<p>In this study 96 individual adult female <em>Aedes aegypti</em> from 12 geographic districts were collected across southern and central California. The authors integrated whole-genome sequencing data from mosquitoes with 25 annual topo-climate variables. This approach resulted in the identification of 112 genes showing strong signals of local environmental adaptation among the population, and most of them were supported by multiple environmental variables, with the top three variables including AHM (annual heat-moisture index), CMD (Hargreaves climate moisture deficit) and DD18 (degree days below 18 °C). Among the top genes, the authors identified genes involved in biological processes with an important role in adaptation to local abiotic environmental conditions, such as cell growth, response to stress and DNA repair.</p>
<p>The findings show how the adaptive evolution is a driving force for the emerging or re-emerging of viral diseases. This work highlights the importance of the disease-vector genotypes to deal with the occurrence of invasive species that cause ecological and economics harms.</p>

<p>A normal trachea has a structure supported by a series of C-shaped rings of cartilage linked together. In most respiratory fluid dynamic studies this characteristic is omitted and the assumption is that the trachea and the bronchi have smooth walls. When a tracheal stenosis is present its characteristic rings appear as O-shaped and constrict the airway.</p>
<p>In this study the authors tried to understand the effect of cartilaginous rings on the flow passing through a stenosed trachea with Grade II stenosis. They measured the flow inside two simplified trachea models at resting breathing state, using two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV) which allows them to perform non-intrusive velocity field measurements close to the wall. One model has a smooth wall, and the other model has idealized symmetric rings. The results showed that the cartilaginous rings disturb the flow inducing velocity fluctuations and turbulence near the wall, although minor differences were observed in the mean velocity field when compared to the model with smooth wall.</p>
<p>The model described in the study highlights the importance to consider cartilaginous rings and other small structures along the airway wall. These observations could have important medical implications, including the development of diagnosis and treatment protocols for different diseases, pollutants and drug delivery.</p>

<p>Female breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, and it is represented by different types of cancer, with each type including different symptoms, diagnosed methods and treatments. In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the cancer cells don’t have receptors for the hormones estrogen and progesterone and for HER2. Compared to other subtypes, TNBC shows a higher risk of developing distant metastasis and death following locoregional recurrence. As a consequence of lack of therapeutic targets, the treatment options for this type of cancer are few and have a poor clinical efficacy. The androgen receptor (AR) is emerging as a promising prognostic marker for TNBC and new studies are now aiming to investigate the related potential of receptor-targeted therapies.</p>
<p>In this retrospective study the authors selected 99 patients, represented by 36 patients with histologically confirmed TNBC and 63 patients with non-TNBC, who underwent breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) before surgery. The authors calculated the pharmacokinetic parameters of DCE-MRI and their corresponding texture parameters between TNBC and non-TNBC groups, and AR-positive (AR+) and AR-negative (AR-) TNBC groups. The results showed how  the pharmacokinetic parameters of DCE-MRI were significantly different in AR-TNBC from AR+TNBC.</p>
<p>The findings highlight how DCE-MRI can be used to predict AR expression in patients with TNBC using DCE-MRI-based pharmacokinetic parameters containing histograms and texture features. The assessment of intratumor heterogeneity has a great potential in clinical practice as it could help to improve diagnosis and to provide tailor-made treatment strategies for each patient.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iron-deficiency-goes-anemia-us-female-adolescents">Iron deficiency goes unnoticed in too many U.S. female adolescents</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many female adolescents in the United States may not have enough iron in their bodies. But most may never know, partly due to a lack of routine screenings as well as disagreement over what constitutes too little iron, pediatric hematologist Angela Weyand argues.</p>



<p>Iron deficiencies are most commonly diagnosed in toddlers, people who menstruate and pregnant people. But Weyand, of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, frequently treats female adolescents for severe cases of the condition. That led her to suspect that its prevalence was being underestimated in that group.</p>





<p>Her analysis of data from thousands of blood samples collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which evaluates a nationally representative sample of people each year, suggests the issue is worthy of attention.</p>



<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2806540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Up to 40 percent</a> of U.S. females from the ages of 12 to 21 could be iron deficient, she and colleagues report in the June 27 <em>JAMA</em>. That’s much higher than <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/89/5/1334/4596788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous estimates</a> of about 16 percent, which use a lower cutoff point than Weyand’s team did for iron levels.</p>



<p>Iron is an essential component of red blood cells that helps deliver oxygen to organs and tissues. Iron deficiency can cause dizziness, headaches, fatigue, sleep disorders and cold hands and feet. Some of those problems can lead to low work productivity or an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/food-for-thought/ironing-out-some-mental-limitations">inability to multitask</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/04)</em>. Severe iron deficiency can also lead to anemia, a condition in which the body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells. Anemia can spark more severe issues, such as heart problems or pregnancy complications.</p>



<p>Weyand and colleagues analyzed levels of two iron-containing proteins, hemoglobin and ferritin, in blood samples collected from almost 3,500 female adolescents from 2003 to 2020 as part of the national survey. The researchers diagnosed iron deficiency if the level of ferritin was below 25 micrograms per liter.</p>

Treating even mild cases can make a huge difference in their quality of life, she says.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129602">A. Weyand</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Weyand and colleagues used that cutoff based on <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanhae/PIIS2352-3026(21)00168-X.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a previous study</a><em> </em>on nonpregnant females showing that their hemoglobin levels started to drop when their ferritin levels dipped below 25 μg/L. Hemoglobin is produced in bone marrow and carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. Low hemoglobin is a sign of anemia.</p>



<p>Typically, 15 μg/L is the cutoff used to diagnose iron deficiency, says Laura Murray-Kolb, a nutrition scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who was not involved in the study. The <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/85843/WHO_NMH_NHD_MNM_11.2_eng.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a> set that cutoff based on when the body’s iron stores in bone marrow are already depleted. Without enough iron, bone marrow can’t produce more hemoglobin.</p>



<p>But the standard may not be the most effective measure of iron deficiency, Weyand says, because it doesn’t capture “how much iron our [bodies] think we need.” Weyand has treated patients with symptoms of iron deficiency who have ferritin levels above the 15 μg/L cutoff.</p>



<p>In the new study, about 40 percent of participants met the 25 μg/L criteria for iron deficiency. Only 17 percent would qualify based on the 15 μg/L standard set by the WHO, which is roughly in line with previous estimates. Six percent met criteria for anemia, with both ferritin levels below 25 μg/L and hemoglobin levels below the standard cutoff of 12 milligrams per deciliter. Factors such as menstruation, food insecurity or low income increased the risk of iron deficiency or anemia, and Black and Hispanic participants were more likely to meet criteria for iron deficiency than non-Hispanic white participants.</p>



<p>Weyand isn’t surprised that cases of iron deficiency and anemia are so prevalent. Families and medical care providers often brush off symptoms as being a normal part of menstruation, she says, and symptoms can also be attributed to other health issues. “Iron deficiency isn’t necessarily what [primary care providers] are thinking of first,” Weyand says. Taken together, that means cases might go unnoticed and untreated.</p>





<p>The recommendations for iron deficiency screening should be reevaluated, Weyand says. For instance, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00051880.htm#:~:text=The%20CDC%20recommends%20periodic%20screening,nonpregnant%20women%20of%20childbearing%20age." target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends</a> that nonpregnant females be screened for anemia every five to 10 years beginning in adolescence but offers no recommendation on screening for iron deficiency.</p>



<p>More research is needed to confirm that the 25 μg/L cutoff is appropriate for widespread adoption in clinical practice, Murray-Kolb cautions. But she agrees that screening recommendations should be reconsidered, especially since screening is so easy to do — requiring a simple blood draw.</p>



<p>The findings underscore just how crucial testing and treatment are for the health of female adolescents even with mild cases, Weyand says. “I’ve seen patients who are really iron deficient and feeling horrible, and we corrected their iron deficiency and their lives really changed.”</p>

<p>An economics study has been retracted after other researchers identified several inconsistencies in the study’s code and submitted a comment to the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those critics say the flaws drove the paper&#8217;s main findings, but an author of the study says they had no major effect and stands by the results.</p>



<p>The original paper, &#8220;<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20210369">Dividend Taxes and the Allocation of Capital</a>,” was published in the <em>American Economic Review</em> in September 2022. It examined the impact of a 2013 increase in the tax rate on dividends in France, concluding an increased rate can encourage the accumulation of capital. The study has been cited four times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction is only the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?ttl%3dEffects%2bof%2bEnvironmental%2band%2bLand%2bUse%2bRegulation%2bin%2bthe%2bOil%2band%2bGas%2bIndustry%2bUsing%2bthe%2bWyoming%2bCheckerboard%2bas%2ban%2bExperimental%2bDesign">second in the journal’s history</a>. As Retraction Watch has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/12/12/why-arent-there-more-retractions-in-business-and-economics-journals/">previously reported</a>, research shows that it is less common for economics papers to be retracted than research in other fields.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127532"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.113.7.2053">retraction notice</a> published this month states, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors are retracting the paper because Figure 4 of the published paper, which pertains to the second result on the increase in investment and which plots the event study difference-in-difference coefficients of the within-firm change in year-to-year investment flows by treated firms, relative to control firms, differs from the figure that was conditionally accepted by the handling editor in two ways.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first difference, the authors write in the retraction notice, was that “the firm size control variable in the conditionally accepted manuscript was coded in changes but was incorrectly written in the baseline specification as levels.” The authors write that this error was found and corrected during the review and replication process, but they failed to inform the appropriate editor of the changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the second instance, a line of code divided two coefficients by a factor of 1.8. The authors write that while they are not sure how the mistake originated, the data were “stored on remote, external servers that were inaccessible to the authors for prolonged periods of time during the publication process so it is unfortunately not possible to recover past versions to isolate the error’s origin.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/skenqoxmygjxfcr/retraction_note_for_website.pdf?dl=0">response</a> to the retraction, author Adrien Matray, an assistant professor of economics at Princeton University, wrote that both alterations were “made in good faith.” Matray posted the response on his <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/adrienmatray/papers?authuser=0">website</a> and linked to it in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AdrienMatray/status/1670839660753436704">tweet</a>. He maintained that neither alteration changed the basic conclusions of the paper.</p>



<p>He also contradicted the text of the retraction notice, which stated that it “explains the authors’ reasons for retracting the published paper.” Matray wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to clarify that it was not my decision to retract the paper. I believe that the scientific concerns could have been addressed in a reply.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that given corrections to the study do not change its results, “this paper may not fall within standard publication ethics (COPE) guidelines for retraction.”</p>



<p>Martray did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charles Boissel, the other author of the paper, left academia in 2018 and was not involved in the alterations that led to the retraction, according to the retraction notice. He was previously a PhD student at HEC Paris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erzo Luttmer, the editor of the <em>American Economic Review</em>, told us:&nbsp;</p>

(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20221432) jointly explain the issues that led to their retraction. The comment explains the nature of the errors and shows how they affect the main results of the article by Boissel and Matray.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In contrast to Matray’s claims that correcting the errors would not change the paper’s conclusions, the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/content/file?id=18907">comment</a> Luttmer mentioned argues that the alterations essentially invalidate the study’s findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The comment was written by Laurent Bach, an associate professor of finance at ESSEC business school; Antoine Bozio, an associate professor at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS); Arthur Guillouzouic, a research economist at the Institut des politiques publiques (IPP) in the Paris School of Economics; and Clément Malgouyres, a researcher at the Paris School of Economics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to an email from Retraction Watch, the authors of the comment wrote that the main conclusions of the paper are “driven by a series of undocumented alterations in the code.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Referencing Matray’s personal response to the retraction, the authors of the comment said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>One thing that matters for the validity of such an empirical design is that there are no statistically significant coefficients in the pre-treatment period, and both figure 4a and figure 4b in that response clearly present such significant coefficients. More generally, what matters for scientific validity in this context is that coefficients in the post-treatment period do not appear significant when the treatment truly has no effect, and both figures 4a and 4b suffer from this assumption being incorrect due to the inclusion of improper control variables in the analysis, according to our comment and as per [Matray’s] own recognition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors also said that the original version of their comment identified further problems with the study, but that they were asked by the journal’s editor to include only two of these issues.</p>



<p>Update, 1600 UTC, 7/19/23: After this story was published, Adrien Matray responded to our emails, saying they had been lost in his spam filter. In his message, he emphasized that the study had been retracted because of the two alterations to the code discussed in the retraction notice, not because its main conclusions did not hold. He said that a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jq1bmy6q39fmlcu/supplemental_note.pdf?dl=0">supplemental note</a> on his website addresses “the conceptual flaw in the specification that the authors of the comment present as their most compelling evidence of the lack of results in my paper.” </p>



<p>He also wrote that “there was no evidence that the standard policy for comments, in which external referees are required to weigh in on the initial comment and any response I have, was followed.” He said that when he brought up that he believed the paper did not meet COPE guidelines for retraction, instead of being told that it did meet them, he was told that the journal was not legally bound by these guidelines. Matray said that Luttmer mischaracterized the retraction to the journal’s co-editors as being Matray’s decision, “in order to justify not allowing me to reply to the comment.”</p>



<p>Matray said that the authors of the comment may have a conflict of interest, since one of their <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qVhHWuHSLo5TkcGcvyKwN2h6b6bL7Hmf/view">working papers </a>examined related reforms and did not find any effects. Their paper has not been published in a journal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/benjamin-franklin-money-counterfeiter">How Benjamin Franklin fought money counterfeiters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Though perhaps better known for its newspapers and almanacs, Benjamin Franklin’s printing business also churned out paper money to support the colonial economy. Now, scientists are confirming some of the ways that Franklin and his associates thwarted counterfeiters to help early American paper currency succeed, including by adding a reflective mineral to bills.</p>



<p>Franklin’s bills “served as an archetype for printed money” to come, says Khachatur Manukyan, a physical chemist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. “It was very sophisticated for that time.”</p>





<p>In past studies, Manukyan and his colleagues have analyzed ancient Roman coins, medieval manuscripts and other artifacts using nuclear imaging techniques. When the researchers realized that Notre Dame housed paper money bills dating to the early colonial days of North America, the team decided to take a closer look. They examined about 600 paper notes.</p>



<p>By using techniques such as infrared, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X-ray analysis, the researchers could see features such as colored threads and muscovite — a crystalized mineral — incorporated into the paper. The blue threads are visible to the naked eye, and the muscovite produces a glimmer that reflects light — features most knock-offs wouldn’t have been able to reproduce, the team reports July 17 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em></p>



<p>The muscovite, found in about 95 percent of the analyzed Franklin bills produced after 1754, was probably sourced from the same geologic area, the team says. The mineral was also probably used to increase the durability of the notes so they could hold up better during circulation.</p>



<p>It’s wonderful that scientists are using these techniques to analyze these bills, says Jessica Linker, a historian at Northeastern University in Boston who studies early moneymaking. Still, she says, historians have known for some time from historical documents that muscovite — also known as mica — and blue threads were incorporated into old paper money to fight counterfeiting.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, while Franklin contracted with the colonial governments to print money, others were involved in the decisions about its manufacture — not just Franklin, she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071723_JRL_ben-franklin-money_inline-1.png" alt="Two photos of Benjamin Franklin’s incorporated elements like blue thread (left) and microscopic muscovite (right) in their paper money." class="wp-image-3129763" width="680" height="221" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071723_JRL_ben-franklin-money_inline-1.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071723_JRL_ben-franklin-money_inline-1-330x107.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129763">Franklin’s operations incorporated elements like blue thread (left) and muscovite (microscope image, right) in their paper money in an effort to make it difficult to counterfeit.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129763">K. Manukyan <em>et al</em>/<em>PNAS</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new analyses also showed that Franklin’s operations used graphite in their black ink. Other money printers of the time, including Paul Revere, generally used a type of black ink that had a higher proportion of chemicals that came from burnt bones like phosphorus and calcium. Counterfeiters had figured out how to fake the bone black ink, and some knock-off Franklin notes are distinguishable by the fact they use this bone black rather than graphite.</p>



<p>Franklin’s operations may have used graphite to one-up the counterfeiters, the researchers say. But Franklin wasn’t the first printer to use graphite in ink, Linker says. Black lead — the historical term for graphite — is listed in some 18th century ink recipes, she says.</p>



<p>“Even if it was unique to the money or new in the mid-Atlantic, it’s possibly not a Franklin innovation, but something he read about, experimented with and used to improve the quality of the ink generally,” she says — not necessarily something to fight counterfeiting.</p>



<p>Still, the discovery of the graphite in Franklin’s notes is intriguing, she says. “I don’t think historians of colonial American printing would expect it to be there,” mostly because graphite was relatively scarce in the colonies at the time. Linker wonders whether this ink was used more broadly in Franklin’s other imprints or used exclusively for paper money.</p>





<p>Efforts to thwart counterfeiters of early American money were eventually upended by the British, who figured out some of the techniques when they flooded their upstart colony with fake bills as a destabilizing tactic during the American Revolution. The value of American money tanked, and in the years following the revolution, the United States typically favored coins, only issuing treasury notes during later wars.</p>



<p>Even so, some of Franklin’s techniques would go on to form the basis of increasingly sophisticated methods used to combat savvier forgers, Manukyan says. “The techniques utilized in producing pre-federal American currency were refined and enhanced during the 19th century whenever new bills were printed,” he says. “For that time, [Franklin’s paper money] was really groundbreaking.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-market-brain">New Alzheimer’s drugs are coming. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Yet another new drug can temporarily hold off the mental decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease, scientists say.</p>



<p>The drug, called donanemab, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2023.13239?utm_campai[…]PDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jama.2023.13239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slowed cognitive decline by about 35 percent</a> over the course of a year and a half, according to data presented July 17 at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Amsterdam and published the same day in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>The finding comes just weeks after the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration gave full approval to another drug, called lecanemab (brand name Leqembi), that can also slow the disease’s progression. Last summer another similar drug, known as aducanumab (Aduhelm), received accelerated approval, though access to it is still very limited.</p>





<p>These drugs target amyloid, a sticky protein that piles up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. The arrival of this new treatment approach marks a turning point in what has been a long, hard slog to come up with ways to slow the disease.</p>



<p>“I think this truly represents a sea change,” says neurologist Jeffrey Cummings of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the rare times where it’s OK to use the word ‘breakthrough.’”</p>



<p>The developments may bring a bit of hope to the 6.7 million people ages 65 and older in the United States who have Alzheimer’s. Even so, lots of questions remain, including who should get the drugs, how well they work and how to weigh the possible benefits against the risks, which can be significant.</p>



<p>One thing is already clear: The drugs aren’t for everyone. They come with risks and require close monitoring. And, even if a person is a good candidate medically, high costs, limited availability and time-intensive dosing schedules could prevent the drugs’ widespread use.<br><br>Here’s what to know about these new medications.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do these Alzheimer&#8217;s drugs work?</h4>



<p>The “mab” that ends their unwieldly names — donanemab, lecanemab and aducanumab — is a clue to their job: All three of these drugs are monoclonal antibodies.</p>



<p>These custom-designed antibodies take inspiration from the antibodies that the body makes to detect harmful substances, a key part of the immune system. In the brain, the lab-made antibodies attach to specific parts of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Once the antibodies attach to amyloid, they call in other immune cells to come take out the trash.</p>



<p>This cleanup job brings mental benefits, recent clinical trials suggest. And that finding supports the idea that amyloid plaques are a key part of Alzheimer’s disease, a long-standing idea called the “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/memories-cant-wait">amyloid hypothesis</a>” (<em>SN: 2/25/11</em>).</p>



<p>Failed clinical trials had led some researchers to abandon that idea. “People were about ready to give up on amyloid altogether,” says neurologist and neuroscientist Erik Musiek of Washington University in St. Louis. “I don’t think a lot of people felt like removing the plaques was that big of a deal.” But this new class of drugs suggests that the plaques aren’t innocent bystanders.</p>



<p>Instead, plaques do indeed seem to harm brain function, and getting rid of them helps, Musiek says. “It seems to suggest that getting those plaques out of there is important.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How well do these Alzheimer&#8217;s drugs work?</h4>



<p>None of these drugs stop the disease. But they can buy some time, the data suggest.</p>



<p>On average, the 588 people who received donanemab in the recent clinical, for instance, stayed sharper for a bit over four months longer than the 594 people who received a placebo. Using a different scale to measure symptoms gave an estimate of seven and a half months of extra time due to the drug, made by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, based in Indianapolis.</p>



<p>Results from studies of aducanumab are more <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-alzheimers-drug-fda-approved-controversy-aducanumab">mixed</a>, generating lots of debate about whether the drug, made by Biogen Inc., based in Cambridge, Mass., is effective (<em>SN: 6/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>For lecanemab, a drug made by Eisai Co., based in Tokyo, and Biogen, people who got the drug spent about five months longer in a milder stage of the disease before developing more severe symptoms than people who got a placebo — about a 30 percent delay over the course of the 18-month study. That may not sound like a lot, and for some people, it might not be worth the drug’s risks. But Aimee Pierce, a geriatric neurologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, says that for some people, that delay could be especially meaningful.</p>



<p>“Some of my patients are writing memoirs or writing books or still struggling through their last year of teaching.” In those circumstances, a five-month reprieve before progressing to more confusion is significant, she says.</p>



<p>So far, the studies have not been representative of the broader population, enrolling very few people who are Black or Hispanic, for instance. That leaves a lot to learn.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Who can get Alzheimer’s drugs?</h4>



<p>So far, the drugs are for people who are showing mild signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists don’t expect the drugs to help once Alzheimer’s has progressed to more intense stages.</p>



<p>To be treated with the drugs, a person should have amyloid plaques in their brain. That’s confirmed with either a brain scan or a cerebrospinal fluid test that can detect amyloid. New <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blood-test-could-predict-risk-alzheimers">blood tests</a> for amyloid buildup — a less-invasive option — are also being studied (<em>SN: 2/1/18</em>). The recent study of donanemab also required people to have excess tau in their brains, another sign of Alzheimer&#8217;s, to qualify for the trial.</p>



<p>Autoimmune disorders, medical implants that preclude MRI scans that monitor brain reactions and other health issues may also stop someone from being a candidate for the drugs. People who carry <em>APOE4</em>, a version of a gene that ups a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s, seem to be at higher risk of harmful side effects from the drugs too.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How are the Alzheimer&#8217;s drugs delivered?</h4>



<p>The drugs are intravenous infusions that are given in medical centers where health care workers monitor reactions.</p>



<p>Aducanumab and donanemab are monthly infusions. But it&#8217;s possible that donanemab may be stopped once plaques are cleared away. In the clinical trial presented July 17, some participants were switched to a placebo once their plaques were gone. Still, the benefits lasted throughout the trial.</p>



<p>Lecanemab infusions happen every other week. That intense dosing schedule can be tough for patients, says Pierce, who was involved in one of the lecanemab clinical trials. And there&#8217;s no good cutoff for when to end the treatment. “As of now, it’s out there and people don’t have a stopping point,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are the risks of taking Alzheimer’s drugs?</h4>



<p>Brain swelling and bleeding are two of the risks. In the recent trial of donanemab, three people died as a consequence of the treatment. People on the drugs ought to be monitored with brain scans that can detect possibly dangerous changes, researchers say. Those scans can identify the worrisome condition ARIA, or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities.</p>



<p>Overall, about a quarter of people in the clinical trials who received the drug developed the condition. In a trial of nearly 1,800 people, for instance, <a href="https://www.eisai.com/news/2022/news202271.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 21 percent of people who received lecanemab had ARIA</a>, while about 9 percent of people who got a placebo did. Most of those cases came with without symptoms, which can include headache, nausea, dizziness and seizures.</p>



<p>Scientists suspect that ARIA stems from the antibodies working well. Amyloid can be in the walls of blood vessels. Removing the amyloid may make the blood vessels less stable and more prone to break.</p>



<p>These drugs can also lead to infusion reactions such as changes in blood pressure, fevers and chills. Those are often temporary and manageable, Cummings says, nor are they specific to these treatments. “This is not unique at all to Alzheimer’s drugs.”</p>



<p>Weighing the risks and the potential benefits of taking the medications is a personal call. An 80-year-old with a list of medical problems who is generally content might have a very different calculation from a 62-year-old CEO of a company with a kid in college, Musiek says. If you are that younger person, “your appetite for risk is probably much higher,” he says.</p>



<p>Researchers hope that this spate of drugs may serve as a stop-off on the way to even better ones that are more effective, less risky and easier to administer.</p>



<p>“Hopefully once we can optimize [these drugs] and help whoever we can help, it will pave the way for the next set of drugs that will come out,” Musiek says. “And then maybe things will get better and better.”</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/serbian-genetic-society.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="170" height="163" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/serbian-genetic-society.png?resize=170%2C163&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127505" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>


<p>A journal that didn’t get an impact factor this year after Clarivate, the company behind the closely-watched but controversial metric, identified unusual citations in several articles will retract the offending papers, according to its editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Genetika</em>, a publication of the Serbian Genetics Society, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/28/truly-devastating-four-journals-wont-get-new-impact-factors-this-year-because-of-citation-shenanigans/">did not receive an updated impact factor</a> in Clarivate’s 2023 Journal Citation Reports due to citation stacking, a practice in which authors or journals seem to trade citations, also known as “citation cartels” or “<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/03/citation-boosting-episode-leads-editors-resignations-university-investigation/">citation rings</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, Clarivate identified five papers published in <em>Genetika</em> in 2021 that had been cited by 22 papers published in the journal <em>Bioscience Research</em> in 2022, Snezana Mladenovic Drinic, the editor of <em>Genetika</em>, told Retraction Watch. Clarivate also suppressed <em>Bioscience Research </em>this year, meaning that the journal did not receive a new impact factor either. </p>



<span id="more-127503"></span>



<p>(Jelena Milasin, president of the Serbian Genetics Society, previously told us <em>Genetika</em> leadership had offered to retract 32 “suspicious papers” published in 2021 and 2022, but Clarivate went ahead and suppressed the journal anyway.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate also removed <em>Genetika</em> from its Web of Science index when it refreshed its Master Journal List on Monday. The company said the journal failed to meet at least one of <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">24 quality criteria</a>, but would not comment on which.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Removing a journal from Web of Science, which Clarivate calls “delisting,” means the company will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor. The company does have a <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/webofscience-platform/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-policies-category-change-requests-and-appeals-process/">pathway</a> for journals to become relisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Milasin and Drinic for comment on the delisting, and Milasin reiterated her earlier comments to us on the suppression, that Clarivate’s decision was “extremely unfair!” She said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You will agree with me that it would be totally illogical to do something for “the benefit of our own detriment”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Drinic said <em>Genetika</em>’s editorial team “did not know anything about misused over citations,” and had no influence on the editorial policy of <em>Bioscience Research</em>, no relationships with the authors of the papers involved, nor control over which papers the authors cited.</p>



<p>Still, Drinic acknowledged the citations from <em>Bioscience Research:&nbsp;</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>affected the real picture of the citations of papers published in the journal <em>Genetika</em> which had tremendous consequences for the journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal Genetika condemns such for the scientific community</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>an unethical and inappropriate pattern of behavior and we will take all measures to prevent this happening again in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked if <em>Genetika</em> would retract any of the relevant papers, and Drinic confirmed the journal would retract “papers for which it was determined that the peer review was not done validly” in its next issue. Drinic said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to note that all papers are reviewed by two reviewers, during 2020 and 2021 a huge number of papers were received by the editorial office, and due to the Covid 19 pandemic it was difficult to find reliable reviewers, so we were forced to ask the authors to suggest reviewers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, a group of authors and reviewers misused it. All authors and those reviewers have been blacklisted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal editors learned of the problem in the middle of last year, Drinic said, and “took all measures to prevent it from happening again.” </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last September, scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik identified <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nSJa5OCqYVVhSd10NN6mvI73Ra0Pfjwx3aMLwHtgGAI/edit?usp=sharing">31 papers</a> published in <em>Genetika</em>, mostly in 2021, that seemed linked to what she called the “<a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2022/09/15/the-iranian-plants-paper-mill/">Iranian Plant Paper Mill</a>.” One of the hallmarks of the papers, she noted, was repeated coordinates indicating where plants were sampled, although the names given for the locations elsewhere in the papers were different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another similarity she found: Many of the papers cited work by S.M. Esfandani-Bozchaloyi and M. Khayatnezhad, “perhaps as part of a citation ring.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example, she linked to the PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5F1B8F7B15E55225C5BA91239742BA">page</a> for the <em>Genetika</em> paper “<a href="https://doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=0534-00122102837M">Study on genetic diversity between Erodium (Geranaiceae) species based on inter-simple sequence repeat markers</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our request for comment on the journal’s suppression, an email attributed to the editorial office of <em>Bioscience Research</em> denied having any relationship with <em>Genetika</em> or exchanging citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have never heard the name of this journal before,” the email stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, the office pinned the blame squarely on Khayatnezhad:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On critical analysis of the provide data by Clarivate, we found that mainly one author i.e.&nbsp; Majid KHAYATNEZHAD from Islamic Azad University Iran cross cited his papers for his personal benefits in papers published by his colleagues from same Iranian university.&nbsp; This was a common authors in all papers published in Genetika citing our journal papers published by his colleagues from same university.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The editorial office also shared the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Appeal-ISI-web-09-05-2023.pdf">appeal</a> the journal sent to Clarivate, which listed four <em>Genetika</em> papers on which Khayatnezhad was a coauthor. Clarivate did not change the decision to suppress the journal based on the appeal. The editorial office of <em>Bioscience Research</em> wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>it was extremely unfair that our journal and hundreds of the authors who trusted and published with us were punished for&nbsp; misconduct of a single author who did it for his personal interest and we don&#8217;t have any role in it and even cant not check and control it.&nbsp; All his conduct was beyond control of editorial office and even no journal can check and fix this type of activity by any of authors among hundred of author. Instead of journal suppression, authors like Majid KHAYATNEZHAD&#8221; must be blacklisted for misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3621-5153">Khataynezhad</a>, of the environmental science and engineering department at the Islamic Azad University’s Ardabil branch in Iran and also <a href="https://ap.ardabil.iau.ir/journal/editorial.board">managing editor</a> of the university’s journal <em>Anthropogenic Pollution</em>, for comment. He responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unfortunately, I recently encountered many problems in this regard. The increase in my citations in recent years is due to my return to university. But if you check my articles, there are no unusual citations in this field. I would like to retract the articles that have cited me unusually. Increasing citations does not matter to me.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-use-antibird-spikes-build-nests">In a ‘perfect comeback,’ some birds use antibird spikes to build their nests</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s the Mad Max dream of a bird’s nest: A menacing composite of metal, clay, twig and plastic.</p>



<p>Spotted in a sugar maple tree in Antwerp, Belgium, the gnarly architecture brims with at least 1,500 long, sharp antibird spikes pointing out from its center. “That is really like a bunker for birds,” says biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra. “Like this fortress which cannot be taken.”</p>



<p>The nest is <a href="https://www.hetnatuurhistorisch.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/documents-nmr/Publicaties/Deinsea/Deinsea_21/Deinsea_21_17_25_2023_Hiemstra_et_al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of five found in Europe</a>, each one decorated with antibird spikes, Hiemstra and his colleagues report July 11 in <em>Deinsea</em>. The pointy strips of bird-deterrent materials normally line eaves in cities around the world. Now, they line some birds’ homes.</p>





<p>The study started when a hospital patient in Antwerp looked out his window and saw the nest in question. He sent a picture to Hiemstra, who researches nests and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-ppe-trash-masks-gloves-pollution-deadly-wildlife">plastic pollution</a> at Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands (<em>SN: 4/12/21</em>). After breeding season, Hiemstra and his team travelled to collect the nest and take it back to the lab for study. As he wrote up his report of the nest, he was tipped off to four more similar bird nests in cities in the Netherlands and Scotland.</p>



<p>The nests belonged to Eurasian magpies (<em>Pica pica</em>) and carrion crows (<em>Corvus corone</em>). The crows used the spikes as part of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-nest-sturdy-physics">structure of their nests</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>). But Hiemstra believes the magpies employed them much as they were originally intended: to ward off other birds.</p>

<p>Magpies are relatively small, so they create domed roofs over their nests to protect their eggs and hatchlings from avian predators. Often, the magpies adorn their roofs with thorny branches for extra protection. But in large cities, spiny vegetation is harder to come by, so the magpies innovate with whatever materials they have available, like nails, screws or knitting needles. Antibird spikes serve as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/canada-crawford-lake-beginning-anthropocene">ultimate Anthropocene replacement</a>, the researchers say (<em>SN: 7/11/23</em>).</p>



<p>The observations are “fascinating,” and the use of citizen science is laudable, says Zuzanna Jagiełło, an ecologist at the University of Warsaw who wasn’t involved in the study. However, she thinks that the paper lacks the experiments or in-field observations to claim that the spikes in the magpie nests are used as a bird deterrent. “It’s a starting point to explore [the phenomenon] more deeply,” she says.</p>



<p>Already, Hiemstra has received reports of other nests made with the spiky material, leading him to believe that the construction may be more common than previously thought. With enough nests, he might even be able to study if the spikes are improving the survival of the young magpies that call the nests home.</p>



<p>Still, amid his scientific excitement, Hiemstra can’t help but laugh. “I just love the irony of it all,” he says. “It&#8217;s just the perfect comeback of the birds.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/07/16/the-idea-for-a-journal-elife-a/">The idea for a journal “eLife-A”</a></h4>

              
                <p>The process of publishing and reviewing scientific results is often a strange and difficult-to-navigate landscape.</p>



<p>It would take too long to mention <em>all</em> the problems and pitfalls related to publishing. For example: overly high publication charges; long turnaround times for reviews and editorial decisions; incomprehensible reviews; incomprehensible manuscripts; delayed careers due to rejections and revision processes; lack of transparency of manuscript evaluation; lack of open access. Just to name what comes to my mind immediately.</p>



<p>Some of these issues have been partly addressed during the last decade by preprints (<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/q-bio?query=neuroscience&amp;searchtype=all&amp;abstracts=show&amp;order=-announced_date_first&amp;size=50">arXiv</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/neuroscience">bioRxiv</a>), open reviews (check out <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/02/11/public-peer-review-files/">my previous blog post on public peer reviews</a>), non-legal mirrors of closed-source material (sci-hub) and experiments with new publication models (most prominently, the new eLife publication model).</p>



<p>Since the inception of <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/54d63486/elife-s-new-model-changing-the-way-you-share-your-research">eLife&#8217;s new publication model</a> End of 2022, the first papers have now gone through this process, and I have the overall impression that the model is mostly well-received and definitely worth the experiment. The published papers now not only include the public peer reviews, but also an assessment by the editors, which summarizes and evaluates the claims of the paper. <a href="https://mschottdorf.github.io/">Manuel Schottdorf</a> just pointed out to me that this digest can also be an outright negative assessment, for example concluding that &#8220;the evidence&#8221; for the claims is &#8220;considered inadequate&#8221; (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/89106#tab-content">full article plus assessment</a>)! That&#8217;s impressive! Even though such an assessment might appear harsh from the authors&#8217; side, such an open process makes science itself and its progress more transparent. The specific paper is outside my area of expertise, but I like the idea in general. The conclusions and claims of a paper should not be evaluated based on its association with a specific journal, but based on its assessments by expert reviewers.</p>



<p>In a post on Twitter, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3B5ItaIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Aaron Milstein</a> just put forward a suggestion to implement this assessment in a way that is also readable by evaluation and grant committees: by giving to each paper a grade between &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;F&#8221;. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="embed-twitter"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if journals placed papers in quality tiers after peer review? So then the press would report &quot;published in eLife-F&quot;, immediately recognizable as different from &quot;eLife-B&quot;. Is that the problem &#8211; we need to know the rating without reading 4 sentences?</p>&mdash; Aaron Milstein (@neurosutras) <a href="https://twitter.com/neurosutras/status/1679981581774061569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For example, &#8220;eLife-A&#8221; would correspond to &#8220;Nature/Science/Cell&#8221; in terms of broad relevance, &#8220;eLife-B&#8221; to &#8220;Nature Neuroscience&#8221; or &#8220;Neuron&#8221;, &#8220;eLife-C&#8221; maybe to the current version of eLife, and so on.</p>



<p>Personally, I do not like the US grading scheme (from A to F), and I&#8217;m also a bit skeptical about mixing impact/relevance and methodological rigor/correctness &#8211; I really hate high-impact papers with strong claims that are not supported or only weakly supported by data, but I know that many people think differently. In any way, a one-dimensional metrix (from A to F) would certainly benefit from improved interpretability, which is already better than what we have right now.</p>



<p>I could also imagine that as a further step, a retrospective re-evaluation of specific papers could be possible, with this secondary, retrospective evaluation reflecting the impact a paper had on its field. It is easier to tag an existing paper that already has a specific &#8220;rating&#8221; with a new additional &#8220;post-publication review rating&#8221;, rather than saying that &#8220;in retrospect, this Scientific Reports paper should have been published in Nature&#8221;. But this is just a side-note.</p>



<p>In an ideal scenario, such a publication model would be set up by an independent entity. eLife would actually be a good choice, because its publication model is already very close to this model. Alternatively, the EU funding agencies or the NIH could set up such a journal and oblige all projects funded by EU or NIH to publish in this journal.</p>



<p>One of the several positive and less obvious side-effects would be to prevent journal hopping. Journal hopping is the process of sequentially submitting a paper to several high-impact journals, in the hope of being lucky with one of them. This process not only wastes a lot of resources from both journals and voluntary reviewers but also comes at the cost of junior researchers whose careers are delayed to an unnecessary degree by this process.</p>



<p>I really hope that a publication scheme that gets rid of the journal tags and replaces them with grades (=subjournals) becomes a reality soon. I think it is a good idea.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-device-detect-coronavirus-air">A new device can detect the coronavirus in the air in minutes</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever thought it would be great to walk into a room and know whether the virus that causes COVID-19 is hanging around, scientists have a device for you. Researchers have created a machine a little bigger than a toaster that can detect airborne SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in minutes.</p>



<p>It takes only <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39419-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five minutes to detect</a> as few as seven to 35 viral particles per liter of air, researchers report July 10 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. That is about as sensitive as PCR nasal swab tests, says Rajan Chakrabarty, an aerosol scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. His team worked “nonstop” for three years to create the detector, he says.</p>

<p>One of the main challenges when sampling airborne viruses is collecting enough air to concentrate viral particles at detectable levels. Previous attempts have sucked in between 2 and 8 liters of air per minute. This detector pulls in 1,000 liters of air each minute.</p>



<p>To trap the virus, “we create an artificial cyclone inside of the sampler,” Chakrabarty says, by swirling liquid at high speed. Viruses get trapped in the wall of the cyclone and concentrated for analysis. Any viruses not captured in the liquid get filtered out of the air with a HEPA filter attached to the device. After five minutes of collection, the liquid is pumped to a biosensor.</p>





<p>The biosensor consists of an electrode attached to a llama nanobody, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-treatments-target-nose-prevention">specialized immune system protein</a> made by llamas and their relatives that fights infections much the way antibodies do but is smaller and perhaps tougher than human antibodies (<em>SN: 9/14/20</em>). The nanobody grabs any passing coronavirus by its spike protein. Electricity passing through the nanobody and spike protein causes tyrosine amino acids in the spike protein to oxidize, or lose electrons. Another device attached to the electrode detects that oxidation as a change in voltage, signaling that SARS-CoV-2 is in the air. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The biosensor is based on a detector for the amyloid-beta protein fragments that form Alzheimer’s disease plaques developed by Chakrabarty’s colleagues Carla Yuede and John Cirrito.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To test the detector, the researchers sent the device to the apartments of two people who had COVID-19 infections. “The device was detecting even the trace amounts of virus being shed by the patients,” Chakrabarty says. Air collected from an empty, well-ventilated conference room showed no sign of the virus.</p>



<p>“They&#8217;ve demonstrated that it works. It&#8217;s able to detect [the] virus at low levels that we would be concerned about in the air,” says Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who studies the spread of viruses. She was not involved in the study but is working on a detector, too.</p>



<p>There are still some challenges to overcome. For instance, the device is about as noisy as a vacuum cleaner or a ringing phone. That’s probably too loud to use continuously in a classroom or office, Marr says, but could be tolerated if run for 10 minutes.</p>



<p>Such detectors cost about $1,400 to $1,900 to build in a research lab, Chakrabarty says. Commercial versions may initially be too expensive for home use, Marr says, but could be used in hospitals, airports and other public areas to survey for the virus. The devices could be linked into HVAC systems, which could ramp up ventilation and filtration if the virus is found, Marr and Chakrabarty suggest.</p>



<p>In the future, Chakrabarty hopes to add llama nanobodies that can detect other respiratory viruses as well, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-asteroid-stardust-old-space">Ryugu asteroid samples are sprinkled with stardust older than the solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Samples of the asteroid Ryugu contain bits of stardust that predate the birth of our solar system.</p>



<p>Slivers of Ryugu material, snagged by the Japanese Hayabusa2 spacecraft, appear to <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh1003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come from the solar system’s frozen fringes</a>, rather than from the asteroid itself, scientists report July 14 in <em>Science Advances</em>. These foreign fragments could illuminate details of the solar system’s history.</p>



<p>Finding these fragments “is really unique,” says cosmochemist Ann Nguyen of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “It’s showing us a new type of material, but also telling us about the dynamics of material from the outer solar system.”</p>





<p>The Hayabusa2 spacecraft visited the asteroid in 2018 and 2019, then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">returned to Earth with 5.4 grams of the space rock in 2020</a> (<em>SN: 12/7/20</em>). Scientists examined those samples in the lab in ways that can&#8217;t be done with telescopes or even spacecraft, like getting detailed measurements of chemical composition.</p>



<p>So far, those examinations have shown that Ryugu is rich in carbon, that it’s made of the same material as some of the rarest meteorites found on Earth, and that it was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">altered by water</a> at some point in its past (<em>SN: 6/9/22</em>). Scientists think that Ryugu formed from the debris of a larger asteroid, which broke up in a collision and re-formed into a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-came-two-other-asteroids">loose pile of rubble</a> (<em>SN: 3/20/19</em>).</p>



<p>Nguyen, however, was searching for something different. “My focus of research is presolar grains,” tiny specks of material that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-meteorite-stardust-oldest-ever-examined-lab">formed from the ashes of dying stars</a>, she says (<em>SN: 1/13/20</em>). “I was on the hunt for them.” These delicate grains contain different isotopes — atoms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons — than those formed by the sun, giving away their alien origins.</p>



<p>Nguyen and her colleagues examined two samples of Ryugu, each less than a millimeter in size. They then picked out tiny slivers of rock, 50 to 200 micrometers wide, called clasts, that stood out from the rest of the Ryugu sample.</p>



<p>Using scanning electron microscopes and other imaging techniques, Nguyen and colleagues found that two of the clasts are chemically different from the rest of Ryugu, with lower oxygen, magnesium and silicon contents, and greater amounts of iron and sulfur.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="766" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071423_LG_ryugu_inline-1-mobile.jpg" alt="Electron microscope images of a sliver of solar system material (outlined in white) in a sample of the asteroid Ryugu show that the material is different from the rest of the asteroid.

Nguyen <em>et al</em>/<em>Science Advances</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The clasts also have much higher concentrations of presolar grains than the rest of the Ryugu material. The grains contain silicon carbide, which is easily destroyed by water, plus an extra abundance of organic matter.</p>



<p>That means the grains could not have been part of Ryugu’s parent body, which was extensively altered by water. The researchers think the grains were bits of a comet that formed in the outer solar system’s Kuiper belt, where the conditions were cool and dry. Then the grains sprinkled onto the rubble that formed Ryugu sometime between the original asteroid’s destruction and the rubble pile’s formation.</p>



<p>“Between these events, it kind of collected some other friends that came from other bodies, from different parts of the solar system,” Nguyen says. It’s not yet clear how material from the outer solar system found its way to Ryugu. Perhaps the asteroid formed farther from the sun — and hence, closer to the Kuiper belt — than it is today. “It’s interesting to visualize how this asteroid came about and what it gathered along the way.”</p>



<p>The discovery is “very exciting,” says cosmochemist Philipp Heck of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, who was not involved in the new work. “These clasts that got incorporated into Ryugu after it formed, they’re really valuable. I think they’re even more valuable than the Ryugu sample itself.”</p>





<p>The clasts can reveal what the unaltered ingredients that formed the solar system were made of. Think of the disk that formed the planets as bread dough, Heck says. Once the dough is well-mixed, it’s hard to tell what went into it. Clasts like the ones in the Ryugu sample are like bits of unmixed flour that survived intact in the final loaf, he says — not delicious, but very informative.</p>



<p>“If we want to understand the ingredients from which the solar system formed, the original ingredients, we need to find these very rare, unaltered clasts,” Heck says. “This is one of them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-missing-chunk-neuroplasticity">Elyse G.’s brain is fabulous. It’s also missing a big chunk</a></h4>

              
                <p><em><strong>EDITOR’S NOTE</strong>: Most of the Interesting Brains Project participants featured in this story are using shortened forms of their names and/or pseudonyms to protect their privacy.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>You’d never guess that Elyse G. has a black hole in her brain.</p>



<p>Meet her on the street, and it’d be impossible to tell she’s lacking a chunk of neural tissue about the size of a small fist.</p>



<p>Looking at her brain scans is a different story. It’s as if someone has knocked over a bottle of ink. The darkness pools inside her skull near her left ear, a puddle of fuliginous black. Inside the splotch, there’s no white matter or gray matter, no blood vessels or tissue at all.</p>



<p>Elyse says you don’t have to be a neurosurgeon to spot what’s different about her brain: “There’s a big honking piece missing!”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="438" height="636" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_REV-2.gif" alt="A gif showing the MRI scan of Elyse G. and the large chunk of her brain missing on the left hand side." class="wp-image-3129547" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129547">In this view of Elyse G.’s brain, scientists stacked MRI slices that go from the bottom of the brain to the top. On the left side, the missing temporal lobe shows up as a large black hole that appears and then disappears as the scans move up through the brain.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129547">COURTESY OF THE FEDORENKO LAB</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Scientists can’t say exactly how it happened. It’s possible that sometime long ago, perhaps due to a stroke before or shortly after birth, a portion of Elyse’s brain died and then ultimately disappeared, leaving behind only liquid — brain tissue swapped for a fluid-filled void. Her sister has one too.</p>



<p>Elyse and her sister, Martha M., who are not using their full names to maintain their anonymity, look and act perfectly ordinary. But each lacks most of a temporal lobe, and each in a different hemisphere. Elyse is also missing part of her brain stem. The women are two of who knows how many people living their lives without brain structures generally thought to be crucial.</p>





<p>Martha, now age 59, didn’t know her brain was different until she was a teenager. Elyse, who will turn 61 this year, found out in graduate school. Two sisters. Two brains. Two black holes. When MIT cognitive neuroscientist Evelina Fedorenko’s team first learned about the duo, “we were all kind of blown away,” she says.</p>



<p>Elyse emailed Fedorenko her brain images in 2016, decades after the void was discovered. She had read an article about neuroscience research at MIT and was curious if scientists would be interested. “She said, ‘I’m missing my left temporal lobe. Do you want to study me?’ ” Fedorenko remembers.</p>



<p>The left temporal lobe is generally thought to be essential for speech and language, and Fedorenko, who trained as a language researcher, was intrigued. Her lab hadn’t studied people like Elyse before, but “I’m a very adventurous scientist,” she says. So her team brought Elyse to the lab for tests.</p>



<p>Fedorenko didn’t know it at the time, but those first studies would set in motion a whirlwind that would alter the course of her research. Her team’s findings would ignite media attention, prompting even more people to send along their brain scans. What started as a single case study has now snowballed into <a href="https://web.mit.edu/~interestingbrains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Interesting Brains Project</a>.</p>



<p>By the end of this fall, the project will likely have scanned more than 40 people with atypical brains. In many cases, participants are missing entire brain regions, and like Elyse, they didn’t find out until they were adults.</p>



<p>That may be a tribute to the brain’s flexibility — its ability to change and adapt — including its redundancies, Fedorenko says. Like backup generators, some brain areas can kick into gear if others get injured. A close look at cases like Elyse’s could help scientists better understand how our brains cope with damage and why some kinds are worse than others.</p>



<p>For now, Fedorenko’s team is focusing on language and aspects of high-level cognition, such as a person’s capacity for general reasoning. But the effort could also offer insights into the workings of the brain more broadly and might one day give doctors a better sense of what outcomes a person with a brain injury might expect.</p>



<p>That’s what Elyse and Fedorenko hope, anyway. Before she started working with the MIT team, Elyse says, “I felt like my brain was something that needed to be ‘cured’ rather than celebrated.” Not anymore. These days, there’s a different word that comes to Elyse’s mind when she thinks about her brain. “It’s fabulous,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MRI turns up atypical brains</h4>



<p>Elyse first learned about her atypical brain after an MRI scan in the fall of 1987. She was 25 years old and in her first year of grad school in Washington, D.C., an avid reader and a whiz with a needle and thread.</p>





<p>At an appointment with a neurologist at the George Washington University Hospital, Elyse — who had been previously diagnosed with epilepsy despite never having a seizure — sensed mostly boredom from the doctor and an accompanying resident. They didn’t pay her much notice, she says.</p>



<p>That feeling evaporated when Elyse came back for her results. Now she had the doctors’ full attention. They leaned forward in their chairs, elbows on knees, chins in hands, eyes laser-focused on Elyse. “How do you feel?” she remembers them asking. She felt like a lab specimen — like a frog they were zapping with electrodes, she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I felt like my brain was something that needed to be ‘cured’ rather than celebrated.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What the doctors had seen in her brain scan, of course, was that blatant black hole. When detected in babies, it’s the kind of lesion that makes parents fear the worst. In adults, strokes in the left hemisphere can steal people’s ability to read and write and jumble their speech. The meaning of words can slip suddenly from the mind, as if an eraser has scrubbed away a person’s mental dictionary. Elyse’s doctors, she remembers, were surprised she had more than a fifth-grade vocabulary.</p>



<p>At the time, Elyse felt sickened and scared. She didn’t know if the lesion was growing, if it foreshadowed early Alzheimer’s disease or if it was going to “explode in my head,” she says. A follow-up scan six months later eased her fears. The scan looked the same as the first. Her brain’s black hole wasn’t expanding.</p>



<p>Elyse never returned to those doctors, but she did get a second opinion that summer from her sister’s neurosurgeon. He had operated on Martha when she was 17, after she had noticed vision problems. The bulk of her right temporal lobe was gone, possibly due to a stroke in the womb. Fluid buildup in the brain was pressing against the nerves of her eyes, hindering her sight. “They drained it, and I went on my merry way,” Martha says. She hasn’t had the area drained since.</p>



<p>Martha’s doctor looked at Elyse’s scan and told her that as MRIs were becoming more common, doctors were finding other people with brains that diverged from the norm. “He said, ‘We’re seeing more and more deviations, and you’ve got one,’ ” she remembers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_inline-1-MM.jpg" alt="An MRI scan of Martha M.'s brain with a large dark section on the right side." class="wp-image-3129526" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_inline-1-MM.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_inline-1-MM-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_interesting-brains_inline-1-MM-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129526">Martha M., Elyse G.’s younger sister, is also missing most of a temporal lobe, but on the right side of the brain — a near–mirror image of Elyse’s lesion.

Like all of the Interesting Brains Project participants tested so far, Martha scores at or above average on language and cognitive tasks.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129526">COURTESY OF THE FEDORENKO LAB</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Interesting Brains Project is born</h4>



<p>When Elyse and Fedorenko first met, Fedorenko was interested in how language areas wire up when a chunk of crucial tissue is missing. Her plan was to peek inside Elyse’s head using functional MRI, a technique that tracks blood flow in the brain. Functional MRI lets scientists see which parts of the brain are active while a person performs a specific task.</p>



<p>For Elyse, that means lying statue-still inside the giant tube of an MRI machine while equipment whirs around her. Depending on the task, Elyse may look at or listen to words, sentences and stories or see math problems or spatial puzzles. Occasionally, she’ll press a button so the team knows she’s staying alert.</p>



<p>Outside the tube, the researchers have also tested Elyse’s vocabulary, reading and writing skills, and intelligence. She scored near the top of every language test she took. “I could have probably taken over the world if I had my entire brain,” Elyse jokes.</p>



<p>Elyse’s first scan with Fedorenko’s team revealed language activity in the right side of the brain, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393222000434?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team reported in 2022 in <em>Neuropsychologia</em></a>. Shifting functions to the right is one trick our brains use to deal with damage on the left, something other scientists have reported previously, Fedorenko says.</p>



<p>The team wondered if Elyse’s left frontal lobe might chip in too. Yes, Elyse lacks her left temporal lobe, Fedorenko says, but her left frontal lobe — where language also typically resides — is perfectly intact. “Is there any language going on there?” Fedorenko asked.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>“I could have probably taken over the world if I had my entire brain.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>But that lobe showed no language-responsive areas at all. The findings hint at a neural order of operations for language development: Without Elyse’s left temporal lobe, language areas in her left frontal lobe couldn’t wire up.</p>



<p>Fedorenko’s team also revealed that Elyse completely lacks a typical region for reading words. The team thought such a region might show up in Elyse’s right temporal lobe. Instead, she appears to tap into a network of neurons across the visual cortex, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02643294.2023.2164923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team reported this year in <em>Cognitive Neuropsychology</em></a>.</p>



<p>“It turns out you can have perfectly functional reading visual machinery in your brain that’s implemented in a different way,” Fedorenko says. Elyse may be the first reported example of this.</p>



<p>The findings from Elyse’s brain caught the attention of a reporter at <em>Wired</em> who wrote an article last year with an eyeball-grabbing headline: “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/she-was-missing-a-chunk-of-her-brain-it-didnt-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She Was Missing a Chunk of Her Brain. It Didn’t Matter</a>.” Then the emails started pouring in.</p>



<p>The morning after the <em>Wired</em> story published, Fedorenko’s inbox was “filled with cool brain pictures — brains missing all sorts of big parts,” she says. In many cases, people found out about their atypical brains accidentally. Fedorenko heard stories about people with neck tension going in for an MRI and finding out they’re missing most of their right frontal lobe. Others, like Helen Santoro, have known about their brain lesions since they were little.</p>



<p>Santoro, a science journalist who reached out to Fedorenko after reading the <em>Wired</em> story, had a stroke before birth and was missing her left temporal lobe, like Elyse. Doctors said Santoro would never speak and would need to be institutionalized. “But month after month, I surprised the experts, meeting all of the typical milestones of children my age,” she wrote last September <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/science/brain-language-research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an article about her experience</a> for the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>



<p>It’s still not clear why some brain injuries slide by unnoticed while others demand attention, says neuroimaging scientist Helen Carlson. Her team at the University of Calgary in Canada has worked with kids who’ve had early strokes in the motor cortex, the brain region responsible for movement.</p>



<p>Some kids with large brain injuries have only minor weakness on one side of their body. Others with just “a little whisper of a smudge on their MRI … have quite profound disabilities for their entire life,” Carlson says.</p>



<p>That mismatch can be true of other difficulties too, including problems with language and general reasoning — and it’s one of several mysteries the Interesting Brains Project is pursuing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How the brain adapts</h4>



<p>As of May 30, the Interesting Brains Project had scanned the brains of 30 people. Some have holes in their frontal or temporal lobes; others are missing parts of their cerebellum, a brain structure involved in balance and movement. Still other participants have brain matter that’s squished up against the sides of their skull; scans show voids that appear to have ballooned from the brain’s center.</p>



<p>These atypical arrangements can stem from cysts, surgery, strokes or excess fluid buildup in the brain. Some can result in a brain with much less neural tissue than usual — and sometimes the change can be abrupt. What happens when the brain needs to perform its same jobs but in a much smaller space, Fedorenko asks. “What are the solutions that our brains come up with when suddenly there’s a lot less turf to work with?”</p>



<p>A community of scientists has already dug up some answers by studying kids who have had perinatal strokes. In some of these cases, during a baby’s birth, or the weeks before and after, blood flow in the brain can cut off altogether, starving tissues of oxygen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“My brain is special, unique and interesting.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The brain can adapt to this injury, but it’s not a lump of clay with infinite potential. “Everybody thinks, ‘Oh, the brain is endlessly plastic,’ ” says Elissa Newport, a cognitive neuroscientist at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. But it tends to deal with damage in set ways.</p>



<p>Newport worked recently with a group of 15 kids and young adults who all had perinatal strokes that resulted in left hemisphere damage in an area that processes words and sentences. In nearly every case, the participants’ brains shifted language over to the same spots in the right hemisphere, Newport and colleagues reported <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207293119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2022 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p>



<p>It’s as if the language region has flip-flopped from left to right, “exactly the mirror image of what ordinary, typical brains look like,” she says. This pattern suggests that certain brain areas can serve as pinch hitters for language function.</p>

<p>But there’s still a universe of more questions, Fedorenko says. She’s curious if brain functions can overlap, sharing the same cortical machinery in an atypical brain when they might otherwise have set up shop in different locations. And a damaged left hemisphere doesn’t always mean language moves to the right. Sometimes language function stays behind, surviving on the fringes of the damaged region, Fedorenko says. “Nobody knows why that happens.”</p>



<p>Carlson and colleagues reported this kind of adaptation in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887899420302770" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 in <em>Pediatric Neurology</em></a>. The team was studying young stroke patients who had perinatal strokes that hit the motor cortex. Carlson says the Interesting Brains Project is valuable because it could tell scientists more about plasticity in the brain at the individual level — how a specific person’s brain has adapted to injury.</p>



<p>Not every person’s brain is able to bounce back. What scientists learn from the project, along with individualized neuroimaging, could help with prognosis, and potentially rehabilitation. “Perhaps if we can tailor intervention options to an individual brain, they might be more effective,” Carlson says.</p>



<p>Getting results will take time. Fedorenko’s team is currently juggling experimental logistics, including scanning a new participant every one to two weeks, performing behavioral tests and analyzing data. Still, they’re seeing some interesting results, Fedorenko says, and hope to submit a paper this summer.</p>



<p>She hopes the project can showcase the range of solutions our brains can, in some cases, employ to deal with a slow or sudden loss of neural real estate. Maybe, she says, the project’s findings will help more people understand “how different you can be and still grow up and do amazing things.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is a normal brain anyway?</h4>



<p>In an opening note in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393222000434?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedorenko’s 2022 paper in <em>Neuropsychologia</em></a>, Elyse wrote about how her brain’s structure doesn’t define her. “Please do not call my brain abnormal, that creeps me out,” she wrote. “My brain is atypical. If not for accidently finding these differences, no one would pick me out of a crowd as likely to have these, or any other differences that make me unique.”</p>



<p>Elyse hopes the message comes through for doctors and research scientists. “I want them to understand that this is a person they’re reading a paper about, not a disembodied brain in a jar,” she says.</p>



<p>One thing Elyse likes about working with Fedorenko’s team is that the research feels collaborative. Scientists rely on close partnerships like this to understand how the brain works under typical situations and how it may recover from injury, says Lesley Fellows, a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies how brain damage affects decision making. People with atypical brains “can give us all kinds of great ideas we might not have thought about,” she says. “They have a unique vantage point.”</p>



<p>Elyse, for example, experiences smell hallucinations. She picks up whiffs of electrical fires whenever she’s under a lot of stress. “When I was in grad school, I would smell electrical fires three times a week,” she says. Elyse hasn’t yet explored this brain quirk with Fedorenko and her colleagues, but she’s open to their ideas for future investigations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“I want them to understand that this is a person they’re reading a paper about, not a disembodied brain in a jar.”</p><cite>Elyse G.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For the team’s most recent study, reported in a preprint this year, Elyse, Martha and another sister (one with an “ordinary” brain) participated in hearing tasks inside the MRI tube. Fedorenko’s team wanted to find out <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.18.523979v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the left or right auditory cortex works when the other side is missing</a>.</p>



<p>You might think that the remaining auditory cortex would have to be enhanced somehow to pull double duty, perhaps taking up extra space, says Tamar Regev, a cognitive neuroscientist in Fedorenko’s lab. But that’s not what the team found.</p>



<p>In both Elyse’s and Martha’s brains, “activity looks completely neurotypical,” Regev says. That suggests there’s some redundancy to the brain’s auditory system, and that the development of one auditory cortex does not depend on the existence of the other.</p>



<p>Elyse is curious what other insights Fedorenko’s team will glean from her brain, and the brains of fellow Interesting Brains Project participants. “My brain is special, unique and interesting,” she wrote in the 2022 paper, “and I am excited that it can help neuroscientists understand the plasticity of the human brain.”</p>

<p>A former lecturer in the modern languages department of the University of St Andrews in Scotland committed plagiarism in seven papers published between 2014 and 2022, according to the results of an institutional investigation. </p>



<p>The university <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/research/documents/integrity-and-ethics/research-integrity-investigation-outcome-july-2023.pdf">posted a statement</a> on its website about the outcome of the investigation that did not name the researcher, who Retraction Watch has learned is Ros Holmes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holmes has two retractions in our <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dHolmes%252c%2bRos">database</a>, both for plagiarism. </p>



<span id="more-127518"></span>



<p>The first retraction, from May of last year, was for “Bad Citizens and Symbolic Subjects: Wang Jin, Zhou Tiehai, and the Art of (In)civility,” originally <a href="https://bjocs.site/index.php/bjocs/issue/view/13">published in 2019</a> in the <em>British Journal of Chinese Studies</em>. The journal removed the article from its website, but updated the <a href="https://bjocs.site/index.php/bjocs/article/view/32">introduction</a> to the issue with a retraction notice that stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have been alerted to the fact that this article uses phrases and ideas taken verbatim from a number of other scholars’ works without being properly cited. In many cases, the scholarship was also not included in the bibliography.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice also included nine references as the “most significant” sources Holmes had plagiarized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holmes’ other retraction to date came last October. “<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artm/article/7/1/31/18049/RETRACTED-Meanwhile-in-China-Miao-Ying-and-the">Meanwhile in China … Miao Ying and the Rise of Chinternet Ugly,</a>” was published in 2018 in the journal <em>ARTMargins</em>. The <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artm/article/11/3/144/112388/Retraction-of-Holmes-Ros-2018-Meanwhile-in-China">retraction notice</a> stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A reader conveyed concerns regarding the originality of parts of the author&#8217;s article in May 2022. The journal independently investigated the charges and verified them. Following Dr. Holmes&#8217;s admission of plagiarism in all the instances identified by the ARTMargins investigation, the journal informed the journals and authors whose work was left un-cited, as well as the Ethics Committee at the author&#8217;s university.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice said Holmes agreed to the retraction, and listed 24 sources she “failed to cite,” including Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of St Andrews’ online statement said it had begun the investigation after academic publishers “and other parties” raised concerns about the lecturer’s work in May and June of last year. The university said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The investigation found incontrovertible evidence that the individual had used the texts and conclusions of other scholars and journalists in their published works without appropriate attribution, and that this amounted to plagiarism and research misconduct.</p>



<p>Over 70 instances of plagiarism, from a wide range of sources, were established across seven pieces of work published between 2014 and 2022.</p>



<p>The individual is no longer employed by the University of St Andrews.</p>



<p>The University is informing all relevant publishers and previous employers of the findings of the research integrity investigation and is grateful for the cooperation and support on which it has been able to rely throughout the investigatory process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/University-of-St-Andrews-Staff-Plagiarism-Investigation-Outcome.pdf">forwarded an email</a> from a university official that named Holmes as the lecturer referred to in the statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KnwXZYPjq7UJ:https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/schoolpeoplepublic/html/build/4208b996-d70a-4ef6-9ef7-4ba3e2a957f1/rmh21/&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">cached version</a> of Holmes’ profile page&nbsp; at St Andrews indicates she joined the university in 2020 and was a lecturer in Chinese studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An email to Holmes’ school email address was not returned as undeliverable, but we have not yet received a reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our request for comment, a university spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have published a statement on this matter on our website in which we have agreed not to name the individual out of concern for an ongoing health issue. All relevant publishers and previous employers are being informed, in keeping with our unwavering commitment to research integrity. University colleagues have also been made aware. We do not intend to comment further on this matter at this time.</p>

                Flight delays, cancellations, and violent turbulence are becoming increasingly common as extreme weather ramps up. Things are likely to get worse with climate change.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mass-moon-orbit-gravity-space">Mass has different definitions. The moon’s orbit confirms two are equivalent</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mass is mass is mass.</p>



<p>Physicists have three different definitions of mass, all thought to be equivalent. Measurements of the distance between Earth and the moon confirm that <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.021401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two of those masses are one and the same</a> to higher precision than ever before, physicists report July 13 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. That result confirms one of the most basic foundations of physics: Newton’s third law of motion.</p>



<p>Inertial mass determines how easily an object accelerates in response to a force. Then there’s active gravitational mass, which determines the strength of an object’s gravitational field. Rounding out the trio is passive gravitational mass, which dictates the force on an object in a given gravitational field.</p>





<p>“It is a big question in physics why these masses are all the same,” says theoretical physicist Claus Lämmerzahl of the University of Bremen in Germany. So scientists want to be sure they aren’t slightly different.</p>



<p>Previously, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-general-relativity-gravity-microscope-experiment">MICROSCOPE experiment</a> confirmed the equivalence of inertial mass and passive gravitational mass in tests aboard a satellite (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, scientists compared active and passive gravitational masses for two elements found in different parts of the moon: iron in the core and aluminum in the crust.</p>



<p>Newton’s third law, often stated as “for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction,” suggests the iron’s gravitational pull on the aluminum should be the same as the aluminum’s pull on the iron.</p>



<p>If the active and passive masses were different, that would violate the rule and the uneven tug-of-war would alter the moon’s orbit. Based upon decades of laser measurements of the moon’s distance from Earth and its location in its orbit, the ratio of active and passive gravitational masses for the two materials were the same to about four trillionths of a percent, Lämmerzahl&nbsp; and colleagues report.</p>



<p>Finding a difference would also clash with Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. So the moon serves up a win not only for Newton, but for Einstein, too.</p>
