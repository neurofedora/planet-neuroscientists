              <h4><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/adhd-the-brain-what-s-in-the-matter">ADHD &#38; the brain: What's in the matter?</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Difficulty concentrating and focusing, impatience, interrupting conversations, hyperactivity and impulsiveness…does that sound like things you struggle with? A national survey carried out by The Ohio State University of 1000 Americans showed that 1 in 4 adults believed they had undiagnosed ADHD. But, many different mental health issues share common symptoms, while the diagnosis for each looks different.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is not merely a childhood affliction; it often persists into adulthood, affecting approximately 6.75% of adults globally. As our understanding of the brain deepens, so too does our appreciation for the complex neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>The Brain&apos;s Architecture: A Structural Perspective</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Recent advancements in neuroimaging, particularly Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), have illuminated the structural anomalies associated with ADHD. A study conducted by Gehricke et al. analysed MRI data from 72 participants, including 31 with ADHD and 41 controls. Their findings indicated differences in white matter fibre bundles and grey matter density, particularly in regions of the frontal lobe, where patients had a smaller density. Notably, these structural changes were most pronounced in individuals with a history of childhood ADHD symptoms, suggesting a critical link between early symptoms and later brain development.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;">&quot;Adults with ADHD display increased MD in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate&quot;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The study&apos;s results align with previous meta-analyses that documented reduced brain volumes in children with ADHD, particularly in the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex. These regions are integral to executive functions, which include planning, impulse control, and attention regulation. It therefore follows that structural deficits in these areas may underpin the behavioral manifestations of ADHD.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Microstructural Insights: The Role of Diffusion Tensor Imaging</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">While macrostructural changes provide a broad overview of brain anatomy, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers a more nuanced view of white matter integrity. A study by Svatkova et al. using DTI identified unique microstructural patterns of white matter associated with different ADHD types, characterised by different presentations, such as predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive, or combined presentation, highlighting the heterogeneity of the disorder. Their findings suggest that these differences can be rooted in the brain microstructure, and urge the need for tailored interventions for patients suffering from a specific type of ADHD.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Connectivity and Functional Implications</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Beyond structural changes, ADHD is characterized by disrupted functional connectivity within and between key brain networks. Mean diffusivity (MD) is a measure used in imaging to describe the overall movement of water molecules within a tissue, where increased MD values mean more diffusion, which leads to tissue breakdown, and more brain water content. Studies have shown that adults with ADHD display increased MD in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate; this makes sense, given that previous experiments have connected higher MD values with more impulsive decision making. These findings highlight the importance of considering both structural and functional aspects of brain connectivity when examining ADHD.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;"> &quot;...previous meta-analyses documented reduced brain volumes in children with ADHD, particularly in the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex&quot;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<h4> The Promise of Biomarkers</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The quest for reliable biomarkers for ADHD has gained momentum, particularly in light of the morphometric findings from Gehricke et al., which demonstrated an 83% accuracy rate in predicting ADHD diagnosis based on structural MRI data. This accuracy suggests that neuroimaging could play a pivotal role in clinical assessments, potentially leading to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment strategies.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As we delve deeper into the neurobiological landscape of ADHD, it becomes increasingly evident that the disorder is not merely a collection of behavioral symptoms, but rather a complex interplay of structural, microstructural, and functional brain alterations. Future research should continue to explore these dimensions, particularly the relationship between early symptomatic expression and subsequent neurodevelopmental trajectories.</span></span></p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/JHI_216_continuous_default.cvf1-50.gif"><img decoding="async" width="425" height="550" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/JHI_216_continuous_default.cvf1-50.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-130992" style="width:250px"/></a></figure></div>


<p>Several top editors of the <em>Journal of Clinical Immunology</em>, a Springer Nature title, have jumped ship to start a new, nonprofit journal with Rockefeller University Press.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/970-jean-laurent-casanova/">Jean-Laurent Casanova</a>, the resigning coeditor-in-chief, told <em>Retraction Watch </em>the move followed pressure from Springer to publish more papers as the journal prepared to become fully open access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Editors from more than 20 other journals have taken similar actions in the past couple of years, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">Retraction Watch has logged</a>. Reasons for the walkouts vary, but editors often cite publishers’ <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/scientific-journal-editors-mass-resignations/">perceived focus on paper quantity over quality</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130991"></span>



<p>Until 2023, the <em>Journal of Clinical Immunology</em> was the official journal of the Clinical Immunology Society, based in Milwaukee. The society <a href="https://clinimmsoc.org/CIS/News/Latest-News/Journal-of-Clinical-Immunology-JoCI-Update.htm?">announced</a> that it would allow its contract with Springer to end Dec. 31, 2022, after the group was unable to “reach a consensus with the publisher that would honor and value CIS’ role and participation in <em>JoCI</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Casanova, an infectious diseases geneticist, professor at The Rockefeller University in New York City, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, said the publisher refused to let CIS and other affiliated professional societies have input in the process of selecting editors, including the next editor in chief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer was “adamant that they and only they decide who sits on the editorial board,” he said. “It pissed me off because it pissed off all the societies in the field.”</p>



<p>The members of the societies are the authors, referees and the readers of the journal, Casanova pointed out. Springer “managed to make everyone unhappy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in 2023, Springer told the editors the company would aim to make the journal open access in 2025, Casanova said, and the pressure to publish more papers began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Their intention was, we&#8217;re going to go open access, we need to publish everything,” Casanova said. “I cannot be instructed by a publisher to publish everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Casanova and all 11 associate editors of the journal resigned at the end of 2024. According to an <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10875/updates/27655912">announcement</a> on the journal’s website, it became fully open access last month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other coeditor-in-chief, Vincent Bonagura of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, NY, remains at <em>JoCI</em>. He did not respond to our request for comment, and Casanova declined to comment on Bonagura’s decision to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Nature did not comment on the mass resignations by press time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://rupress.org/JHI"><em>Journal of Human Immunity</em></a> is a joint venture between Rockefeller University Press and the International Alliance for Primary Immunodeficiency Societies (IAPIDS), of which CIS is a member. Casanova is its founding editor-in-chief. All of the associate editors from <em>JoCI</em> have joined the editorial team, plus new editors Casanova recruited, he said. The journal expects to begin publishing this spring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new journal’s article processing charge will be around $3,500, Casanova said, cheaper than <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10875/how-to-publish-with-us#Fees%20and%20funding">nearly $5,000</a> for publishing in <em>JoCI</em>. The journal will also offer discounts to IAPIDS members and waive the charges for authors from low- and middle-income countries. </p>



<p>Because IAPIDS splits ownership of the journal evenly with Rockefeller University Press, “any surplus goes back to the research community, not shareholders,” said Susan King, executive director of Rockefeller University Press. The university also co-owns the journal <a href="https://www.life-science-alliance.org/"><em>Life Science Alliance</em></a> with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and EMBO Press.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The field will be paying to publish these papers, but the money will return to the field,” Casanova said. “I think it’s better for us.”</p>

<p>A management journal has removed from its masthead an editor who was the subject of a <em>Retraction Watch</em> post last month.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jaipuria.ac.in/faculty/shalini-srivastava/">Shalini Srivastava</a>, a professor at the Jaipuria Institute of Management in India, was an associate editor at <em>Employee Relations</em>, an Emerald Publishing title. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/16/emerald-employee-relations-journal-organizational-change-management-retractions/">We reported last month</a> that two articles she coauthored — one in <em>Employee Relations </em>and another in the <em>Journal of Organizational Change Management</em>, also an Emerald journal — were retracted because “a large portion of this article’s models, samples, and results are taken, without full and proper attribution, from” earlier work, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/er-07-2019-0293/full/html">both</a> retraction <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jocm-02-2020-0063/full/html">notices</a> read.</p>



<p>Following our report, Srivastava’s name disappeared from the <a href="https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/er">editorial team page</a> of <em>Employee Relations</em>. Asked to comment on the change, a spokesperson from Emerald’s research integrity department replied:</p>



<span id="more-130986"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following investigations into several articles authored by Prof. Srivastava, the editor and publisher for Employee Relations made the decision to remove Prof. Srivastava as an Associate Editor for the journal. Prof. Srivastava agreed with this decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Srivastava, who did not respond to our request for comment to our first story, responded when asked this week about the new retractions and the removal from the editorial team:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our team has provided all the relevant information and documents to justify our cases, but the Journals were not convinced in accepting our point of view. The final decision is with the Journals which we as authors having no other option but to accept.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, three additional papers on which Srivastava is a coauthor have been retracted. “<a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/er-05-2020-0244/full/html">Perceived stress and psychological well-being of working mothers during COVID-19: a mediated moderated roles of teleworking and resilience</a>,” published in April 2021 in <em>Employee Relations</em>, was retracted on January 27. The notice used the same phrasing as the previous two, citing substantial overlap with yet another paper, “<a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijoa-02-2019-1664/full/html">Workplace bullying and job burnout: A moderated mediation model of emotional intelligence and hardiness</a>,” published in September 2019, in the <em>International Journal of Organizational Analysis</em>, also an Emerald title. That paper was retracted on January 29.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third paper, “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0258042X1103600402">Assessing the Relationship between Personality Variable and Managerial Effectiveness: An Empirical Study on Private Sector Managers</a>,” published in 2011 by <em>Management and Labour Studies</em>, a Sage journal, was retracted February 4. The retraction notice cites “substantial unattributed overlap” to three published articles, as well as “some concerns about the reported data.”</p>



<p>An anonymous poster <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/069600CB6FBB83F8E84120267A1615">flagged</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9A23B11750938BADA9F65A683AB5FC">two</a> of the newly retracted articles on PubPeer in November. Sleuth Elisabeth Bik posted about <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0629E5DC52A016ECAEF2062EC909DB">the third</a> after receiving an email tip from an anonymous account.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jain.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="171" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jain.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-130952"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Suman L.

<p>While reviewing a manuscript for the <em>Journal of Organic Chemistry, </em>Caroline Kervarc-Genre and her colleague, Thibault Cantat, researchers at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, noticed something unusual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra buried in the supplementary information had striking irregularities: The baseline was interrupted in some parts, and the noise was the same from one spectrum to the next. “Noise being inherently random, repeating noise is only possible if the spectra are altered [or] fake,” Kervarc-Genre told <em>Retraction Watch</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting to suspect something was wrong, she and Cantat, examined other papers by the lead author. They discovered data appeared to have been edited in several of the author’s latest publications. “The fraud was not subtle,” Kervarc-Genre said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She had never come across such blatant fraud, she said, and was unsure about what to do, so <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=suman+jain">turned to PubPeer</a> to report the findings. Others soon joined, uncovering more troubling patterns in the work.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130951"></span>



<p>In total, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=suman+l+jain">43 papers have been flagged on PubPeer</a>, all sharing a common author: Suman L. Jain, a scientist at the CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum in Dehradun. Published between 2011 and 2024, many of the articles show anomalous spectra, as well as identical noise patterns and missing product characterizations – meaning there is no way of knowing if experiments were done at all, Kervarc-Genre said. In December and January, 10 of the flagged papers, all in journals from the Royal Society of Chemistry, were retracted; seven more from the publisher have received expressions of concern, pending further investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kervarc-Genre said the issues in the papers were often “blatant”. In two, “<a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/D54FDBF9BEAF9BACE6842B0851774B#">Novel Organic‐Inorganic Hybrid Mesoporous Silica Supported Oxo‐Vanadium Schiff Base for Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</a>,” published in <em>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis</em> and “<a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/475CAAF842C6CBC63DF5C328906FEE#">Thiourea dioxide promoted efficient organocatalytic one-pot synthesis of a library of novel heterocyclic compounds</a>,” which appeared in <em>Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry</em>, the sleuths recognized spectra copied from the <a href="https://sdbs.db.aist.go.jp/">Spectral Database for Organic Compounds</a>, a well-known repository in the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to the <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/475CAAF842C6CBC63DF5C328906FEE#">PubPeer comments</a> pointing out the copy-and-paste, Jain wrote she was “extremely sorry”, and said her institute didn’t have the right equipment to perform the experiments at the time.&nbsp; According to Jain, her students obtained the data from other institutes, and she was shown hard copies when the manuscript was being prepared. “These students are now settled in other countries and I have minimum contact information about them,” Jain wrote on PubPeer, adding she was attempting to contact them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper in <em>Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry</em> <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/ob/d4ob90165g">was retracted in January</a>, alongside nine others published in Royal Society of Chemistry journals. In the series of papers, the retraction notices cite duplications and anomalies in the spectra – such as peaks appearing manually added or removed – as well as significant gaps in the data. Some of the retraction notices specify author contributions, with some attributing responsibility for the experimental work to the first authors, often the students in the lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010603016308899">Nickel oxide nanoparticles grafted on reduced graphene oxide (rGO/NiO) as efficient photocatalyst for reduction of nitroaromatics under visible light irradiation</a>”, published in the <em>Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010603024003617">was corrected</a> after a commenter on PubPeer noticed identical noise on the spectra published in the paper. “The authors feel extremely sorry as they have inadvertently made a mistake in data handling…”, the correction states, attributing the noise duplication to a possible “labeling mistake”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213343724010601?via%3Dihub">Synergistic CdS@CeO2 nanocomposites: Harnessing Z-scheme electron transfer for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 conversion and aqueous Cr(VI) reduction</a>,” which appears in the <em>Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering,</em> a PubPeer commenter pointed out peaks appeared to have been manually added onto the spectra, and unexpected blank spots in one of the graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain acknowledged the irregularities, stating on PubPeer she agreed with the concerns and was trying to contact the student responsible for the experiments, who had left her group a year earlier. Then in August 2024, she wrote that she had submitted a correction to the editor, although none appears on the article page. In an email to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, a spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes the journal, said they had not received any request for correction to the article by the authors. However, the publisher is investigating this paper, along with 13 others flagged on PubPeer, that Jain published in Elsevier journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A handful of Jain’s papers flagged on PubPeer were also co-authored by French chemists, Rabah Boukherroub and Sabine Szunerits, recently called out on <em>For Better Science </em><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/12/06/lille-papermille/">for alleged papermilling</a>. Earlier in her career, Jain’s 2009 paper “<a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adsc.200800361">An Efficient Synthesis of Poly(ethylene glycol)-Supported Iron(II) Porphyrin using a Click Reaction and its Application for the Catalytic Olefination of Aldehydes</a>” was also retracted, after a reader discovered a reported reaction hadn’t happened, invalidating the paper’s hypothesis and conclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Suman-Jain-comment.pdf">email to <em>Retraction Watch</em></a>, Jain wrote “this is a most unfortunate situation for me,” and that she was “highly shocked” after receiving notifications on PubPeer and an email regarding an investigation by the Royal Society. of Chemistry. She called it “the most unfortunate part of my life” that the students who performed the experiments had left her group and could no longer be reached. During the manuscript submissions, she described having uploaded the supporting files that her students prepared, without realizing they had manipulated the data. </p>



<p>“I sincerely apologise and accept my mistake that I should check and re-verify the data before submission,” she wrote, adding that until reading the comments on PubPeer, she was “utterly unaware of this unethical act by the students.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain said she felt “afraid to respond on PubPeer” but planned to resubmit each retracted article as a new publication with the raw data to preserve her integrity. She claimed to have already provided corrected results to some journals, adding that for the rest she would “re-perform the reactions… with the help of new students.” She continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>… please believe me. I was completely unaware of these manipulations during the manuscript submission. I could never imagine that students whom I helped a lot during their PhD did this to me, and now, they are not even responding. I feel cheated by the dirty and manipulative students who, just for their selfish purpose, created this trouble for me. I am highly depressed and do not know how to come out of all that.</p>



<p>This situation is an eye-opener for me for the future. I will be extremely careful in data handling from now onwards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We attempted to contact a handful of the students who once worked in Jain’s lab, and were listed as co-authors on the articles issued with retractions or expressions of concern. None have yet responded to our queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with another colleague, Cantat, one of the researchers who first spotted the abnormalities in Jain’s work, contacted editors at 11 journals to report the findings he and Kervarc-Genre had made. Only two replied: the <em>European Journal of Organic Chemistry</em>, which said it would “thoroughly investigate”, but has <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejoc.202201338">yet to take action</a>, and the Royal Society of Chemistry, the publisher which issued the ten retractions in its journals earlier this year.</p>



<p>“We were extremely disappointed in the reaction of the editors and publishers, which was to ignore us, and the data manipulation,” Kervarc-Genre said. “We found it very infuriating that the reviewers and editors had accepted papers that contained some blatant fraud and had clearly not been looked at with enough care.”</p>



<p>The manuscript that first sparked their suspicion never made it into the <em>Journal of Organic Chemistry </em>after Cantat reported his concerns to the handling editor. Instead, a year later, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468823124007442">it resurfaced</a> in <em>Molecular Catalysis</em>, although Cantat said he had not had the time to review the published version.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/02/plos-price-transparency-update-2024/">PLOS Price Transparency Update 2024</a></h4>

              
                <p>We&rsquo;re pleased to once again share our annual reporting from the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/journal-comparison-service/">Plan S Journal Comparison Service</a> to give our community insight into how our publication fees are used to support journal activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Price transparency snapshot for 2023</strong><strong><br></strong>The data in the table below reflects the reporting we provided to the Journal Comparison Service at the end of 2024 covering the year 2023. It&rsquo;s based on the publication fee for a Research Article in each journal at that time and the services we provide for each article we receive (not just those which are ultimately published).</p>



<p>While the price breakdown among the broad categories provided by the framework remains largely the same year to year, we are always innovating to meet the needs of our communities. In 2023 we invested in processes, tools and systems to further support our high publication ethics standards, as well as strengthening our overall digital infrastructure to meet growing submissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there are always variances between journals in line with differences in their editorial models and development stage. Community Development, for example, takes a greater share of the allocation for our newer journals as we continue to establish those journals in their respective fields. We encourage you to look back at our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">original post</a> for more detail on key differences between our journal models.</p>



<p>You can find our full report from the framework in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lCMVh4s5lhhBvD3I33AasGtIq-i2u8DR/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=116331873531812821923&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond the APC</strong><strong><br></strong>While the data above are based on the standard publication fee for each journal, PLOS has long been working to reimagine more equitable and sustainable <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/models/">models for open access publishing</a> that do not rely on APCs. Each of our journals are currently supported by institutional business models to address different challenges such as the high-cost of selective publishing and regional economic disparities.</p>



<p>As a non-profit organization, PLOS also works alongside researchers, librarians, and funders to redefine publishing norms and effect positive change. In 2024 we received three major grants to advance this work: a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/12/plos-receives-3-3m-grant-to-support-open-access-publishing-business-model-transformation/">3-year funding package from the Gates Foundation</a> which will support PLOS during our transition to APC-free publishing and funding support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation launching our 18-month <a href="https://plos.org/redefining-publishing/">Research and Design project</a> which seeks to transform publishing models to ensure that science is open, recognized, and accessible to all. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;re excited to provide updates on the R&amp;D project throughout the year. You can also find more information about our finances and strategic initiatives on our <a href="http://plos.org/financial-overview">Financial Overview </a>page.</p>

<p><em>Retraction Watch readers are likely familiar with the work of Charles Piller, an award-winning investigative reporter who has been covering problematic research in neuroscience and other fields for </em>Science<em>. We&#8217;re pleased to offer an excerpt of his new book, </em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Doctored/Charles-Piller/9781668031247">Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer&#8217;s</a><em>, which publishes today</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <em>Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease (JPAD) </em>seems authoritative and looks prestigious. Its sponsors are Springer, a division of Springer Nature, one of the largest scientific publishers, and the annual Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Congress—a major, global scientific meeting. Many doctors rely on <em>JPAD </em>when deciding whether to prescribe amyloid-reducing drugs such as Leqembi, or others to fight agitation or anxiety that can accompany Alzheimer’s dementia.</p>



<p>Matthew Schrag first raised an eyebrow about the journal in August 2021 while examining possible misconduct in studies behind Cassava Sciences’ simufilam for the citizen petition to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The prior year, <em>JPAD </em>had published a paper by Cassava’s Lindsay Burns and Hoau-Yan Wang that suggested strong potential for the drug. It said simufilam lowered key biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s—particularly tau proteins—in the spinal fluid of patients who were volunteers for the company’s clinical trial. That paper helped boost confidence in Cassava and simufilam.</p>



<span id="more-130610"></span>



<p>Schrag thought an image central to its experimental findings looked strange. A single band of a western blot depicting the presence of tau seemed to have been copied and pasted into the larger image. He emailed his doubts to <em>JPAD </em>editors in September 2021. Bruno Vellas, a French neuroscientist and then coeditor-in-chief, handled the query. He seemed a curious respondent, because Vellas and Wang coauthored a similar 2017 article in another journal. It too showed biomarker benefits from simu- filam. Schrag thought that it too showed strong signs of image doctoring; that paper would be retracted in 2022.</p>



<p>Soon after, Schrag asked ethics administrators at Springer to examine the matter, and coeditor-in-chief Paul Aisen of the University of Southern California took over the complaint. Vellas also stepped down as coeditor-in-chief. Independently, I confirmed Schrag’s findings with image-integrity specialists and Alzheimer’s researchers who were not affiliated with <em>JPAD</em>. Yet eleven months after Schrag raised his concern, Cassava issued a press release saying <em>JPAD </em>had exonerated the paper. Aisen later told Schrag that they had run the images by experts familiar with western blots, rather than a forensic-image analyst. The article helped smooth simufilam’s glide path to late-stage human trials.</p>



<p>Schrag noticed University of Nevada neuroscientist Jeffrey Cummings among its editorial board members. Cummings, an authority on Alzheimer’s trials and amyloid hypothesis advocate, had with Harvard’s Dennis Selkoe sharply criticized my 2022 “<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease">Blots on a Field</a>?” article in <em>Science </em>about the influential study by Sylvain Lesné and Karen Ashe. The same story described concerns about Cassava’s work. As of April 2024, Cummings was a long-standing paid member of Cassava Sciences’ advisory board.</p>



<p>According to federal records, Cummings augments his income—by nearly $1 million in personal fees and travel in the last few years alone—consulting for a laundry list of big and small Alzheimer’s companies, including Cassava, Biogen, Eisai, Alzheon, and Acadia.</p>



<p>Other top <em>JPAD </em>editors show similar issues. Vellas has received consulting fees from Eisai and others. Aisen has been paid more than $100,000 since 2016 by makers of anti-amyloid drugs. As head of a clinical research center, he has pulled in tens of millions of corporate dollars to test such drugs. Another editor, Brown University’s Stephen Salloway, took $170,000 in fees and $25 million in research support. Others on the journal’s editorial board show similar figures. Current and former Biogen and Eisai employees have actually served on that board.</p>



<p>Anti-amyloid drugs from those companies and others often have received favorable coverage in <em>JPAD </em>in papers written by Cummings, Aisen, Vellas, and Salloway. Their articles supported the companies’ arguments that their drugs enjoyed a sound scientific foundation at critical junctures in the development and regulatory process.</p>



<p>Biogen and Eisai’s drug Aduhelm became a fiasco that never achieved full federal approval. Yet <em>JPAD</em>’s “‘expert panel’ produced ‘appropriate use recommendations’ for aducanumab [Aduhelm] before the clinical trials of [Aduhelm] had even been published,” Schrag noted in his analysis. “Five of the six members of this panel were paid by Biogen and/or Eisai,” the drug’s makers. They included Salloway and Cummings. “This was not disclosed in the abstract or main text, but only in fine print at the end of the article,” Schrag added.</p>



<p>Like any normal journal, <em>JPAD </em>relies on peer review to ensure accuracy and scientific relevance. Unpaid, ostensibly unbiased and skeptical experts critique each submission. Peer reviewers nearly always request clarifications or changes to sharpen and improve a manuscript. Such reviews and corrections, required for acceptance of a paper, typically take weeks and can last several months. The delays understandably frustrate authors, but high-quality reviews of complex science take time. The <em>Nature </em>journals—among the world’s most respected—average 213 days from submission to acceptance. The <em>Science </em>journals move at a comparable pace, 202 days. <em>JPAD</em>’s “peer reviewed” guidelines for Aduhelm took eight days, including a US holiday.</p>



<p>Schrag wondered how fast <em>JPAD </em>generally completed peer reviews, examining the dates manuscripts were submitted and approved. Some cases involving Cummings and his affiliated companies proceeded at an improbable clip. The Cassava biomarker study took seven days. A favorable 2016 study of the anti-amyloid drug tramiprosate, coauthored by Vellas, Cummings, and Serge Gauthier, another coeditor-in-chief, took just six. The drug’s maker, Alzheon, paid all three of those scientists for consulting at the time, and they served on its advisory board.</p>



<p>“This casts a shadow on the whole publishing and peer review process,” said Donna Wilcock, the Indiana University neuroscientist and chief editor of <em>Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia</em>, who examined a dossier Schrag prepared about <em>JPAD</em>. “Anytime you get a paper that is accepted within a week of being received, I guarantee it’s not been peer reviewed.” Wilcock worries about the <em>JPAD </em>guidelines for prescribing anti-amyloid antibodies, she said. “That’s what all of us are using to guide our clinical programs. If they are not undergoing peer review, as advertised, then you’ve got to question the robustness of those papers.”</p>



<p>Cummings also has described his own credentials in an unorthodox way. The physician prominently notes a ScD degree in his biographical materials—reinforcing his credibility as a researcher. He fails to mention that his undergraduate alma mater, the University of Wyoming Laramie, bestowed the ScD in 2011 as an honorary degree. He replied to my query about this via <em>JPAD </em>editor Jacques Touchon, who noted that the university found Cummings’s voluminous writings “worthy of an advanced degree.” According to the university registrar, “An honorary degree was given to [Cummings] in 2011 based off his contributions to his profession. Honorary degrees are not noted on official transcripts.”</p>



<p>A 2018 <em>JPAD </em>article suggested that pimavanserin, a drug to treat psychosis among Alzheimer’s patients, was effective. The manuscript cleared peer review the same day <em>JPAD </em>editors received it. Public disclosures show that afterward, Cummings—the first listed author—received about $65,000 in various fees from its developer, Acadia Pharmaceuticals. The journal accepted a second paper extolling the benefits of the drug for patients with “pronounced psychotic symptoms” on the day received.</p>



<p>According to Schrag’s analysis, <em>JPAD </em>published 129 research articles, including expert statements and drug-use guidelines, between 2019 and 2021. When one of the journal’s editors-in-chief—including Vellas, Aisen, and Gauthier—coauthored a paper, submission to acceptance averaged about twenty-three days, compared to a still-brisk fifty-two days for other papers.</p>



<p>“It raises questions about whether this journal is a fair and legitimate venue for the dissemination of scientific results, or . . . a personal platform for selected editors and their allies,” Schrag noted in his analysis.</p>



<p>I forwarded Schrag’s concerns and my own questions to all of the concerned editors. They sent a joint reply that they review quality and police conflicts of interest rigorously. Pharma company leaders, they said, “are among the most knowledgeable experts in the field and contribute important perspectives,” and that editors from Biogen and Eisai do not “review clinical trial results due to potential conflict of interest.” <em>JPAD </em>relies on declarations by authors to avoid such conflicts, the editors said, noting that “statistically, we have good reason to believe that we are in the right.” </p>



<p>Vellas denied receiving personal compensation from Alzheon, although he disclosed receiving “fees and/or stock options” from the company in the pages of <em>JPAD </em>itself within a favorable article, in 2017, about that company’s drug tramiprosate. In November 2023, Vellas said he had asked his assistant to put in corrections to his own journal, and to others in which he said he had accidentally disclosed payments from Biogen that were not received. Seven months later, no corrections had been posted.</p>



<p>Regarding the ultrafast peer review process for themselves, they noted, “because the editors-in-chief and board members lead some of the most important clinical and research centers in the field, it is unsurprising that some papers from their teams are of high value and readily judged to be publishable [and] accepted quickly due to their quality, originality, or importance.” They added: “We do not give priority to anyone.”</p>



<p>Jason Karlawish, an eminent ethicist and Alzheimer’s expert at the University of Pennsylvania, and <em>JPAD</em>’s ethics editor from its inception through 2020, declined to comment about any of these matters. “My experiences were precisely none,” he said about his work at the journal. “It was one of those roles that never moved on from a title.”</p>

<p>The majority of the editorial board of a top psychology journal have resigned en masse after the publisher replaced the journal’s editors without warning. Also departing are the honorary editor and statistical consultants.</p>



<p>The journal, <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em>, is a Karger title and “the official journal of the International College of Psychosomatic Medicine and the World Federation for Psychotherapy,” according to its <a href="https://karger.com/pps#home-affiliations">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christna Chap, head of editorial development for Karger, called the change in the journal’s leadership a “normal editorial transition” which “may have been misunderstood by some members of the community, leading them to criticize the journal and encourage others to do the same based on incorrect information.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130926"></span>



<p>“We are concerned about these actions,” Chap said, “but look forward to shortly appointing new leadership for the Editorial Board of <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em> with whom we will work closely to define the next developmental stage of the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">catalogued</a> mass editorial resignations from at least 20 other scientific journals since 2023, for a variety of reasons. With publishers increasingly adopting a business model of charging article processing fees and aiming to publish more articles, editors have grown concerned about quality and stress on the peer review process, as our Ivan Oransky <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/scientific-journal-editors-mass-resignations/">recently explained on Science Friday</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em> boasts an impact factor of 16.3 and CiteScore of 29.4, with an acceptance rate of 14%. In a December 10 <a href="https://karger.com/pps/article/doi/10.1159/000542491/917390/The-Journal-s-Appreciation">editorial</a>, Jenny Guidi and Fiametta Cosci, then the editors in chief, wrote that the journal&#8217;s impact factor ranked it fourth among psychiatry journals and the same among psychology journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The day after the editorial was published, Karger’s publication manager notified Guidi by email that her contract would not be renewed at the end of its term, and “it was time for the journal to take a new direction,” Guidi told Retraction Watch. Her access to the submission system had already been revoked. She emailed Karger’s chairwoman and the company CEO asking for clarification, “since it all had happened without justified reasons,” but didn’t receive an answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was fired about seven months before contract termination,” Guidi said. She called the episode a “deplorable, unexpected situation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cosci, an associate professor at the University of Florence in Italy, resigned from her role, and is now editor in chief of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-psychosomatic-research/about/editorial-board"><em>Journal of Psychosomatic Research</em></a>, an Elsevier title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karger replaced Guidi, Cosci and their assistant editors with an employee as managing editor, according to Giovanni Fava, honorary editor of the journal. Fava served as editor in chief for 30 years, and in 2022 handed off the role to Guidi and Cosci as his chosen successors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karger’s decision to replace the editorial leadership “was taken without consulting me and the editorial board,” Fava said. In response, he, the journal&#8217;s statistical consultants, and 70% of the editorial board members resigned, according to a comparison of the journal’s <a href="https://karger.com/PPS/pages/editorial-board">current editorial board listing</a> and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240912135555/https://karger.com/pps/pages/editorial-board">archived version of the webpage</a> from last September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The event is in line with the growing attacks of publishers to the independence of editors and editorial board which led to mass resignations in other journals,” Fava said. He cited <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">previous coverage</a> by Retraction Watch of editorial mass resignations as showing “corporate interests … disregard the work of scientists who spend their time and energies for preserving intellectual freedom and the ethics of publishing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fava described “frictions” between the journal editors and publisher, such as “the very slow production time and its quality,” and the publication manager’s desire to start issuing calls for papers and commissioning articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher’s production issues delayed the publication of articles and release of issues, Guidi said, and led to “inconsistencies and gross errors.” The publication manager also proposed strategies such as instituting special issues and using computerized tools to automatically find reviewers. The proposed strategies “did not apply to our top journal, or eventually run counter [to] its unique identity and intellectual freedom,” Guidi said. “Therefore, I generally denied those proposals, based on well-founded scientific reasons.”</p>



<p>Cosci said she “had a positive experience” at Karger. “I was not involved in any steps following my resignation thus I have nothing to say about my colleagues&#8217; decision to resign en masse,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics’</em> reputation, and the efforts of its editors, submissions to the journal had decreased in the last five years, “to the point of regularly experiencing difficulties having enough content to publish new issues at the scheduled times,” Chap said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Cosci’s resignation and Guidi’s contract ending, Chap said, “in light of the continuing difficulties the journal was experiencing, we informed Professor Guidi within the standard notice period that we would not renew her contract at its conclusion.” The publisher “first informed Professor Guidi, then the Editorial Board, and the affiliated societies who collaborate with the Karger-owned journal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is to be expected that a change in editorship comes with changes to the editorial board,” Chap said, “in particular when a number of the members have worked with the journal and the former Editors for more than 10 years.” She said it was “great to see” about 30% of the editorial board members remaining, and some were suggesting candidates for the next editor in chief. “Karger is also currently working closely with the affiliated societies on the journal’s future, including receiving their recommendation for a potential candidate,” Chap said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editorial board “did not get any announcement from the publisher” about the journal’s change in leadership, Richard Balon, an editorial board member from Wayne State University in Detroit, Mich, told Retraction Watch. He learned of the decision “through the grapevine” and contacted Karger leadership for an explanation. The answers he got were “very vague,” he said, and “suggested that they would like to take the journal in some new direction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balon resigned because he felt he and the entire editorial board “was ignored and not given any information (after years of free service),” he disagreed with Guidi’s firing, and was suspicious about Cosci’s departure. He also said he did not understand what the publisher’s desired “new direction” meant, given the journal’s strong metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have the feeling that the bottom line is not going to be the excellent quality of the journal, but money,” Balon said. “I have worked for other journals/publishers who treat their editors and editorial boards better.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Massimo Biondi, a professor emeritus of the Sapienza University of Rome in Italy, also said he resigned from the editorial board because the publisher gave them “no meaningful response” and “no information about a sudden change.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We, and the institutions we represent, do not deserve such a treatment from the Publisher,” he said. </p>



<p>“What happened to <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em> is certainly astonishing, particularly in view of its reputation and scientific standards,” Guidi said. She was “impressed” by the mass resignation, she said. “This is a sign of the intellectual values that we share and should be preserved despite adversities.”</p>

<p>The first weeks of the second Trump administration have brought unprecedented <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276342/nsf-freezes-grant-review-trump-executive-orders-dei-science">shock and awe</a> to science. In response, the leaders of the scientific community must cease their hand-wringing and align behind two strong approaches to dealing with the chaos: protest and candor.</p>



<p>I write these words as an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/16/guest-post-when-whistleblowers-need-lawyers/">attorney representing whistleblowers of scientific fraud</a>. Prior to law school, I was an <a href="https://eugeniereichlaw.com/plastic-fantastic/">investigative journalist</a> focused on this same phenomenon. Today I represent scientists and technical experts independent of whether the falsified data they have uncovered support a political agenda. Twenty years of experience investigating, exposing and, when necessary, litigating cases of scientific fraud, has, however, led me to think in terms of a different kind of politics: the politics of nonconfirmatory data. Any research-based organization – a university, a healthcare provider, a laboratory or a corporation – faces a daily challenge from data gathered by scientists within that contradict the scientific hypotheses that are bringing in the money.</p>



<span id="more-130931"></span>



<p>Shock and awe disruptions exacerbate this problem.&nbsp; Too often in cases of scientific fraud, I observe a pattern of facts in which one or more experimentalists or data analysts were under severe pressure to deliver a result, while suffering from job insecurity. This can originate with the short-term nature of early career positions, or with a laboratory or institution being in a state of rapid change. Scientists do not do well facing existential job threats, because the natural pace of science is incremental. Facing setbacks in their experiments or their analysis, scientists need time to think, not reasons to hustle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only individual integrity, but professional and institutional stability, are necessary for most scientists to have a fully objective response when the data they have spent thousands of hours collecting imply that it is time to start over.&nbsp; Most also need a minimum level of job security to feel safe speaking up about failure to reproduce the results of others who are prominent in their fields of study.</p>



<p>Those who hold secure positions in scientific leadership must educate the public about this issue. Abrupt disruptions may deliver the advice a politician wants in the short term, but they will also fail to deliver the products the country wants, the medical treatments it needs and effective solutions to our problems. In the long term, the economy and technological progress will stall in a country where scientists are afraid to tell the truth about their data.</p>



<p>Yet this message is not enough. Leaders of the scientific community must also acknowledge missteps – both their own and of their peers. In my experience,&nbsp; many scientists who start out critical of the claims of others but who later identify as whistleblowers, even working with a lawyer such as myself, do so reluctantly only because authors, journals and scientific institutions have failed to respond to direct, well-evidenced allegations appropriately, or have <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/when-scholars-sue-their-accusers">made legal threats to silence them</a>.</p>



<p>Over time, denying and downplaying fraud is not only keeping my shop in business, it is producing a reserve of ammunition for those who misguidedly seek to control scientific results for political purposes.&nbsp; Scientific leadership must begin rolling, proactive disclosures of unaddressed issues now. They must also commit to proactively disclose new issues as they arise and before they escalate into weapons that the enemies of science can deploy against it. A whistleblower or a critic with concerns should be seen by leadership as an opportunity to stand tall and demonstrate an ability to listen and engage, not an inconvenient voice to muzzle.</p>

                During his confirmation hearings this week, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he would promote vaccines as HHS secretary, despite a long history of promoting anti-vax positions.

<p>Sage has retracted 416 articles from the <em>Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems (JIFS),</em> which had a mass retraction of over 450 papers last August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the mass retraction last year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/exclusive-publisher-retracts-more-than-450-papers-from-journal-it-acquired-last-year/">which we covered</a>, Sage paused publication of new articles from the journal, which it <a href="https://group.sagepub.com/press-releases/sage-grows-research-portfolio-by-acquiring-ios-press?_gl=1*1ol2wiz*_gcl_au*Mzc3MDgzNTM5LjE3MjQzMjE2OTg.*_ga*MTg4Mjc2NDY3MS4xNjQ5MTUxMTc3*_ga_60R758KFDG*MTcyNDMyMTY5OC4yMjUuMC4xNzI0MzIxNjk4LjYwLjAuMA..&amp;format=amp">acquired</a> when it bought IOS Press in 2023. The journal is now accepting new submissions, according to a Sage spokesperson. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219434">retraction notice</a> mentions citation and referencing “anomalies,” “incoherent, extraneous text and tortured phrases” and “unverifiable authors and reviewers,” among other signs of misconduct. “These indicators raise concerns about the authenticity of the research and the peer review process underlying the following articles. The Publisher regrets that these were not flagged during the journal’s editorial and peer review processes,” the notice reads.</p>



<p>Most of the researchers are from universities in India and China.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130922"></span>



<p>The notice also credits the Problematic Paper Screener’s (PPS)&nbsp; “Feet of Clay,” a detector which flags articles citing retracted material. The <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31">detector</a> makes use of the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a>, which is now part of Crossref. Guillaume Cabanac, the sleuth who created the PPS, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/exclusive-publisher-retracts-more-than-450-papers-from-journal-it-acquired-last-year/">told Retraction Watch</a> in August the retractions “will feed the Feet of Clay even more” as information is collected by metadata providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that time, Feet of Clay had flagged 674 papers by <em>JIFS,</em> not all of which had been retracted. The number is now <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:%5CJournal%20of%20Intelligent%20%26%20Fuzzy%20Systems%5C">up to 716</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to suspicion of “citation stacking,” Clarivate did not give the journal an impact factor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">in 2020</a>. And in 2021, IOS Press retracted <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/14/publisher-retracts-nearly-80-articles-over-three-days/">nearly 50 articles</a> from <em>JIFS</em> for “literature sources that have no relation to the subject matter of the citing article,” according to the <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219218">notice</a>.</p>



<p>The editor in chief of the journal, <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/langari-reza.html">Reza Langari of Texas A&amp;M</a> University in College Station,&nbsp; resigned last June. He told us at the time his decision was “due to differences of opinion on how to proceed.” He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Langari-comment.pdf">told us</a> growth in the AI field, which the journal covers, meant they received over 10,000 submissions in 2023 and rejected over 80% of them, “some of which were clearly manufactured by paper mills or else using AI tools.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage was aware of issues with the journal before acquiring IOS Press, the publisher’s spokesperson said in August:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For any new journal we take on, we use our resources to make sure we’re publishing at a high standard and in accordance with COPE. If there are any issues with specific journals then we’ll take corrective action as needed.</p>
