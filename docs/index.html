<p>A professor at the University of Pittsburgh who sued the institution for racial discrimination and retaliation has refiled his suit after a federal judge dismissed his claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/11/author-of-paper-on-covid-19-and-jade-amulets-sues-employer-for-mental-anguish-discrimination/">previously reported</a>, <a href="https://www.sph.pitt.edu/directory/moses-bility">Moses Bility</a>, an assistant professor of infectious diseases and microbiology in the university’s School of Public Health, sued the school earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among many claims of racial discrimination, Bility alleged the school’s response to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720363592">2020 paper</a> he published and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/11/16/co-authors-of-paper-on-covid-19-and-jade-amulets-blames-the-online-press-and-social-media-for-misinterpretation-in-retraction-letter/">later withdrew</a> that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/29/amulets-may-prevent-covid-19-says-a-paper-in-elsevier-journal-they-dont/">proposed jade amulets may prevent COVID-19</a> was discriminatory. (In the process of our previous reporting on the article, Bility <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Gmail-STOTEN-paper.pdf">accused</a> Retraction Watch of racism.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Bility’s complaint, Pitt officials demanded an investigation of his research, which found he “did not violate any academic integrity standard.” However, at a departmental town hall meeting over Zoom, presenting the investigation’s findings, “students in Defendant Pitt’s School of Public Health called Dr. Bility derogatory names, such as stupid, retarded, unintelligent, etc.” Bility later received two emails “from anonymous individuals who Dr. Bility assumes came from the Defendant Pitt community” that included racial slurs.  </p>



<span id="more-128298"></span>



<p>Bility also alleges the school denied his application for tenure as retaliation for his complaints of discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pitt and two administrators named in the suit, the former and current deans of the School of Public Health, filed a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> the case in August. Last month, the judge assigned to the case granted that motion, but allowed Bility to update and refile his complaint. He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/28-second-amended-complaint.pdf">did so</a> earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/26-dismissal-opinion.pdf">opinion</a>, Judge Marilyn J. Horan wrote that Bility had not established that the majority of the claimed discriminatory acts were connected to his race.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Horan wrote that Bility’s allegations the school denied his application for tenure as retaliation was “conclusory,” and “not enough to suggest that there is a causal relationship between his formal complaints about racial discrimination and the denial of his tenure.” She wrote:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The substantial passage of time between his formal discrimination complaints and the tenure decisions does not support or even suggest that any causal connection existed between the alleged protected activity and the tenure decision.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to our request for comment, Bility’s lawyer, <a href="https://www.ohanlonschwartz.com/about-us/">Steven O’Hanlon</a> of the firm O’Hanlon Schwartz, pointed us to the updated complaint Bility filed on November 8. The new complaint alleges Pitt informed him his employment will end in August 2024.</p>



<p>Pitt’s lawyer <a href="https://marcus-shapira.com/attorneys/jonathan-d-marcus/">Jonathan Marcus</a>, of the firm Marcus &amp; Shapira (no connection to Retraction Watch co-founder Adam Marcus), declined to comment.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Pinaki Saha will talk about his work in the talk entitled &quot;Olfaction prediction using 3DCNN and molecular electron density.&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is a complex and poorly understood phenomenon that
involves the interaction of odorant molecules with olfactory receptors. The molecular
structure and properties of odorants determine their affinity and specificity for
different olfactory receptors, and thus their perceived odor quality and intensity. In
this presentation, I talk about a novel approach for olfaction prediction based on 3D
convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) and promolecule electron density of odorant
molecules.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crabs-left-sea-several-times-evolution">Crabs left the sea not once, but several times, in their evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Most terrestrial plants and animals left the ocean a single time in their evolutionary history to live ashore. But crabs have seemingly scuttled out of the sea more than a dozen times, with at least two groups later reverting back to a marine lifestyle, a study finds.</p>



<p>The research, published November 6 in <em>Systematic Biology</em>, sheds new light on <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syad066/7370615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the evolutionary history of the group Brachyura</a>, which includes roughly 7,600 species of “true crabs,” and includes the most comprehensive evolutionary tree yet created for the group. And the study offers clues about how other early invertebrates may have evolved a terrestrial lifestyle, researchers say.</p>





<p>Unlike for well-studied animals such as birds and mammals, a unified crab tree of life has been lacking, says Kristin Hultgren, an invertebrate zoologist at Seattle University. “While the authors have developed a useful framework for understanding the complexity of transitioning to terrestrial life, one of the most important contributions is the extensive, well-dated evolutionary tree.”</p>



<p>Crabs are an extremely diverse group and have colonized nearly every type of habitat on Earth. It’s been a challenge to study when crabs first shifted from one habitat to another during evolution because, like some other invertebrates, crabs don’t have the extensive fossil trail that early vertebrates do, says Joanna Wolfe, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University.</p>



<p>Past research has also often treated marine, freshwater and land crabs as discrete subgroups when they’re more like a continuum, Wolfe says. “They’re not distinct and actually have a lot in common, and looking at them together helps trace their evolution.”</p>



<p>Wolfe and her colleagues collected genetic data from 333 species of crabs in the group Brachyura. These crustaceans are evolutionarily distinct from, although closely related to, another group of crustaceans that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/copy-crab-dna-confirms-crab-forms-have-several-origins">independently evolved crablike bodies</a> and are often erroneously referred to as crabs, including animals like the hermit and king crabs.</p>



<p>The team then combined that genetic data with dozens of fossils to generate a crab evolutionary tree, layering on details about each species’ life history and adaptations for living on land to reconstruct a possible timeline of when crabs colonized drier ground.</p>



<p>True crabs diverged from other crustacean lineages roughly 230 million years ago during the Triassic Period, the researchers found, refining previous estimates. Over the next hundred or so million years, brachyurans diversified widely during a period previously dubbed the “Cretaceous crab revolution.”</p>



<p>The study also showed that during their evolution, crabs appear to have adapted to a more terrestrial lifestyle as many as 17 times, either by shifting from the ocean to the intertidal zone or similarly salty habitats like mangroves, or by colonizing freshwater estuaries and rivers on route to land. In at least two cases, crabs reverted to a marine lifestyle long after they’d left.</p>



<p>The amount of times that crabs independently left the ocean is “astonishing,” says Katie Davis, an evolutionary paleobiologist at the University of York in England who was not involved in the research. “And it&#8217;s really fantastic that molecular biology, fossils and modern numerical techniques can be combined to provide insight into previously unanswerable questions.”</p>



<p>The study also hints at what other early arthropods that ventured onto the land may have been like, Wolfe says. Past studies have shown that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2004.2917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crabs and insects share a common, if unknown, aquatic ancestor</a>. By looking at the types of crabs that successfully left the ocean, it’s possible to guess at what adaptations early insects might have needed to do the same. Modern crabs living out of the water today, for example, excel at keeping themselves from drying out and have limited their dependence on water for reproduction.</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re going to be the first proto-insect to come out of the ocean … you’re probably going to need those kinds of adaptations,” Wolfe says.</p>

<p>After his father’s unexpected death from alcohol use disorder in 2017, evolutionary biologist Noah Whiteman undertook a journey to understand how nature’s toxins affect the world. The result is his debut book, <em>Most Delicious Poison: The Story of Nature’s Toxins — From Spices to Vices</em>.</p>



<p>The book weeds through chemistry, evolution and world history to explore the origins of toxins and how humans have co-opted them for everything from medicines to spices to pesticides. “The chemicals in these products of nature are not a sideshow — they are the main event,” Whiteman writes, “and we’ve unwittingly stolen them from a war raging all around us.”</p>





<p>That tussle, part of what Charles Darwin called the “war of nature,” is the innovative ways plants and animals continuously evolve traits that one-up their predators or competitors. Many of the chemicals that we stock in our cabinets and pharmacies, for instance, originated in plants as deterrents against insects snacking on them, Whiteman points out. These chemicals act on our brains and bodies thanks to the surprising neurological similarities between insects and humans.</p>



<p>Whiteman, who studies how insects adapt to plant toxins, is a knowledgeable tour guide through this greenhouse of poisons and cures. And it is a greenhouse. Though people put some animal-made toxins to use, the plant derivatives steal the show.</p>



<p>Chrysanthemums with their insecticidal compound, pyrethrin, make an appearance in the book, as do terpenoid-wafting pines, calming chamomile and morphine-like water lilies. To tame the tangle of chemicals and their interactions, Whiteman dedicates each chapter to a couple of toxin classes and lays out their source in the natural world, their chemical mechanisms and historical context for their use by people.</p>



<p>Take tannins. They show up in a wide array of plants, including oaks, tea plants and grapes. Whiteman muses that these chemical compounds may protect plants by inhibiting the ability of microbes and herbivores to absorb nutrients. Tannins also bind to salivary proteins, resulting in the “rough, dry puckering sensation” that many people enjoy while sipping a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Humans have also long put the protein-binding properties of tannins to use in tanning animal hides for leather. For nearly 1,500 years, Europe and then its colonies relied on ink manufactured from tannin-rich oak galls for drafting important documents, including the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most important role of toxins in the human world can be found in our pantries and medicine cabinets. Whiteman focuses on pharmacological heavyweights such as the antimalarial drug quinine, derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, and salicylates, such as aspirin and oil of wintergreen. Curare, cocaine and scopolamine demonstrate how we’ve wrangled these alkaloids into anesthetics. It’s one of many instances where Whiteman nods to Indigenous communities around the world that have been repeatedly exploited or gone uncompensated for their medicinal discoveries.</p>



<p>“It is no wonder that many countries in Latin America and elsewhere in the global tropics now have biopiracy laws that strictly regulate the export of natural products,” Whiteman notes.</p>



<p>Whiteman closes by examining how medieval Europe’s lust for spices catapulted the world into five centuries of geopolitical upheaval. The Columbian exchange, the Opium Wars and the founding of the East India Company are all pit stops along Whiteman’s exploration of how the pursuit of all things psychoactive and medicinal fueled European colonialism. The lasting consequences, Whiteman argues, include infringement on Indigenous rights, global biodiversity loss and the climate crisis.</p>



<p>The opioid epidemic and alcohol use disorder also loom large in the book. Here, Whiteman’s assertion that our use of toxins “walk[s] a knife’s edge between healing and harm” is loudest. His father haunts many of the personal anecdotes sprinkled throughout the 304-page read. Whether he’s recalling the toxicology report from his father’s autopsy or noting his family’s fondness for black pepper, Whiteman explores grief as much as he does science: “My attempt to grasp why [my father] died allowed me to identify and then draw together the many ways that nature’s toxins affect the world.” </p>



<p>Personal and well-researched, <em>Most Delicious Poison</em> has wide appeal, in part, as Whiteman points out, because indulging in nature’s toxins “is an essential part of what it means to be human.” So go ahead. Pour a cup of herbal tea, add some drops of lavender oil to the diffuser and enjoy this mind-bending read.</p>

<p>P.P.C. Graziadei and J.F. Metcalf of Florida State University have been producing … ever more detailed, evidence for olfactory nerve regeneration in mammals…. Might olfactory nerves be regenerated in people who have trouble smelling, thereby restoring or improving their sense of smell? “The phenomena of regeneration are applicable to all vertebrates and most likely to humans,” says Graziadei.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update </h4>



<p>The scientists’ hunch was right on the nose: The human cells that detect scent information and send it to the brain can replenish themselves, though exactly how is unclear. Experimental therapies to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-smell-sense-loss-olfactory-training-treatment">help people who have lost their sense of smell due to COVID-19</a> could help researchers figure it out (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 14</em>). Smell training, which involves regularly and deeply smelling various scents, might rewire cells’ connections to the brain or stimulate new cell growth. Treating damaged cells with steroids and blood plasma might aid healing. More invasive treatments such as nasal lining transplants aim to boost regenerative stem cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breast-cancer-drug-tamoxifen-less-effective-africans">Why a popular breast cancer drug may be less effective for some Africans</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — A genetic variant commonly found in some Africans may stymie the effects of a popular breast cancer drug.</p>



<p>The variant produces a sluggish version of the enzyme known to activate tamoxifen. People who inherit two copies of the variant show five times less active drug in their bloodstreams compared with people who don’t have that variant, researchers reported November 2 at the American Society of Human Genetics’ annual meeting. As a result, many of these patients may receive a dose that’s insufficient to treat their cancer.</p>





<p>The gene, called <em>CYP2D6</em>, that produces the crucial enzyme differs dramatically among people. On average, a fifth of Africans carry at least one copy of the variant that the researchers studied. Across the continent, however, that figure ranges from a slim 5 percent to over 34 percent.</p>



<p>Preemptive genetic screening that identifies patients with the genetic variant would probably cost too much for local clinics and hospitals, says molecular geneticist Comfort Kanji, who is based at the African Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology in Harare, Zimbabwe. But he imagines that his team’s findings could inspire clinical trials that test larger starting doses of tamoxifen in heavily affected groups.</p>



<p>Kanji and his colleagues collected daily blood samples from 42 Zimbabweans taking tamoxifen. Some of the participants had one copy of the variant, while others had two. A third group had a different version of the gene with no known effect on the enzyme. The differences in how they metabolized the medication emerged right away and remained for the duration of the monthlong experiment.</p>



<p>Doubling the prescribed amount of the drug for participants with two copies of the variant, the researchers found, brought levels of active drug in the blood back to normal — and with few short-term consequences.</p>



<p>The study provides powerful results despite a small sample size, says David Twesigomwe, a pharmacogeneticist at the Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience in Johannesburg who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>It offers a clear-cut case for metabolic screening, he says. Even as comprehensive genetic testing remains out of reach for many Africans, he believes simpler, narrower tests could do the trick, potentially laying the foundation for clinicians to incorporate screening more widely in treatment.</p>



<p>Each year, around 200,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa receive diagnoses of breast cancer. Fewer than<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15353702211006047" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 40 percent survive for longer than five years</a> past their diagnosis, unlike 86 percent in the United States. The main reason is that many patients in Africa struggle to access or afford treatment, and as a result show up to clinics with late-stage cancers. This new finding is unlikely to turn those cases around, but it could help make timely care more effective, Kanji says.</p>



<p>Worldwide, about 30 percent of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer — the most common type — <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304383507001541?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show little improvement on tamoxifen</a>. That proportion is even higher among African women, Kanji says. The prevalence of the studied gene variant, or others with a similar effect, could offer a partial explanation.</p>



<p>A separate study would be required to see if the findings extend to African Americans, Kanji and Twesigomwe both say. In the United States, Black women are 40 percent more likely to die of breast cancer— with about 28 deaths per 100,000 for Black women compared with 20 per 100,000 for white women — despite a similar rate of diagnosis.</p>



<p>Experts caution that the reasons why are multifaceted, including biological, sociological and historical. The role that a variant of <em>CYP2D6</em> plays may constitute a sliver of a sliver.</p>





<p>The enzyme that the gene generates metabolizes more than just tamoxifen. It’s responsible for breaking down many other drugs, including opioids, beta-blockers and a common class of antidepressant drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. That means that people with different variants of the gene may respond better or worse to those medications too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bonobos-humans-cooperation-evolution">Bonobos, like humans, cooperate with unrelated members of other groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans regularly cooperate and share resources with other, unrelated humans in different social groups, often without any immediate, reciprocated benefits. The phenomenon has been considered unique to our species. But some bonobos appear to share this social trait, a study finds.</p>



<p>This type of cooperation is thought to underpin human civilization. So bonobos’ ability to <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg0844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bond and cooperate with groups of nonrelatives</a> across group boundaries, even when there’s no immediate payoff, may provide some insight into the kinds of evolutionary conditions that led to the development of humankind’s large-scale societies, researchers report November 16 in <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Both chimpanzees (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>) and bonobos (<em>P. paniscus</em>) live in social groups with individuals that may not be very closely related. But compared with territorial and aggressive chimpanzees, bonobos have a more easygoing, tolerant attitude toward other groups. Bonobos occasionally groom and share food with unrelated individuals from other social groups and have even been known to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bonobos-first-great-apes-adopt-orphan-infant-outside-group">adopt outsiders’ young</a> (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). But the extent of the apes’ cooperative behavior has been unclear.</p>



<p>So behavioral ecologists Liran Samuni of the German Primate Center in Göttingen and Martin Surbeck of Harvard University studied two bonobo groups in the Congo’s Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve.&nbsp;Over two years, the team recorded which bonobos exchanged grooming services and shared food, and when.</p>



<p>Conflict and competition are not completely absent among bonobos. So the researchers also recorded when the apes formed alliances with members of the other group, cooperating to attack a third individual.</p>



<p>The two groups encountered each other frequently. They interacted with each other nearly 100 times over the study, sharing 20 percent of the two-year observation period in each other’s company. Some meetings lasted for just an hour, others for multiple weeks, allowing for longer-term bonds to be forged.</p>



<p>While the bonobos were together, the researchers documented many instances of cooperative behavior. Of the more than 3,700 grooming interactions observed, 10 percent were between bonobos of different social groups. Of all partnerships formed to attack a third individual, 15 percent were between bonobos of different groups.</p>



<p>“This is not a one-off kind of thing,” Samuni says, where individuals share food very occasionally, for example.&nbsp;In the Kokolopori bonobos, 6 percent of all food shares were across groups.</p>



<p>The cooperation wasn’t random. Individuals that tended to engage in cooperative behavior within their group were more likely to interact with bonobos in the other group that had the same tendency. This cooperation doesn’t appear to be solely motivated by immediate reciprocation, the researchers say. For instance, during the study, only 14 percent of bonobos that shared food with a partner in the other group had the deed reciprocated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study’s overall findings build on evidence from bonobos in captivity behaving similarly and raises the possibility that cooperating with nonrelatives across social groups is intrinsic to the species. Many animals will aid and cooperate with relatives, since such behavior encourages the survival and proliferation of one’s own genes, albeit indirectly. When helping nonrelatives, the evolutionary benefit is even more indirect, and doesn’t evolve as readily.</p>

Samuni/Kokolopori Bonobo Research Project</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Bonobos aren’t the only nonhuman animals known to behave in this way. Male dolphins will cooperate with other unrelated males to guard females, which increases their own chances of mating. But, unlike with a lot of the bonobo cooperation observed in the new study, there’s a clear, self-directed benefit involved in the dolphins’ behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Food sharing between unrelated individuals, though, is rare, Samuni says. Vampire bats, bonobos and humans are among the few species known to do it. Chimps also do this, but share food only within the social group, Surbeck says. In human evolution, such sharing “is considered one of those behaviors that supported our societies, that allowed us to sustain each other in terms of food shortfalls,” Samuni says.</p>





<p>Our own species’s behavior is what makes the new result particularly interesting, says Shinya Yamamoto, a comparative cognitive psychologist at Kyoto University in Japan.</p>



<p>“Humans sometimes compete or fight with neighboring groups, but other times we cooperate even with outgroup members,” Yamamoto says. Among our primate relatives, it’s been easier to find examples of aggression and competitiveness, especially in humans’ close relatives, chimpanzees. But the evolutionary origins of humankind’s cooperative side remain unclear.</p>



<p>Humans are equally related to chimpanzees and bonobos, and the new research doesn’t tell us whether early human ancestors were more like chimps with their universally rigid territories and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strategy-not-habitat-loss-leads-chimps-kill-rivals">lethal patrol groups</a>, or like the more relaxed bonobos (<em>SN: 9/17/14</em>). But the finding could lead to insights into the types of conditions in which either side of the coin evolves, Surbeck says.</p>



<p>“Under which circumstances do you see this cooperation? Under which circumstances do you see more of a chimpanzee pattern, in permanently hostile relationships between groups?” he asks. “What shifts the needle from one to the other?”</p>



<p>The finding also suggests that extensive, long-term cooperation between groups can occur without the heavy influence of cultural factors and social norms. In humans, these have been considered necessary to build and sustain between-group cooperation, Samuni says.</p>



<p>“We are showing quite a simple system,” she says. “And we still see it emerging and in a way that is quite similar [to humans].”</p>



<p>There could still be a cultural component at play with these two bonobo groups, Yamamoto says. It’s possible that over generations, some bonobos have learned to be particularly social, similarly to how elements of human culture form.</p>



<p>This study looked at just two wild bonobo groups, and other bonobo groups are known to have variable rates of interaction with other groups, Yamamoto says. So studying more of the apes might reveal something akin to social norms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flint-water-crisis-mental-health-community">Flint grapples with the mental health fallout from the water disaster</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">On a Saturday in May in Flint, Mich., residents took seats in one of three rings of chairs at a local food bank. The 50 or so participants, spanning three generations, would spend time that morning sharing stories and practicing deep listening as part of a healing circle. It’s one component of a wider community-based movement to <a href="https://healourcommunities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build relationships and challenge racist beliefs and systems</a>.</p>



<p>In one circle, healing practitioner Todd Womack asked participants to introduce themselves and describe their favorite desserts. Fingers snapped softly to signal mutual enjoyment. Next, participants paired off, with instructions to take turns asking about something that recently made them smile or laugh — and to listen without interruption. From there, new pairs moved to other topics, such as an accomplishment they were proud of.</p>





<p>Healing circles are a space to foster community, says Lynn Williams, the director of equity and community engagement at the Community Foundation of Greater Flint, who helped organize the event that morning. The circles allow room for “healing of trauma from systems, from oppression, from negativity,” she says. And they provide a place to tell a community’s full story, to “highlight the assets and the cultural contributions.”</p>



<p>The circles are one way to let people know they matter when society keeps telling them they don’t.</p>

<p>The residents of Flint — a city with a majority Black population and many people experiencing poverty — know this disregard well. In April 2014, to cut costs, state officials switched the city’s water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River without an adequate treatment plan. The public health catastrophe that has followed “is a story of government failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction and environmental injustice,” according to <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/formergovernors/Folder6/FWATF_FINAL_REPORT_21March2016.pdf?rev=284b9e42c7c840019109eb73aaeedb68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the final report from the Flint Water Advisory Task Force</a>, commissioned to find the causes of the water disaster. The human-made crisis turned a necessity into a hazard for the residents of the city, which had a population of around 99,000 at the time. The lack of proper treatment exposed people to bacteria, excessive disinfection chemicals and lead.</p>



<p>Residents reported that their physical health suffered. People <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/flintwater/documents/2016/CASPER_Report.pdf?rev=d49ce88517a34da9b3b8887076e07e10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke out in rashes, lost hair</a> and had <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5722721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gastrointestinal illnesses</a>. Researchers found an association between a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1718679115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local, deadly Legionnaires’ disease outbreak</a> in 2014–15 and insufficient disinfection in the water system. Many children have developed <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health and behavioral problems</a> from lead poisoning. “I am so upset,” says Bishop Bernadel Jefferson of Faith Deliverance Center in Flint, speaking of her grandson’s lead exposure and subsequent learning difficulties. “The system failed him.”</p>



<p>Mental health has suffered, too. Residents have reported experiencing depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. With disasters, especially those that involve toxic exposures, “the emotional consequences are long-term, because they’re fueled by this concern [that] health or cognitive functioning has been forever adversely affected,” says Evelyn Bromet, a psychiatric epidemiologist at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University in New York who has studied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.</p>



<p>For a year and a half, officials dismissed residents’ concerns about the safety of the water. “It was horrifying, because not only were they not believed, but they weren’t taken seriously,” Bromet says. The anger that goes along with that “is of course a detrimental emotional state to be in for a long period of time.”</p>



<p>Other difficult experiences compounded the anguish that came with the water disaster. “This community has been exposed to multiple traumas,” says Womack, a social worker at the University of Michigan–Flint. When the disaster began, Flint was still struggling with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs due to General Motors’ layoffs and plant closures from the 1970s to the 1990s. The COVID-19 pandemic began as the water disaster continued.</p>



<p>Mental health remains a pressing concern for the community. But there aren’t enough mental health providers to meet the need, says Barbara Wolf, a clinical health psychologist at McLaren Health Care in Flint. Genesee County, which includes Flint, is among the areas in the United States with a shortage of mental health professionals, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="375" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-6_680.jpg?resize=680%2C375&#038;ssl=1" alt="A person stands with two others in a room and paintings, one of a snowman, surround them." class="wp-image-3133037" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-6_680.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-6_680.jpg?resize=330%2C182&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133037">Youth Arts: Unlocked provides art workshops to young people at the Genesee County Juvenile Justice Center.

<p>So, as they’ve done before, Flint residents are finding a way. It was the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9869341/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community’s organizing and activism</a> that brought attention to the water disaster. And as Flint approaches 10 years since the disaster began, local organizations continue to help the community heal. There are <a href="https://genhs.org/free-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health and resiliency trainings</a>, mindfulness meditation and <a href="https://gfhc.org/events/talk-about-it-tuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community conversations</a> about mental health. “There’s not just one approach,” says Kristin Stevenson, project manager for the Flint Resiliency in Communities After Stress and Trauma, or ReCAST, program at the Greater Flint Health Coalition, and a healing practitioner. “All of these things combined are what create the impact.”</p>



<p>What has happened in Flint — and what continues there — illustrates a community’s activism and perseverance, as well as the mental health fallout of a disaster. But this story won’t end in Flint. Communities across the country could find themselves part of the next chapter, their lives upended by catastrophe. The United States’ <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/Final_DWINSA%20Public%20Factsheet%204.4.23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aging water infrastructure</a> has led to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2212978" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other water crises</a> and could trigger more. <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wildfires</a>, <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurricanes </a>and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heavy-precipitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floods</a>, fueled by climate change and other human-caused environmental changes, are increasing in frequency and destructiveness. Mental health will <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffer in the aftermath</a> of these traumatic events. The water disaster in Flint can be seen as both a warning and a model of community response.</p>





<p>“We recognize that our struggle, if not now, will become yours,” Womack says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The making of the water disaster in Flint</h4>



<p>A decorative archway spanning one of downtown Flint’s main thoroughfares reads “Flint: Vehicle City.” The city was home to a booming carriage business before General Motors was founded there in 1908. Residents look back with pride on the community’s activism during GM workers’ <a href="https://sloanlongway.org/flint-sit-down-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous sit-down strike</a> for better pay and recognition of their union, the United Auto Workers. For around six weeks in 1936–37, striking workers occupied factories to stop production. Family and community members <a href="https://www.geneseehistory.org/genora-johnson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided supplies and support from the outside</a>. The strike heralded the rise of the labor movement in the automotive industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="447" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-2_680.jpg?resize=680%2C447&#038;ssl=1" alt="Workers sit reading papers on couches in a factory setting with partially built automobiles in the background." class="wp-image-3133033" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-2_680.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-2_680.jpg?resize=583%2C383&amp;ssl=1 583w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-2_680.jpg?resize=283%2C186&amp;ssl=1 283w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133033">Flint residents have a long history of activism, including the sit-down strike of 1936–37 by General Motors workers, who remained in the plants to stop production (Fisher body plant factory No. 3 is shown).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3133033">SHELDON DICK/LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As in other cities, Flint’s industrial growth was detrimental to its river, as factories would discharge waste directly into the water. The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Water Act of 1972</a>, which regulates pollution from industrial and municipal sources, has improved the health of U.S. waterways, including Flint’s. In 1974, the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-safe-drinking-water-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safe Drinking Water Act</a> was enacted to safeguard the country’s drinking water. The law sets standards for levels of contaminants, including microorganisms, chemicals and metals such as lead.</p>



<p>In 2014, Flint’s water treatment plant hadn’t been fully operational for almost 50 years. Instead, the city had been purchasing treated Lake Huron water from Detroit’s water utility. But an unelected emergency manager, placed in charge of Flint’s finances by Michigan’s then-Governor Rick Snyder, had authorized a switch to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure. Water treatment is a complex process, and the Flint River water was more corrosive than other water sources. But the Flint plant <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5353852/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t test its treatment procedures sufficiently</a>, according to an analysis by water treatment experts. In violation of federal requirements, there was no corrosion control treatment, which <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b04034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helps prevent lead from leaching into the water</a> as it moves through the distribution system’s pipes.</p>



<p>When residents turned on their faucets in the weeks after the switch on April 25, they were unsettled by what came out. “I used to love tap water, just to run it and let it get cold,” Jefferson says. But after the switch, the water left a film in her mouth. Flint resident Gina Luster liked to chew ice, but it started to taste “like metal, like I’m chewing steel.” Cynthia Watkins, apostle at the Well International Church Ministries in Flint, remembers the water “just smelling, it was horrible.” For Roshanda Womack, a professional storyteller and spouse of Todd Womack, the water had a strong odor and was sometimes cloudy or had a slight brown tinge to it.</p>



<p>People in the community spoke out about the poor water quality, with some reporting rashes from exposure to the water. But officials maintained that the water was safe for use.</p>



<p>Warning signs mounted in the following months. The water in the distribution system tested positive in August for <em>E. coli</em>, which can indicate fecal contamination and inadequate disinfection. This prompted a boil water advisory. In October, General Motors announced that it would stop using the city’s water at an engine plant over concerns about corrosion. While the company switched to a different water supply for manufacturing, officials still claimed Flint’s water met safety standards for people. Throughout 2014, church leaders and other community members worked to elevate people’s concerns about the water.</p>



<p>At the end of 2014, the city was served with a Safe Drinking Water Act violation, having <a href="https://www.cityofflint.com/wp-content/uploads/City-of-Flint-Violation-Notice-MCL-TTHM-12_16_14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exceeded allowable levels of trihalomethanes</a>, disinfection by-products tied to an increased risk of cancer. These chemicals form when disinfectant added during treatment reacts with naturally occurring materials in river and lake water. One of the challenges of water treatment is maintaining proper disinfection while limiting by-product chemicals.</p>



<p>After the public notice of the violation in January 2015, Flint resident LeeAnne Walters asked the city to test her water. Samples from February and March revealed lead levels around seven and 27 times what spurs regulatory action. Walters’ home plumbing was plastic. An analysis of the city service line to the house <a href="https://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Miguels-Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed it was the source of the lead</a>. When Walters’ 4-year-old son was tested for lead in March, his level was 6.5&nbsp;micrograms per deciliter. No amount of lead is considered safe. At the time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used a reference value of 5 µg/dL, developed based on national surveys, to identify kids with the highest lead levels. In 2021, the CDC lowered that reference value to 3.5&nbsp;µg/dL.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="433" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-3_680.jpg?resize=680%2C433&#038;ssl=1" alt="A person holds a jug of brown water with a pink &quot;Safe Water&quot; sign in the background." class="wp-image-3133034" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-3_680.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-3_680.jpg?resize=601%2C383&amp;ssl=1 601w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-3_680.jpg?resize=292%2C186&amp;ssl=1 292w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133034">Community activism was instrumental in bringing attention to the Flint water crisis.

<p>As the year continued, local organizations and churches formed the Coalition for Clean Water, which passed out flyers to inform residents of the water safety issues and collected water samples for testing. People protested, with rallies in Flint, Detroit and Lansing, the state capital. In August, organizers delivered to the mayor a petition, with more than 26,000 signatures, demanding to switch back to water from the Detroit system.</p>



<p>Then, at a September news conference, local researchers announced an alarming rise in the percentage of Flint children with lead levels of 5 µg/dL or higher. The analysis included children younger than age 5 who had had their levels checked as part of routine lead screening — 736 children in 2013, before the water source changed, and 737 after, in 2015. The percentage of kids <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered to have high lead levels</a> increased from 2.4&nbsp;percent in 2013 to 4.9 percent in 2015, the researchers reported in 2016 in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>. In neighborhoods with the most lead in the water, the jump was from 4.0 to 10.6 percent. A similar change was not seen in 2,202 children who lived outside of the city and had a different water source.</p>





<p>Lead harms children’s developing brains and nervous systems. Studies have found that the metal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338437/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupts communication between nerve cells and impairs the hippocampus</a>, a brain region important in learning and memory. Children exposed to lead can develop learning disabilities, speech and hearing disorders, and behavioral problems. The damage can shape the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>Officials ultimately couldn’t brush aside the evidence of poisoned children. The city reconnected to the Detroit water system on October 16, 2015. But that water still had to flow through Flint’s pipes, which had become corroded. The city has been replacing its lead service lines but has repeatedly missed court-ordered deadlines and still isn’t finished. Lead levels have been in compliance with federal regulations since 2016 but <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/flintwater/-/media/Project/Websites/flintwater/images/Graph-2023-07-02-Lead-Copper-Rule.jpg?rev=b0e3936df9e44957bbe60f7ff4473c94" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have fluctuated recently</a>. In 2022, lead levels rose to the highest seen in six years.</p>



<p>“We’re still not fixed,” says Kent Key, a health disparities researcher at the Flint campus of Michigan State University’s College of Human Medicine.</p>



<p>The Flint Water Advisory Task Force reported that the state government was primarily responsible for the water disaster.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The anguish Flint residents have felt</h4>



<p>The Flint community organized, rallied and distributed testing kits and bottled water while people there lived through a disaster. “The water disaster was a traumatic experience,” Todd Womack says. “At the time, I don’t think people were saying it was traumatic. I think they were saying, ‘How do we get this basic need?’”</p>



<p>Eventually, the trauma rose to the surface. There had been so much worry, stress, anger and grief. Parents who had cajoled their kids to choose water over soda and juice were distraught. “I feel so guilty now,” Luster says. “I was poisoning my kid.” Pets died unexpectedly, which seemed to be tied to drinking the water. “I ended up losing both my dogs,” Watkins says. “That was just devastating.” Getting enough bottled water was a financial hardship for many. “I watched people, low-income families or on a fixed income … take half of their money to buy water every month,” Jefferson says.</p>



<p>And for so long, residents were told, “ ‘You’re paranoid, you’re crazy, the water is fine,’ ” Roshanda Womack says, “when you can see it’s not fine.” Jennifer Carrera, an environmental sociologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing, says there were “so many ways in which the treatment of the residents minimized their experiences…. Gaslighting is a very fair way of characterizing what happened to Flint residents.”</p>



<p>Yet General Motors got a different water supply for its plant. “For parts, for automobile parts,” Jefferson says, but not for people. “It was all right for us to be poisoned. It was all right to be sick. It was all right to die.”</p>



<p>Dionna Brown, a sociology graduate student at Wayne State University in Detroit, grew up in Flint and was a teenager during the water disaster. Brown felt “like the government is trying to poison a Black city.” She realized, “Black children, we can’t have a childhood. We have to grow up fast.”</p>



<p>“To live with that level of betrayal,” says Bromet, the Stony Brook psychiatric epidemiologist, “of course it takes its toll.”</p>



<p>As does the lack of justice. “The perpetrator, in a just and fair society, is held accountable,” Key says. “In the Flint water crisis, that still hasn’t happened.” The city has been “forced to work with the perpetrator, the state, to work towards recovery.”</p>



<p>The experience has left many unconvinced that the city’s water is safe. “I think you’re just going to have a large portion of the population that is never going to drink the water again,” says social epidemiologist Jerel Ezell of the University of California, Berkeley, who grew up in the Flint suburbs.</p>



<p>Worrying about water “puts a strain on you,” says Flint resident Tyshae Brady. “I don’t want to always go over to a friend’s house and go, ‘Hey, is your water safe to drink?’ ” The unease extends beyond Flint, too. Flint church elder Sarah Bailey, who has worked on stroke prevention in the community and other projects, recalls being at a Boston restaurant with colleagues. “The waitress brings some water to the table in glasses, and I reach over and say, ‘Do you happen to have any bottled water?’ ” One of her colleagues told Bailey the water was safe. “I said, ‘For you…. The water was not safe for me.’ ”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The mental health aftermath of the water crisis</h4>



<p>The disaster has weighed heavily on the mental health of residents, both children and adults. From December 2018 to March 2020, researchers surveyed the caregivers of 1,203 children, ages 3 to 17. The caregiver-reported <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2023.307406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rates of anxiety and depression</a> among the children were 13&nbsp;percent for anxiety and 8&nbsp;percent for depression, higher than the national rates of 9 and 4 percent for that age group, the researchers reported in September in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>.</p>



<p>A different research team surveyed 1,970 adult residents from August 2019 to April 2020 — around that time, Flint’s total population was just over 81,000. Twenty-two percent of the respondents had experienced symptoms of depression in the past year, while <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 percent met criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder</a>. That’s higher than the estimated past-year rates, 8&nbsp;percent for depression and 5 percent for PTSD, for the U.S. population. Extending the findings to Flint’s population suggests that around 13,600 adults may have experienced depression and around 15,000 may have had PTSD, the researchers reported in 2022 in<em> JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>



<p>People who were worried the water had harmed their or their family’s health were more than twice as likely to meet the criteria for depression and about 1.7 times as likely for PTSD, compared with people without this concern.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lingering mental health effects</h3>



<p>More than 20 percent of nearly 2,000 adult Flint residents surveyed about five years after the water crisis began met the criteria for past-year depression. Nearly 25 percent met the criteria for past-year post-traumatic stress disorder, above the percentage for postdeployment Gulf War veterans.</p>

<p>Past tragedies, such as a serious accident, physical abuse, sexual assault or a previous environmental calamity, can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096796/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase mental health risks</a> when disaster strikes. “Your cumulative exposure to potentially traumatic events drives a lot of the risk for either developing or maintaining PTSD or depression,” says Dean Kilpatrick, a clinical psychologist at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston and one of the authors of the study in adults. Kilpatrick and colleagues found that the risk of developing symptoms of depression increased by a factor of close to three, and for PTSD symptoms by a factor of 4.6, for Flint residents with past exposure to a potentially traumatic event, compared with those without.</p>



<p>For some, mental health issues from disasters <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735822000885" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may persist for years</a>. Researchers followed mothers who experienced Hurricane Katrina and had incomes less than twice the federal poverty line. The women were surveyed at three points after August of 2005, when the storm hit the U.S. Gulf Coast. Although rates of post-traumatic stress symptoms declined over time among the women, 1 in 6 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still had symptoms 12 years after the hurricane</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in <em>Social Science &amp; Medicine</em>. Mothers with young children who were evacuees after the Chernobyl disaster and Chernobyl cleanup workers have had <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0936655511005334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-lasting mental health consequences</a>.</p>



<p>Despite the potential impacts, only 35 percent of respondents in the study in J<em>AMA Network Open </em>reported that they had ever been offered mental health care to attend to issues that arose from the water disaster. If offered, most people — 79&nbsp;percent — took advantage.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, another traumatic experience, hit the community while they were still dealing with the water disaster. In the most recent Community Health Needs Assessment for Flint and surrounding Genesee County, from 2022, 45&nbsp;percent of respondents to the assessment’s resident survey indicated that they were dealing with stress, and 33 percent said they had <a href="https://gfhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hc726-CHNA-Report-2022_web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health problems such as depression or anxiety</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How the community is helping and healing</h4>



<p>Having too few mental health care practitioners is not an issue unique to Flint. Nearly 166 million people in the United States, about half the population, live in areas with <a href="https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/shortage-areas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a shortage of mental health professionals</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has<a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/practitioner/2022-covid-psychologist-workload" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> only exacerbated the problem</a>.</p>



<p>Treatment options did recently expand somewhat in Flint. In May, local mental health services provider Genesee Health System opened a new outpatient clinic that serves uninsured county residents. The treatment facility is funded in part by a recently passed property tax increase to support mental health in the county.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Flint organizations are taking community-based approaches to help residents cope. The Flint ReCAST program, supported with a grant from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, funds local organizations seeking to address trauma and stress in the community. ReCAST has supported art, music and dance programs for young people and an initiative to build mindfulness skills among the police and community members.</p>



<p>ReCAST also funds Genesee Health System to offer free community mental health and resiliency trainings, on topics ranging from recognizing suicidal ideation to learning about mental health and stigma to building resiliency. ReCAST and Genesee mental health professionals have teamed up for virtual conversations about mental health called Talk About It Tuesdays.</p>



<p>The Flint Public Health Youth Academy, which Key began developing in 2014, is a homegrown initiative to inspire Flint’s young people to pursue careers in public health. “I wanted to create a youth group that did not allow the water crisis to be a sentence of doom and gloom,” he says, but rather a jumping-off point to create the next generation of public health professionals. Among the academy’s activities is an annual summer camp that centers on a public health topic, such as environmental justice.</p>



<p>Looking to the future, Stevenson, the project manager for ReCAST, is interested in bringing training of mental health ambassadors to Flint. The idea is to train trusted community members to be a source of mental health information for their neighborhoods. Stevenson is also a big proponent of healing circles as a way to help people heal and build resilience.</p>

<p>At the close of one healing circle on that Saturday in May, Todd Womack took out a skein of moss green yarn. Womack asked the participants to be ready to share something they appreciate about themselves. Womack went first, then tossed the skein to another participant while holding on to a piece of the yarn. As each person took a turn, the skein zigzagged across the space, unwinding along the way. In the end, everyone in the circle was holding on to the web of yarn, a physical reminder of the community and connections created that morning.</p>



<p>That afternoon, three different groups formed to discuss changes residents would like to see in Flint. People responded on sticky notes to different questions, such as what Flint would look like without gun violence. People talked about the city’s history, GM’s layoffs and the abandoned homes that still dot many neighborhoods, the result of years of population loss. After a peak of nearly 197,000 in 1960, the latest population estimate, from 2022, is under 80,000.</p>



<p>The people gathered that Saturday are among those who have stayed. They are Flintstones, as residents call themselves. While brainstorming about Flint’s future, playful chants broke out between the groups, each of which had taken on a Flint-related name. “Flintstones!” one group cried. “810!” another responded, referring to the local area code. “Bedrock!” boomed the third, naming the town from the old <em>The Flintstones </em>cartoon.</p>



<p>When residents reflect on Flint, the strong sense of community comes up again and again. It’s how residents have stood up for their health and safety during a disaster, and it’s how they continue to care for each other.</p>



<p>“There’s really this unity and connectedness with anyone who has lived here,” Todd Womack says.</p>



<p>“We’re a loving city,” Dionna Brown says, “and we’re going to be OK.”</p>



<p>“There are amazing, deeply committed people that live here … there’s a lot of commitment, there’s a lot of passion,” Lynn Williams says. “And that’s why we stay.”</p>

<p>Researchers apparently don’t need to be real to publish in scientific journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take Nicholas Zafetti of Clemson University, in South Carolina, who has at least <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?search_mode=content&amp;and_facet_researcher=ur.011133550723.76">nine publications</a> to his name. Or Giorgos Jimenez of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EFB4C7C007DEDF4D152FD720A6E6FD">12 papers</a> under his belt.</p>



<p>Both identities seem to be bogus, according to Alexander Magazinov, a scientific sleuth and software engineer based in Kazakhstan. They add to a short but growing list of ostensibly fictitious researchers who appear as coauthors on real papers. </p>



<span id="more-128271"></span>



<p>We’ve written about Beatriz Ychussie of Roskilde University, in Denmark, whose <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/18/another-whodunit-the-author-no-one-can-find/">work was marred by plagiarism and faked peer review</a>; Dragan Rodriguez of Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/15/who-are-you-dragan-rodriguez-fifteen-studies-have-the-same-fake-author-sleuth-finds/">whose name adorned 15 articles</a> on anything from cancer detection to “renewable energy systems optimization;” and Toshiyuki Bangi of Nanyang Technological University, in Singapore, who apparently was added to manuscripts by researchers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/05/eight-papers-retracted-after-author-found-to-be-fictional/">looking to boost their “chances in the review process</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Zafetti nor Jimenez responded to interview requests sent to the email addresses listed on their papers.</p>



<p>Magazinov spotted Zafetti, as he did Rodriguez, while investigating a potential citation ring linked to an Iranian paper mill. Intriguingly, Zafetti had published almost exclusively with Chinese researchers. And his papers – appearing in titles from Springer Nature, Elsevier and Taylor &amp; Francis – included an unusually high number of references to work by Noradin Ghadimi, a researcher at Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University, in Turkey. (Ghadimi did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p>In October, Magazinov contacted Clemson University to share his concerns. In an email to Tracy Arwood, associate vice president and chief ethics and compliance officer at the institution, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This case is similar to several others, where fictional identities of US-based researchers were used in scientific publications. …</p>



<p>The similarities with the &#8220;Rodriguez&#8221; case include complete absence of domestic collaboration (the coauthors are mostly Chinese, with one exception: a single paper signed by Charalampos Baniotopoulos from Birmingham, UK), as well as an unexpected abundance of citations to one specific person, Noradin Ghadimi.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Arwood promised to investigate. On November 6, she circled back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have completed our review. We are reaching out to the journal editors to share our findings and ask for any information they may have that is contrary to our findings. We will also ask that they take appropriate action if they agree with our findings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Arwood nor the university’s newsroom responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three affected publishers all told us they were looking into the concerns about Zafetti. An Elsevier spokesperson added that the company was investigating authorship changes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544221011580?via%3Dihubhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544221011580">two</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484720306156">of</a> Zafetti’s papers “that were not approved by the Editors.”<em>.</em></p>



<p>We also reached out to two of Zafetti’s (seemingly real) coauthors, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231114151542/https:/orcid.org/0000-0003-2784-7706">Ziyu Wang</a> of the University of Birmingham, in the U.K., and Yongtang Wu of Weifang University of Science and Technology, in China, but did not hear back.</p>



<p>Magazinov shared with us three other apparently fake identities he had stumbled on during his sleuthing: a &#8220;<a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?search_mode=content&amp;and_facet_researcher=ur.011731403107.18">Benjamin Badami</a>&#8221; of the University of Georgia, in Athens, Georgia; an &#8220;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isatra.2021.01.043">Achla Anderson</a>&#8221; of Texas Tech University, in Lubbock; and a &#8220;<a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?search_mode=content&amp;and_facet_researcher=ur.07403031537.97">Scott Mizzi</a>&#8221; of Northeastern University, in Boston. They all published exclusively with international coauthors, mainly from China, and none appeared on the websites of the institutions with which they were allegedly affiliated.</p>



<p>As to Jimenez, SAGE Publications publicly called the bluff last year. In a pair of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09544119221134231">retraction</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09544119221134230">notices</a>, the publisher stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following publication of the article, the Journal became aware that the identity of one of the authors, G Jimenez, cannot be confirmed at their listed institution. The authors were asked for an explanation of the involvement of an unauthorised third party and did not provide a response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But that didn’t stop Jimenez’ work from being <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809422008886?via%3Dihub">published elsewhere</a>. And most of “his” papers remain in print – in titles published by Springer Nature, Elsevier, De Gruyter and others – as do those of Zafetti, Badami, Anderson, Mizzi and Rodriguez.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/obesity-semaglutide-wegovy-heart-attack-stroke">The weight loss drug Wegovy lowered heart attack risk in a large trial</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PHILADELPHIA ­</strong>—&nbsp;At the recent American Heart Association meeting, a cavernous room full of doctors erupted into applause. Cleveland Clinic cardiologist A. Michael Lincoff had just presented the dramatic&nbsp;—&nbsp;and at times enigmatic&nbsp;—&nbsp;results of a new clinical trial on the weight loss drug semaglutide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drug, sold under the brand name Wegovy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/?_ga=2.241453762.1720669771.1692203876-1411015482.1692203876#!/10871/presentation/16575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut patients’ risk of major cardiovascular problems</a>&nbsp;by 20 percent, Lincoff reported November 11. It also reduced the risk of dying&nbsp;—&nbsp;from any cause&nbsp;—&nbsp;over the roughly 40 months patients participated in the study on average.</p>





<p>Lincoff’s work notches yet another role for semaglutide, which doctors currently use to treat diabetes and obesity. Previous work had already uncovered a cardiovascular benefit in people with type 2 diabetes. The new study, which targeted overweight or obese patients with cardiovascular disease, is the first to show that semaglutide can help the hearts of people without diabetes too.</p>



<p>That’s important because it expands the number of people who could benefit from the drug, says Tiffany Powell-Wiley, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the National&nbsp;Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. In the United States alone, more than 6 million obese or overweight people have cardiovascular disease but not diabetes. Semaglutide could be a game changer for these people, says Powell-Wiley, who was not part of the new trial. Still, she and others at the meeting recognized the limitations of the study&nbsp;—&nbsp;and the limitations of the drug.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As much as we may want a quick fix for the rising levels of obesity seen around the world, Powell-Wiley says, “it’s important to understand that this isn’t the panacea.” We still don’t know how well semaglutide works in a diverse group of people, she says. And the drug doesn’t fix the&nbsp;societal, environmental and social factors that lead to obesity — and its potential health consequences — in the first place.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Semaglutide reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke and death</h4>



<p>Semaglutide is one among a family of drugs gaining popularity for treating obesity. On November 8, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-medication-chronic-weight-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved&nbsp;a new one</a>: tirzepatide, a relative of semaglutide that goes by the brand name Zepbound.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic-strokes-heart#faq">[See also:&nbsp;<strong>Semaglutide FAQ</strong>&nbsp;]</a></p>



<p>Semaglutide, sold under the brand name Ozempic, first came on the market for treating diabetes in 2017. Since then, the drug’s slew of uses has kept growing. In 2020, the FDA OK’d it for cutting cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes and heart disease. And in 2021, treatment for obesity (with the higher dose Wegovy) joined the list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lincoff’s semaglutide trial, called SELECT, included more than 17,000 people, half of whom received weekly injections of semaglutide for roughly three years; the other half got a placebo.&nbsp;By the end of the trial, 8 percent of the people in the placebo group had had a nonfatal stroke or heart attack or died due to cardiovascular causes. That number&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped to 6.5 percent in the semaglutide group</a>, Lincoff reported at the meeting and online November 11 in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk reduction</h3>



<p>In a trial of 17,000 adults, those taking the drug Wegovy were less likely to experience nonfatal heart attacks, nonfatal heart strokes or death due to cardiovascular causes than those taking a placebo. This reduction in risk occurred early in the trial — before participants had lost a lot of weight. That suggests the drug may somehow be boosting heart health directly.</p>

<p>The difference between the two groups may not sound like much, but “it’s a massive result,” says Amit Khera, a cardiologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas who was not part of the trial. One can’t underestimate the importance of finding a new treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The illness is “the largest source of mortality in the world,” Lincoff said at a news conference on November 10, and there’s no single therapy that can eliminate it. Instead, doctors try to chip away at it with various treatments that offer incremental benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For overweight or obese people with heart disease, Khera says, semaglutide is another tool in cardiologists’ toolkits.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Questions remain about how the drug works — and for whom</h4>



<p>The new study results flesh out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic-strokes-heart#faq">earlier news of the trial released by funder Novo Nordisk in August</a>&nbsp;<em>(SN: 8/29/23</em>). At the time, doctors wanted to know who the drug helped, how it worked and what side effects it set off. The latest report offers answers to some questions but kicks others wide open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants on semaglutide were slightly more likely to drop out of the trial than those taking the placebo. That difference seemed to be driven by the drug’s gastrointestinal side effects, which include nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. The number of serious issues that occurred, like cancer or infection, was slightly lower in the semaglutide group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though semaglutide offered clear cardiovascular benefits for patients, one mysterious aspect of the data snagged researchers’ attention. The drug’s protective effects became apparent early in the trial&nbsp;—&nbsp;well before participants had shed lots of pounds.</p>



<p>That’s a big deal because it suggests semaglutide may be boosting heart health directly, perhaps in addition to the typical benefits that accompany weight loss, says&nbsp;Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. She was not involved in the study but is on Novo Nordisk’s scientific advisory board. Lincoff said his team is “working feverishly” on analyzing the SELECT data to better understand semaglutide’s actions.</p>



<p>Those data include demographic and medical information on thousands of trial participants. But the trial does have one “huge limitation,” says Powell-Wiley: 84 percent of the study’s participants were white and 72 percent were men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expanding the diversity of people represented in clinical trials like these is crucial, she said. It’s a point she brought up in a panel discussion after Lincoff’s talk, and one that — like the trial’s results — garnered widespread applause. In the United States, African-American, Hispanic and Indigenous people are most impacted by obesity, Powell-Wiley says, and the new trial doesn’t tell us much about how semaglutide works in those groups.</p>

<p>A former PhD student at Auburn University in Alabama relabeled and reused images inappropriately in a grant application, published paper, and several presentations, a U.S. government watchdog has found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Office of Research Integrity says Sarah Elizabeth Martin “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally or knowingly falsifying and/or fabricating experimental data and results obtained under different experimental conditions,” according to a <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/case-summary-martin-sarah-elizabeth">case summary</a> posted online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The published paper, “<a href="https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/27/9/1102.short">The m6A landscape of polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA and its related methylome in the context of KSHV replication</a>,” appeared online in advance of publication in <em>RNA</em> in June 2021. The journal <a href="https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/28/2/274.full">retracted</a> the article last year, with the following notice:</p>



<span id="more-128267"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>RNA</em> is retracting the above-mentioned article because the authors have lost confidence in the validity of some of the data and conclusions drawn from them. This action has been agreed to by all of the authors. The authors regret any inconvenience that this has caused to the scientific community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited a total of nine times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science, seven of the citations coming after the retraction.</p>



<p>ORI’s findings include an extensive and detailed list of images Martin reused and relabeled to represent different experiments, including original gel images in PowerPoint presentations she provided to <em>RNA</em> to support her data. </p>



<p>We sent an email requesting comment to Martin’s Auburn email address and did not immediately receive a response or a bounce back. Martin’s former advisor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-sztuba-soli%C5%84ska-phd-18830094/">Joanna Sztuba-Solińska</a>, was the principal investigator on the grant application ORI said contained fake data. That grant garnered $188,451 in funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Sztuba-Solińska now works in vaccine development at Pfizer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martin agreed to a three-year ban from all federal contracting, including grant funding, as well as a two-year supervision period for any federally-funded research to begin after the ban lapses. During the five-year period, Martin may not serve in any advisory or consulting role with the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the National Institutes of Health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-scans-how-teens-handle-pandemic-stress">Brain scans give clues to how teens handle pandemic stress</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON </strong>— Brain scans could be used to predict how teenagers’ mental health will fare during a stressful time, an analysis that spanned the COVID-19 pandemic suggests.</p>



<p>The findings, presented November 13 in a news briefing at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, may help explain <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10892/presentation/22261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why some people succumb to stress</a> while others are more resilient.</p>



<p>For a lot of research, “the study happens, and you report on the results, and that’s about it,” says Margot Wagner, a bioengineer at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved in the new work. But this research followed hundreds of teenagers over time, a study design that “means you can intervene and help way sooner than otherwise,” Wagner says.</p>





<p>The pandemic was particularly tough for many teenagers, as isolation, worry and upheaval of daily routines affected them in ways that scientists are just now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-prematurely-aged-teens-brains">starting to see</a> (<em>SN: 1/3/23</em>). A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boys-experience-depression-differently-girls">record number of young people</a> are struggling with depression and anxiety, a mental health crisis that some scientists are calling “the second pandemic” (<em>SN: 6/30/23</em>).</p>



<p>While many teenagers struggled during the pandemic, others did OK. Computational neuroscientist Caterina Stamoulis of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital investigated why responses differed using data collected as part of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development, or ABCD, study. That larger study — involving scientists at 21 research sites across the United States — aims to figure out how teenagers’ brains grow over the years.</p>



<p>“This is the first time in history we’re looking at thousands of participants and getting these measures over time,” Wagner says. “It’s truly remarkable.”</p>



<p>The ABCD study, begun in 2015, was well under way when COVID hit, so researchers possessed brain scans from before the pandemic. “Without the pandemic, we would not have been able to understand the impact of a long-lasting adverse event” that deeply affected the participants’ lives, changing their interactions with their family and friends, Stamoulis says.</p>



<p>At the outset of the project, fMRI brain scans measured blood flow — a proxy for brain cell activity — in 1,414 teenagers, a subset of the more than 11,000 adolescents enrolled in the ABCD study. The fMRI images recorded how certain regions of the brain behave in tandem with each other, a clue that those regions work together in what neuroscientists call a brain circuit.</p>



<p>“Neuroimaging data is particularly useful for developing predictive models of future outcomes,” says neuroscientist and engineer Vince Calhoun of Georgia Tech, “including resilience to stress, depression and many other things.”</p>



<p>In May 2020, as the world shut down, researchers started surveying the teenagers in the study about how they were holding up. These surveys, sent every few months, measured aspects of mental health, stress and sadness, among other things.</p>



<p>Teenagers who had weaker neural connections between certain parts of the brain before the pandemic fared worse than teenagers with stronger neural connections, the team found. These brain regions included the prefrontal cortex, a brain area that gets drastically reshaped during adolescence, and the amygdala, a structure on each side of the brain that’s involved in emotions. Weaker brain connections were associated with kids having more sadness and stress during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Weaker and more fragile networks predicted harder times during the pandemic, Stamoulis says. But “stronger and more resilient brain networks predicted better mental health, lower stress and lower sadness.”</p>



<p>She and her colleagues plan to study these brain circuits as time goes on. As brains develop, they respond to experiences and environments. If those are positive, Stamoulis says, they can be “protective factors for the brain and how its circuits evolve and become wired.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/AdobeStock_610377029-1-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Oral cancer, also known as mouth cancer, refers to cancers that develop in any part of the mouth including the lips, tongue, gums, palate, inner cheeks, and minor salivary glands. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common oral cancer and ranks as a “top 10” cancer globally in the male population. Annually, approximately 370,000 new cases of oral cancer are recorded worldwide, with an incidence rate of 7.1 per 100,000 people. Moreover, approximately 200,000 deaths related to oral cancer are estimated each year, with a mortality rate of 3.8 per 100,000 people. The highest mortality rates are observed in Eastern Europe, South Asia and Southeast Asia as well as in Latin America. Incidence and mortality rates are higher in men than in women across all age groups.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13388" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13388" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-13388" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/AdobeStock_116110879-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13388" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© freshidea / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Disparities in the worldwide occurrence of this disease are primarily attributed to differences in lifestyle and exposure to risk factors, such as tobacco, alcohol, betel quid and sun exposure, in the case of lip cancer. Although it may not be as widely discussed as other types of cancer, oral cancer is a significant health issue that affects people of all ages. It not only results in significant mortality but also causes extensive facial disfigurement, loss of oral functionality (including speech and swallowing), economic and psychological burden.</p>
<h3><strong>The importance of early diagnosis</strong></h3>
<p>Early diagnosis and effective treatment play a pivotal role in improving patient outcomes and reducing the mortality rates associated with oral cancer. However, most cases are detected at a late stage, when treatment is complex, costly, and yields poor results. Early diagnosis is a cornerstone of mitigating the impact of oral cancer, but its importance is a particularly critical dimension in a global context. Access to healthcare services, awareness, and resources varies significantly from region to region. Therefore, it is paramount to develop strategies that can be effectively implemented in diverse healthcare settings to ensure equitable access to early diagnosis at a global scale.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the current perspectives on global oral health?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2015, the United Nations formulated 17 <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) within the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">Agenda 2030 Action Plan</a> to achieve peace, prosperity, and well-being for all by 2030. <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">SDG 3</a> aims to ensure a healthy life and promote well-being for people of all ages. However, achieving this goal is not possible unless countries adopt integrated approaches to address non-communicable diseases, including strategies to combat the burden of oral diseases.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/inequalities-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© Natalia / stock.adobe.com</div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, oral health is not explicitly mentioned or addressed within the context of SDG 3. Conditions such as dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer affect a staggering 3.58 billion people worldwide, making them the most common and preventable non-communicable diseases afflicting humanity, so oral health is fundamental to achieving good health and well-being and serves as the foundation for SDG 3.</p>
<p>In response to this, the International Dental Federation (FDI) and the International Association of Dental Research (IADR) have issued a <a href="https://www.fdiworlddental.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/fdi-wha72-11_4_implementation_sdgs_0.pdf">joint statement</a> advocating for the inclusion of oral health in Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interplay between oral health, general health, and overall well-being is undeniable and should not be underestimated. It is imperative to raise global awareness within the dental and oral health sciences community to prioritize oral health care, promote oral health, and ensure universal health coverage.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategies for reducing risk</strong></h3>
<p>Strategies to reduce the risk factors associated with oral cancer, such as tobacco and alcohol cessation, as well as promoting regular oral examination, must be tailored to the unique challenges faced by communities worldwide. Cultural factors, socioeconomic disparities, and healthcare infrastructure/access play a role in shaping the landscape of prevention efforts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13387" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13387" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-13387" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/iStock-1403523137-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13387" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© fizkes / Getty Images / iStock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oral cancer disproportionately affects economically vulnerable individuals, and reducing social inequalities necessitates the implementation of national policies coordinated with broader health and social initiatives. This approach, known as the common risk factor approach, is based on controlling the environment, ensuring access to safe water, providing adequate food, conducting public and professional education campaigns on early signs and symptoms, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment, applying evidence-based treatments appropriate to available resources, and offering thoughtful rehabilitation and palliative care.</p>
<h3><strong>Call for Papers!</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dentalhealth.org/mouthcanceractionmonth2023">Mouth Cancer Awareness Month</a> is an annual initiative that encourages individuals and communities to learn more about the disease, its risk factors, and, most importantly, how early detection and prevention can be achieved to save lives. In line with this alarming international scenario, <em>BMC Oral Health</em> has recently launched a new Collection ‘<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/EDPOC">Early detection and prevention of oral cancer</a>’ dedicated to recruiting cutting-edge research advancements, innovative methodologies, and clinical insights for the early diagnosis and prevention of oral cancer.</p>
<p>By promoting knowledge sharing and collaboration, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat this disease.</p>

<p>A public health journal intends to retract an article that estimated how many unintentional pesticide poisonings happen each year worldwide, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the authors hired a lawyer to represent them in contesting the retraction, and maintain the journal’s decision “undermines the integrity of the scientific process.” This is the second time within a few months that the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/04/authors-file-complaint-with-publisher-as-journal-retracts-vaping-paper/">retracted an article</a> through a process authors said was problematic.</p>



<span id="more-128259"></span>



<p><em>BMC Public Health</em> published the article, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09939-0">The global distribution of acute unintentional pesticide poisoning: estimations based on a systematic review</a>,” in December 2020. It has been cited 145 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors are all affiliated with the Pesticide Action Network, a collection of organizations “working to replace the use of hazardous pesticides with ecologically sound and socially just alternatives,” as they disclosed in the paper. In their review, they concluded that unintentional pesticide poisoning “is an ongoing major global public health challenge” and “a problem that warrants immediate action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Wolfgang-quote-for-retraction-watch.docx.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch, first author Wolfgang Boedeker called the journal’s process for deciding to retract the paper “problematic from the beginning.” He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There was no information provided to the authors about any kind of investigation into our paper prior to being informed about the planned retraction. We, the authors, were piece-wise informed about the reasons, only after repeatedly asking for them. We learned by email that the details of the investigation remained confidential.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper previously attracted criticism from the pesticide industry. In October 2021, the journal published a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0#author-information">letter to the editor</a> in which employees of Bayer and CropLife International claimed the numbers in the article “appear to overestimate the global burden of pesticide poisonings.” The authors <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11941-z">responded</a> that the critics “do not seem to have understood our estimation method.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the journal informed Boedeker’s group of a separate critique from a reader alleging they had overestimated the number of pesticide poisonings in France. The authors responded, but their response was apparently unsatisfactory. In April, an editor told the authors that the journal would retract their article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the authors’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/retraction-BMC-PH-final-080523.pdf">rebuttal</a> to the retraction, they were told the decision was based on the assessment of one editorial board member. After further back-and-forth, the authors learned the critical reader and editorial board member had concerns about the data the authors had sourced for other countries in addition to France. They defended their methods in detail in their rebuttal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boedeker told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The critique suggests that using an ‘ever’ prevalence of poisoning to denote annual frequency may result in an overestimation. We agreed on this and discussed this at length as a possible source for bias in our publication. However, the question is if such an overestimation has taken place. We detailed in our rebuttal that the prevalences used in our extrapolations are not higher than “true” annual ones and therefore no overestimation has taken place. For countries without a strict annual prevalence the effect on the extrapolations is negligible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On May 24, Natalie Pafitis, senior editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, emailed the authors saying the journal would still retract the article following “further advice” from an editorial board member on their rebuttal. Pafitis shared the editorial board member’s comments and wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As stated previously, and in light of the advice received above, we no longer have confidence in the data you are reporting in your study and will be proceeding with a retraction using the following text:</p>



<p>============</p>



<p>The Editor has retracted this article because concerns were raised about the use of&nbsp; ‘ever’ prevalence of pesticide poisoning to represent annual frequency in the extrapolations. Expert assessment has confirmed the validity of this concern and also concluded that the assumption of annual exposure for countries where the time frame is not reported is unreliable.&nbsp; The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented. [The authors agree/do not agree with this retraction].</p>



<p>===========</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pafitis has not responded to our request for comment. Last month, the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/27/exclusive-public-health-journal-says-it-will-retract-vaping-paper-for-questions-authors-say-were-addressed-in-peer-review/">retracted a paper</a> on e-cigarettes and smoking rates, also following a reader critique and assessment by an editorial board member, which the authors of that paper said was flawed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the pesticide paper <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rebuttal-BMC-PH-retraction-extension.pdf">responded</a> to the editorial board member’s new comments, disputing them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On July 14, their lawyer sent the journal a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-07-14-Letter-Resp.-to-Editors-re-Global-UAPP-Article-Retraction.pdf">letter</a> arguing that the retraction would be “inappropriate.” The lawyer proposed that the paper receive an expression of concern instead of a retraction notice, and that the authors be allowed to republish it elsewhere. The letter stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Authors feel strongly that the importance of the topic of their work requires more scientific debate, not the complete elimination of their findings from scientific discourse.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Boedeker said the journal should have asked the critical reader to submit a letter to the editor, “which would have generated an interesting dialogue on the science around estimations of pesticide poisoning,” and “could have encouraged further discussion of how to improve on data collection on pesticide poisonings, by governments and other institutions, in order to work towards preventing harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if the critique of the paper was correct, Boedeker said, the effect on the study’s results would be negligible, and the journal’s decision to retract wouldn’t line up with its own <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#corrections+and+retractions">policies</a>. &#8220;The retraction of our paper is an unacceptable result from an unacceptable process,&#8221; he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/huntingtons-disease-development-gene-brain">Why Huntington’s disease may take so long to develop</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> <strong>— </strong>Scientists have uncovered a clue about why it takes so long for Huntington’s disease to develop. And they may have a lead on how to stop the fatal brain disease.</p>



<p>Huntington’s is caused by a mistakenly repeated bit of a gene called <em>HTT.</em> Until recently, researchers thought the number of repeats a person is born with doesn’t change, though repeats may expand when passed to future generations.</p>



<p>But in some brain cells, the repeats <a href="https://eppro01.ativ.me/src/EventPilot/php/express/web/planner.php?id=ASHG23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can grow over time to hundreds of copies</a>, geneticist Bob Handsaker reported November 2 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. Once the number of repeats passes a certain point, the activity of thousands of other genes in the brain cells changes drastically, leading the cells to die.</p>





<p>These findings suggest that adding repeats to the <em>HTT</em> gene in vulnerable brain cells is what is driving Huntington’s disease, says Handsaker, of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Mass. The research also suggests that preventing the repeats from growing may stop the development of the disease.</p>



<p>The new work gives “serious insight into the disease mechanism,” says Russell Snell, a geneticist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>About 41,000 people in the United States have symptomatic Huntington’s disease, and another 200,000 are at risk of developing it. Inheriting just one copy of a repeat-riddled <em>HTT</em> gene produces symptoms.</p>



<p>Even though individuals are born with the disease-causing gene, symptoms don’t usually appear until people are in their 30s to 50s. Those symptoms include depression, mood swings, forgetfulness, balance problems, involuntary movements and slurred speech. Eventually, a person with the disease may be paralyzed and can die from complications such as pneumonia or heart failure.</p>



<p>In one part of the <em>HTT</em> gene, the DNA bases cytosine, adenine and guanine — CAG — are repeated over and over. Most people have 26 or fewer repeats, but people who have 40 or more repeats will develop Huntington’s disease. The more repeats, the earlier symptoms start.</p>



<p>Previously, researchers thought that long-term exposure to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/signs-huntingtons-show-brain-childhood">toxic huntingtin protein</a> — made from the disease-causing version of <em>HTT</em> — damaged and killed brain cells, much like smoking does to lung cells, Snell says (<em>SN: 10/18/15</em>).</p>



<p>In the new research, Handsaker and colleagues examined individual brain cells in donated brains from people with and without the disease. After measuring the length of the repeated genetic bit in all the cells, the researchers found a “dramatic expansion” of the repeats in brain cells called striatal projection neurons, also known as medium spiny neurons, in people with Huntington’s, Handsaker said. The extra DNA wasn&#8217;t found in other types of brain cells in people with or without the disease.</p>



<p>“Some cells had up to 1,000 CAG repeats,” Handsaker said. The additions “occurred only in the vulnerable cell types that are lost to” Huntington’s disease. Exactly why the repeats grow longer in those cells and not others is not yet known.</p>



<p>Only a few cells had such long stretches of repeats. Most spiny neurons had added more modest numbers, he said. Based on the ages of the donors when they died and on computer simulations, the researchers noticed an unusual pattern to the ever-accumulating repeats. It can take decades to go from about 40 repeats to 80, but then the process picks up steam. It takes only a few years to go from 90 repeats to 100s, Handsaker said.</p>



<p>It wasn’t clear at first whether additional repeats affected the brain cells. So, the researchers examined the activity of thousands of genes by charting RNA levels in the donated cells. The activity of those genes remained stable until the disease-causing version of <em>HTT</em> had about 150 repeats. Then, gene activity altered drastically: Thousands of genes increased activity, while thousands of others decreased.</p>





<p>Since precise levels of activity are needed to keep cells healthy, it’s probably this change that leads to the death of the cells within months of reaching 150. “It looks like a switch,” Snell says. “It looks like you’re OK, more or less, to 150.”</p>



<p>But, Handsaker said, why things are generally fine until that point and then go awry is another mystery. “We really don’t know what goes wrong at 150.”</p>



<p>Regardless, keeping the growth of the repeats in check may be a way to stop the disease from progressing. CAG sequences might inadvertently get added when a protein called MSH3, which is involved in repairing DNA, loses its place. Lowering levels of that protein may prevent the expansion, Handsaker said.</p>



<p>Current experimental techniques for managing Huntington’s focus on lowering the levels of huntingtin. Another insight of the new research, Snell says, is these strategies may not be necessary.</p>



<p>The “work represents a very interesting potential paradigm shift for [Huntington’s] research,” says Leora Fox, Assistant Director of Research and Patient Engagement for the Huntington’s Disease Society of America in New York City. “Huntingtin lowering is not dead, but targeting [DNA] instability holds therapeutic potential.”</p>



<p>Computational biologist Liana Lareau agrees. The work is “a success story for single-cell sequencing,” which the researchers used to examine DNA and RNA in individual cells. The new insights would not have been possible without examining how DNA changes and gene activity are coordinated, says Lareau, of the University of California, Berkeley. And brain donations were also key, she says. “We can’t see this type of thing when we look at cells … in a dish. You need the full complexity of the natural environment.”</p>

                <p>Smallpox, measles, mumps. These are among the contagious diseases that European colonists likely brought to the Americas at the turn of the 16th century, prompting the collapse of Indigenous populations. But the exact viruses that caused the millions of deaths remain unknown.</p>

<p>Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks to solve that historical puzzle. An evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, he uses cutting-edge tools to study ancient viruses and illuminate how they have shaped human evolution and history. In recent work, Blanco-Melo and colleagues reconstructed two viruses circulating in Mexico at the time of European colonization.</p>



<p>“Our research on ancient viruses is really appealing to the curiosity of the people and how we can study history,” Blanco-Melo says. But this work also holds personal meaning for Blanco-Melo as someone who was born and raised in Mexico. Through genetic sleuthing, he is able to study “something that is very dear in my heart,” he says, “really understanding, with molecular biology, those historical events.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Viruses shape human evolution</h4>



<p>Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school when he had a chance encounter with Matt Ridley’s book <em>Genome</em>. Blanco-Melo had bought it as a Father’s Day gift for his dad but ended up reading it himself. Later, with encouragement from his biology teacher, he enrolled in an undergraduate program in genomics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, campus in Cuernavaca.</p>



<p>He had his first encounter with ancient viruses as a Ph.D. student at the Rockefeller University in New York City. His research focused on particular viruses called endogenous retroviruses, remnants of past infectious viruses that have become integrated into a host’s genetic instruction book.</p>



<p>Blanco-Melo first cataloged the genetic remains left behind by an ancient retrovirus called HERV-T that spread among our primate ancestors tens of millions of years ago. Further analysis revealed that a gene responsible for producing the virus’s outer envelope stuck around throughout primate history; even modern humans retain an inactive version. This gene encodes the envelope protein that helps the virus enter and infect a cell by interacting with another protein on the cell surface.</p>



<p>Why would such a viral gene be so well preserved, Blanco-Melo wondered. What kind of evolutionary advantage could it have offered? Based on studies of cells in a lab dish, he hypothesizes that ancient primates <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/22519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must have co-opted the viral gene</a> and used the related protein to get rid of the cell surface protein, essentially blocking the virus’s entry into cells.</p>



<p>This example highlights how a virus’s own genetic material, over the course of evolution, can be used against it. “This project not only satisfied my curiosity, but we were able to push it into a full-blown story of how a virus evolved, emerged, but also how that virus ceased to exist,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>



<p>Perhaps today’s researchers can exploit similar strategies to combat current retroviruses — “the big goal being HIV,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Delineating historical events</h4>



<p>More recently, Blanco-Melo has teamed up with María Ávila-Arcos, an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM and an old friend, to study viral epidemics that largely wiped out Indigenous populations in the Americas.</p>



<p>Blanco-Melo, Ávila-Arcos and a team of researchers extracted and isolated viral DNA from skeletal remains that they dated to somewhere between the 15th and 17th centuries. These remains come from mass graves at a colonial hospital and a chapel in what is now Mexico City. Archaeological and hospital autopsy records suggest that the remains in the graves belonged to Indigenous people and enslaved Africans who were victims of epidemics that occurred during the 1540s and 1570s.</p>





<p>Based on those findings, the team reconstructed the genetic instruction books of two viruses not previously known to be circulating at that time — human parvovirus B19 and a human hepatitis B virus.</p>



<p>The study, published in 2021 in the journal <em>eLife</em>, is perhaps the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first to obtain ancient viral sequences from the Americas</a>, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutch who wasn’t involved in this work.</p>



<p>“Knowing about the ancient viruses that were infecting people hundreds of years ago is of great scientific and historical interest throughout the world, but especially of interest in the Americas,” Bloom says.</p>



<p>The team found that the ancient viruses were similar to contemporary African strains. They “seem to have arrived in Mexico shortly after the European arrival,” Blanco-Melo says, “but they did not come from Europe. They came from Africa, basically through the transatlantic slave trade.”</p>



<p>Through the collaboration, Blanco-Melo has been careful to avoid helicopter research, where outsiders come to a place, get the data and take credit for the resulting work. “These samples should stay in Mexico, should be analyzed by Mexican researchers … and all those results are, of course, going to be communicated back into the communities. That’s our goal,” he says.</p>



<p>Though the two viruses the team identified aren’t likely to have caused massive epidemics, they could have exacerbated some of the symptoms of other diseases. Ongoing projects based on the same samples from Mexico are looking for other viruses and even peptides to get a fuller picture of the viruses from that time — and perhaps pin down big culprits. “There&#8217;s a lot more research that needs to be done in order to capture those other causative agents,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>

<p>Around Christmas last year, Preston Sowell received an unpleasant delivery. </p>



<p>An archaeologist who knew about Sowell’s work in southeastern Peru sent him a paper about new findings in a particular part of the country Sowell, an independent environmental scientist, was familiar with. The paper, written by several of Sowell’s former colleagues, contained a “shocking” surprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I almost immediately recognized there were errors in the paper,” Sowell said. “I recognised, literally with my first read, some of those artifacts.”</p>



<span id="more-128243"></span>



<p>Artifacts that Sowell recognized as findings from his own projects years earlier had been published without permission. He also said the authors misidentified the location of the artifacts, and falsely claimed the objects had been collected from excavations, not obtained at the surface of the sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2011, Sowell initiated archaeological research in the vicinity of Peru’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Sibinacocha">Lake Sibinacocha</a>, the subject of the paper, after finding artifacts believed to be pre-Incan submerged in the lake. He also runs a nonprofit focused on the protection and conservation of the watershed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No one had notified Sowell when the paper had been published in May 2022. “Which is pretty disturbing,” he says. “Considering my long history at the site and how much I contributed to all this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/00934690.2022.2072161?needAccess=true">Pastoral Paleoclimate Palimpsests of the South-Central Andes: High-Altitude Herder Dwellings in the 2nd Millennium a.d.</a>,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Field Archaeology</em> and has no citations to date. Earlier this year, the journal retracted the article after the authors confirmed the work contained “fundamental errors”. Sowell says the retraction “doesn’t fully characterize the issues of the paper” and adds that he had to complain several times before the journal pulled the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sowell first decided to email <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8195F9EDB2ED622106724A5FAFB7A0">a complaint about the paper</a> to Christina Luke, editor of the <em>Journal of Field Archaeology</em>, in January, alleging that several artifacts included as findings in the author’s 2019 field work were not found at the sites nor on the dates listed in the paper. Instead, Sowell alleges, many of the artifacts were collected under his own projects in the area in surface collections beginning in 2015.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also claims the authors used data from his projects without permission, and that the paper includes a number of miscitations, misinformation and incorrect observations.</p>



<p>Luke wrote back to Sowell in March, informing him that an erratum would be published for the paper, and that his concerns about authorship, permissions and claims of falsified data should be directed to the home institution of the author. “It was shocking and confusing,” Sowell says of the response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sowell had also been in contact with the Office of Research Integrity and Ethics at Washington University, the home institute of Sarah Baitzel, lead author of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, a research integrity officer from the university emailed Sowell with his assessment of Sowell’s allegations. The officer wrote that Baitzel had agreed to publish a correction for one of the figures in the paper. The officer described the reason for the correction as “an honest error, which does not constitute research misconduct under our Policy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If this was an honest error, it would be easy to refute,” Sowell says. </p>



<p>The email continues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Therefore, I do not find that the evidence supports initiating research misconduct proceedings and the allegation is dismissed. The concerns, other than those related to Figure 8 raised in your communication, would not constitute research misconduct under our Policy and are either differences of scientific opinion or matters outside of the scope of our policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In May, Sowell sent another complaint to the Office of Research Integrity and Ethics. He wrote the follow-up complaint as a formal document that compiled information from several of his emails and included some additional errors and his issues with the erratum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July, he received a response from the office, confirming the paper would be retracted. The email included a note from Baitzel addressed to Sowell:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In response to your letter, I am writing to inform you that I have discovered an error in the article and as a result, I and my coauthors have decided to retract the article. I have already spoken with the editor of JFA, Dr. Luke, to initiate the process.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2023.2249332">retraction notice</a>, published in August this year, states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since publication, concerns have been raised about the integrity of the data in the article. When approached for an explanation, the authors checked their data and confirmed there are fundamental errors present. Therefore, they have agreed to the retraction of this article. The authors apologise for this oversight.</p>



<p>We have been informed in our decision-making by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retractions.</p>



<p>The retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly record, but it will be digitally watermarked on each page as “Retracted”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Baitzel, Luke, nor research integrity committee members responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Taylor &amp; Francis, the journal’s publisher, wrote in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We were first made aware of this issue in January 2023. We followed standard COPE guidelines in looking at the claims made, working with the Editor of the journal to address the concerns raised. This ultimately led to the corresponding author acknowledging there were fundamental errors present in the paper, which resulted in the decision to retract the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The representative replied to a follow-up email requesting more detail:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I’m afraid we have no further information to provide outside of what is already in the retraction notice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Sowell, who has tried to protect the Lake Sibinacocha archaeological area from mining, says the errors are “egregious.” The area “is a blank spot on the map relative to archaeology and cultural heritage,” he says. “[The authors] have contaminated the archaeological record up there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before making his complaint, Sowell contacted Payson Sheets, a research professor in archaeology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who has not been involved with this work. Sheets underscored the enormity of such an error, helping Sowell understand why it was important to make the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to other fields of research, “replication testing can never be done in archaeology,” Sheets says. “Once excavations are done, that can never be duplicated, it cannot be replicated, it cannot be tested. It is a moral and ethical imperative for us to be very thorough.”</p>

                <p>For PLOS, increasing data-sharing rates&mdash;and especially increasing the amount of data shared in a repository&mdash;is a high priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research data is a vital part of the scientific record, essential to both understanding and reproducing published research. And data repositories are the most effective and impactful way to share research data. Not only is deposited data safer and more discoverable, articles with data in a repository have a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20citation%20prediction,studies%20%5B24%E2%80%9328%5D.">25% higher citation rate</a> on average.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">support from the Wellcome Trust</a>, we&rsquo;ve been experimenting with two solutions designed to increase awareness about data repositories and promote data repository use among both authors and readers. One solution didn&rsquo;t achieve its expected outcome in the context we tested it (a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; result) while the other shows promise as a tool for increasing engagement with deposited data. The mixed outcomes are an example of why it&rsquo;s so important to share all research results regardless of their outcome &ndash; whether &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo; results. We hope that our experiences, what we&rsquo;ve learned, and above all the data and results, can help the scholarly communications community to develop new and better solutions to meet the challenges we all face, and advance Open Science.</p>

<h2>PLOS data repository experiments, 2021-2023</h2>



<h3>Experiment 1: Using iconography to highlight data shared in a repository</h3>



<p><strong>Question</strong></p>



<p>Does highlighting data in a repository linked to published research articles with an eye-catching graphic in the form of an Accessible Data icon increase access to the associated dataset?</p>



<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>



<p>We hypothesized that:</p>



<ol><li>the Accessible Data icon would be associated with a statistically significant increase in engagement with datasets, and&nbsp;</li><li>the icon would motivate authors to deposit their data in a repository in order to have the icon applied to their article</li></ol>



<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>



<p>An Accessible Data icon automatically appeared on any article published after 2014 that included a link in its Data Availability Statement to one of three popular data repositories (Dryad, Figshare, and OSF) beginning on March 29 2022. Readers can see and click on the icon from any eligible PLOS journal article and be directed straight to the data in the repository.</p>



<p><strong>Data</strong></p>



<p>Usage data relating to the number of Accessible Data icon link clicks, and internal data from Figshare, one of three selected repositories. A survey of 4,898 researchers, and follow-up interviews with 12 researchers.</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>In the first 12 months of the experiment (April 2022-March 2023) we recorded more than 20,000 reader clicks on the icon across all PLOS properties. Through analysis of 543 Figshare datasets linked to PLOS articles, we observed that in the 12 months prior to the launch of the icon, the average number of views received per month was 2.5, rising to 3.0 in the 12 months following the launch (a statistically significant relative increase of 20%).</p>



<p>Survey respondents who were aware of the Accessible Data feature and who had used a repository were asked to what extent the feature influenced their decision to use a repository: 51% answered that they were influenced either somewhat or strongly by the existence of the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked about the impact of the Accessible Data feature on their future likelihood of submitting to a repository: 40% were more or much more likely to use a repository.</p>



<h3>Experiment 2: Integrating Dryad into the Editorial Manager submission system for <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> to ease repository use</h3>



<p><strong>Question</strong></p>



<p>If authors have the option to submit their data to a repository as part of journal submission, will repository use increase?</p>



<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>



<p>We predicted an absolute increase of 10 percentage points in the use of data repositories by <em>PLOS Pathogens </em>authors, from the 2020 baseline of 25% to 35%.</p>



<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>



<p>A new option appeared on the Attached Files screen in the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> Editorial Manager submission system on October 5 2021, allowing authors to upload research data to Dryad. Authors were redirected into the Dryad system via a popup window where they entered the required information and files and received a Dryad DOI, which they could then include in the Data Availability Statement later in the submission process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details and instructions were added to the journal submission guidelines, Editorial Manager submission system, and PLOS website, and the offering was promoted through established channels including email, social media, and advertising.</p>



<p><strong>Data</strong></p>



<p>Usage data from the Editorial Manager submission system and Dryad. Survey data from 654 researchers who submitted to <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>About 2% of submitting<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> authors (44 submitting author groups) used the integrated repository feature. <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>&rsquo; repository use for the first half of 2023 was 33%, however this appears to be part of an ongoing organic increase that began prior to the experiment.</p>



<p>Among the 574 survey respondents who did not share or plan to share data using the Dryad integration, the biggest reasons included lack of awareness (35%), uncertainty in how to use the integration (26%), and that data had already been uploaded to another repository (21%).</p>



<h2>Our next steps</h2>



<p>As a result of these experiments and our findings, we&rsquo;ve made the decision to discontinue the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> integration with Dryad. PLOS will continue its publisher membership of Dryad and our authors are still encouraged to use it to share data in their own workflows. We look forward to exploring other ways to increase use of repositories. Because of the promising results from the Accessible Data icon, we decided to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">extend the service</a> to include an additional six repositories, for nine total. We look forward to seeing&mdash;and sharing&mdash;the outcomes from this next phase of work.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Paul Moggridge will talk about his conference paper entitled &quot;On Instance Weighted Clustering Ensembles&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Ensemble clustering is a technique which combines multiple clustering results, and
instance weighting is a technique which highlights important instances in a dataset. Both
techniques are known to enhance clustering performance and robustness. In this research,
ensembles and instance weighting are integrated with the spectral clustering algorithm. We
believe this is the first attempt at creating diversity in the generative mechanism using
density-based instance weighting for a spectral ensemble. The proposed approach is
empirically validated using synthetic datasets comparing against spectral and a spectral
ensemble with random instance weighting. Results show that using the instance weighted
sub-sampling approach as the generative mechanism for an ensemble of spectral clustering
leads to improved clustering performance on datasets with imbalanced clusters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/moving-overseas-for-your-phd">Moving overseas for your PhD</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Through this series, we will be sharing first-hand advice on applying for postgraduate courses. Here, Carly Hood reflects on her own experience moving from Australia to the UK for her PhD with plenty of practical advice. </strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_2737008ee0ee4edbaaad8c73004bb3fb~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Image credit: Chad Peltola via Unsplash" ></figure><p><strong>Who am I and what am I interested in?</strong></p>
<p>I am a PhD student at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, originally from Brisbane, Australia. As a member of the Genomic Disorders and Cognitive Development Lab, I work with children who have intellectual impairment of known genetic origin and their families. My research aims to use computational and network approaches to examine how genes mediate brain structure, brain function and cognition with a view to develop targeted support for these kids.</p>

<p><strong>What lead to my decision to move overseas? </strong></p>
<p>Prior to my PhD, I did both my Bachelor of Speech Pathology and Masters in Neuroscience in Brisbane. My clinical work with children who have rare genetic conditions lead to my research interest in isolating biological mechanisms of neurodevelopment. The rarity of these genetic conditions, however, meant that the few institutions working in this area were all located in overseas in countries with larger populations, <a href=""  >namely the United Kingdom, United States and Europe.</a> I had always wanted to move overseas, so this was an excellent opportunity to do so while advancing my professional interests. </p>

<p><strong>Why did I decide to come to the UK?</strong></p>
<p>From the outset, I felt the length and structure of the US programmes were less aligned with what I wanted from a PhD. They are approximately 5- 7 years, as opposed to 4 in the EU and the UK, with the first two years largely comprised of coursework and lab rotations. Given that I had already done a masters and knew the exact research question I wanted to address, the UK and EU programme structures were better suited.</p>

<p><strong>How did I choose programmes to apply to?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to preface here that, often, starting a PhD overseas is a matter of securing both a place in a programme and funding. I first identified the programmes and researchers I was interested in and then noted specific funding requirements. I compiled an excel sheet where I listed all the programmes and their deadlines as well as respective funding options (which may have a separate deadline). </p>
<blockquote>You have to prepare yourself for a prolonged process with pinch-points, but the experience on the other side is incomparable</blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on funding</strong></p>
<p>International students incur fees about triple those of home students and are often eligible for far fewer funding schemes. Further, the dwindling research funds following Brexit has made finding funding even more of a challenge. Each programme will differ. Some offer funded positions, others direct you to other potential sources of funding and others accept self-funded students. Many EU institutes for example provide a generous salary, compared to a tax-free stipend in the UK. I also investigated broad funding schemes that were for Australian students to pursue post-graduate studies overseas. Note that these deadlines are often before the programme application deadlines - sometimes over a year in advance, such as in the case of the John Monash Scholarship in Australia. In writing this article, I’m taken back to the number of late nights I sat hunched, 20 links deep and trying to figure out my eligibility for various funding schemes. PhD applications are time consuming and taxing at the best of times, let alone with the added layer of finding funding. There is a sweet spot between too few and too many applications -  what worked for me was choosing a limited number of programmes (I seriously considered about 4 and prepared applications for 2) where you can really see yourself spending 4 years and focus the funding search to these. </p>

<p><strong>How did I approach my applications?</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the 4 programmes I would actively consider, I started my research. I spoke to each Principle Investigator (you are interviewing your supervisor as much as they are interviewing you), their students (it is indicative of a good work-place culture when supervisors put you in touch with their students specifically) and people I knew of in the field. Another advantage of talking to supervisors is that they may know of other funding opportunities and can provide tailored advice you may not get from admissions websites. Then it came to constructing the application which involved writing research proposals and personal statements, requesting references, and filling out funding applications. </p>
<blockquote>I’ve had to actively remind myself that settling in will take time - eventually I’ll come to a semblance of balance between life in the UK and home</blockquote>
<p><strong>Eventually… the move </strong></p>
<p>Following a protracted process, I was very fortunate to be offered a funded position at the MRC CBU in Cambridge which I promptly accepted. Though this was a huge relief, I now needed to consider the logistics of moving country. This process was tiring and at times stressful, but at least the finish line was in sight. It involved making arrangements for leaving Australia (suspending health insurance, registering for overseas voting, notifying banks etc) and for living in the UK (applying for visas, registering with the NHS, arranging insurance, opening a bank account, transferring funds etc). Of note, your visa requirements may specify an arrival date or periods of time where you cannot be in the country. In my case, my offer conditions needed to be fulfilled so I could be issued a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) to use in my application for a student visa before arriving. It is also important to not underestimate the cost of moving on top of paying for visas immigration health surcharges and general cost-of-living. You may need to save accordingly throughout the process of applying. <a href=""  >A  further consideration is paying any living expenses upfront (as was the case with the college system at Cambridge).</a></p>

<p><strong>Starting the PhD  </strong></p>
<p>As for starting the PhD, I certainly underestimated the challenges of starting a highly involved programme whilst also adjusting a new place of residence. Even coming from somewhere with a reasonably comparable culture with the same language, there have been various points of difference to navigate. I’ve had to actively remind myself that settling in will take time - eventually I’ll come to a semblance of balance between life in the UK and home. It takes time to figure out how to best maintain long-distance relationships with family and friends at home (don’t get me started on the time difference…). I also remind myself that this will be in flux throughout my time here. </p>

<p><strong>Overall… </strong></p>
<p>For anyone who is considering pursuing higher degree research and has also considered moving overseas, my advice is to just start looking! Yes, you have to prepare yourself for a prolonged process with pinch-points as I outlined, but the experience on the other side is incomparable. Higher degree research is a particularly flexible time where you are largely responsible for your individual progress and are therefore afforded periods of flexibility that can be leveraged. In my case this is to travel - it is still astounding to me that I can visit another country for a weekend – and also pursue other personal interests. The added benefit of moving to Cambridge, which has a vibrant international community, is that I have met many like-minded individuals who have gone through similar processes. Thus far, I have relished the experience of moving to a completely unfamiliar country and how this has enriched my life, both personally and professionally. </p><hr><p>This article was written by Carly Hood and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-water-molecules-evaporate-heat">Light, not just heat, might spur water to evaporate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Green light means “go.” That might apply to evaporating water molecules too.</p>



<p>Visible light, especially that of a greenish hue, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312751120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might spur water to evaporate</a>, researchers report in the Nov. 7 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. In experiments, water evaporating under visible light showed a higher evaporation rate than possible based on heat alone, MIT mechanical engineer Gang Chen and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Coupled with other observations, they say, the finding suggests that when light shines on water, individual particles of light, or photons, can sever the bonds that connect water molecules, releasing clusters of molecules into the air.</p>





<p>“This is super exciting stuff,” says Yuki Nagata, a chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany, who was not part of the research. He notes that the hypothesis needs additional checking. “We are not 100 percent sure this is really the mechanism,” he says. But if it is, it’s “totally new.”</p>



<p>Normally, heat is what gets evaporation going, causing water molecules in the liquid to jostle more vigorously. That extra energy can break some of the bonds between molecules in the liquid, allowing molecules to escape as water vapor. Based on how much heat goes in, scientists can calculate the amount of evaporation expected. Visible light can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/turning-water-steam-no-boiling-required">help water evaporate</a> due to the heat it imparts (<em>SN: 3/8/16</em>). But until now, it wasn’t thought to directly break the bonds between water molecules.</p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers shone light on water contained in porous hydrogels, materials that greedily sop up water. The proposed effect occurs where air meets water, and the hydrogels the researchers studied contain innumerable crannies where the two meet, allowing the water to be cleaved off and escape. In some cases, the evaporation rate was more than double the expectation based on heat. What’s more, the evaporation rate varied with the wavelength of the light. Green light produced the highest evaporation rate.</p>



<p>That wavelength dependence is convincing support for the researchers’ hypothesis, says thermodynamicist Janet A.W. Elliott of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. “If you just shine [visible] light on something, how do you know if it’s the light or the heat from the light that’s doing your job? But if it’s wavelength dependent … that’s evidence that the light part of it matters.” Additionally, she says, the excess evaporation didn’t occur when a heater was used instead of light.</p>



<p>When heat drives evaporation, molecules typically escape one at a time. But measurements of the temperature of the vapor above the hydrogel suggest that when light is driving the evaporation, water molecules escape in clusters. Then the clusters themselves evaporate, breaking into individual water molecules, cooling the vapor in the process.</p>



<p>In general, the measured vapor temperature was higher closer to the hydrogel, just as steam is hottest directly above a boiling pan. But in a pocket of vapor between about 8 to 14 millimeters above the surface, the temperature didn’t vary with height. That, the researchers say, is evidence of a region where the air is saturated with individual water molecules, and where clusters continually evaporate and recondense.</p>



<p>“It’s pretty convincing that, in this particular experimental setup, you can see clumps of molecules coming off and then those clumps evaporate,” Elliott says.</p>



<p>But, Elliott says, “there’s still lots of questions to be answered.” For example, the researchers don’t explain in detail how the photons could break the bonds or why it works best with green light.</p>



<p>Chen admits that the theoretical explanation involves some handwaving. Still, he hopes that this effect could be put to use for practical purposes, such as more efficient ways of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-desalination-tech-could-help-quench-global-thirst">making freshwater from saltwater</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/16</em>)</p>



<p>The effect might be widespread in nature, Chen says, in water within porous materials like soil or plants, or in foams on the surface of the ocean. “We have a feeling this is really happening daily, widely, and that’s why we’re very excited about this.”</p>
