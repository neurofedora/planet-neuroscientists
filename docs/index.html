                <p>After 15 happy years on WordPress.com, I&#8217;ve moved to Substack at <a href="https://neuroai.science">neuroai.science</a>. I&#8217;ve already published more than a dozen long-form articles on neuroscience and AI over there in newsletter format. You can subscribe or read the archives completely free. </p>



<p>Substack makes it easy to create sticky experiences for audiences and reach them where they are–in their email. This is all the more important as traditional social media channels have de-emphasized link sharing, making it harder to maintain an audience. The archives of xcorr.net will remain here. Thank you for supporting the blog over its long run!</p>

<p>President Trump recently issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/restoring-gold-standard-science/">executive order</a> calling for improvement in the reproducibility of scientific research and asking federal agencies to propose how they will make that happen. I imagine that the National Institutes of Health’s response will include replication studies, in which NIH would fund attempts to repeat published experiments from the ground up, to see if they generate consistent results.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearingto-consider-the-nomination-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-of-california-to-be-secretary-of-health-and-human-services">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and NIH director <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/council/april-21-2025-agenda">Jay Bhattacharya</a> have already proposed such studies with the objective of determining which NIH-funded research findings are reliable. The goals are presumably to boost public trust in science, improve health-policy decision making, and prevent wasting additional funds on research that relies on unreliable findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a former biomedical researcher, editor, and publisher, and a current consultant about image data integrity, I would argue that conducting systematic replication studies of pre-clinical research is neither an effective nor an efficient strategy to achieve the objective of identifying reliable research. Such studies would be an impractical use of NIH funds, especially in the face of extensive proposed budget cuts.</p>



<span id="more-132022"></span>



<p>When I interviewed for my first job in scholarly publishing more than 30 years ago, one of the questions I was asked was, &#8220;Are you OK with the fact that half of what you publish will turn out to be wrong?&#8221; We didn’t call the pervasiveness of unreliable research a “reproducibility crisis” then. We just accepted as fact that science is an inefficient, iterative process. Researchers have never been under the illusion that everything published is correct. The enterprise of science progresses by means of a messy combination of error-correction, replication, and accumulation of corroborating lines of evidence, the latter of which is vital for any work with the potential to change medical care or health policy.</p>

<p>The “crisis” came to light with the publication of replication studies by authors from <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrd3439-c1">Bayer Healthcare in 2011</a> and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/483531a">Amgen in 2012</a>. Bayer and Amgen reported on their efforts to replicate published pre-clinical research, primarily in the field of cancer biology, before initiating their own drug-development programs based on the work. The companies found that ~66 percent and 89 percent, respectively, of published studies could not be replicated. Those quantifications were higher than expected based on folklore, although a <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71601">more recent study</a> was closer to the 50 percent mark.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The consequences of irreplicability, in which studies gain attention or even traction despite the inability of others to replicate or meaningfully build on them, are serious, and addressing this issue is worthwhile. Improving replicability could save money, decrease time to discovery (which leads to decreased human suffering and health-care costs), and increase public trust in science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are numerous problems with (and questions raised by) using systematic, post-publication efforts to improve replicability in biomedical research.</p>



<p><strong>Sheer volume</strong>: Replicating a small number of studies will not make a dent in the problem when <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2024.100968">there are over 1 million articles per year published</a> in biomedical journals. Granted, only a small percentage of published studies will interest other researchers to an extent that they will want to build on them and thus need the work to be replicable. How will those studies be identified for replication? Dr. Bhattacharya has <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/council/april-21-2025-agenda">alluded to a selection process</a> “by the scientific community at large”— in other words, a post-publication peer-review process. Does NIH have the capacity to take on another review process? Can the review be done quickly as part of an initiative that is already time-sensitive?</p>



<p><strong>Selection criteria</strong>: There is already an NIH replication initiative, under which researchers can elect to have their own studies replicated. This process is likely self-selecting for robust studies, creating a bias toward replicable work. Someone who does careless work is not likely to volunteer to have it replicated. It is notable that uptake of the existing program, which has been in place for a year, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-launches-initiative-double-check-biomedical-studies">has been sparse</a>. Will the replication studies envisioned by RFK Jr. and Dr. Bhattacharya be forced on authors? It may be hard to draw reliable scientific inferences from replication efforts that take place in the absence of author cooperation.</p>



<p><strong>What constitutes replication?</strong> The criteria for defining “replication” are unclear. Do they entail remaking every recombinant DNA construct? Rerunning every assay? Resequencing every genome? Remaking every mouse knockout? And how many attempts at replication constitute failure? Failure to replicate once does not mean that you won’t replicate on the second, third, or fourth attempt.</p>



<p><strong>Sufficient expertise</strong>: Many types of experiments require substantial expertise and experience, and it may be difficult to find researchers with the appropriate expertise who are willing to function as service providers to replicate studies. This could lead to reliable studies being misclassified as irreplicable.</p>



<p><strong>Dissemination of replication studies</strong>: Will all NIH-sponsored replication studies have to be published in the <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/council/april-21-2025-agenda">new journal proposed by Dr. Bhattacharya</a>? If not, how will the public be informed of the results of the replication studies? The results of the existing NIH replication initiative are <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-launches-initiative-double-check-biomedical-studies">not being made public</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Consequences for the original study</strong>: What are the consequences if a study cannot be replicated? Should the original paper be retracted? Should it at least get an “Expression of Concern”? Should the authors be denied funding in the future?</p>



<p>What happens if a study <em>can</em> be replicated. At the very least, the original publication should get some sort of gold star badge, indicating this fact and linking to the replication study, assuming it’s published somewhere. Either way, the public should be informed.</p>



<p><strong>Timing is everything</strong>: If a study is deemed irreplicable, that information will probably arrive too late to be of use by any interested parties. By the time NIH has chosen the studies to replicate, and replication efforts have conclusively failed, it seems likely that any pharma/biotech scientist who is interested in the work will already have failed to replicate it and moved on to another approach. The same goes for any academic who is trying to build on the work. In other words, people will have already spent time figuring out for themselves whatever the findings of the replication initiative later reveal. Thus, timing is a fundamental problem with creating a systematic replication program post-publication.</p>



<p><strong>Public trust</strong>: If history is any guide, failure to replicate will not serve to correct public misunderstandings of science. For example, the Wakefield study linking the MMR vaccine to autism has failed to replicate many times, yet a substantial portion of the public continues to believe it. How many replications are sufficient to convince people? Perhaps the focus should instead be on public communication around known failures to replicate.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">What can be done to improve replicability in pre-clinical research? I believe the focus should be upstream of publication, before irreplicable studies get into the published literature.</p>



<p>There are many stages in the process of scientific research where flaws might be introduced, all of which are targets for intervention: Poor study design and execution. Poor characterization of materials such as antibodies or cell lines, and poor description of methods. Inappropriate statistical analysis. Selective data presentation. There’s outright fraud, including the new scourge of wholly fabricated articles for sale by “paper mills,” which is <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/24/1-in-7-scientific-papers-is-fake-suggests-study-that-author-calls-wildly-nonsystematic/">far more prevalent</a> in biomedical research than the old “few bad apples” notion. And there’s the distorted incentive of publish-or-perish, which can cause people to deliberately cut corners to publish quickly and frequently by not replicating their own work enough times before deciding it is ready for publication.</p>



<p>In my own field of image forensics, I have advocated for more than 20 years for systematic and universal screening of image data before publication. There are now automated ways to perform such screens, which should lower the bar for participation in this type of quality control by all stakeholders, including funders, institutions, and publishers. These algorithms are still far from perfect, but they allow for rapid screening at scale.</p>



<p>There are also automated ways to screen for numerous other indicators of the robustness and reliability of a study — for example, inappropriate statistical analysis, use of generative AI, or evidence of paper mill activity — that should be deployed more widely. Screening, of course, is much easier to apply universally to all articles before publication compared to replication studies after publication.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, neither replication efforts nor screening of data pre-publication will change the underlying problem of the publish-or-perish culture. This perverse incentive costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year funding non-robust science for the personal gain of researchers in desperate need of funding, hiring, or promotion, to the detriment of science’s proper pursuit of truth.</p>



<p>Successfully reducing that incentive structure by rewarding quality over quantity will motivate researchers to replicate their own work more times before publication. Perhaps a minimum number of replications can be codified and formally paid for as a line item in grant funding. Showing all replications in a published paper and making all of the underlying data available to the public will help to address public trust in science. Funders, institutions, and publishers all have roles in addressing this problem and helping to reduce the number of irreplicable studies that are published.</p>

<p>Does it even matter if a proof is erroneous when the result is true? Does someone reading a wrong proof of a true theorem truly <em>know</em> the result? One line of thought, going back to Plato, is that as long as the (wrong) proof (1) provides justified true belief in the theorem (i.e., there is some justification for believing it is true), (2) that the reader believes the theorem, and (3) that the theorem is indeed intrinsically true, then yes, the reader <em>knows</em> the result. This is the justified-true-belief (JTB) tripartite analysis of knowledge. In a landmark <a href="https://fitelson.org/proseminar/gettier.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1963 paper</a> philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gettier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edmund Gettier</a> disagreed. He provided two thought experiments that he argued show that while JTB analysis may be necessary for knowledge, it is not sufficient. In particular, Gettier&#8217;s examples implied that if belief in a theorem stems from a falsehood, then the theorem is not known. This is not the only issue raised by Gettier&#8217;s counterexamples, but it is the one that Litt&#8217;s question implicitly touches on.</p>



<p>So how many true results in mathematics are currently believed to be true based on false proofs? I thinking about this question, I think it&#8217;s helpful to discuss an example of such an instance from my own work. In 2007, in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-007-9116-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper with Radu Mihaescu and Dan Levy</a>, we settled a conjecture in phylogenetics, known as Atteson&#8217;s conjecture, in the affirmative:</p>

<p>Our proof of Atteson&#8217;s conjecture follows from Theorem 25 in our paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-007-9116-4">Mihaescu, Levy, Pachter, 2005</a>. In fact, Theorem 25 proves a stronger result. But our paper also established something else, namely that another &#8220;proof&#8221; of Atteson&#8217;s conjecture, in the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.tcs.2006.08.044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dai, Xu, and Zhu, 2005</a>, was false. In our Theorem 34 we showed that the Dai et al. paper contained an argument that is fundamentally flawed. Thus, while Atteson&#8217;s conjecture is true, i.e. it is a theorem, belief in its truth prior to our work was based on an erroneous proof. This is a single, yet compelling example, of Litt&#8217;s concern.</p>



<p>We considered whether it is worthwhile, or important, to correct the literature, i.e. to ask the journal Theroetical Computer Science, where Dai et al. published their work, to post a note explaining that the Dai et al. proof was incorrect. At the end we decided that it is important to correct the literature, because proof techniques can in some cases turn out to be more valuable than the results they are used for. And we thought we could reduce noise in mathematics so that a future mathematician would not be led astray using the arguments of Dai et al. So we wrote a note to the journal (Theoretical Computer Science) asking to publish the following erratum (reproduced below in its entirety):</p>

In fact, in Theorem 34 in [3] we provide an example in which such a tree does not exist. Our example shows that the intermediate distance matrices may be further than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cell%28e%29%7D%7B4%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cell%28e%29%7D%7B4%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cell%28e%29%7D%7B4%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;frac{&#92;ell(e)}{4} " class="latex" /> from any tree metric. This presents a problem not only for the proof of Theorem 2 of [2], but also for Theorem 4 of [4].</p>



<p>The edge radius theorem can be proved inductively by relaxing the hypothesis, as is done in Theorem 25 of [3].</p>

<p>The journal editor at the time sent our note to the authors of the Dai et al. manuscript, who said that they disagreed with us and refused to do anything about it. The journal didn&#8217;t publish our erratum. I sent a follow up email a few years later asking again that the erratum be published (although frankly the Dai et al. paper should have been retracted in its entirety). The editor of Theoretical Computer Science refused again. </p>



<p>The Gettier problem above highlights an epistemic failure of epistemic failure: the following two points are rarely acknowledged and not well understood (including by scientists!):</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Neither being right for the wrong reason nor wrong for the right reason constitutes knowledge</strong>. As discussed above, knowledge requires more than just truth, and more than justified true belief.</li>



<li><strong>In</strong> <strong>science being wrong for the right reason does frequently constitute progress, whereas being right for the wrong reason rarely does</strong>. Yet, it is common for science to be hailed as fundamentally flawed when results are shown to be wrong and for it to be hailed as successful when beliefs held for wrong reasons turn out to be right.</li>
</ol>



<p>For instance, Newton&#8217;s theory of gravity is incomplete in the sense that while it holds in many regimes of physics, it has limitations. However, Newton&#8217;s derivation of his laws were based on right reasoning, which is why they were successful in explaining many physical phenomena, such as Kepler&#8217;s laws of planetary motion. Indeed, Newton&#8217;s theory constituted progress, and played a direct role in our current more complete picture of gravity described by the theory of general relativity. Similarly, in biology, the initial characterization of the DSCAM gene (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-abstract/7/2/227/641433?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yamakawa et al., 1998</a>) was incomplete; it took place at a time when biology was understood through the lens of the one gene, one protein, one function theory. The characterization had its limitations (<a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)80878-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schmucker et al., 2000</a>). But the discovery of DSCAM was based on right reasoning. And its discovery constituted progress: we now have a more complete picture of the tremendous isoform diversity of genes, which has forced us to revisit the one gene, one protein, one function paradigm. The word &#8220;wrong&#8221; is often used to describe scientific work that is better characterized as &#8220;incomplete&#8221;.</p>



<p>In regards to erroneous proofs of true statements in mathematics, I doubt they are common and disagree with Litt that they constitute a &#8220;not insubstantial portion of the literature&#8221;. The example of Atteson&#8217;s conjecture was, in my opinion, a rare case brought about partly due to mathematical phylogenetics being a small field and not as well-trodden as mainstream fields of mathematics. The typical trajectory for erroneous proofs of true theorems is perhaps better exemplified by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The true theorem with initially published with incomplete and non-rigorous proofs, but revisited frequently, until it was eventually formalized properly (<a href="https://nonagon.org/ExLibris/argand-fundamental-theorem-algebra">first by Jean Robert Argand</a>).</p>



<p>In other words, <strong>most published research results are true</strong> <em>and</em> replete with correct proofs and/or evidence of their truth. Sometimes published results are incomplete, or even wrong, and it is certainly a worthwhile endeavor to work on correcting the scientific record. I&#8217;ve spent a not insubstantial portion of my career doing exactly that. However, even when published results are wrong, they usually turn out to be useful.</p>

<p>The authors of an article linking scores on a “wokeness” scale and mental health issues are&nbsp; blaming political bias for the retraction of their paper in March following post-publication peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sjop.13065">Do Conservatives Really Have an Advantage in Mental Health? An Examination of Measurement Invariance</a>,” appeared in the <em>Scandinavian Journal of Psychology</em> last August. It has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, one being the retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Following publication of this article, concerns were raised by third parties about the conclusions drawn by the authors based on the data provided,” according to the March 26 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sjop.13109">notice</a>. After investigating, the publisher and the journal “concluded that the article contains major errors involving methods, theory, and normatively biased language,” which “bring into doubt the conclusions drawn by the authors,” the notice stated. The authors disagreed with the decision.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/my-first-politically-motivated-retraction">blog post</a>, one author, Emil Kirkegaard, called the journal’s action “my first politically motivated retraction.” Kirkegaard’s studies and writings are provocative, on topics including race and IQ.</p>



<span id="more-131975"></span>



<p>“I think the journal&#8217;s behavior was fairly typical of academia, and not in a good way,” Kirkegaard told us. “Lots of research shows that politically unfavored research is held to <a href="https://researchers.one/articles/23.08.00002">higher standards</a>,” he wrote in an email. He added he was “surprised they published our study to begin with.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper fell to a practice known as post-publication peer review, which can be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/01/covid-19-vaccine-myocarditis-paper-sage-post-publication-peer-review/">controversial</a>. The apparent necessity of post-publication peer review for some papers raises questions about how well publishers ensure the quality of the initial peer review process and editorial decision-making, and which papers earn the extra scrutiny.</p>



<p>After receiving concerns, the editors of the <em>Scandinavian Journal of Psychology </em>“sought post-publication peer review to gain other expert opinions as they reevaluated the paper,” said a spokesperson for Wiley, the journal’s publisher. “In this case, both of the new peer reviewers validated the initial concerns surrounding the paper&#8217;s methods, theory, and language, and also raised additional questions,” the spokesperson said, leading to the decision to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Kirkegaard “is perhaps best known for his provocative writing on genetics and race,” <a href="https://capd.mit.edu/people/ashley-smart/">Ashley Smart</a> wrote in an <a href="https://undark.org/2025/03/26/unleashed-genetics-intelligence/">article</a> published on <em>Undark </em>the same day as the retraction notice. Among Kirkegaard’s writings, Smart noted, was a blog post asserting “that the hereditarian hypothesis of intelligence — roughly, the idea that races or ancestry groups differ in average intelligence in ways that are substantially attributable to genetics — is ‘almost certainly true.’”</p>



<p>One of Kirkegaard’s <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=VKUbfSIAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">recent papers</a>, “<a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/coso/24/2/article-p272_5.xml">Stereotypes of the Intelligence of Nations</a>,” found Americans’ stereotypes about the intelligence of people from different countries “correlated at .78 with measured national IQ s.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/the-undark-race-science-summary">blog post</a> responding to the <em>Undark </em>article, Kirkegaard called it a “hit piece,” but acknowledged, “Smart did his homework.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after the <em>Scandinavian Journal of Psychology </em>published Kirkegaard’s study on “wokeness” and mental health, Leonid Schneider contacted the journal’s editor in chief and Wiley, he wrote in a blog post on <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/09/13/schneider-shorts-13-09-2024-the-presss-need-to-scandalize/#woke">For Better Science</a>. He noted the retraction in an <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2025/04/04/schneider-shorts-4-04-2025-give-people-the-benefit-of-the-doubt/#nazi">April post</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails Kirkegaard published, the retraction followed an investigation in which two reviewers evaluated the article in light of “concerns raised by third parties.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other author of the retracted article, Edward Dutton, told us the post-publication reviewers were “nominated because they were biased to the far left and would give the desired result.” The issues they raised “were extremely minor and almost inconsequential cavils such as the difference between &#8216;left-wing&#8217; and &#8216;woke&#8217; or between &#8216;religious&#8217; and &#8216;spiritual,&#8217;” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the reviewers “accused us of citing white supremacist literature, when we did no such thing,” Dutton said. “They were simply making up issues to complain about.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson did not directly answer our question about the role a paper&#8217;s topic or public pressure play in commissioning post-publication peer review. The publisher does not track how often such reviews are commissioned, the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to use post-publication peer review “is very case-dependent,” the spokesperson said. The process “can be particularly relevant” when an editor needs “a more specialized subject matter expert” to re-evaluate a paper due to its topic, the spokesperson said, or “when there are concerns about the completeness of the initial peer review, and we need another expert opinion to know whether the paper can stand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The post-publication review did identify a coding problem, which Kirkegaard said “should have been found earlier.” He fixed it, plus another “more important” problem he found upon looking at the dataset again, he said, but “the results didn&#8217;t change much.”</p>



<p>“I think these kinds of errors are fairly common in science coding,” Kirkegaard said. “As you probably know, peer review is generally superficial and even if the code and data is provided, reviewers do not generally download the code and data and run things themselves. This is only done when there is some motivating factor. In this case, political hostility, but in other cases it may be fraud concerns.”</p>



<p>The editors and Wiley invited the authors to revise and resubmit the paper for reconsideration, but Kirkegaard and Dutton said they do not plan to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The paper has been published,” Dutton said, “and any reasonable academic will see that it&#8217;s been retracted for political reasons and will cite it even though it&#8217;s been retracted.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authors of a paper on how motivation influences&nbsp; intelligence test scores have retracted their paper following the retraction of a 50-year-old study included in their analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part meta-analysis and part longitudinal study, “Role of test motivation in intelligence testing” appeared in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </em>in 2011. The meta-analysis portion included a 1978 paper by Stephen Breuning, a child psychologist who was the subject of 1987 report from the National Institute of Mental Health that found he “knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly” engaged in research misconduct and fabricated results in 10 NIMH funded articles.</p>



<p>As we reported earlier this year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/20/stephen-breuning-nimh-misconduct-retraction/">six of Breuning’s papers have been retracted</a>, including one last December. That article, published in 1978 in the<em> Journal of School Psychology</em>, found record albums, sporting event tickets, portable radios, and other incentives boosted scores on IQ tests.</p>



<span id="more-131956"></span>



<p>The 1978 paper wasn’t part of the NIMH investigation, but came about “due to concerns about the integrity of the data reported and other issues identified within the NIMH Final Report that clearly established a pattern of ongoing scientific misconduct,” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022440578900043?via%3Dihub">the retraction notice</a> read.</p>



<p>The authors of the 2011 <em>PNAS </em>study became aware of the retraction in January 2025, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508040122">the retraction notice</a>, which is dated May 1. “Reanalyzing the data without the retracted study … does substantively change the results of the meta-analysis,” the notice, signed by study coauthors <a href="https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/angela-duckworth">Angela Lee Duckworth</a>, <a href="https://publichealth.indiana.edu/about/directory/Patrick-Quinn-quinnp.html">Patrick D. Quinn</a>, and <a href="https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/donald-lynam/">Donald R. Lynam</a>, stated. The effect size was reduced but remained statistically significant.</p>



<p>“However—and most important—while in our 2011 publication, only one of four tests indicated publication bias, there is now strong evidence of publication bias for all four tests,” the authors continued. When adjusting for publication bias, the result was no longer statistically significant, they stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second portion of their paper, the longitudinal study, was not affected. “Although the results of Study 2 are not in need of correction, given the extensive changes to the findings in Study 1, we have decided to retract the article,” the authors stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction follows an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2502439122">expression of concern</a> on the article, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/24/pnas-expression-concern-iq-breuning-duckworth-nimh-misconduct/">we reported in February</a>. The paper has been cited 215 times, four of which were after the expression of concern, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Research psychologist Russell Warne had been studying Breuning’s work, and, as we reported in our earlier story, had reached out to Duckworth and <em>PNAS </em>about the inclusion of Breuning’s data. “A retraction is more than I expected,” Warne told us this week. “I hope that the journal allows them to resubmit a corrected version. The 2011 article was a legitimate investigation into an important scientific question, and I would hate to see Dr. Duckworth&#8217;s research permanently sidelined because she and her coauthors were the victim of scientific fraud.”</p>
