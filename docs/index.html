<p>Longtime Retraction Watch readers know the scientists on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our Leaderboard</a> have changed over the years. But one characteristic has remained relatively constant: There are few women on that list – in fact, never more than one at a time.</p>



<p>So when a recent paper dove into whether retraction rates vary by the gender of the authors, we were curious what the authors found.</p>



<p>The team, from Sorbonne Study Group on Methods of Sociological Analysis (GEMASS) in Paris, sampled 1 million articles from the <a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a> database, then referenced the <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a> to compare against their sample.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131585"></span>



<p>After identifying gender based on the first names of the authors of the articles, the researchers looked at single-author studies by both men and women and teams of researchers of both mixed and single-gender researchers. Regardless of gender, single-author papers were less likely to be retracted than studies with multiple authors. Mixed teams were more likely to have retractions than single-gender teams. Mixed author groups led by women were slightly less likely to face retractions than mixed groups led by men.</p>



<p>We asked the researchers to expand on the methods and results of their study, which <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00353/127805/The-Retraction-Gender-Gap-Are-Mixed-Teams-More">appeared </a>March 6 in <em>Quantitative Science Studies, </em>the journal of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics. The authors, <a href="https://www.gemass.fr/member/maddi-abdelghani/?lang=en">Abdelghani Maddi</a>, <a href="https://umr-lisis.fr/membre/emmanuel-monneau/">Emmanuel Monneau</a>, <a href="https://www.gemass.fr/member/guaspare-cartron-catherine/?lang=en">Catherine Guaspare-Cartron</a>, <a href="https://www.gemass.fr/member/gargiulo-floriana/?lang=en">Floriana Gargiulo</a>, and <a href="https://www.gemass.fr/member/dubois-michel/?lang=en">Michel Dubois</a>, responded collectively via email. The questions and responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What are the main takeaways from the analysis? </strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>GEMASS Researchers:</strong> The study provides a nuanced examination of how gender influences the dynamics of scientific retractions. It highlights that the gender composition of author teams—whether single-authored or collaborative, including mixed-gender groups—can correlate with distinct patterns in article retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analysis suggests that gender might affect both the likelihood of an article being retracted and the underlying processes that lead to such outcomes. This unexpected influence calls into question common assumptions about scientific risk-taking and error correction, indicating that the interplay between individual traits and team dynamics is more complex than previously understood.</p>



<p>Overall, beyond gender-related aspects, our findings highlight several factors that increase the likelihood of retraction:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Publications in Open Access</li>



<li>Publications in high-impact journals</li>



<li>Medium-sized research teams (3 to 10 authors)</li>



<li>Conversely, publications with project-based funding were associated with a reduced probability of retraction</li>



<li>Research in the health and life sciences exhibited higher retraction probability of retraction compared to the social and physical sciences.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What are some of the other takeaways beyond article authorship?</strong></p>



<p><strong>GEMASS Researchers:</strong> The research points toward significant broader implications for the scientific community. Mixed-gender teams, in particular, may benefit from a more balanced approach to oversight and self-correction, potentially mitigating errors and reducing the incidence of retractions. The findings underscore that retraction is not solely a consequence of isolated mistakes or misconduct but is also intertwined with social and cultural dimensions, including potential biases in peer review and the public perception of scientific credibility.</p>



<p>These findings challenge common assumptions about scientific rigor and integrity across genders. The evidence implies that while male-dominated research environments might be more prone to issues related to misconduct, the relatively lower incidence of retractions among women could reflect either a more cautious approach or differences in the opportunities and pressures encountered in their careers. Ultimately, the study calls for a deeper examination of how gender dynamics intersect with research practices and accountability, highlighting the need for nuanced policies that promote both equity and excellence in science.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: You categorized gender by looking at authors’ first names, but were only able to determine gender for 70% of your original sample. Why did you pick this method? What are its shortcomings?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>GEMASS Researchers: </strong>We chose the first-name method because it is the most commonly used approach to infer gender in large datasets, with tools like Genderize.io, Gender API, NamSor, and Wiki-Gendersort. Manual inference would be challenging in our case, given that our sample includes over 2.6 million authors.</p>



<p>However, we recognize the limitations of automated gender detection methods, particularly in terms of accuracy. To mitigate this, we applied a validation process, both technical and functional, to ensure that the observed global patterns in our data aligned with findings from existing literature.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: While single-author studies are less likely to be retracted than multiple author studies, your study found the risk stops increasing, or even decreases, when a study has more than 10 researchers. How do you interpret this threshold?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>GEMASS Researchers: </strong>While this result may seem counterintuitive, it aligns with prior research. Specifically, <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/176716/">Rathmann and Rauhut (2019)</a> suggested that larger research groups may benefit from enhanced social control and oversight. Similarly, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04125-4">Sharma (2021)</a> observed that smaller teams tend to be more vulnerable to retractions, underscoring the importance of team size in maintaining research integrity.</p>



<p>Our findings introduce additional nuance: medium-sized teams– which we define as three&nbsp; to 10 authors–are at higher risk of retraction compared to larger teams. This suggests that while collaboration can mitigate misconduct risks, medium-sized teams may face challenges related to unclear roles and responsibilities, potentially increasing oversight gaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: How do you interpret the result that mixed collaborations led by women are less likely to be retracted than mixed collaborations led by men?</strong></p>



<p><strong>GEMASS Researchers: </strong>Both the odds ratios and the crude ratios indicate that mixed-gender publications with a male first author have a higher likelihood of retraction compared to those led by a female first author. This difference remains statistically significant in our regression analysis, with odds ratios of 2.27 versus 1.65, even after controlling for other variables.</p>



<p>Without qualitative data, we can only hypothesize. One potential explanation, suggested by existing literature, is that gender-based social norms may influence both behavior and how misconduct is judged. Women, for example, may be less frequently less exposed to retraction due to tendencies to adopt more cautious, apologetic behavior, while men may engage in riskier behaviors. It is possible that women commit misconduct at similar rates <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00156-13">but are less often detected or sanctioned</a>. It is also possible that women exercise their responsibilities as first author differently from men.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Why do you think studies led by men are more likely to be retracted for misconduct, while studies led by women are more likely to be retracted for errors or disguised text plagiarism?</strong></p>



<p><strong>GEMASS Researchers: </strong>While male- and female-led publications share certain breaches of integrity, such as plagiarism, fabrication, image or text manipulation, the retraction profile of male-led publications is over-represented in characterized departures from integrity, i.e., misconduct, and breaches of ethics, such as lack of ethical authorization, whereas the retraction profile of female-led publications is over-represented in errors. Beyond this observation, our study, based on two databases, does not go any further in understanding these disparities. It would be necessary to add a qualitative approach to explore correction practices in greater detail.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Are there sufficient studies with non-binary authors to be included in this kind of analysis?</strong></p>



<p><strong>GEMASS Researchers: </strong>The practice of scientific signatures remains to our knowledge indifferent to the question of gender. When we sign an article, we are not supposed to declare ourselves as “male” or “female”. However, it is possible to identify the relative share of men and women by analyzing first names, often in conjunction with country-specific conventions – e.g., recognizing that “Andrea” is typically a woman’s name in the United States but a man’s name in Italy. In this study, we used the Genderize.io algorithm to infer the gender of the authors. Current bibliometric datasets lack metadata on non-binary authorship, which makes this analysis impossible. To our knowledge, no studies, on this topic, have yet integrated this dimension.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Do you believe journals should ask researchers for their gender or pronouns before publishing?</strong></p>



<p>Collecting this information could indeed improve the depth and accuracy of gender-based analyses. If journals were able to collect this type of data by giving researchers the opportunity to declare their gender, they would enable researchers to improve the accuracy of detection, given that automated tools fail to classify around 30% of cases due to the presence of initials only or unisex first names. This would also enable us to broaden research questions surrounding gender disparities in research collaborations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Many neuroscientists use calcium imaging to record the activity from neurons (or other cells in the brain). The video below was recorded by Sian Duss and me in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in mice.</p>

<p>To make calcium imaging traces comparable across cells and recordings, most researchers use a method called ΔF/F (&#8220;delta F over F&#8221;) to normalize the fluorescence traces. However, there are different ways to compute ΔF/F, and it is not always obvious how to choose the best method and how to interpret the result.</p>



<p>In a guest blog post for the <a href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/resources">Scientifica Resource Center</a>, I summarized key suggestions and guidelines on how to compute ΔF/F and how to interpret the results, in particular for GCaMP calcium indicators: <a href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/learning-zone/how-to-compute-%CE%B4f-f-from-calcium-imaging-data">How to compute ΔF/F from calcium imaging data</a>.</p>



<p>Let me know if you have any feedback on my suggestions and guidelines!</p>

<p>On March 7, a Sage journal published an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241239903">expression of concern</a> for an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241226566">article</a> on cases of myocarditis in people who had received a COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Editor and the publisher were alerted to potential issues with the research methodology and conclusions and author conflicts of interest” and had undertaken an investigation of the article, the notice stated. According to one of the authors, the investigation involved two new peer reviews of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve reported on many cases of authors disagreeing with retractions other publishers issued after conducting post-publication review processes. The papers often involve hot-button issues – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/14/journal-pulls-pesticide-article-a-year-after-authors-engaged-lawyer-to-fight-retraction-decision/">pesticide poisoning</a>, the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/04/authors-file-complaint-with-publisher-as-journal-retracts-vaping-paper/">effect of vaping on smoking rates</a>, an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/01/how-an-article-estimating-deaths-from-hydroxychloroquine-use-came-to-be-retracted/">estimation of deaths from the use of hydroxychloroquine</a> early in the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/17/reddit-post-prompts-retraction-of-article-that-called-trump-the-main-driver-of-vaccine-misinformation-on-twitter/">President Trump’s role in spreading vaccine misinformation</a> on Twitter before the company suspended his account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131570"></span>



<p>The apparent necessity of post-publication peer review for some papers raises questions about how well publishers ensure the quality of the peer review process and editorial decision making, and how the companies respond to scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a world awash with flawed papers, which ones earn a post-publication review from a publisher? A spokesperson for Sage said a paper’s topic does not play a role in the decision to commission a post-publication review, but a sleuth argues it should.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The COVID-19 vaccine myocarditis article appeared in Sage’s <em>Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety</em> on January 27, 2024. It has been cited seven times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. In 2021, an earlier version of the article had been published briefly in an Elsevier journal, then <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/25/covid-19-vaccine-myocarditis-paper-to-be-permanently-removed-elsevier/">removed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://jessicar.substack.com/p/breaking-the-drama-is-not-over-for">blog post</a> from Jessica Rose, one of the authors of the paper, the two individuals who reviewed the published paper requested dozens of corrections. That appears to contrast with the two original reviewers, who “provided a single sentence review with no substance,” a Sage spokesperson told us. In her blog post, Rose said she and her coauthors had revised the paper “as per the reviewers’ helpful comments and suggestions” before it was published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not how the peer-review process works, at least, it never has been in the past,” Rose wrote in her post. “You cannot re-review an already accepted and published paper based on post-publication ‘complaints/whining/musings’ and expect the authors to re-write it to this degree (52 detailed points?!) after a year has passed.”</p>



<p>If the article had so many problems, they should have been addressed in the original peer review process, not a year after publication, Rose wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rose attributed <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C9EC1C8336F615B6BCA5C724932682">criticism</a> of her paper to “trolls,” and wondered “if this is an attempt to purge the paper once again from the eyes of the public.” </p>



<p>In a follow-up email, Rose told us whether they make the requested changes to the article is &#8220;up to the corresponding author,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I personally do not plan to. It already went through peer review.&#8221;</p>



<p>An internal managing editor “now assists in ensuring high standards of peer review are met” at the journal that published Rose’s paper, a Sage spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As scholarly processes aren’t perfect, like all publishers, we must continually refine our practices to make meaningful, long-term improvements,” the spokesperson said. “This means learning from cases like these and making process changes in response, giving guidance to editors while respecting editorial independence, and taking corrective action when necessary to preserve the integrity of the scientific record.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Other researchers have accused Sage of conducting post-publication peer reviews with a foregone conclusion: retracting their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last October, the authors of three papers about abortion that Sage <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/06/papers-used-by-judge-to-justify-abortion-pill-suspension-retracted/">retracted</a> after conducting post-publication peer review <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/04/authors-sue-sage-over-discriminatory-retractions-of-papers-cited-in-abortion-pill-case/">sued the publisher</a>, alleging the retractions were “discriminatory.” A federal judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-publisher-retracts-studies-cited-by-texas-judge-suspending-abortion-pills-2024-02-06/">cited two of the articles</a> in his 2023 decision to suspend approval of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation#:~:text=Mifepristone%20is%20a%20drug%20that,of%20the%20last%20menstrual%20period).">mifepristone</a>, a drug used in medical abortions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors sought to compel Sage to enter arbitration with them, and <a href="https://lozierinstitute.org/charlotte-lozier-institute-scholars-begin-arbitration-to-defend-science-against-publisher-retractions/">appear to have prevailed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their <a href="https://assaultonscience.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/2025.02.21-SvS-Arbitration-Demand_Redacted.pdf?__hstc=85124486.429de3af8435f67c7f605937018b7b53.1742913001887.1742913001887.1742999568665.2&amp;__hssc=85124486.1.1742999568665&amp;__hsfp=3604940382">demand for arbitration</a>, lawyers for the authors allege the post-publication review was “improper, unscientific, and performed with the express purpose of justifying retraction.” (The demand also refers to the lead author’s entries in The Retraction Watch Database, claiming other editors will find those and not want to publish his submissions.) The publishing agreement the authors signed with Sage did not authorize such a review, and Sage did not give the authors an opportunity to read and respond to the reviewers’ full comments before deciding to retract the articles, the authors allege.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage wanted to retract the articles because the publisher “did not want to provide a platform for researchers whom it perceived to be pro-life or advancing pro-life views or causes,” the authors allege. Sage “applied inconsistent retraction standards” to their work based on the publisher’s perception of them as pro-life, the authors argue, in violation of California’s anti-discrimination law.</p>



<p>In light of these recent, high-profile cases, we asked Sage a few questions about how the publisher handles post-publication peer review — not just an internal evaluation of concerns raised, but with additional reviewers recruited to assess an article in its entirety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage undertakes such reviews “when substantial concerns about the quality of an article are brought to our attention, the original review process did not meet our standards as outlined by the Committee on Publication Ethics, and if there are no concerns regarding fabrication of identities or indicators of paper mill activity,” a Sage spokesperson who declined to be named told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on those criteria for initiating a review, the number of papers to get such treatment varies each year, according to the spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage asks reviewers “to consider whether the methodology is appropriate, if the study is grounded in the literature, and if the conclusions are supported by the results,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The topics a paper addresses do not play a role in deciding to initiate a review, the spokesperson said. When we asked for an example of non-controversial papers that have received post-publication peer review, the spokesperson sent us a November 2023 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00207209231197937">retraction notice</a> for 90 papers from the <em>International Journal of Electrical Engineering &amp; Education</em>. The original peer review process for the articles did not meet Sage’s standards, according to the notice, and post-publication peer review “highlighted fundamental concerns within the articles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The volume of papers retracted from a single journal, plus the language of the notice, suggest paper mill activity, which would indicate a completely different category of apparently substandard peer review than the other recent cases. However, the Sage spokesperson said the publisher identified “a range of issues” in papers from the journal and re-reviewed those “with quality and peer review concerns that did not display indicators of paper mill activity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Heathers, a scientific sleuth, argues that a paper’s topic should play a role in the decision to conduct a post-publication review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The societal and scientific implications of any given paper vary wildly from &#8216;of absolutely no consequence whatsoever&#8217; to &#8216;an active threat to human life,&#8217;” he said. “Anyone treating both of those the same is waiving necessary editorial discretion and wasting resources!”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iwj.v22.4.cover_.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="595" height="782" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iwj.v22.4.cover_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131568" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iwj.v22.4.cover_.jpg 595w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iwj.v22.4.cover_-228x300.jpg 228w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>The <em>International Wound Journal </em>has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?field1=Title&amp;text1=Retraction&amp;publication%5B%5D=1742481x&amp;publication=&amp;Ppub=&amp;AfterMonth=1&amp;AfterYear=2025&amp;BeforeMonth=4&amp;BeforeYear=2025&amp;content=articlesChapters&amp;field1=Title&amp;target=default&amp;text1=Retraction">retracted 242 papers so far this year</a> as part of an ongoing investigation into manipulated peer review.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/03/wiley-medical-journal-retracts-dozens-of-paper-for-manipulated-peer-review-with-more-to-come/">reported in December</a> the journal, a Wiley title, had retracted 27 papers as part of an investigation. A Wiley spokesperson told us the 2025 retractions are part of the same ongoing investigation, and that the editors “anticipate additional retractions in the weeks to come.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the retraction notices list manipulated peer review and share similar text, like the notice from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70380">this retraction</a> of a 2023 paper:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131565"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following an investigation by the publisher, all parties have concluded that this article was accepted solely on the basis of a compromised peer review process. The editors have therefore decided to retract the article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nearly 80 percent of the notices stated the authors did not respond to the notice regarding retraction, with 15 percent of authors disagreeing with the retraction.</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us for our last story the investigation started internally, but several of the retraction notices cited a “third party,” stating “It came to the publisher’s attention from a third party that a number of articles shared concerning similarities in format and structure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least 21 of the 2025 retractions <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70246">also credit</a> a “third party” that found “evidence of excessive self-citations” in the articles’ references. The Wiley spokesperson didn’t respond to our request for more information about who the third party might refer to.</p>



<p>The journal became open access in 2021. In a 2023 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14380">editorial</a> marking the journal’s 20th birthday, editors noted “submission volumes have increased exponentially.” The papers retracted to date were all published from 2022 to 2024.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70010?af=R">August 2024 notice</a> announcing the expansion of the journal’s editorial board, the editors noted the increase in submissions was due, in part, to papermill activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/19/environmental-toxicology-wiley-journal-retractions-compromised-peer-review/">Earlier this year</a>, Wiley retracted 26 papers from a different journal, <em>Environmental Toxicology</em>, for compromised peer review as part of an ongoing investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley has had a lot of experience with mass retractions for peer review issues in recent years. After buying Hindawi in 2021, Wiley has been attempting to clean up journals it acquired. (Neither<em> International Wound Journal </em>nor <em>Environmental Toxicology</em> are former Hindawi titles.) In 2023, Hindawi <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">announced</a> it would be retracting 8,000 articles for paper mill activity. Wiley has retracted over 11,000 papers from former Hindawi journals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A former cancer specialist sanctioned for “recklessly falsifying data” admitted during an investigation interview that he periodically altered images, documents obtained by Retraction Watch show. He also stated “he may have inadequately or improperly labeled and organized” image files, increasing the chances the images were confused or misidentified.</p>



<p>Alan Lichtenstein, previously a staff physician at the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and faculty member at UCLA, engaged in research misconduct, according to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/18/2024-26756/findings-of-research-misconduct-c">a November 2024 notice</a> in the Federal Register. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UCLA-Records-24-4517-Lichtenstein-memos-only.pdf">Documents we obtained</a> through a public records request revealed his admissions, made during an inquiry that preceded the misconduct ruling.</p>



<p>The documents also reveal a relatively swift process: The initial inquiry by a joint UCLA-VA GLA committee took from June to August 2023 to determine a full investigation should follow. The investigation committee, formally tasked in October of that year, finished its assessment in March 2024. The inquiry committee looked at 18 allegations across 12 papers, and the investigation considered 31 allegations in 13 papers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131539"></span>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/19/cancer-specialist-faked-data-in-at-least-ten-papers-va-and-ucla-find/">As we reported at the time</a>, the investigation focused on about a dozen papers with evidence of image similarities. Three of those papers had been retracted when the Federal Register notice was published.</p>



<p>A fourth paper has now joined that list: <em>Blood</em>, the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology,<em> </em>retracted the 2003 article, “<a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/101/8/3126/16683/RETRACTED-Downstream-effectors-of-oncogenic-ras-in">Downstream effectors of oncogenic ras in multiple myeloma cells</a>.” The retraction notice published March 12 states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An institutional investigation found falsified data in Figures 2, 3, and 4. Images in these figures include reused panels that create false representations. The Editors concur with these findings.</p>



<p>Jung-hsin Hsu, Joseph Gera, and Brian Van Ness approve the retraction. No response was received from Liping Hu, Yijiang Shi, or Alan Lichtenstein.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article has been cited 116 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The director of the VA GLA initiated a misconduct inquiry on June 23, 2023, after the research integrity officer at the institution received 10 emails in April of that year from an anonymous source, according to the documents we obtained. As we reported in November, that source was scientific sleuth Kevin Patrick, who also had called the papers out on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The committee interviewed Lichtenstein on Aug. 10, 2023, as part of that initial inquiry. By that point he had retired from UCLA and VA GLA. A memo from the research misconduct inquiry committee to the VA director, dated Aug. 18, 2023, summarized the interview. </p>



<p>The inquiry report said Lichtenstein told interviewers all original data and lab books were discarded when he closed his lab when he retired. The report stated the researcher told interviewers he “had no knowledge of the present whereabouts of any of the gel images or other original data.”</p>



<p>The documents note that, as part of the investigation, the VA research integrity officer searched Lichtenstein’s network drives but “was unable to identify any files that were material to the investigation.”</p>



<p>Lichtenstein told interviewers the first author of the publications “was always the person who cast and ran the gels in the laboratory,” according to the inquiry report. Lab staff would email the original images to Lichtenstein as a PowerPoint file, which he would save “according to the protein probe used and were formatted and arranged into the figures that were eventually published.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The later investigation report stated those images were formatted and arranged “exclusively” by Lichtenstein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The interview summary in the inquiry report stated Lichtenstein admitted to altering images, and that poor labeling could have led to wrong files getting used:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Respondent admitted to altering the contrast, brightness, and aspect ratio of the images at times, claiming that he did not know this was inappropriate. He admitted that since many of the files may have been inadequately or improperly labeled, there is a chance that some of the files may have been confused or misidentified, with consequent multiple use and mislabeling.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
