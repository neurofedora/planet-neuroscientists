<p>A journal has finally issued a correction following a seven-year-old exchange on PubPeer in which the authors promised to fix issues “as soon as possible.” But after following up with the authors and the journal, it’s still not clear where the delay occurred.</p>



<p><em>Neuron </em>published the paper, “<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(11)00884-1">Common DISC1 Polymorphisms Disrupt Wnt/GSK3β Signaling and Brain Development</a>,” in 2011. It has been cited 101 times, 28 of which came after concerns were first raised, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It first appeared on PubPeer in April 2018, when commenter Epipactis voethii first pointed out figures 2 and 3 of the paper had potential image duplication.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131907"></span>



<p>Shortly after, <a href="https://picower.mit.edu/faculty/li-huei-tsai">Li-Huei Tsai</a>,&nbsp; the co-corresponding author and the director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, responded on PubPeer saying the authors were “currently working with the journal to resolve this issue.”</p>



<p>That same month, PubPeer commenters debated the merits of the image similarity accusations, and some raised concerns about the statistical analyses, questioning the tests used and validity of p values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors were silent until earlier this year, when PubPeer commenter Actinopolyspora biskrensis reignited the discussion with more possible instances of image overlap in the article. In April, Tsai commented yet again that the authors “have found the original data and are working with the Journal to correct the errors.” She did not respond to Actinopolyspora’s request for original images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tsai forwarded our request for comment — including our request for clarification on why the correction took as long as it did — to a communications director for the Picower Institute, who sent us the text from the <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00304-6">May 2025 correction notice</a>. The notice says the “duplication errors” in six figures were “mistakenly,” “erroneously” or “incorrectly” in the paper. The authors said they “mixed up” images and made several cropping errors, but said the errors were made post-analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Queen Muse, the head of media for Cell Press, which publishes <em>Neuron</em>, told us the journal has “no comment beyond what&#8217;s included in the published correction notice, which outlines the relevant details.”</p>

                Dementia has been the leading cause of death for UK women for over a decade. But the story doesn’t end there - women face greater risk, faster decline, heavier caregiving loads, and less representation in research. Why is dementia hitting women hardest?

<p>Unverifiable researchers are a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/09/20-ways-to-spot-the-work-of-paper-mills/">harbinger of paper mill activity</a>. While journals have clues to identifying fake personas — lack of professional affiliation, no profile on ORCID or strings of random numbers in email addresses, to name a few — there isn’t a standard template for doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The International Association of Scientific, Technical, &amp; Medical Publishers (STM) has taken a stab at developing a framework for journals and institutions to validate researcher identity, with its <a href="https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/stm.offloadmedia/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/13110718/Report2-v1-final-2.pdf">Research Identity Verification Framework</a>, released in March. The proposal suggests identifying “good” and “bad” actors based on what validated information they can provide, using passport validation when all else fails, and creating a common language in publishing circles to address authorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how this will be implemented and standardized remains to be seen. We spoke with <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/people/hylke-koers/">Hylke Koers</a>, the chief information officer for STM and one of the architects of the proposal. The questions and answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<span id="more-131899"></span>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: How do the proposals in STM’s framework differ from other identity verification efforts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers: </strong>Other verification efforts in the academic world tend to focus on the integrity and authenticity of the material, such as the text or images, submitted by researchers. While still important, the growing sophistication of generative AI tools makes this increasingly challenging, calling for the development of new and additional measures tied more directly to the person responsible for the production of the submitted material.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: How will the identity verification system prevent or combat certain kinds of fraud, such as with peer reviewers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers</strong>: For publishers that choose to implement the framework, here is how it would work: Any user interacting with the publisher&#8217;s editorial system would be prompted to complete a verification process to provide evidence of their identity. That process would be tailored and proportionate to the user&#8217;s role: author, peer reviewer, editor, guest editor, and so on.</p>



<p>Such a process makes impersonation or identity theft much more difficult. A concrete example of the kind of identity manipulation that this type of verification could prevent is an author suggesting a peer-reviewer by providing an email address that looks like a well-respected, independent researcher but is, in fact, controlled by the author themselves.</p>



<p>In addition to strengthening defenses to prevent research integrity breaches, the proposed framework could deter individuals from acting fraudulently. And, if they still do so, it improves accountability: having information about someone’s identity beyond an opaque email address makes it easier to identify and hold them accountable for their actions.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What steps would a journal take to verify an author, reviewer or editor’s identity?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers: </strong>The framework we are putting forward recommends offering a range of options to researchers, rather than insisting on any single method. If a user doesn&#8217;t have access to one method, for any reason, they&#8217;d be able to use another, or a combination thereof. Recommended options would include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Asking researchers to validate a recognized institutional email address, or to log in through their institution&#8217;s identity management system, similar to accessing subscription-based content through federated access and services like <a href="https://www.shibboleth.net/">Shibboleth</a> or <a href="https://seamlessaccess.org/">SeamlessAccess</a>.</li>



<li>Another would be to have users sign in with ORCID, and use so-called &#8220;Trust Markers&#8221; stored on their ORCID record. Unlike information researchers can add themselves to their ORCID profile, Trust Markers are claims that have been added to an ORCID profile, with the user’s consent, by institutions, funders, publishers and other trusted organizations.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Official government documents like passports and driver’s licences could be another option. While these don&#8217;t offer evidence of academic credibility, they provide stronger verification of individual identity — and a route to accountability — as they do when using many other online services.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Where none of these options is possible, the editorial system could fall back to manual checks, some of which are also being used today. Examples include direct contact with individuals or asking colleagues to vouch for them.</li>
</ul>



<p>Researchers could continue to use an opaque email address, such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, Erols, etc. but such an email address alone would not be enough to verify their identity.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: As for manual checks, are any publishers now doing this?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> Yes. Some of the members of the group who developed this framework have staff that work directly in this way, manually reviewing&nbsp; researchers by exploring their backgrounds, contacting them and their institutions to verify their identities. They are effectively carrying out these checks, but such a manual approach is of course time-consuming and has limited scale.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Can you define what “level of trust” means in this context? And if journals can decide what that level is, won’t it be difficult to introduce a standard?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> “Trust level” is essentially a shorthand for “how confident can we be that this person is who they claim to be, and that the information they’ve provided is genuine?” It reflects the assurance that an editorial system can have that a contributor is not acting fraudulently. One practical measure of that confidence might be “do we know how to hold this person accountable if needed?”</p>



<p>The appropriate level of required trust is, at its core, a risk assessment that depends on the specific context of the journal, making this a judgment call that publishers or editorial systems will need to make individually. The long-term goal is to create the conditions under which meaningful consensus can emerge.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: How realistic is it that researchers are going to provide publishers with pictures of their passports or other government documents?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> This challenge isn’t unique to academic publishing. Many other domains — financial services, social platforms, even dating apps — have needed to verify identities without directly handling sensitive documents themselves. The common solution is to use specialist third-party services that perform identity checks independently, and then return a confirmation of trust to the relying party, without exposing the underlying documents.</p>



<p>We expect that researchers would be reluctant to provide such information directly to publishers or editorial systems and, vice versa, those organisations may not want to take on the burden of managing sensitive personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The framework that we are putting forward supports such federated models, where identity assurance can be handled once by a trusted third-party provider, and then re-used across multiple platforms in a standardised, privacy-preserving way.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Paper mills have created elaborate networks of fake and compromised peer reviewers. Will the ideas put forth in this framework actually do any good against them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> This is one of the most important questions we’re looking to answer. Paper mills have found it easy to exploit the current model of weak identity verification, for example by using untraceable email addresses to impersonate legitimate researchers, and using these to manipulate peer review processes. This is where we believe that the proportionate and carefully designed addition of verification could have an effect.</p>



<p>No framework can completely eliminate fraud — particularly if bad actors gain access to legitimate user accounts or infiltrate institutions or publication systems themselves — but by raising the cost of fraud, reducing opportunities for undetected manipulation, and making accountability more feasible, we think the situation can be improved.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Aries and ScholarOne had previously</strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/515480a"><strong> claimed to have fixed</strong></a><strong> this vulnerability. Are you saying it didn’t work? Why is this still happening?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> We’re not in a position to comment on specific examples, but — as the article that you mention here explains very well — narrow technical patches alone don’t eliminate the underlying problem. The fundamental point here is to do with system design, not just the implementation details.</p>



<p>Rather than closing individual security loopholes (such as insecure password-handling) or relying on individual editorial staff to be on the alert for “red flags,” we advocate for a shift to viewing identity and trust in a coherent and systematic way — which is what the verification framework tries to offer. While non-institutional email addresses are perfectly fine for communication, they cannot be used to make trust decisions.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What is the evidence that this framework could deter individuals from acting fraudulently?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> While the proposed framework is still in development and therefore doesn’t yet have direct empirical evidence of impact, it draws on principles from other domains where identity assurance is used to deter misconduct. A key priority for us now is to gather evidence to support or reject these ideas.</p>



<p>What we do know is that some of the major integrity breaches that have occurred in recent years involve paper mills exploiting systems where identities were poorly verified and accountability was weak. Logically, fraud is easier in these conditions. Introducing basic forms of identity assurance &#8211; such as verified ORCID profiles, institutional affiliations confirmed by a trusted party, or known identity providers &#8211; addresses some of the known gaps and reduces the ease of operating under false or misleading identities.</p>



<p>Ultimately, no system can eliminate fraud entirely. We believe that this framework will make it harder to act fraudulently, will make it harder to do so without being noticed, and will make it easier to trace and respond when breaches occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: The framework mentions using ORCID as part of the verification process. As of 2020, only</strong><a href="https://info.orcid.org/the-value-of-orcid-ids-in-enabling-digital-identity-on-a-global-scale-report-from-the-oecd/"><strong> about half</strong></a><strong> of researchers were using ORCID. And even fewer —</strong><a href="https://info.orcid.org/trust-markers-in-orcid-records-verified-email-domains/"><strong> less than 20%</strong></a><strong> — use Trust Markers. How will this work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> One of our key recommendations is to increase the addition of Trust Markers into ORCID records by publishers, institutions and funders, and thereby to make them more useful as sources of verified claims. Use of ORCID in general, and Trust Markers more specifically, is growing rapidly, and as their use becomes more effective, it’s possible that this growth will accelerate.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Do the verification methods, especially verification by institutional email, exclude independent researchers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> No. The report is clear in recognizing that legitimate researchers must never be excluded from participation in the editorial process (be it as author, reviewer, or editor). Alternative pathways should always exist to accommodate users who lack access to the specifically defined methods of verification.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Researchers might be hesitant to show things like their passports or may not have access to identification methods like this. What are the alternative pathways?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> This is exactly why we are not proposing a single solution but rather a framework that explicitly acknowledges this and recommends a mixture of verification methods, calibrated by risk, and appropriate to different roles in the publishing process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal is not to enforce a narrow set of ID methods, but to ensure that any method used is transparent, auditable, and proportionate to the role and associated risk. For low-risk activities self-assertion may still be acceptable. For higher-risk roles (e.g. acting as an editor or peer reviewer), stronger assurances may be justified, but those assurances don’t necessarily need to come from a passport scan.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the framework aims to enable inclusion with accountability, not to gatekeep based on institutional privilege. Ongoing work will include testing these alternative pathways and ensuring they are accessible, fair and practical.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: To push back on this, from the point of view of an unaffiliated researcher, this could be viewed as making their lives more difficult. If the process takes longer to verify unaffiliated researchers, the actual publication could be held up. And this extra step might discourage individual researchers from pursuing publications.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> That’s a very fair concern &#8211; and exactly the kind of issue the framework is meant to surface and address early, not accidentally entrench.</p>



<p>Indeed, if we’re not careful, the introduction of verification steps &#8211; however well-intentioned &#8211; could introduce new forms of friction, particularly for some groups like unaffiliated researchers. That’s precisely why we’ve recommended a framework rather than a fixed mechanism: so that identity verification can be implemented proportionately, with multiple equivalent routes, and designed to avoid discrimination or delay.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: The framework offers a lot of guidelines but lacks an implementation strategy. How will this system create uniformity that’s helpful for both journals and researchers?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hylke Koers:</strong> That’s deliberate. The goal isn’t to mandate a one-size-fits-all model, but to provide a shared structure that supports flexibility while enabling interoperability. As mentioned before, it is up to publishers and editorial systems to assess risk levels for their specific contexts and determine which specific verification mechanisms are an appropriate way to address that risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key idea is that even partial or selective adoption — as long as it uses the common language and trust concepts defined in the framework — can still improve consistency across the system. For example, if different journals begin to signal what level of trust they require using shared terminology, and trusted identity providers begin to indicate the level of verification they offer (ideally in a machine-readable way), then those elements can start to align, even if different journals implement different policies.</p>



<p>That said, we do intend to work with early adopters — journals, platforms, and identity providers — to test and refine our assumptions and offer recommendations for practical integration patterns. Over time, we anticipate that these implementation pathways will be made clearer and easier to adopt, and provide an evidence-base for further iterations.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: We asked Elsevier to respond to some of the findings in this post. In response, a spokesperson told us they will now remove the journal from Scopus. See Elsevier’s response <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?p=131884">in this story</a>.</em></p>



<p>I received a letter recently pointing me to a questionable journal indexed in Elsevier’s Scopus database. Scopus indexes many problematic and even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/18/journal-hijackers-still-infiltrate-scopus-despite-its-efforts/">hijacked</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/07/the-whack-a-mole-problem-hijacked-journal-still-being-indexed-in-scopus-even-after-discovery/">journals</a>, but this case is the most outrageous I have seen to date.</p>



<p>Scopus indexed <a href="https://legal-science.com/index.php/SoL"><em>Science of Law</em></a> in July 2024. According to its profile in the database, the journal is published by the “Editorial Team of SoL.”  However, “the editorial team” and many <a href="https://legal-science.com/index.php/SoL/about/editorialTeam">members of the editorial board</a> are fake names and that such individuals do not actually exist. For example, the three editors listed — Alessio Miceli from the University of Alabama School of Law, Anita Steinberg from Wichita State University, and Jeffrey Robinson from McGeorge School of Law — do not have author profiles in Scopus. The universities themselves do not have anyone with these names in their directories. </p>



<span id="more-131886"></span>



<p>The 60-plus members of the editorial<strong> </strong>board are<strong> </strong>also most likely fake. Jakub Muchlinski, Sofia Vermeulen and Caspian Magliveras can’t be found in Scopus because such an author probably doesn’t exist.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeZ3lJe7bVP5xnmPSusYIGk9uuPQ_VVGlpUzBobYetisrJ9uNeds2neX3ZKHxt0VGQb6cU1P5JR8zyVjAIgb_MVsKTpEDb5AEgOhdTbkTXFvS58NMgKnJFcE7WMEXvB2nxehrAl?key=7pr2Tp7HJ9PAg9WTR-5cdA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Screenshot of the journal’s profile in Scopus</figcaption></figure>



<p>In reality this journal’s publisher is <a href="https://onlinesciencepublishing.com/">Online Science Publishing</a>, which publishes 12 more journals, all of which can be identified in Crossref.<em> Science of </em>Law<em> </em>charges a publication fee of $780 USD.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdje56Wud0pTG1vC51Gxpnkis8HSA9sVrgU7uvuOUivi5mAH9J1fyh7-u2UrYemzpNAy4TxqSAsSBOt4x9Msii5bLbQrQqYXUGum65QXr8wz8JWqPkUMcOKv2ks1xR8CYPYsYSXKw?key=7pr2Tp7HJ9PAg9WTR-5cdA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Screenshot of journals published by Online Science Publishing, according to Crossref.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another red flag for the journal is the anonymous registration of the website domain legal-science.com in December 2023 with GoDaddy. Anonymous registration is a common practice among fraudulent journals.</p>



<p>The timeline raises further concerns. How could a journal with a domain registered in December 2023 be indexed in Scopus in July 2024, when Scopus requires at least two years of regular publication for newly launched journals before indexation? (They did remove that <a href="https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-content-policy-and-selection-changes?utm_source=chatgpt.com">rule</a> in August 2024, after this journal was indexed.)&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdEd9nZLfYtt_fHeo3vX4tGy_Z5oHNoIzK6_-BW54rCcXHtGj6jBOe2X62TKluaYshuLbkQ9akji57j3LRtz2eUbRExWgvzw_tMtnS8Gd8PHWmBrfzPZIsu57CSUSVU8npBLkpF0w?key=7pr2Tp7HJ9PAg9WTR-5cdA" alt="" style="width:300px"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Screenshot of the web domain registration details</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The likely answer: The journal backdated the archive and filled it with papers that are probably fabricated and “authored” by nonexistent researchers for issues starting in 2021 through the second issue of 2024 to demonstrate its continuous and regular publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that is hard to verify because the full text of articles is not freely accessible, which is very typical for problematic journals. For example, hijacked journals also have a fake archive that you can access only with a “subscription.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the papers from these issues are currently indexed in Scopus. And, according to the database, some of these papers cite others in the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe0jVSFYO2f6X4oZV_-GKntdgR0AhSdXy7AXilUOMbGhvB0TuvVlOAvNvhu8VXgMnSFSvSJ-zPvgG-WE1DK12rDw_IfCWCjs0JXgywCRoD8SYKY6xOv_jNjsx2UOqzeug5lbUYk?key=7pr2Tp7HJ9PAg9WTR-5cdA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Louis Vieillard can’t be traced at Paris Dauphine University. There are no other papers written by a Louis Vieillard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the papers published before Scopus indexed the journal are likely fake, the third issue of 2024 most likely consists of real submissions. However, many published papers also have red flags. For example, there are collaboration anomalies, such as multiple affiliations per paper, a sign of paper mill production.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This case is shocking. It demonstrates that Scopus,<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus"> “the world&#8217;s largest, comprehensive and trusted academic database</a>,” can’t be trusted due to vulnerabilities in the evaluation processes and a lack of ability to identify fraudulent publishers. This is a very evident case of a fake journal that should have been immediately rejected during the evaluation process. This case demonstrates the failure of evaluation by the Content Selection and Advisory Board and content control in Scopus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also shows that fraudsters now don’t need to buy a journal indexed in Scopus to publish problematic papers, as happened with many journals like <em>Migration Letters</em> and <em>Journal of Namibian Studies</em>. It is enough to create a fake journal with a fake editorial board and a fake archive to be indexed in one of the leading databases.</p>



<p>The experience of recent years shows that fraudulent publishing has increased, together with paper mills and fake, predatory or hijacked journals. Such bad practices are legitimized by indexing databases, and the lack of quality integrity control will lead to a decrease in trust in data quality.</p>



<p>To respond to the threats of fraudulent publishers, the databases collecting the scientific record must have an in-house research integrity board to identify bad actors. It should include research integrity experts who would proactively identify patterns of problematic journals, fraudulent publishers that hunt for journals indexed in bibliographic databases, hijacked and predatory journals. Without that, it only incentivizes fraudulent activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsevier has removed a journal from its Scopus database after Retraction Watch inquired about its review process for the journal, whose editorial board lists fake names and digital fingerprint shows other red flags.</p>



<p>Scientific sleuth Anna Abalkina uncovered several issues with <a href="https://legal-science.com/index.php/SoL/index"><em>Science of Law</em></a>, which she details <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?p=131886">in a post published today</a>. Besides editors and editorial board members who cannot be verified and don’t seem to exist, the journal’s history doesn’t match its publication record, early articles show signs of fabrication, and its publisher data in Scopus doesn’t match that in Crossref. Despite this, Scopus added the journal to its index last year. </p>



<p>To understand how these problems could have evaded reviewers at Scopus, we asked Elsevier if Scopus staff verifies editorial board members when vetting journals, and if they assess the quality and validity of articles in journals before adding them to the index.</p>



<span id="more-131884"></span>



<p>A statement from an unnamed Elsevier spokesperson indicated that as a result of our inquiry, the company will remove the journal from the database. That statement reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for raising these serious concerns regarding the current content of Science of Law, which we share.</p>



<p>Science of Law was accepted for inclusion in July 2024, following Scopus’ rigorous <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/content/content-policy-and-selection#1-title-evaluation">evaluation processes</a>, including review of the listed Editors, policies, and publication and citation record.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the journal information and content on which acceptance was based have since been changed or removed, and the journal no longer meets Scopus’ standards for quality and integrity.</p>



<p>We have therefore taken the decision to immediately discontinue coverage of new content from Science of Law. We are also taking the exceptional step of removing all previous content.</p>



<p>Maintaining the integrity of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of paramount importance to us. This case will be used to inform our continuous efforts to review and refine Scopus’ (re)evaluation processes.</p>
