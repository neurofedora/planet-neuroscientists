<p>While reviewing a manuscript for the <em>Journal of Organic Chemistry, </em>Caroline Kervarc-Genre and her colleague, Thibault Cantat, researchers at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, noticed something unusual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra buried in the supplementary information had striking irregularities: The baseline was interrupted in some parts, and the noise was the same from one spectrum to the next. “Noise being inherently random, repeating noise is only possible if the spectra are altered [or] fake,” Kervarc-Genre told <em>Retraction Watch</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting to suspect something was wrong, she and Cantat, examined other papers by the lead author. They discovered data appeared to have been edited in several of the author’s latest publications. “The fraud was not subtle,” Kervarc-Genre said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She had never come across such blatant fraud, she said, and was unsure about what to do, so <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=suman+jain">turned to PubPeer</a> to report the findings. Others soon joined, uncovering more troubling patterns in the work.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130951"></span>



<p>In total, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=suman+l+jain">43 papers have been flagged on PubPeer</a>, all sharing a common author: Suman L. Jain, a scientist at the CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum in Dehradun. Published between 2011 and 2024, many of the articles show anomalous spectra, as well as identical noise patterns and missing product characterizations – meaning there is no way of knowing if experiments were done at all, Kervarc-Genre said. In December and January, 10 of the flagged papers, all in journals from the Royal Society of Chemistry, were retracted; seven more from the publisher have received expressions of concern, pending further investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kervarc-Genre said the issues in the papers were often “blatant”. In two, “<a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/D54FDBF9BEAF9BACE6842B0851774B#">Novel Organic‐Inorganic Hybrid Mesoporous Silica Supported Oxo‐Vanadium Schiff Base for Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</a>,” published in <em>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis</em> and “<a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/475CAAF842C6CBC63DF5C328906FEE#">Thiourea dioxide promoted efficient organocatalytic one-pot synthesis of a library of novel heterocyclic compounds</a>,” which appeared in <em>Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry</em>, the sleuths recognized spectra copied from the <a href="https://sdbs.db.aist.go.jp/">Spectral Database for Organic Compounds</a>, a well-known repository in the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to the <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/475CAAF842C6CBC63DF5C328906FEE#">PubPeer comments</a> pointing out the copy-and-paste, Jain wrote she was “extremely sorry”, and said her institute didn’t have the right equipment to perform the experiments at the time.&nbsp; According to Jain, her students obtained the data from other institutes, and she was shown hard copies when the manuscript was being prepared. “These students are now settled in other countries and I have minimum contact information about them,” Jain wrote on PubPeer, adding she was attempting to contact them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper in <em>Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry</em> <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/ob/d4ob90165g">was retracted in January</a>, alongside nine others published in Royal Society of Chemistry journals. In the series of papers, the retraction notices cite duplications and anomalies in the spectra – such as peaks appearing manually added or removed – as well as significant gaps in the data. Some of the retraction notices specify author contributions, with some attributing responsibility for the experimental work to the first authors, often the students in the lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010603016308899">Nickel oxide nanoparticles grafted on reduced graphene oxide (rGO/NiO) as efficient photocatalyst for reduction of nitroaromatics under visible light irradiation</a>”, published in the <em>Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010603024003617">was corrected</a> after a commenter on PubPeer noticed identical noise on the spectra published in the paper. “The authors feel extremely sorry as they have inadvertently made a mistake in data handling…”, the correction states, attributing the noise duplication to a possible “labeling mistake”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213343724010601?via%3Dihub">Synergistic CdS@CeO2 nanocomposites: Harnessing Z-scheme electron transfer for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 conversion and aqueous Cr(VI) reduction</a>,” which appears in the <em>Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering,</em> a PubPeer commenter pointed out peaks appeared to have been manually added onto the spectra, and unexpected blank spots in one of the graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain acknowledged the irregularities, stating on PubPeer she agreed with the concerns and was trying to contact the student responsible for the experiments, who had left her group a year earlier. Then in August 2024, she wrote that she had submitted a correction to the editor, although none appears on the article page. In an email to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, a spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes the journal, said they had not received any request for correction to the article by the authors. However, the publisher is investigating this paper, along with 13 others flagged on PubPeer, that Jain published in Elsevier journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A handful of Jain’s papers flagged on PubPeer were also co-authored by French chemists, Rabah Boukherroub and Sabine Szunerits, recently called out on <em>For Better Science </em><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/12/06/lille-papermille/">for alleged papermilling</a>. Earlier in her career, Jain’s 2009 paper “<a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adsc.200800361">An Efficient Synthesis of Poly(ethylene glycol)-Supported Iron(II) Porphyrin using a Click Reaction and its Application for the Catalytic Olefination of Aldehydes</a>” was also retracted, after a reader discovered a reported reaction hadn’t happened, invalidating the paper’s hypothesis and conclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Suman-Jain-comment.pdf">email to <em>Retraction Watch</em></a>, Jain wrote “this is a most unfortunate situation for me,” and that she was “highly shocked” after receiving notifications on PubPeer and an email regarding an investigation by the Royal Society. of Chemistry. She called it “the most unfortunate part of my life” that the students who performed the experiments had left her group and could no longer be reached. During the manuscript submissions, she described having uploaded the supporting files that her students prepared, without realizing they had manipulated the data. </p>



<p>“I sincerely apologise and accept my mistake that I should check and re-verify the data before submission,” she wrote, adding that until reading the comments on PubPeer, she was “utterly unaware of this unethical act by the students.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain said she felt “afraid to respond on PubPeer” but planned to resubmit each retracted article as a new publication with the raw data to preserve her integrity. She claimed to have already provided corrected results to some journals, adding that for the rest she would “re-perform the reactions… with the help of new students.” She continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>… please believe me. I was completely unaware of these manipulations during the manuscript submission. I could never imagine that students whom I helped a lot during their PhD did this to me, and now, they are not even responding. I feel cheated by the dirty and manipulative students who, just for their selfish purpose, created this trouble for me. I am highly depressed and do not know how to come out of all that.</p>



<p>This situation is an eye-opener for me for the future. I will be extremely careful in data handling from now onwards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We attempted to contact a handful of the students who once worked in Jain’s lab, and were listed as co-authors on the articles issued with retractions or expressions of concern. None have yet responded to our queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with another colleague, Cantat, one of the researchers who first spotted the abnormalities in Jain’s work, contacted editors at 11 journals to report the findings he and Kervarc-Genre had made. Only two replied: the <em>European Journal of Organic Chemistry</em>, which said it would “thoroughly investigate”, but has <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejoc.202201338">yet to take action</a>, and the Royal Society of Chemistry, the publisher which issued the ten retractions in its journals earlier this year.</p>



<p>“We were extremely disappointed in the reaction of the editors and publishers, which was to ignore us, and the data manipulation,” Kervarc-Genre said. “We found it very infuriating that the reviewers and editors had accepted papers that contained some blatant fraud and had clearly not been looked at with enough care.”</p>



<p>The manuscript that first sparked their suspicion never made it into the <em>Journal of Organic Chemistry </em>after Cantat reported his concerns to the handling editor. Instead, a year later, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468823124007442">it resurfaced</a> in <em>Molecular Catalysis</em>, although Cantat said he had not had the time to review the published version.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/02/plos-price-transparency-update-2024/">PLOS Price Transparency Update 2024</a></h4>

              
                <p>We&rsquo;re pleased to once again share our annual reporting from the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/journal-comparison-service/">Plan S Journal Comparison Service</a> to give our community insight into how our publication fees are used to support journal activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Price transparency snapshot for 2023</strong><strong><br></strong>The data in the table below reflects the reporting we provided to the Journal Comparison Service at the end of 2024 covering the year 2023. It&rsquo;s based on the publication fee for a Research Article in each journal at that time and the services we provide for each article we receive (not just those which are ultimately published).</p>



<p>While the price breakdown among the broad categories provided by the framework remains largely the same year to year, we are always innovating to meet the needs of our communities. In 2023 we invested in processes, tools and systems to further support our high publication ethics standards, as well as strengthening our overall digital infrastructure to meet growing submissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there are always variances between journals in line with differences in their editorial models and development stage. Community Development, for example, takes a greater share of the allocation for our newer journals as we continue to establish those journals in their respective fields. We encourage you to look back at our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">original post</a> for more detail on key differences between our journal models.</p>



<p>You can find our full report from the framework in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lCMVh4s5lhhBvD3I33AasGtIq-i2u8DR/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=116331873531812821923&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond the APC</strong><strong><br></strong>While the data above are based on the standard publication fee for each journal, PLOS has long been working to reimagine more equitable and sustainable <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/models/">models for open access publishing</a> that do not rely on APCs. Each of our journals are currently supported by institutional business models to address different challenges such as the high-cost of selective publishing and regional economic disparities.</p>



<p>As a non-profit organization, PLOS also works alongside researchers, librarians, and funders to redefine publishing norms and effect positive change. In 2024 we received three major grants to advance this work: a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/12/plos-receives-3-3m-grant-to-support-open-access-publishing-business-model-transformation/">3-year funding package from the Gates Foundation</a> which will support PLOS during our transition to APC-free publishing and funding support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation launching our 18-month <a href="https://plos.org/redefining-publishing/">Research and Design project</a> which seeks to transform publishing models to ensure that science is open, recognized, and accessible to all. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;re excited to provide updates on the R&amp;D project throughout the year. You can also find more information about our finances and strategic initiatives on our <a href="http://plos.org/financial-overview">Financial Overview </a>page.</p>

<p><em>Retraction Watch readers are likely familiar with the work of Charles Piller, an award-winning investigative reporter who has been covering problematic research in neuroscience and other fields for </em>Science<em>. We&#8217;re pleased to offer an excerpt of his new book, </em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Doctored/Charles-Piller/9781668031247">Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer&#8217;s</a><em>, which publishes today</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <em>Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease (JPAD) </em>seems authoritative and looks prestigious. Its sponsors are Springer, a division of Springer Nature, one of the largest scientific publishers, and the annual Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Congress—a major, global scientific meeting. Many doctors rely on <em>JPAD </em>when deciding whether to prescribe amyloid-reducing drugs such as Leqembi, or others to fight agitation or anxiety that can accompany Alzheimer’s dementia.</p>



<p>Matthew Schrag first raised an eyebrow about the journal in August 2021 while examining possible misconduct in studies behind Cassava Sciences’ simufilam for the citizen petition to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The prior year, <em>JPAD </em>had published a paper by Cassava’s Lindsay Burns and Hoau-Yan Wang that suggested strong potential for the drug. It said simufilam lowered key biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s—particularly tau proteins—in the spinal fluid of patients who were volunteers for the company’s clinical trial. That paper helped boost confidence in Cassava and simufilam.</p>



<span id="more-130610"></span>



<p>Schrag thought an image central to its experimental findings looked strange. A single band of a western blot depicting the presence of tau seemed to have been copied and pasted into the larger image. He emailed his doubts to <em>JPAD </em>editors in September 2021. Bruno Vellas, a French neuroscientist and then coeditor-in-chief, handled the query. He seemed a curious respondent, because Vellas and Wang coauthored a similar 2017 article in another journal. It too showed biomarker benefits from simu- filam. Schrag thought that it too showed strong signs of image doctoring; that paper would be retracted in 2022.</p>



<p>Soon after, Schrag asked ethics administrators at Springer to examine the matter, and coeditor-in-chief Paul Aisen of the University of Southern California took over the complaint. Vellas also stepped down as coeditor-in-chief. Independently, I confirmed Schrag’s findings with image-integrity specialists and Alzheimer’s researchers who were not affiliated with <em>JPAD</em>. Yet eleven months after Schrag raised his concern, Cassava issued a press release saying <em>JPAD </em>had exonerated the paper. Aisen later told Schrag that they had run the images by experts familiar with western blots, rather than a forensic-image analyst. The article helped smooth simufilam’s glide path to late-stage human trials.</p>



<p>Schrag noticed University of Nevada neuroscientist Jeffrey Cummings among its editorial board members. Cummings, an authority on Alzheimer’s trials and amyloid hypothesis advocate, had with Harvard’s Dennis Selkoe sharply criticized my 2022 “<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease">Blots on a Field</a>?” article in <em>Science </em>about the influential study by Sylvain Lesné and Karen Ashe. The same story described concerns about Cassava’s work. As of April 2024, Cummings was a long-standing paid member of Cassava Sciences’ advisory board.</p>



<p>According to federal records, Cummings augments his income—by nearly $1 million in personal fees and travel in the last few years alone—consulting for a laundry list of big and small Alzheimer’s companies, including Cassava, Biogen, Eisai, Alzheon, and Acadia.</p>



<p>Other top <em>JPAD </em>editors show similar issues. Vellas has received consulting fees from Eisai and others. Aisen has been paid more than $100,000 since 2016 by makers of anti-amyloid drugs. As head of a clinical research center, he has pulled in tens of millions of corporate dollars to test such drugs. Another editor, Brown University’s Stephen Salloway, took $170,000 in fees and $25 million in research support. Others on the journal’s editorial board show similar figures. Current and former Biogen and Eisai employees have actually served on that board.</p>



<p>Anti-amyloid drugs from those companies and others often have received favorable coverage in <em>JPAD </em>in papers written by Cummings, Aisen, Vellas, and Salloway. Their articles supported the companies’ arguments that their drugs enjoyed a sound scientific foundation at critical junctures in the development and regulatory process.</p>



<p>Biogen and Eisai’s drug Aduhelm became a fiasco that never achieved full federal approval. Yet <em>JPAD</em>’s “‘expert panel’ produced ‘appropriate use recommendations’ for aducanumab [Aduhelm] before the clinical trials of [Aduhelm] had even been published,” Schrag noted in his analysis. “Five of the six members of this panel were paid by Biogen and/or Eisai,” the drug’s makers. They included Salloway and Cummings. “This was not disclosed in the abstract or main text, but only in fine print at the end of the article,” Schrag added.</p>



<p>Like any normal journal, <em>JPAD </em>relies on peer review to ensure accuracy and scientific relevance. Unpaid, ostensibly unbiased and skeptical experts critique each submission. Peer reviewers nearly always request clarifications or changes to sharpen and improve a manuscript. Such reviews and corrections, required for acceptance of a paper, typically take weeks and can last several months. The delays understandably frustrate authors, but high-quality reviews of complex science take time. The <em>Nature </em>journals—among the world’s most respected—average 213 days from submission to acceptance. The <em>Science </em>journals move at a comparable pace, 202 days. <em>JPAD</em>’s “peer reviewed” guidelines for Aduhelm took eight days, including a US holiday.</p>



<p>Schrag wondered how fast <em>JPAD </em>generally completed peer reviews, examining the dates manuscripts were submitted and approved. Some cases involving Cummings and his affiliated companies proceeded at an improbable clip. The Cassava biomarker study took seven days. A favorable 2016 study of the anti-amyloid drug tramiprosate, coauthored by Vellas, Cummings, and Serge Gauthier, another coeditor-in-chief, took just six. The drug’s maker, Alzheon, paid all three of those scientists for consulting at the time, and they served on its advisory board.</p>



<p>“This casts a shadow on the whole publishing and peer review process,” said Donna Wilcock, the Indiana University neuroscientist and chief editor of <em>Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia</em>, who examined a dossier Schrag prepared about <em>JPAD</em>. “Anytime you get a paper that is accepted within a week of being received, I guarantee it’s not been peer reviewed.” Wilcock worries about the <em>JPAD </em>guidelines for prescribing anti-amyloid antibodies, she said. “That’s what all of us are using to guide our clinical programs. If they are not undergoing peer review, as advertised, then you’ve got to question the robustness of those papers.”</p>



<p>Cummings also has described his own credentials in an unorthodox way. The physician prominently notes a ScD degree in his biographical materials—reinforcing his credibility as a researcher. He fails to mention that his undergraduate alma mater, the University of Wyoming Laramie, bestowed the ScD in 2011 as an honorary degree. He replied to my query about this via <em>JPAD </em>editor Jacques Touchon, who noted that the university found Cummings’s voluminous writings “worthy of an advanced degree.” According to the university registrar, “An honorary degree was given to [Cummings] in 2011 based off his contributions to his profession. Honorary degrees are not noted on official transcripts.”</p>



<p>A 2018 <em>JPAD </em>article suggested that pimavanserin, a drug to treat psychosis among Alzheimer’s patients, was effective. The manuscript cleared peer review the same day <em>JPAD </em>editors received it. Public disclosures show that afterward, Cummings—the first listed author—received about $65,000 in various fees from its developer, Acadia Pharmaceuticals. The journal accepted a second paper extolling the benefits of the drug for patients with “pronounced psychotic symptoms” on the day received.</p>



<p>According to Schrag’s analysis, <em>JPAD </em>published 129 research articles, including expert statements and drug-use guidelines, between 2019 and 2021. When one of the journal’s editors-in-chief—including Vellas, Aisen, and Gauthier—coauthored a paper, submission to acceptance averaged about twenty-three days, compared to a still-brisk fifty-two days for other papers.</p>



<p>“It raises questions about whether this journal is a fair and legitimate venue for the dissemination of scientific results, or . . . a personal platform for selected editors and their allies,” Schrag noted in his analysis.</p>



<p>I forwarded Schrag’s concerns and my own questions to all of the concerned editors. They sent a joint reply that they review quality and police conflicts of interest rigorously. Pharma company leaders, they said, “are among the most knowledgeable experts in the field and contribute important perspectives,” and that editors from Biogen and Eisai do not “review clinical trial results due to potential conflict of interest.” <em>JPAD </em>relies on declarations by authors to avoid such conflicts, the editors said, noting that “statistically, we have good reason to believe that we are in the right.” </p>



<p>Vellas denied receiving personal compensation from Alzheon, although he disclosed receiving “fees and/or stock options” from the company in the pages of <em>JPAD </em>itself within a favorable article, in 2017, about that company’s drug tramiprosate. In November 2023, Vellas said he had asked his assistant to put in corrections to his own journal, and to others in which he said he had accidentally disclosed payments from Biogen that were not received. Seven months later, no corrections had been posted.</p>



<p>Regarding the ultrafast peer review process for themselves, they noted, “because the editors-in-chief and board members lead some of the most important clinical and research centers in the field, it is unsurprising that some papers from their teams are of high value and readily judged to be publishable [and] accepted quickly due to their quality, originality, or importance.” They added: “We do not give priority to anyone.”</p>



<p>Jason Karlawish, an eminent ethicist and Alzheimer’s expert at the University of Pennsylvania, and <em>JPAD</em>’s ethics editor from its inception through 2020, declined to comment about any of these matters. “My experiences were precisely none,” he said about his work at the journal. “It was one of those roles that never moved on from a title.”</p>

<p>The majority of the editorial board of a top psychology journal have resigned en masse after the publisher replaced the journal’s editors without warning. Also departing are the honorary editor and statistical consultants.</p>



<p>The journal, <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em>, is a Karger title and “the official journal of the International College of Psychosomatic Medicine and the World Federation for Psychotherapy,” according to its <a href="https://karger.com/pps#home-affiliations">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christna Chap, head of editorial development for Karger, called the change in the journal’s leadership a “normal editorial transition” which “may have been misunderstood by some members of the community, leading them to criticize the journal and encourage others to do the same based on incorrect information.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130926"></span>



<p>“We are concerned about these actions,” Chap said, “but look forward to shortly appointing new leadership for the Editorial Board of <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em> with whom we will work closely to define the next developmental stage of the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">catalogued</a> mass editorial resignations from at least 20 other scientific journals since 2023, for a variety of reasons. With publishers increasingly adopting a business model of charging article processing fees and aiming to publish more articles, editors have grown concerned about quality and stress on the peer review process, as our Ivan Oransky <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/scientific-journal-editors-mass-resignations/">recently explained on Science Friday</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em> boasts an impact factor of 16.3 and CiteScore of 29.4, with an acceptance rate of 14%. In a December 10 <a href="https://karger.com/pps/article/doi/10.1159/000542491/917390/The-Journal-s-Appreciation">editorial</a>, Jenny Guidi and Fiametta Cosci, then the editors in chief, wrote that the journal&#8217;s impact factor ranked it fourth among psychiatry journals and the same among psychology journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The day after the editorial was published, Karger’s publication manager notified Guidi by email that her contract would not be renewed at the end of its term, and “it was time for the journal to take a new direction,” Guidi told Retraction Watch. Her access to the submission system had already been revoked. She emailed Karger’s chairwoman and the company CEO asking for clarification, “since it all had happened without justified reasons,” but didn’t receive an answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was fired about seven months before contract termination,” Guidi said. She called the episode a “deplorable, unexpected situation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cosci, an associate professor at the University of Florence in Italy, resigned from her role, and is now editor in chief of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-psychosomatic-research/about/editorial-board"><em>Journal of Psychosomatic Research</em></a>, an Elsevier title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karger replaced Guidi, Cosci and their assistant editors with an employee as managing editor, according to Giovanni Fava, honorary editor of the journal. Fava served as editor in chief for 30 years, and in 2022 handed off the role to Guidi and Cosci as his chosen successors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karger’s decision to replace the editorial leadership “was taken without consulting me and the editorial board,” Fava said. In response, he, the journal&#8217;s statistical consultants, and 70% of the editorial board members resigned, according to a comparison of the journal’s <a href="https://karger.com/PPS/pages/editorial-board">current editorial board listing</a> and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240912135555/https://karger.com/pps/pages/editorial-board">archived version of the webpage</a> from last September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The event is in line with the growing attacks of publishers to the independence of editors and editorial board which led to mass resignations in other journals,” Fava said. He cited <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">previous coverage</a> by Retraction Watch of editorial mass resignations as showing “corporate interests … disregard the work of scientists who spend their time and energies for preserving intellectual freedom and the ethics of publishing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fava described “frictions” between the journal editors and publisher, such as “the very slow production time and its quality,” and the publication manager’s desire to start issuing calls for papers and commissioning articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher’s production issues delayed the publication of articles and release of issues, Guidi said, and led to “inconsistencies and gross errors.” The publication manager also proposed strategies such as instituting special issues and using computerized tools to automatically find reviewers. The proposed strategies “did not apply to our top journal, or eventually run counter [to] its unique identity and intellectual freedom,” Guidi said. “Therefore, I generally denied those proposals, based on well-founded scientific reasons.”</p>



<p>Cosci said she “had a positive experience” at Karger. “I was not involved in any steps following my resignation thus I have nothing to say about my colleagues&#8217; decision to resign en masse,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics’</em> reputation, and the efforts of its editors, submissions to the journal had decreased in the last five years, “to the point of regularly experiencing difficulties having enough content to publish new issues at the scheduled times,” Chap said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Cosci’s resignation and Guidi’s contract ending, Chap said, “in light of the continuing difficulties the journal was experiencing, we informed Professor Guidi within the standard notice period that we would not renew her contract at its conclusion.” The publisher “first informed Professor Guidi, then the Editorial Board, and the affiliated societies who collaborate with the Karger-owned journal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is to be expected that a change in editorship comes with changes to the editorial board,” Chap said, “in particular when a number of the members have worked with the journal and the former Editors for more than 10 years.” She said it was “great to see” about 30% of the editorial board members remaining, and some were suggesting candidates for the next editor in chief. “Karger is also currently working closely with the affiliated societies on the journal’s future, including receiving their recommendation for a potential candidate,” Chap said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editorial board “did not get any announcement from the publisher” about the journal’s change in leadership, Richard Balon, an editorial board member from Wayne State University in Detroit, Mich, told Retraction Watch. He learned of the decision “through the grapevine” and contacted Karger leadership for an explanation. The answers he got were “very vague,” he said, and “suggested that they would like to take the journal in some new direction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balon resigned because he felt he and the entire editorial board “was ignored and not given any information (after years of free service),” he disagreed with Guidi’s firing, and was suspicious about Cosci’s departure. He also said he did not understand what the publisher’s desired “new direction” meant, given the journal’s strong metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have the feeling that the bottom line is not going to be the excellent quality of the journal, but money,” Balon said. “I have worked for other journals/publishers who treat their editors and editorial boards better.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Massimo Biondi, a professor emeritus of the Sapienza University of Rome in Italy, also said he resigned from the editorial board because the publisher gave them “no meaningful response” and “no information about a sudden change.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We, and the institutions we represent, do not deserve such a treatment from the Publisher,” he said. </p>



<p>“What happened to <em>Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics</em> is certainly astonishing, particularly in view of its reputation and scientific standards,” Guidi said. She was “impressed” by the mass resignation, she said. “This is a sign of the intellectual values that we share and should be preserved despite adversities.”</p>

<p>The first weeks of the second Trump administration have brought unprecedented <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276342/nsf-freezes-grant-review-trump-executive-orders-dei-science">shock and awe</a> to science. In response, the leaders of the scientific community must cease their hand-wringing and align behind two strong approaches to dealing with the chaos: protest and candor.</p>



<p>I write these words as an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/16/guest-post-when-whistleblowers-need-lawyers/">attorney representing whistleblowers of scientific fraud</a>. Prior to law school, I was an <a href="https://eugeniereichlaw.com/plastic-fantastic/">investigative journalist</a> focused on this same phenomenon. Today I represent scientists and technical experts independent of whether the falsified data they have uncovered support a political agenda. Twenty years of experience investigating, exposing and, when necessary, litigating cases of scientific fraud, has, however, led me to think in terms of a different kind of politics: the politics of nonconfirmatory data. Any research-based organization – a university, a healthcare provider, a laboratory or a corporation – faces a daily challenge from data gathered by scientists within that contradict the scientific hypotheses that are bringing in the money.</p>



<span id="more-130931"></span>



<p>Shock and awe disruptions exacerbate this problem.&nbsp; Too often in cases of scientific fraud, I observe a pattern of facts in which one or more experimentalists or data analysts were under severe pressure to deliver a result, while suffering from job insecurity. This can originate with the short-term nature of early career positions, or with a laboratory or institution being in a state of rapid change. Scientists do not do well facing existential job threats, because the natural pace of science is incremental. Facing setbacks in their experiments or their analysis, scientists need time to think, not reasons to hustle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only individual integrity, but professional and institutional stability, are necessary for most scientists to have a fully objective response when the data they have spent thousands of hours collecting imply that it is time to start over.&nbsp; Most also need a minimum level of job security to feel safe speaking up about failure to reproduce the results of others who are prominent in their fields of study.</p>



<p>Those who hold secure positions in scientific leadership must educate the public about this issue. Abrupt disruptions may deliver the advice a politician wants in the short term, but they will also fail to deliver the products the country wants, the medical treatments it needs and effective solutions to our problems. In the long term, the economy and technological progress will stall in a country where scientists are afraid to tell the truth about their data.</p>



<p>Yet this message is not enough. Leaders of the scientific community must also acknowledge missteps – both their own and of their peers. In my experience,&nbsp; many scientists who start out critical of the claims of others but who later identify as whistleblowers, even working with a lawyer such as myself, do so reluctantly only because authors, journals and scientific institutions have failed to respond to direct, well-evidenced allegations appropriately, or have <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/when-scholars-sue-their-accusers">made legal threats to silence them</a>.</p>



<p>Over time, denying and downplaying fraud is not only keeping my shop in business, it is producing a reserve of ammunition for those who misguidedly seek to control scientific results for political purposes.&nbsp; Scientific leadership must begin rolling, proactive disclosures of unaddressed issues now. They must also commit to proactively disclose new issues as they arise and before they escalate into weapons that the enemies of science can deploy against it. A whistleblower or a critic with concerns should be seen by leadership as an opportunity to stand tall and demonstrate an ability to listen and engage, not an inconvenient voice to muzzle.</p>

<p>Sage has retracted 416 articles from the <em>Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems (JIFS),</em> which had a mass retraction of over 450 papers last August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the mass retraction last year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/exclusive-publisher-retracts-more-than-450-papers-from-journal-it-acquired-last-year/">which we covered</a>, Sage paused publication of new articles from the journal, which it <a href="https://group.sagepub.com/press-releases/sage-grows-research-portfolio-by-acquiring-ios-press?_gl=1*1ol2wiz*_gcl_au*Mzc3MDgzNTM5LjE3MjQzMjE2OTg.*_ga*MTg4Mjc2NDY3MS4xNjQ5MTUxMTc3*_ga_60R758KFDG*MTcyNDMyMTY5OC4yMjUuMC4xNzI0MzIxNjk4LjYwLjAuMA..&amp;format=amp">acquired</a> when it bought IOS Press in 2023. The journal is now accepting new submissions, according to a Sage spokesperson. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219434">retraction notice</a> mentions citation and referencing “anomalies,” “incoherent, extraneous text and tortured phrases” and “unverifiable authors and reviewers,” among other signs of misconduct. “These indicators raise concerns about the authenticity of the research and the peer review process underlying the following articles. The Publisher regrets that these were not flagged during the journal’s editorial and peer review processes,” the notice reads.</p>



<p>Most of the researchers are from universities in India and China.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130922"></span>



<p>The notice also credits the Problematic Paper Screener’s (PPS)&nbsp; “Feet of Clay,” a detector which flags articles citing retracted material. The <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31">detector</a> makes use of the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a>, which is now part of Crossref. Guillaume Cabanac, the sleuth who created the PPS, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/exclusive-publisher-retracts-more-than-450-papers-from-journal-it-acquired-last-year/">told Retraction Watch</a> in August the retractions “will feed the Feet of Clay even more” as information is collected by metadata providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that time, Feet of Clay had flagged 674 papers by <em>JIFS,</em> not all of which had been retracted. The number is now <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:%5CJournal%20of%20Intelligent%20%26%20Fuzzy%20Systems%5C">up to 716</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to suspicion of “citation stacking,” Clarivate did not give the journal an impact factor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">in 2020</a>. And in 2021, IOS Press retracted <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/14/publisher-retracts-nearly-80-articles-over-three-days/">nearly 50 articles</a> from <em>JIFS</em> for “literature sources that have no relation to the subject matter of the citing article,” according to the <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219218">notice</a>.</p>



<p>The editor in chief of the journal, <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/langari-reza.html">Reza Langari of Texas A&amp;M</a> University in College Station,&nbsp; resigned last June. He told us at the time his decision was “due to differences of opinion on how to proceed.” He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Langari-comment.pdf">told us</a> growth in the AI field, which the journal covers, meant they received over 10,000 submissions in 2023 and rejected over 80% of them, “some of which were clearly manufactured by paper mills or else using AI tools.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage was aware of issues with the journal before acquiring IOS Press, the publisher’s spokesperson said in August:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For any new journal we take on, we use our resources to make sure we’re publishing at a high standard and in accordance with COPE. If there are any issues with specific journals then we’ll take corrective action as needed.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"><strong>Rebecca ‘Becca’ Williams is a computational neuroscience PhD student at the University of Cambridge and a passionate scientific communicator. As part of her public engagement extracurricular activities, Becca posts as a guest writer for the dementia researcher blog. In her </strong></span><u><a href="https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/blog-the-binary-of-science-femininity/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><strong>most recent piece</strong></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"><strong>, Becca discussed the Women in Neuroscience UK 2024 Awards event: “It was an evening of celebrating some incredibly inspiring scientists, mentors, and activists. An evening of celebrating some incredibly inspiring women. Women in cerebral ear-rings and hot pink suits, neuron necklaces, and Purkinje dresses. Women whose innovation and impact were in no way diminished by their high heels”. </strong></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"><strong>Becca pondered her previously internalised perception of women and science being binary terms, with no overlap, and the connotations we attach to the word scientist: “analytical and rational, never emotional. Decisive and confident, never passive and soft. Because to be a scientist is to be independent, assertive, and logical. It’s a strange coincidence of fate that these are also traits typically ascribed to masculinity. And so, at a young age, and entirely subconsciously, I had to choose between being perceived as intelligent and being perceived as feminine”.</strong></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><strong>Women in Neuroscience UK (WiNUK) founder, Lizzie English, shares her response to Becca&apos;s blog post below:</strong></span></em></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">“I loved listening to this blog post and here’s why:</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">I packed remaining #WiNUKAwards2024 Women in Neuroscience UK certificates and trophies yesterday, ready for posting, but I nearly stopped myself doing pretty pink calligraphy, with femininity too often seen as unprofessional…</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">Women in Neuroscience UK branding is often hyper-feminine - more feminine than I express myself on most days. This may sometimes feel uncomfortable but is very much intentional.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">We see a professional world where masculinity is praised, whilst feminine appearances and attributes are too often frowned upon. Scientists might not always want to express femininity to the level of WiNUK’s branding (and my aim is certainly not to force this), but by being hyperfeminine, WiNUK shows everyone that it is possible to be both feminine and professional at the same time</span></p>

                <p>Author: Lauren Cadwallader, Open Research Manager, PLOS</p>



<p>The latest version of the PLOS Open Science Indicators (OSI) dataset,<strong> </strong>produced in partnership with DataSeer, extends its coverage to articles from January 1st 2018 to September 30th 2024. These data on 147,619 articles offer insights into open science practices over even more time and, with improved metadata integrated from <a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a>, this and future versions of the data can be explored in new ways.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21687686.v9"><strong>Download the dataset</strong></a></p>



<p>This release includes the latest results for data and code sharing, and preprint posting. Previously released preliminary rates of study registration, and protocol sharing are also included.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="205" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-1024x205.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22575" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-1024x205.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-300x60.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-768x153.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-1536x307.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig1-2048x409.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 1: Open Science Indicators for PLOS and comparator content by publication quarter Q1 2018-Q3 2024. Rates are given as a proportion of all published articles.</em></p>



<p>Previous versions of the dataset have included information on the country associated with the first corresponding author and disciplinary information taken from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/">MeSH terms</a> associated with the article on PubMed. In this version, the country and discipline metadata has been replaced with openly available data from OpenAlex to provide better coverage and standardised names across the articles (OpenAlex is an open and free bibliographic catalogue of scientific papers, authors and institutions). Users of OSI told us they needed different &ndash; including less granular &ndash; ways of exploring trends by discipline, and better coverage of geographic information across the comparator (non-PLOS) dataset.</p>



<p>This update allows a more thorough examination of trends by country as well as by discipline. The new fields included in OSI version 9 are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&ldquo;Primary Topic Field&rdquo; and &ldquo;Primary Topic Subfield&rdquo;&nbsp; &ndash; these give disciplinary information about each article from two levels of the <a href="https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/topics">OpenAlex Topic hierarchy.</a> The &ldquo;Primary Topic Field&rdquo; has 26 distinct categories, whereas the Subfield category gives more granular information.</li>



<li>&ldquo;Corresponding Author Country&rdquo; and &ldquo;First Author Country&rdquo; give the geographic location of the affiliation of the authors. Both are provided as &ldquo;First Author Country&rdquo;, which gives better coverage across the whole dataset than &ldquo;Corresponding Author Country&rdquo;. Where data for both are available, the country matches in &gt;95% of cases.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Examples of using the new metadata</strong></p>



<p>Example 1</p>



<p>Using First Author Country and looking at the data across the whole dataset, we can examine preprint posting trends in specific countries (Figure 2). In this case, trends for the USA, China and India can be observed. Not only do we see how the results change over time, with differences emerging post COVID pandemic, but also how rates differ between countries.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="630" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2-1024x630.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22576" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2-1024x630.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2-300x185.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2-768x472.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig2.png 1494w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 2: Preprint posting rate for three countries based on publication date of the article. 2024 is for Q1-3 only.</em></p>



<p>Example 2</p>



<p>Integrating disciplinary data from OpenAlex with the OSIs facilitates exploring the data with specific subject-based communities in mind. For example, the graph below (Figure 3) shows the rates of data shared in a repository by articles that fall into the Environmental Science primary topic for articles published in PLOS and articles published elsewhere. This allows us to get a better sense of the open science practices that are happening within different communities and therefore tailor solutions that work with existing community practices and norms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="629" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22577" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3-1024x629.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3-300x184.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3-768x471.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/Fig3.png 1497w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 3: Rates of data shared in a repository for articles published PLOS articles versus those in the Comparator dataset where Primary Topic Field is &ldquo;Environmental Science&rdquo; based on publication year. 2024 is for Q1-3 only.</em></p>



<p>We hope that other users of the OSI data find these improvements useful and we welcome any feedback from and collaboration with users of the data.</p>



<p><strong>Future OSI releases</strong></p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll be making some changes to how, and how often, we release the OSI dataset in 2025 so that we best support the needs of OSI&rsquo;s users, and PLOS&rsquo; mission. As such there won&rsquo;t be an OSI public release in March/April 2025. Our commitment to <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21640889.v1">the OSI principles</a> including open data and methods for OSI results will not change. We&rsquo;ll share more information on our OSI plans later in 2025, and meanwhile feel free to <a href="mailto:lcadwallader@plos.org">contact us</a> with questions about using the data.</p>

<p>An English university has issued a finding of research misconduct against a former graduate student and is requesting 10 retractions of his published work, which they say bears the marks of being papermilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former student, Sameer Quazi, was enrolled at the University of Manchester in 2021 in the school’s “PGCert” program in clinical bioinformatics, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameer-quazi-81628811a/?originalSubdomain=in">LinkedIn profile</a>. The <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-certificate-diploma/#:~:text=A%20postgraduate%20certificate%20(PGCert)%20or,to%20complement%20your%20professional%20experience.">certificate program</a> sits between undergraduate and masters training. Quazi’s profile states he is currently enrolled in a master’s program in biomedical sciences at Anglia Ruskin University, in Cambridge. (Update, 2/3/25: Ruskin tells us he is no longer enrolled there, and as of today his LinkedIn profile says he left there this month.)</p>



<p>According to a January 30 <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/statement-on-research-misconduct/">statement from the university</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>In September 2023 a concern was raised about the conduct of Sameer Quazi, Founder and CEO of GenLab Biosolutions Private Limited, India, regarding publication ethics.</p>



<p>The University of Manchester completed an investigation and reached a finding of research misconduct against Mr Quazi, who is no longer enrolled as a student at the University.</p>



<p>The investigation was conducted in accordance with the University’s Code of Practice for Investigating Concerns about the Conduct of Research.&nbsp; The Panel of Investigation noted no research in the papers was completed at The University of Manchester and found a large number of instances of other types of research misconduct in relation to Mr Quazi’s sole- and co-authored papers. The Panel of Investigation was of the view that Mr Quazi was running a paper mill.&nbsp; Publishers have been contacted to request retraction of ten papers.</p>

<p>Following publication, concerns were raised regarding the contribution of the author of this article. Our investigation, conducted in accordance with Frontiers policies, confirmed a serious breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics; the article is therefore retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Quazi was the single author on that article and objected to the retraction, according to the notice. He was the second author on the other retracted paper, “New insights into molecular signalling pathways and current advancements in prostate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics,” from <em>Frontiers in Oncology</em>. The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1343833/full">retraction notice</a> is identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university does not identify the papers involved in the case. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Sameer+Quazi&amp;sort=date&amp;sort_order=asc">search of Pubmed</a> turned up 10 articles by Quazi published between 2021 and 2022, on topics ranging from the gut microbiome to AI in medicine. Quazi was the sole author on eight of those articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2AB633BE8B28635C58A2C1E3D2A5E">April 2024 PubPeer comment</a> on one his papers notes likely “tortured phrases” and reference problems.</p>



<p>The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We emailed Quazi for comment but have not heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Quazi <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7175352761415315456/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A7175352761415315456%2C7175380990750507008)&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A(7175380990750507008%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7175352761415315456)">opined on LinkedIn</a> about university ranking systems, many of which rely heavily on citations – an easily gamed metric that is often the focus of paper mills:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While I appreciate the intention to challenge the current rankings system, boycotting may not be the most effective solution. It could be more beneficial to work towards improving the current ranking criteria or creating an alternative system that focuses on quality of teaching and research. Simply boycotting may not lead to the desired change.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="352" height="352" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130909" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1.png 352w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1-300x300.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1-150x150.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dario Alessi</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In 2018, a biochemist in Scotland became aware of image irregularities in two of his papers through comments on PubPeer, each in a different journal. The researcher, <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/dario-alessi">Dario Alessi</a>, a professor at the University of Dundee, said he alerted his home institution immediately.</p>



<p>In July and October 2024, the papers were retracted.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FOI_296_Inke-Nathke-FEBS-letters.pdf">Emails</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FOI_296_Inke-Nathke_Biochem-Journ-letters.pdf">obtained</a> by <em>Retraction Watch</em> through a public records request show what happened in the intervening six years: Consecutive investigations by Dundee and a funder, then delays as the journals juggled conflicting narratives. In the meantime, the papers continued racking up citations.</p>



<span id="more-130908"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Alessi said he came across comments on Pubpeer in April 2018 “suggesting irregularities” in one of his publications. The comments raised concerns about two of his 2005 papers: “<a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.febslet.2005.05.040">Role of the PDK1–PKB–GSK3 pathway in regulating glycogen synthase and glucose uptake in the heart</a>” published in<em> FEBS Letters</em>, and “<a href="https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-abstract/385/3/639/78666/Deficiency-of-PDK1-in-liver-results-in-glucose?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Deficiency of PDK1 in liver results in glucose intolerance, impairment of insulin-regulated gene expression and liver failure</a>” published in <em>Biochemical Journal (BJ)</em>.</p>



<p>In January 2019, following a preliminary investigation, the research integrity group at Dundee’s School of Life Sciences recommended a formal investigation, according to emails <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/inke-nathke">Inke Nathke</a>, the interim dean and top research integrity officer at the School of Life Sciences, sent to the journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group came to the conclusion there were “additional issues beyond those flagged on PubPeer at the time,” Alessi told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Alessi was also affiliated with the UK-based Medical Research Council (MRC), they undertook the second investigation. But appointing the investigation panel took two years – during which the COVID-19 pandemic happened. The panel began its work in July 2021 and in December 2022 determined the two papers be retracted. </p>



<p>Six months later, Nathke contacted the journals with the results of both investigations.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">She waited four months for a response. In an October 2023 email to Nathke, a <em>BJ</em> representative wrote that their office “has been contacted separately by the co-corresponding author on this publication … who has appealed the proposed retraction.” (The name of the researcher was redacted by the University of Dundee before they provided us the emails.)</p>



<p>We emailed both corresponding authors of the <em>BJ </em>paper, Calum Sutherland and Alfonso Mora, asking if they appealed the retraction. <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/calum-sutherland">Sutherland</a>, also a researcher at Dundee, responded, simply: “Not me, sorry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, Nathke referred to “an appeal by the first author.” In both papers, the first author is <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6397-4836">Mora</a>, a researcher at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares and Organ Crosstalk in Metabolic Diseases Group in Madrid, Spain, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54353-4">recent publication</a>. He did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complaining author, presumably Mora, “did not think the MRC investigation was fair,” according to the Portland Press Editorial Office, which&nbsp; publishes&nbsp; <em>BJ</em>. Lapses in communication and disagreement over the text of the retraction notice&nbsp; — which remained unchanged, despite the co-author’s objections — delayed the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from complaints from Mora, <em>BJ</em> investigated the existence of the PubPeer comments Alessi said caused concern in 2018. No PubPeer comments on either the <em>BJ</em> or <em>FEBS </em>papers date before 2024; however, Alessi’s other works have received <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7D714F52420D956BEBA5CAD8FAD04F">comments</a> going back to 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emails between <em>BJ</em> and Nathke reference Mora’s objections to the retraction, which we have&nbsp; not seen. Nathke wrote in the October 2023 email, in response to the appeal: “my view is that whether something has or has not appeared on PubPeer is not relevant. What is relevant is that issues discovered with data in the publication remain questionable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nathke told us: “With regards to the PubPeer alert that you cannot find, there are two possible reasons. I think some problems were discovered by the research integrity group in [the School of Life Sciences] when they started investigating, which were not on PubPeer, and (I do not know this) but it is possible that the MRC may have received independent report(s) directly.”</p>



<p>The Portland Press representative blamed the delay on the lack of comments posted about the paper on PubPeer,” and “the issues that were raised to us that were investigated were due to direct emails from the University of Dundee rather than via PubPeer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether or not PubPeer comments on the papers existed at the time, they do now. The <em>BJ</em> paper has two <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1E8D6C4D24F6B5FB3B900DF87FAA36">comments</a> published October 2024, after the paper had already been retracted, pointing out that the images were “Much more similar than expected.”</p>



<p>The <em>FEBS Letters</em> paper also has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9B1C4149398B76FC82516DCA8B9733">comments</a> from October 2024, underneath the announcement of the retraction. One says: “Much more similar than expected after vertical resizing.” Several simply contain links to announcements of the awards and grants Alessi has received in the past few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alessi didn’t respond to our questions about the PubPeer comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In December 2023, Nathke wrote in an email to the <em>BJ</em> editorial team that Alessi “kindly shared with me your update about taking the retraction forward.”</p>



<p>It still took more than six months. On July 25, 2024, after several follow-up emails from Nathke, a staff member at the journal said the retraction was “just in the process of being published.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, the <a href="https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article/481/15/981/234735/Retraction-Deficiency-of-PDK1-in-liver-results-in">retraction</a> notice appeared, stating:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article is being retracted from the Biochemical Journal at the request of the authors. The authors willingly supported independent investigations, which have confirmed concerns regarding image duplications in Figures 3B and 5B in the original publication. The authors apologise for the inconvenience caused. The Editorial Board agrees with the decision to retract.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As for the seven-month delay after agreement that the retraction would move forward: “Unfortunately, this delay was caused by unforeseen changes in staffing arrangements,” the Portland Press Editorial Office told us in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meanwhile, at <em>FEBS Letters,</em> things were quiet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June 2023, soon after Nathke sent her initial email requesting the retraction, an “Image Integrity Analyst” was assigned. “This may take some time to look into,” an unnamed editorial assistant said in an email obtained through a public records request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After over a year of the journal not responding and Nathke’s repeated follow-up emails, a representative for the publication said they had “initiated an investigation, but recently had some staffing changes so things may have gotten side-tracked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper was finally retracted in October 2024, “by agreement between the authors; the journal Editor-in-Chief, Michael Brunner; FEBS Press; and John Wiley and Sons Ltd.,” according to the <a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1873-3468.15044">statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The journal was contacted by a representative of the research integrity group at the authors&#8217; institute, since an institutional investigation revealed inappropriate splicing and duplication of image sections within Fig. 2A, B and Fig. 3A. Consequently, the conclusions of the paper are substantially compromised, and the institute has recommended the paper to be retracted. The editors of the journal agree with the retraction based on the institutional investigation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we asked for clarification regarding staffing issues, a representative from the editorial office told us the retraction “was indeed delayed, due to internal miscommunication during a time of staff turnover. Nevertheless, the article has been retracted, and we feel that the matter is now closed.”</p>



<p>This case is hardly the first time we’ve seen a protracted retraction. Last year, for example, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/17/a-universitys-three-year-battle-to-retract-papers-with-fake-data/">covered</a> the University of Maryland’s mission to retract a researcher’s faked data, and in 2020, philosophy professor Michael Dougherty <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/30/a-two-year-drama-the-anatomy-of-a-retraction-request/">detailed</a> his “two year drama” to get a plagiarized paper retracted.</p>



<p>In the six years it took for the papers to be retracted, the paper in <em>FEBS Letters </em>was cited 19 times and the <em>BJ </em>paper 14 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. They have been cited 78 times and 71 times in total, respectively.</p>



<p>The retraction “took longer than anticipated due to the involvement of multiple institutions (UoD, MRC, Journals) and an appeal by the first author,” Nathke told us, but she still defended the journals: “I would like to emphasise that in my experience over the last year, journals are responding and take action very quickly.”</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Associate Professor Rebecca ‘Becky’ Trueman works at the University of Nottingham and was the winner of the Inclusive Workplace Development award! Becky’s role is split between teaching and research, both of which she enjoys. Studying Neuroscience as an undergraduate at Cardiff University, Becky’s research career began with work on Huntington’s Disease, before moving into stroke research later on. More recently, her work has been focused on drug discovery for Myotonic Dystrophy, another genetic disorder, and she is working within a fantastic multidisciplinary team. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky was nominated for this award because she strives to create an inclusive environment in her research group, believing that science is a team sport. Within her teaching endeavours, Becky has worked on a number of initiatives to improve inclusivity, including work with Emily Herrod (British Neuroscience Association, BNA, Placement student 2021), Anne Cooke (BNA), Hannah Thurgur (BNA) and Emily Sena (University of Edinburgh) to develop anti-racist tools for Neuroscience, helping to develop a Faculties Inclusive Curriculum toolkit.</span></span></p>

<p>Dr Katie Long is a Research Fellow at King’s College London, where she started her own lab with an MRC Career Development Award in 2019. Her lab investigates how the human brain develops to the right size and shape. She works with many fantastic basic science and clinical colleagues to address these questions in human foetal development using an interdisciplinary approach – from biomechanics and computational modelling to cell biology and immunology.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Katie studied Biomedical Science at Sheffield University before going on to do a PhD in developmental neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh (with Charles ffrench-Constant), exploring how brains are ‘built’ during development. She then moved to the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden (with Wieland Huttner) where she began working on brain development in different species, becoming interested in how brains have evolved into such unique anatomical structures.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Katie was nominated for this award because diversity is a key part of her research, from the experimental approaches she uses to the people she works with. Her commitment to an inclusive and open workplace includes, but is not limited to: hosting ethics lab meetings, encouraging open dialogue in her weekly lab meetings, highlighting important equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) topics, prioritising the career development of her lab members, providing a platform for anonymous feedback, establishing a mentoring programme and collaborating on Routes Collective. This is an organisation dedicated to supporting refugee and asylum-seeking women in London.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dr Kamar ‘Kam’ Ameen Ali has been a Senior Lecturer in Biomedical Science at Teesside University since 2022. Kam splits her time between teaching and pursuing an independent programme of dementia research. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam gained her PhD in behavioural neuroscience and neurobiology at Durham University, using an animal model to understand complex forms of memory. Her first postdoctoral position at the University of Sheffield investigated cognitive and neuropathological changes in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Following this, Kam decided to gain some experience outside of academia, taking up a position as regional programme manager for the NC3Rs, a research funder in the UK. Gaining this type of experience helped her to reflect on her career and fuelled her decision to return to academia. Kam then took two successive postdoctoral positions, firstly at Newcastle University, looking at the relationship between stroke and dementia using human post-mortem brain tissue, and then at the University of Glasgow looking at the relationship between traumatic brain injury and dementia, again using human post-mortem brain tissue. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam was asked to be a judge for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because she is a passionate advocate for academic researchers, and regularly contributes to the Dementia Researcher Blog to share her insights on life as a researcher. She is also a committed mentor as part of the BNA Scholars Programme and through ARUK’s cross centre mentorship scheme. </span></span></p>

<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_2dfa56466184448889883fb01f1e9d64~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Associate Professor Jo Jones, University of Cambridge"></figure>
<p>Dr Joanne ‘Jo’ Jones is an Associate Professor in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge and an Honorary Consultant Neurologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, specialising in the care of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Her lab is a translational neuroimmunology lab, focusing on understanding tissue immunity and immune regulation in health and disease, including in the brain. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jo completed her undergraduate medical training at Bristol University, where she was fortunate to receive MRC funding for an intercalated BSc. This confirmed her passion for immunology and medical research. So, after initial postgraduate medical training in the Southwest, in 2003 she moved to Cambridge to study for a PhD with Professors Alasdair Coles and Alastair Compston, working on a novel immune therapy for MS (Campath-1H – now licensed as Lemtrada). She thought the project was incredible, with a fantastic supervisor and research team.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Following Jo’s PhD, she returned to full-time neurology training for a few years before being appointed as a Clinical Lecturer in Neurology – a role made possible by a newly established national scheme. This allowed her to develop her research ideas and to generate the data needed to secure a Wellcome Trust Intermediate Clinical Fellowship, which provided the time and funding she needed to establish her own lab. After her fellowship, she was appointed as an Assistant Professor, and later promoted to Associate Professor, the role that she currently holds. Jo was awarded tenure last year. Over the years her group has grown; Jo now leads an outstanding team of talented individuals including a lab manager, five post-doctoral researchers and six PhD students. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jo was nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because “she is not only inspiring as a scientific leader in her field, she is an exceptional leader with a true dedication to mentoring and empowering the next generation of scientists”. Jo&apos;s lab truly celebrates an inclusive environment, championing gender and racial equity both in the lab and the wider department: “She ensures everyone feels welcome, is given support (both career and more broadly) and she stands out in her support of early-career researchers, whatever their chosen career path, after their time in her lab”. She leads the EDI group in her department, which has included sessions on parental leave, and actively promotes the representation of women in neuroscience through organising, supporting and participating in conferences, workshops, and outreach efforts.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dr Hilary Richardson is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and a developmental cognitive neuroscientist. Most of her research examines the neural correlates of social cognitive development in childhood. She is interested in the development of brain regions that take on particular cognitive functions, and the role of intrinsic and experiential factors on this development. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, she worked as a research assistant in a developmental psychology lab led by Professor Henry Wellman and contributed to studies on children’s ‘theory of mind’ development (‘theory of mind’ describes the human ability to reason about others’ internal mental states – their beliefs, desires, and emotions). When Hilary graduated from university, she took a full-time research assistantship position at MIT; this position provided her with more experience in development social cognitive neuroscience research,using fMRI as a key method. She stayed at MIT to complete her PhD in Neuroscience (with Professor Rebecca Saxe) and then completed a postdoctoral research fellowship at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School (with Professor Charles Nelson). During the fellowship, Hilary learned how to use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to study social brain development in young children. Hilary started as a Lecturer in the Psychology Department at the University of Edinburgh in 2020.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary was nominated because she is a dedicated mentor, supporting her most senior PhD student through two first-author publications, a prior MSc student with a first-author publication, four undergraduate/MSc students to obtain PhD positions and a postdoctoral researcher to a Lectureship position. She tailors her advice to suit each of her mentees and makes professional development a priority in her lab meetings and one-to-ones. Hilary promotes an inclusive and supportive environment by organising group activities with low/no financial costs, hosting open lab meetings, and celebrating both small and big achievements through announcements in monthly lab meetings. </span></span></p>

<p>Dr Emma Cahill has been a Lecturer in Neuroscience at the University of Bristol since 2021, where she teaches undergraduate courses on the brain, neuropharmacology and behaviour, as well as leading a research team conducting  experimental work on the neurological mechanisms underlying memory.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her undergraduate degree was in Neuroscience, from Trinity College Dublin, where she first discovered her love for lab work (her summer project investigated how exercise could enhance object recognition memory in rats!). Emma then travelled to France for her Masters and PhD research. Her PhD programme was for international students, so she met people from lots of different countries and made lifelong friends. Her PhD thesis was on understanding the effect of cocaine on the NMDA-type glutamate receptor and Dopamine type 1 receptor and involved mostly wet-lab work and cell culture. It had ups and downs, but Emma recalls enjoying working in a team and leading a research project to completion. She also got her French up to scratch and started teaching in the University Paris VI.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Post-PhD, Emma decided she wanted to continue to study glutamate and dopamine interactions, but this time in the context of fear memories. She was aiming to secure a post-doctoral position, and she reflected on how she “pretty much stalked relevant groups at big conferences” and managed to secure a position with a team focused on behaviour analysis in Cambridge. As a postdoctoral researcher, Emma continued to teach and perform experiments on how dopamine regulates fear memory persistence. She obtained her own research funding from the BBSRC and an Industry collaborative grant, so she stayed in Cambridge on a temporary lectureship for three years, during which time her first PhD student started. These grants helped Emma to pave the way for her own research that she now continues in Bristol.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Emma was nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’ for her investment in the scientific development of her mentees, sharing curated opportunities, facilitating networking and assisting in the gain of a wide variety of skills. She is incredibly inclusive of all students, believing in them equally, treating them as individuals and never assuming ability. Her nominator particularly appreciates that “personal flair is always encouraged and you never feel as if you’re being pushed into a mould” and truly believes that “neuroscience, and science at large, would be vastly improved if more people mentored like Emma”.</p>

<p><u><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>The Importance of Mentorship</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In our research roles, it can often feel as though we are being stretched too thin, with teaching, meetings and all the other essential tasks required of us! Trying to fit being a mentor into our busy schedules can be incredibly difficult, but it is one of the most invaluable uses of your time. There’s a reason that universities often have mentorship schemes for individuals all the way from undergraduate students up to Professors - there’s always something we can learn or teach. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi was in agreement and also recognised that everyone’s journey is different, even if we end up in similar positions eventually. She remarked that mentorship is important because “it allows people to expand their knowledge - it’s a true personification of “a problem shared, is a problem halved”.” Tomi also recognised that mentorship opens the door to sponsorship opportunities, which are an “ever-growing important part of scientific career progression.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky has been lucky enough to consider many wonderful people to have been mentors throughout her career, sharing that they are the people “who give great practical advice and push you to do things you didn’t think you were quite ready for, and the ones who are there for fantastic emotional support when nothing seems to be working.” She reflected that she has always tried to “search out mentors who hold similar values to [her] and strive to create a positive research culture” and that mentors are “hugely important to help you navigate the rocky road of academia”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie shared that we are not always the best at providing guidance and support for ourselves, instead we are “often much better at seeing the good in other people and their work than we are at seeing our own. Having a mentor (or better yet more than one!) is so important to help you see your own strengths and to navigate your career in a way that you enjoy”. It is equally as important to help those you mentor to do the same. Being a mentor to others can highlight just how critical we can all be of ourselves sometimes. Having that outside perspective really can make all the difference.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, Kam commented that “mentorship is important now more than ever, because we know that women and people from under-represented groups face structural inequalities in academia and are disproportionately affected by things such as precarious contracts and work casualisation”. She explained that mentorship is an “effective way of supporting early- and mid-career researchers through providing guidance and enabling them to develop and make choices that will allow them to progress in their careers”. Whilst Kam has tried to model many of the skills and qualities she sees in her mentors, she acknowledges that “it’s important to be flexible and tailor your mentorship for the needs of each mentee”. After all, we’re all different and require different types of support!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Jo has learned that mentorship is a dynamic, two-way process, stating that “mentors provide guidance, but they also learn from their mentees. Effective mentorship requires active listening, tailored support, and encouragement of independence”. She highlighted how although it is tempting to solve every problem brought to you, “often it is just helpful for someone to be able to talk issues through. As a mentee, I’ve benefited from mentors who not only provided technical expertise but also encouraged me and helped me navigate career challenges”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary asserted, “Mentorship is hard! It is a skill to be continually refined”. Recognising how crucial supporting and advising others is, she observed that mentorship is the part of her job that feels most impactful: “No one is an island in academia; my mentors provided me with training and access to opportunities that changed the way that I think and helped me define and push me towards my professional goals”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Emma recognised that being a mentor has not only benefited her mentees, but has also helped her to develop new ways to manage herself, saying “it’s always a two-way process and there is something to be gained by both mentee and mentor.” She shared that being a mentor involved being flexible and adapting your approach, depending on the mentee’s requirements, as “there is not a one-fit rule either. As a mentor, you may need to adjust your approach for different situations or different persons, and your own experience might not be relevant. So, it helps to be flexible. In the same way, search out different mentors for different aspects of support.”</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi wants you to remain authentic and to ask for help (because it’s OK not to know everything!). She also imparts that no goals are “too big” - set goals that you truly want to achieve!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky would like you to “believe in yourself, do not be afraid to take up space, your thoughts and opinions are valid. Find mentors – they don’t have to officially be mentors and don’t need to be in your field – but people who you can knock on the door of and will reassure you when you need it, push you to take those next big steps and help you find the connections and network you need”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie acknowledges that “research can be such a fun and rewarding career path, despite the challenges” and recommends that you “find the things that you enjoy, the questions that you love to work on, the surprise directions that excite you and the people who will support and motivate you. You may find these things in places you weren’t expecting to, so be open to new directions and opportunities to enjoy what you do”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam shares the advice that she always gives to ECRs: “Have an idea of what you’re interested in, but keep your mind open to different opportunities that come your way. If you follow what you’re interested in, you can’t go wrong, but be open for that to change. In academia we develop such a variety of skills, and we have a range of different career options open to us because of that. Even if you decide to pursue one option, you are not committing yourself to that path forever. More and more people are moving between academic and non-academic jobs, and employers are increasingly seeing the benefit of researchers who have worked across sectors”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">For Jo, prioritising “building a strong network, collaborations and mentorship” is one of the most invaluable things you can do throughout your career. “Be proactive in seeking opportunities, but also learn to say no sometimes to protect your time. Resilience is key; setbacks are inevitable in research, but they offer valuable learning experiences. Finally, advocate for yourself - whether it’s for funding, authorship, or career progression, don’t be afraid to make your contributions and ambitions known!”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary emphasises the importance of pursuing questions that “excite you, with people who challenge and support you. Scientific outputs take a lot of time and effort; being genuinely interested in ‘the answer’ that a particular project provides is a good sign that a project is worth doing”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Emma stressed the value of some inner reflection: “Know what works for you and what you need help with, [so that you can] search out people who are excited by your science”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We also chatted to them about their thoughts and feelings surrounding their award category.</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi wanted to be Head Judge for the ‘Inclusive Workplace Development Award’ because she thinks it is great to acknowledge the work of others; “Often this work is done without reward, whilst the nominees do this work without expectation, it is wonderful to be part of highlighting these individuals”. Along with her panel of judges, Tomi selected Becky Trueman and Katie Long as the finalists. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite all of the fantastic work Becky has done to create a supportive environment for her team, she remarked that she was “surprised [to be nominated], and to be honest did not feel deserving, as much of [her] work to create a more inclusive environment has been done with others. I want to acknowledge the many incredible individuals I&apos;ve had the privilege to collaborate with in my inclusivity work, as well as those whose open conversations, social media posts, books, and other media have made me consider my own biases. A significant number of these have been women from minoritised groups, whose contributions have been instrumental in driving progress in this area. As we continue to work to improve inclusion for women in our field, it’s crucial to recognise the importance of intersectionality. Different groups experience unique and often compounded barriers to advancement, and we must be mindful of these nuances.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I would not be here if it was not for the work of others, and to name a few key people:  Errolinda Ward, who started the inclusive curricula project within my School; Yvonne Mbaki and Rakesh Patel, who led our faculty toolkit; and the fantastic Emily Sena, University of Edinburgh, who suggested we approach the BNA when I was discussing resources for decolonising Neuroscience teaching with her. And all the teams who worked with me on these projects, along with the groups of students who have helped co-create resources”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie was really grateful to be nominated for the ‘Inclusive Workplace Development Award’: “I’m very lucky to have the support from my colleagues, mentors and team to help make our environment more inclusive, and to have seen some fantastic examples of improving inclusivity, diversity and accessibility of science, many of them driven by amazing women that I work with. They are an incredibly inspiring group and I hope together we can continue to help show that science is a space for everyone”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam made the decision to be Head Judge for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because she “fully supports the work of WiNUK and thought it was an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of some outstanding female neuroscientists and provide greater visibility for them and their work”. Kam and the rest of the judges selected Jo, Hilary and Emma as the finalists.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Jo remarked that she was “Delighted!” to be nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’, explaining that she “had no idea [she] had been nominated - the first I heard was when I received an invitation to the awards ceremony saying I’d been short-listed. I’m incredibly grateful to those who took the time out of their busy lives to put me forward.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary also felt “grateful and honoured [to be nominated]! I’m so lucky to work with my team”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As did Emma, who was “really happy and appreciative of the effort of a nomination” and “was excited to meet other people through the network too”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It was great to hear from the judges and finalists for these incredibly important categories. Congratulations again to Rebecca Trueman and Joanne Jones for your wins. What a fantastic group of women, who all deserve to be celebrated - we can’t wait to see what all of you go on to do next!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We will be featuring winners of our WiNUK 2024 award categories in interview pieces throughout 2025, so keep your eyes peeled for some exciting chats! And who knows, maybe there will be a 2025 WiNUK Awards Event?! Who might you nominate?</span></span></p>
