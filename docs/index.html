<p>The chief executive of a university in Eastern India whose research is full of <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/01/bosom-peril-is-not-breast-cancer-how-weird-computer-generated-phrases-help-researchers-find-scientific-publishing-fraud/">tortured phrases</a> – possible signs of plagiarism – had two papers pulled in December after investigations found evidence of “compromised” peer review and other red flags in the publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A third article by the executive, Amiya Kumar Rath, has also come under scrutiny, a publisher told us.</p>



<p>Rath<a href="https://www.bput.ac.in/vice-chancellor.html"> became vice chancellor</a> of Biju Patnaik University of Technology in Rourkela in 2023. A computer scientist with <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7006690086">more than 100</a> publications, he is listed as the second author of one of the now-withdrawn works, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-020-01865-8">a 2020 review article</a> on inspecting and grading fruits using machine learning.</p>



<span id="more-132789"></span>



<p>Two years after the review was published in Springer Nature’s <em>Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing</em>, another computer scientist, <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a>,<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7F3E585105065432F331BF9D951D78"> flagged it on PubPeer</a>. As Cabanac pointed out, the paper contained several odd wordings for well-known scientific concepts, like “fluffy rationale” instead of “fuzzy logic.” Such tortured phrases can be a sign authors have tried to avoid plagiarism detection by using paraphrasing software.</p>



<p>How the strange language slipped through peer review is not clear, but <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-020-01865-8">the retraction notice</a> offers clues. “The article was submitted to be part of a guest-edited issue,” the notice states. “An investigation by the publisher found a number of articles, including this one, with a number of concerns, including but not limited to compromised editorial handling and peer review process, inappropriate or irrelevant references or not being in scope of the journal or guest-edited issue.”</p>



<p>The review has been cited 63 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Springer Nature told us the problematic special issue was titled “Social &amp; Privacy Computing in Intelligent Social System,” but would not share the guest editor’s name “owing to confidentiality considerations.”</p>



<p>Rath did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S2049642720000068">The other retracted article</a>, on a type of network management called software-defined networking in the cloud, was part of a <a href="https://www.emerald.com/ijius/issue/8/4">2020 special issue</a> of the <em>International Journal of Intelligent Unmanned Systems</em>. Rath was one of two authors of the work.</p>



<p>The paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250910183251/https://www.emerald.com/ijius/issue/8/4">does not show as retracted</a> on the publisher’s new platform, Emerald Insight, and elsewhere. But Laura Etchells, head of research integrity at the company, told us all of the articles in the special issue “were actually retracted due to an investigation that uncovered evidence that the peer review process had been compromised.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper on grading fruits is not the only work by the vice chancellor that is plagued by tortured phrases. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-5971-6_1">One of his conference papers</a> contains <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C0EA0CF20C347C307E298731536597">the weird phrases</a> “underground creepy crawly state” – <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03621-0/index.html#section-gM9iO4XBRl">presumably a paraphrased version</a> of “ant colony” – and “counterfeit honey bee state,” for “artificial bee colony.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920307742?via%3Dihub">An article</a> Rath published in Elsevier’s <em>Procedia Computer Science</em> in 2020<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1B2DCE412BEB1BEA70E6EC3BF289EB#0"> also contains several</a> strange phrases, such as “limit esteem” instead of “threshold value,” according to an anonymous PubPeer post from 2023. In many places the paper is close to unintelligible, with such mangled sentences as, “Image segmentation meant way toward sectioning default image into its tremendous sections or objects.”</p>



<p>That paper has been cited <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920307742?via%3Dihub#section-cited-by">126 times</a>, according to the publisher, and is still in circulation more than two years after it was flagged. Three of its four authors also appear on the byline of the fruit-grading article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier told us, “The journal was not aware of any concerns regarding the publication; an investigation has now been initiated.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a side-by-side comparison shows large parts of the article, garbled language and all, overlaps verbatim with yet another paper –<a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1444587/v1"> a preprint from 2022</a> by a different group of researchers in India. An online plagiarism checker <a href="https://app.copyleaks.com/dashboard/v1/report/c6uivj1t9cdmbqwy/preview?key=mwwkg2meir2o9ve8&amp;suspectId=79b4bc64d0&amp;viewMode=one-to-one&amp;contentMode=html&amp;sourcePage=1&amp;suspectPage=1&amp;showAIPhrases=false">determined nearly half of the text</a> in the preprint was identical to passages in Rath’s paper.</p>

                <p>Scholarly communication is transforming more rapidly than ever before. Policy, community norms and technology are all reshaping the ways in which we think about how research is shared and evaluated. While some of these factors offer promising new avenues&ndash;growing open science culture, new platforms and tools&ndash; the ever-present challenge for scholarly communication is to evolve&nbsp;in ways that make the most of these benefits while upholding integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peer review plays a foundational role in shaping scientific knowledge, but often isn&rsquo;t the focus when we talk about innovation in research communication. We believe openness throughout the research process, including during peer review, is important to not only increase transparency, but to support more flexible and integrated forms of knowledge sharing.</p>



<p>Open peer review comes in different forms such as signed reviews, publicly available peer review reports and ways of opening the peer review process to a wider pool of experts. This Peer Review Week we take a look back at our long-standing commitment to make the peer review process more transparent and a new initiative that brings open peer review to preprints for authors submitting to <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Linking peer review to preprints&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In a new pilot supported by the <a href="https://plos.org/gates-foundation-partnership/">Gates Foundation</a>, authors submitting to <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> can now opt in to have their peer review comments posted to their preprint as their manuscript undergoes formal evaluation. This initiative brings together two key strands of our open science strategy: encouraging preprint sharing and promoting transparent peer review.</p>



<p>Why does this matter? While many publishers support preprints and/or offer some form of transparent peer review, linking official peer reviewer reports to preprints is a novel approach to opening up more of the research publishing process.</p>



<p>Preprints offer an important pathway&nbsp; for rapid dissemination, especially in fields like global health where timely access to research can have real-world impact. By linking peer review comments to preprints, we&rsquo;re enabling readers to benefit from expert evaluations earlier in the research lifecycle. This approach also signals when a preprint has undergone peer review, enhancing trust and surfacing the full scholarly conversation around the work.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re also eager to learn from this pilot: What motivates authors to share their reviews? How do readers engage with peer-reviewed preprints? The answers will help shape the future of how we can support open science beyond the traditional article format.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our continuing efforts to open peer review</h2>



<p>Open peer review is essential to a healthy research ecosystem. It promotes accountability and reduces potential for bias, by making the evaluation process visible. It supports integrity by surfacing the expert assessment that underpins the evaluation of research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are continually innovating to understand how we can make peer review more open, efficient, and recognized for its importance. In 2019, we launched Published Peer Review History, allowing authors to opt in to share their complete peer review reports combining reviewer comments and editorial decisions alongside their published articles. We&rsquo;ve long supported reviewers who wish to sign their reviews, and integrate with tools like ORCID to enable reviewer credit even for anonymous reviews. We encourage editors to consider preprint comments as part of the peer review process across all our journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS has partnered with <a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</a> since 2020 to provide a journal-agnostic, high-quality peer review service for authors of preprints in bioRxiv and medRxiv who wish to submit to our life sciences journals. Earlier this year we also announced a new partnership between <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/08/plos-biology-announces-agreement-to-become-a-metaror-partner-journal/"><em>PLOS Biology</em> and MetaROR</a> to consider reviews that accompany submissions of metaresearch that have already been evaluated on the site.This partnership builds on the journal&rsquo;s <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/PCIRegisteredReports/about/pci_rr_interested_journals">collaboration with PCI-Registered Reports</a> and other <a href="https://genomics.peercommunityin.org/about/pci_friendly_journals">PCI communities</a>, as well as its existing commitment to portable peer review, which allows authors to submit reviews from previous submissions to other journals to expedite editorial decisions and reduce strain on the reviewer pool.</p>



<p>These practices reflect our belief that transparency in peer review fosters trust, accountability, efficiency, and a richer scholarly dialogue. But openness is a journey, not a destination. As the means of sharing research evolves beyond the article, so too must our approaches to peer review. As we continue to innovate, we remain committed to listening and learning from researchers, maintaining open dialogue to ensure that we build solutions that advance open science while remaining tailored to the needs of our authors and contributors. </p>

                <p>TeX Live 2025 is now available in the arXiv submission process.</p>
<p><strong>What is TeX Live?</strong></p>
<p>TeX Live is a free distribution of the TeX typesetting system that includes many TeX-related programs, fonts, and macros packages, including LaTeX, maintained by a core group of TeX users and the TeX User Group.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for my arXiv submission? Do I have to use TeX Live 2025?</strong></p>
<p>With the introduction of TeX Live 2025, users can expect enhanced performance, improved compatibility, and updated packages including ones that better support tagging for accessibility.</p>
<p>arXiv currently supports both TeX Live 2023 and TeX Live 2025, and you may choose either for your submission. You will be presented with this choice during the submission process, and your submission will be processed automatically based on the processer you select – make sure to carefully check and verify the resulting PDF before completing your submission to make sure there are no errors or compilation issues.</p>
<p>We have made note of the most common errors we have seen in the set of current submissions using TeX Live 2025 <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit_tex.html#supported-processors">here</a>, and there is further information at the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/tex-live-2025-is-now-available">Overleaf TeX Live announcement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any other changes to the arXiv submission process?</strong></p>
<p>We recently upgrade to “Submission 1.5” which you can read about <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/09/10/attention-authors-submission-1-5-and-other-updates/">here</a>. arXiv is always evaluating how we process LaTeX and how the submission process can be improved for authors. We have planned changes to add more TeX processors and other upgrades in the near future – keep an eye on this space for updates!</p>
<p><b>Will you support TeX Live 2026 when it becomes available?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a part of Submission 1.5, arXiv intends to closely track TeX Live annual releases going forward. It should be noted that we will only be offering the two most recent versions of TeX Live (the most recent release, and the immediately previous version). For example, when TeX Live 2026 becomes available, submitters will be given the choice of TeX Live 2025 or TeX Live 2026, and TeX Live 2023 will no longer be offered as an option during the submission process. It’s always a good idea to compile your papers with the latest versions of LaTeX tools and packages.</span></p>
<p><strong>Help! I’m having issues using TeX Live 2025 with my submission.</strong></p>
<p>If you have questions or issues with your submission, be sure to first check <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit_tex.html">our help pages</a> that lay out the common issues we are currently seeing. You can also <a href="https://arxiv-org.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1">submit a help ticket</a> for more support, or leave a comment below if you have suggestions for improving the arXiv submission process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/09/10/attention-authors-submission-1-5-and-other-updates/">Attention Authors: Submission 1.5 and other updates</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv authors – notice anything new? Say hello (if you haven’t already) to Submission 1.5!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv has been hard at work updating and streamlining our submission process. This is a part of the work that we are doing to improve arXiv and ensure that the technology that upholds arXiv and open science is modern, stable, and able to scale sustainably in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This update to arXiv’s submission process has <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2024/04/18/major-changes-coming-to-arxivs-latex-processing/">been in the works since mid-2024</a>, when we first decided it was time to retire our legacy system (Submission 1.0), the famous arXiv-developed “AutoTeX” system.</span></p>
<p><b>Why and how did arXiv update from Submission 1.0 to Submission 1.5?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal in retiring AutoTeX is to provide a simpler, more straightforward, and better documented submission process for arXiv users. Submission 1.5 was first rolled out as an option for a small percentage of arXiv test users this past spring, allowing our dev team to catch any potential issues while causing the least amount of disruption to arXiv submissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submission 1.5 was eventually expanded as an available choice to 50% of arXiv users, then 100% of arXiv users. Once Submission 1.5 was successfully deployed to all arXiv users this summer, we then officially retired Submission 1.0 / AutoTeX, with Submission 1.5 now the stand-alone default for nearly all submissions. (While AutoTeX is now retired for new submissions, submissions previously processed with AutoTeX / arXiv’s legacy submission system will continue to be recompiled with AutoTeX, unless an author chooses to replace and compile with the newer TeX engines).</span></p>
<p><b>What are the changes and benefits of Submission 1.5?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Submission 1.5, arXiv will only use the most current version of TeX to convert files, which we will closely track to the annual TeX live releases. While arXiv used AutoTeX for decades to convert (La)TeX submissions to PDFs, much of the work AutoTeX did “behind the scenes” was poorly documented and the results were sometimes surprising to authors. The changes instituted with Submission 1.5 allow authors more transparency and control during submission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submission 1.5 . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. . . makes the submission process technically faster by reducing the amount of guesswork the system needs to make while processing files</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. . . provides better feedback to arXiv users during the submission process, allowing authors to see in real-time when there are issues with their TeX</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. . . makes future recompilation of work easier by providing clear instructions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. . . provides a better technical foundation to support future upgrades, such as TeX Live updates and additional TeX processors</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read more about Submission 1.5 changes<a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit_tex.html#newtex"> here</a>.</span></p>
<p><b>Are any more changes coming to arXiv Submission?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with Submission 1.5, <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/09/10/tex-live-2025-on-arxiv/">TeX Live 2025</a> is also now available during the arXiv submission process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv continually assesses and re-examines our submission and (La)TeX processing, and more upgrades are on the way! Be on the lookout for future updates, such as bib –&gt; bbl processing, as well support for other TeX processors, which will be announced here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll also keep arXiv users informed on the next upgrade to Submission 2.0, which is tentatively scheduled for 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope these changes will make for a better author and viewing experience. If you have suggestions, questions, or concerns, leave a comment on this post! Feedback is always welcome.</span></p>

<p>An Elsevier journal has retracted a paper coauthored by a deputy department chair at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and says it plans to retract at least two more of his articles for image-related concerns.</p>



<p>The 2022 paper, in <em>Matrix Biology</em>, describes the regulatory role of proteoglycans in remodeling of the cervix during pregnancy. According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0945053X25000678">the August 12 retraction notice</a>, 18 of the image panels were duplicates. The paper has been cited 18 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jefferson.edu/academics/colleges-schools-institutes/life-sciences/faculty-staff/faculty/iozzo.html">Renato Iozzo</a>, deputy chair of Pathology, Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology at Jefferson, is a coauthor on the study. Neither Iozzo nor corresponding author <a href="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/14546/mala-mahendroo.html">Mala Mahendroo</a>, a researcher at UT Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<span id="more-132778"></span>



<p>The paper was first flagged <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0CCB0A34B1A2D2DD959C583833D36A">on PubPeer in May</a> in a comment noting panels in two different figures were “more similar than expected.” That same month, pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis sent the journal PubPeer comments for that paper and several others coauthored by Iozzo that had been flagged for image problems, according to correspondence Retraction Watch has seen. Three of the articles were published in <em>Matrix Biology</em>.</p>



<p>According to the retraction notice, Mahendroo “acknowledged the image duplications, unequal image sizing, and reuse of images for multiple genotypes” and said “multiple images were generated … from three biological samples.” Although the authors provided corrected images, the notice stated, the editorial team had “lost confidence in the reliability of the findings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[A]pologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process,” the notice continues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails from editor-in-chief Joanne Murphy-Ullrich to Francis that we have seen, at least two other papers by the same authors will be retracted.</p>



<p>One of them is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2017.04.002">2017 paper</a> describing a glycoprotein’s role in angiogenesis that <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1191C03797150B6E4F505D2E5F84E2">was also flagged</a> on PubPeer in May for image duplication and has been cited 59 times.</p>



<p>The corresponding author is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maurizio-mongiat-2a80956/?originalSubdomain=it">Maurizio Mongiat</a>, a <a href="https://research.jefferson.edu/labs/researcher/iozzo-laboratory/team.html">former researcher</a> at Iozzo’s lab, who is currently affiliated with the <a href="https://www.cro.sanita.fvg.it/it/">Oncology Referral Center</a> in Aviano, Italy. Mongiat did not respond to multiple email requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbplus.2020.100029">second article</a>, from 2020, looks at a glycoprotein’s role in gastric cancer and was published in <em>Matrix Biology Plus</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/matrix-biology-plus">a companion title</a> to <em>Matrix Biology</em> that is not indexed in Web of Science. The paper had problems with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9FF57B7D611B428924DB2816CF6C02">two panels that contained unexpected similarities</a>, according to the PubPeer comments.</p>



<p>Murphy-Ullrich, who is also editor-in-chief of <em>Matrix Biology Plus,</em> told Francis on May 11 figures in the 2020 paper “look flipped,” adding, “We will raise this with the authors.” She copied Elsevier publisher Lynn Sherrer on her email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a July 12 email, Murphy-Ullrich added the journal “ran our own forensics and uncovered additional issues” in Iozzo’s papers beyond the issues flagged on PubPeer. “We have now notified the authors of 3 of the articles that we have decided to retract these articles,” she wrote.</p>



<p>The emails also stated <em>Matrix Biology</em> planned to correct a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2020.10.001">2021 paper</a> that was <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F37F966B400000944CF760D2282F8C">flagged</a> on PubPeer. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0945053X2500068X?via%3Dihub">The correction</a> was posted on August 16. </p>



<p>An Elsevier spokesperson told us the publisher was still investigating the papers.</p>



<p>More of Iozzo’s works have been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=renato+iozzo">flagged on PubPeer</a> for image issues, including a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27220888/">2016 article</a> in <em>Oncotarget</em> that was <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/28657/pdf/">corrected last October</a>. And in 2019, Iozzo <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215889">lost a paper</a> for duplication, according to the <em>PLOS One</em> retraction notice. He and the other authors of the paper disagreed with the retraction.</p>



<p><em>Update, September 11, 2025: This story was updated to clarify the &#8220;additional issues&#8221; were in the same papers flagged on PubPeer, not additional papers. We also updated the story to state the correction on the 2021 paper was posted on August 16. </em></p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="635" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb-1024x635.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132769" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb-1024x635.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb-300x186.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb-768x476.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Earlier this year, China’s supreme court said companies selling fake or low-quality research papers<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00612-3"> should be punished</a>. But shady middlemen there continue to offer questionable deals to journal editors across the globe in a bid to secure publications for their customers, emails obtained by Retraction Watch suggest.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-email-journal-european-mathematical-society.pdf">the emails</a>, sent between May and August and using the same boilerplate language, the Nanjing-based agency A-Techo said it would pay an “expedited processing fee” of $500 to $1,000 US “per accepted manuscript to support the review process.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250905064909/https://a-techo.org/">its website</a>, the company provides various types of publication support. Signatures in the correspondence we obtained listed different names of purported assistant editors, who said they were “writing on behalf of an academic institution that supports Ph.D. researchers and faculty in publishing high-quality research.”</p>



<span id="more-132767"></span>



<p>Some journals allow authors to pay a fee to fast-track the editorial processing of their manuscripts. But when A-Techo’s proposition landed in the inbox of<a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~agricola/"> Ilka Agricola</a>, an editor of the <em>Journal of the European Mathematical Society</em>, she had no doubt about the underlying motive.</p>



<p>“It was clear to me that the ‘fast-track fee’ was a euphemism for ‘bribe,’” she told us, adding that fast-tracking is “unheard of” in mathematics. “The offer was to accept a low-quality paper for money, which would never have been accepted otherwise, in the hope that nobody would notice.”</p>



<p>Agricola, a professor at the Philipp University of Marburg, in Germany, and chair of the International Mathematical Union’s Committee on Publishing, said the entire editorial boards ”of at least two journals” had received emails from A-Techo within “a few days.”</p>



<p>”I was outraged by how brazen some of the fraudsters in this business have become, and so were my colleagues,” she told us.</p>



<p>A-Techo also targeted journals in environmental conservation science and political science with similar offers, according to emails we have seen.</p>



<p>Bribery <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fakin-it-modern-way">is nothing new</a> in academic publishing. A joint investigation by Retraction Watch and <em>Science Magazine</em> last year found a paper mill in China had<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds"> paid tens of thousands of dollars in kickbacks</a> to international editors who accepted its manuscripts. And in December, we wrote about a journal editor in the United States who had received a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/12/bribery-offers-from-china-rattle-journal-editors-are-they-being-scammed/">bribery offer</a> that also appeared to come from China. A sting by an academic and a blogger earlier this year provided more detail about <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2025/05/19/a-sting-inside-a-papermill/">how these furtive agencies operate</a>.</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250905064909/https://a-techo.org/">its website</a>, A-Techo, sometimes written A-Tech, appears to be a full-fledged paper mill, offering “End-to-end support for your publication journey, from manuscript preparation to post-publication promotion.” But there are several red flags. For instance, the site uses stock images purporting to be of staff. It also features dubious testimonials from happy customers such as ”Dr. Sarah Johnson,” who is described as a ”research scientist” at Stanford University. At least one real person with a Ph.D. is named Sarah Johnson and works as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford, but she told us she had never used A-Techo’s services and the image provided was not of her. A Google Lens search showed it was also a stock photo.</p>



<p>Reached for comment at its Nanjing number, a representative of the firm who identified himself only as ”John” said, ”What we&#8217;re actually looking for is that some journals offer some expeditious [sic] review.”</p>



<p>He said the company was “not looking for” editors “to just accept our papers or something,” but simply wanted to know if the journals had “some system that they can review the papers faster.”</p>



<p>But last year,<a href="https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=1076"> David Wood</a>, a professor at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, who edits several accounting journals, had an exchange on LinkedIn suggesting A-Techo’s tactics are less savory than the company would like them to appear.</p>



<p>As Wood<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidawood_edited-the-university-listed-in-this-and-activity-7270870295312265216-FPpK/"> wrote in the LinkedIn post</a> in December, he was contacted by an individual whose profile described him as a research assistant at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.</p>



<p>”We do not want to submit articles through the traditional process. We seek confirmation that our articles will be accepted by your journal, as we have many manuscripts ready for submission,” the person told Wood. ”For each article, we will pay an additional expedited review fee of 1,000 USD( Can be negotiate).”</p>



<p>Wood also included the text of one of the LinkedIn posts from the person who had contacted him, a ”Mizanur Rashid”: “I’m reaching out on behalf of a cultural exchange organization [&#8230;] that has helped over 18,000 research articles from top Chinese universities get published in respected journals worldwide,” the post began. “We’re looking to partner with journal editors to publish high-quality research across different fields.”</p>



<p>The domain name of the contact email address provided was “a-techo.org.”</p>



<p>”Pay-to-publish schemes taint not only the perception of objectivity but very likely objectivity itself,” Wood told us. ”Such providers should work with journal owners, not individual editors. Journal owners can then decide what is best for their journals and communicate that policy transparently to all members. There should be no back-office deals that give one group an unfair advantage over another.”</p>



<p>As Wood noted in an update on LinkedIn, both Rashid and Nanjing University later contacted him to say Rashid’s account had been ”hijacked” by ”someone not associated with the” institution.</p>



<p>Asked for comment on Wood’s post, A-Techo’s “John” said he hadn&#8217;t heard about it and asked for more information. We sent several emails with links to the post and also messaged the company on WhatsApp, but never received a response.</p>



<p>Whether for-profit publishing, in particular charging publication fees, is inherently <a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224">at odds with good science</a> has long been a matter of debate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“However, accepting papers in exchange for a fee without peer review compromises the integrity of scholarly publishing and disregards established peer review practices within the research community, regardless of the review model applied,” said Loreta Tauginienė of Kaunas University of Technology, in Lithuania, editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Academic Ethics.</em></p>



<p>Tauginienė, who is also a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics Council, told us “legal measures against paper mills should be envisaged. Precedents for such practice already exist; for example, administrative penalties are imposed on paper mills in Lithuania, and their websites are banned in Australia.”</p>
