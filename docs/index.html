<p>The Lancet today retracted two papers by former Karolinska Institutet surgeon Paolo Macchiarini, whose professional and personal escapades have made headlines for more than a decade and who has been <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/transplant-surgeon-gets-prison-sentence-failed-stem-cell-treatments">sentenced to 30 months in prison for causing bodily harm to his patients</a>.</p>



<p>The move comes a month after Sweden’s National Board for Assessment of Misconduct (NPOF in Swedish) said it had <a href="https://npof.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Decision-in-case-3.2-22-0092_web.pdf">found Macchiarini guilty of misconduct</a> involving the two articles, eight months after the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/13/five-years-on-convicted-transplant-surgeon-earns-expressions-of-concern-from-lancet/">issued expressions of concern for the two papers</a>, and five years after Macchiarini had already been found to have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/07/06/the-final-verdict-lancet-retracts-two-papers-by-macchiarini/">committed misconduct in related work</a>.</p>



<p>As we reported in February:</p>



<span id="more-128124"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the first paper, published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61598-6/fulltext">2008</a>, Macchiarini and his colleagues reported how they implanted a cadaveric windpipe seeded with stem cells into a 30-year-old woman; in the second, from <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62033-4/fulltext#section-7c530872-6235-4433-899c-b3f276970189">2013</a>, they described how the patient fared over the next five years. Despite needing repeated bronchoscopic interventions, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62033-4/fulltext">the authors wrote</a>, she “had a normal social and working life.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the woman described in the 2008 report suffered multiple complications, including respiratory failure, and had to have surgery to remove her left lung, according to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30485-4/fulltext">a 2019 Lancet report</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction notice for “Clinical transplantation of a tissue-engineered airway” <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext">reads</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After The Lancet issued two Expressions of concern in February, 2023 <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#">1</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#">2</a> for the original case description <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#bib3">3</a> and the 5-year follow-up Article, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#bib4">4</a> the investigation by the Swedish National Board for Assessment of Research Misconduct <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#bib5">5</a> into the 5-year follow-up paper has led us to retract this paper.<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#bib6">6</a> During that investigation, it was confirmed that a stent was inserted in the patient&#8217;s trachea less than 4 months after the operation. The Swedish National Board for Assessment of Research Misconduct <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#bib5">5</a> found that the statement made in that Article<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#bib4">4</a> that a “4-month follow-up showed no complications” and that omitting information that a stent was inserted constitutes falsification. Similarly, the statement in the original report<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#bib3">3</a> that “the graft immediately provided the recipient with a functional airway, improved her quality of life, and had a normal appearance and mechanical properties at 4 months” would also constitute falsification.<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02341-3/fulltext#bib5">5</a> We are, therefore, also retracting the Article of the original case description.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And the retraction notice for “The first tissue-engineered airway transplantation: 5-year follow-up results” reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Further to the two Expressions of concern The Lancet issued in February, 2023 <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02340-1/fulltext#">1</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02340-1/fulltext#">2</a> for the Article presenting the 5-year follow-up results<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02340-1/fulltext#bib3">3</a> of the case of tissue-engineered transplantation, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02340-1/fulltext#bib4">4</a> the Swedish National Board for Assessment of Research Misconduct <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02340-1/fulltext#bib5">5</a> has concluded in an investigation into this paper that it “contains fabrication and falsification in several places, and three falsified figures (4, 5 and 6C)”. We are therefore now retracting this Article<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02340-1/fulltext#bib3">3</a> together with the original description of this case. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02340-1/fulltext#bib6">6</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retractions are the third and fourth for Macchiarini from The Lancet, which has faced criticism for many years for how long it took to retract the fraudulent paper by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/09/29/the-doctor-who-fooled-the-world-an-excerpt-from-brian-deers-new-book-about-andrew-wakefield/">Andrew Wakefield and colleagues that has been used as evidence that vaccines cause autism</a>.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Patricia Murray and Peter Wilmshurst, who have been <a href="https://drpeterwilmshurst.wordpress.com/2022/09/25/is-the-lancet-complicit-in-research-fraud/">chronicling the problems in Macchiarini’s work for years</a>, and were among those <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o498">calling in the BMJ</a> for the retraction of one of the now-retracted papers last year, told Retraction Watch they welcomed the decision to retract:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are concerned that the decision to retract the fraudulent articles has taken more than 5 years since the Lancet received irrefutable evidence that the original 2008 paper made false claims and as a result the 2014 paper was also false. The Lancet ignored requests from doctors, scientists and the chairs of the UK Parliament’s Science and Technology Committee and Health and Social Care Committee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a comment we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/For-retraction-watch.doc">make available in full here</a>, they continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Again the Lancet’s reputation for correcting the scientific record has been harmed. Some may wonder which other articles in the Lancet the editors are failing to retract when they know they are false.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And, they said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The wider concern is that other senior authors on the 2008 paper and their institutions have known for some years that the article is false.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Murray and Wilmshurst referred specifically to co-author Martin Birchall, formerly of University of Bristol and now at University College London, who they said “continued to perform tracheal transplants using the original false Macchiarini-Birchall technique after Macchiarini stopped doing so.”</p>



<p>They conclude:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It may be no coincidence that while UCL has repeatedly refused to get Birchall to retract the paper, he and his colleagues have been awarded massive grants from public funds to extend the research in this flawed technology at UCL.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Macchiarini’s story – which also includes his romantically <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/celebrity-surgeon-nbc-news-producer-scam">scamming an NBC producer</a> – has spawned <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/12/meet-the-filmmakers-who-cracked-open-the-case-against-star-surgeon-macchiarini/">multiple documentaries</a>, a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/dr-death-season-2-mandy-moore-edgar-ramirez-1235623662/">fictional dramatization</a>, and even <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/lyrical-liar-inside-swedens-macchiarini-inspired-opera">an opera</a>. He first came to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/11/26/misconduct-leads-to-retraction-from-italian-super-surgeon-under-house-arrest/">our attention in 2012</a>.</p>

<p>A diabetes researcher who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/08/19/judge-dismisses-defamation-suit-against-diabetes-journal/">lost a defamation suit</a> against a journal that marked four of his papers with expressions of concern now has four more papers flagged – by the same journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Diabetes</em>, a journal of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), placed expressions of concern on four papers led or co-authored by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-author/mario-saad/">Mario Saad</a>, of the University of Campinas (Unicamp) in Brazil on October 23.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saad sued the ADA in 2015 after <em>Diabetes</em> marked four other papers with similar notices. A judge dismissed the suit, and the journal later <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/24/lawsuit-couldnt-stop-four-retractions-for-diabetes-researcher-who-also-added-two-expressions-of-concern/">retracted the papers</a> (for which <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/05/dirt-award-cleaning-scientific-literature/">we recognized them</a> with a DiRT — Doing the Right Thing — award). Saad is now up to 19 retractions, by <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSaad%252c%2bMario%2bJose%2bAbdalla">our count</a>.&nbsp;</p>

The expressions of concern identify the same images as problematic, either containing a “panel duplication” or appearing “unexpectedly similar” to images in other papers from the same lab.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-new-deep-sea-coral-reefs-galapagos">See the wonders of two newfound deep-sea coral reefs off the Galápagos</a></h4>

              
                <p>Four decades ago, warm waters from an El Niño event killed off nearly all the corals surrounding the Galápagos. Most coral reefs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gal%C3%A1pagos-waters-preview-future-corals">never recovered</a> (<em>SN: 1/9/15</em>). But in recent months, researchers have discovered vast landscapes of thriving corals in deeper waters surrounding the equatorial islands.</p>



<p>In April, scientists documented the <a href="https://www.darwinfoundation.org/en/blog-articles/887-scientists-discover-pristine-deep-sea-coral-reefs-in-the-galapagos-marine-reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first pristine deep coral reef</a> found in the region, dubbed Cacho De Coral, which sits atop the ridge of an underwater volcano and stretches about 250 meters. On October 26, a second team announced the discovery of an even bigger reef, this one more than 800 meters long, spanning the length of eight football fields. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With coral reefs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-ocean-heat-florida-climate-change">around the globe in peril</a> due to climate change, the finds are a small piece of good news (<em>SN: 8/9/23</em>). These newfound reefs within the Galápagos Islands Marine Reserve have so far been protected from human influence and the direct impacts of warming waters.</p>

<p>The newest reef was discovered when oceanographer Stuart Banks and colleagues set out on a 30-day expedition to explore parts of the ocean using a remotely operated robot named SuBastian. While in the Galápagos Islands Marine Reserve, which included a visit to Cacho De Coral, the team spotted a second reef.</p>



<p>“It’s like coming into your house and realizing that you’ve got a basement that you never knew was there,” says Banks, of the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos. “And it’s full of really cool stuff.”</p>





<p>The newly identified reefs are in cold waters up to 420 meters below the surface, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, a nonprofit based in Palo Alto, Calif., that operates ocean research vessels, announced in a news release. Such a location probably helped corals living there remain pristine. Unlike corals that flourish in warm, shallow water with lots of sunlight to fuel symbiotic algae, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nearly-200-great-barrier-reef-coral-species-also-live-deep-sea">deep-sea corals survive in darker parts of the ocean</a> that don’t warm up as quickly under climate change (<em>SN: 12/11/18</em>).</p>



<p>It’s rare to find so much living coral in one spot, and scientists often need to get close to glimpse everything that’s hiding inside rocky reefs, Banks says. “Seeing these things for the first time is always a big ‘wow.’”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-cancer-cells-bacteria-viruses-energy">Human cancer cells might slurp up bacteria-killing viruses for energy</a></h4>

              
                <p>From our nose to our lungs to our guts, the human body is home to a diverse range of microorganisms. Such rich microbial ecosystems are prime hunting grounds for viruses that infect and kill bacteria. But how these bacteria-killing viruses interact with human cells has remained mysterious.</p>



<p>Past research has shown that human cells can slurp up bacteria-killing viruses when a cell ingests a large amount of the fluid surrounding it. Microbiologist Jeremy Barr wanted to know if the ingested viruses have any effect on the cell’s immune response.</p>





<p>To his surprise, Barr instead found that <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mammalian cancer cells grown in the lab use the viruses as a food source</a>. The results, published in the Oct. 26 <em>PLOS Biology</em>, show that it’s possible for mammalian cells to use bacteria-killing viruses as fuel — meaning normal, noncancerous cells could do it too, though this remains to be seen.</p>



<p>This nascent line of work upends traditional biological dogma, says Barr of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “You&#8217;re told that [phages] just do not interact with mammalian cells,” he says. “And that&#8217;s completely false. They do.”</p>



<p>Bacteria-killing viruses, called bacteriophages, are ubiquitous in the human body. <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-virology-111821-111322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cells in our body ingest up to 30 billion phages each day</a>, Barr estimates. To test how the phages interact with mammalian cells, the researchers experimented with human and dog cancer cells, mainly because they are easy to cultivate in the lab. The team grew the cancer cells in an environment flush with bacteriophage T4, a common virus that preys on <em>E. coli</em>.</p>



<p>Barr’s team then used a battery of antibodies, each of which binds to a specific type of protein, to determine the proteins the cells made in response to the phage. Though the researchers expected to see more proteins involved in inflammation, part of the cell’s immune response, they instead saw changes in the amounts of proteins involved in cell growth and division. “Cells that had been given phage were actually growing at a faster rate,” Barr says. This suggests that “they&#8217;re using the phages as a food source.”</p>



<p>Because the cells used in this study were grown in a lab and come from established lines of cells used for research, we can’t yet be sure that cells in the bodies of humans and other mammals behave the same way, says Paul Bollyky, an immunologist at Stanford University. “Cell lines are funny creatures,” he says. “They do things energetically that are probably closer to tumor biology than to normal cell biology, so it can be difficult to extrapolate.”</p>



<p>Still, “this is a really exciting and trailblazing study from a group that&#8217;s doing excellent work,” Bollyky says. “Like a lot of good science, this study really raises questions.”</p>



<p>Barr says he next wants to investigate whether noncancerous cells derived from a living animal also snack on phages. He also plans to examine more phages, especially viruses that — like T4 — live in our guts, and others that are being used in phage therapy, where viruses are used instead of antibiotics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-virus-phage-shigellosis-arms-race">to kill infectious bacteria</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/21</em>). “We know they kill the bacterial hosts, but what are they doing to the human host?” Barr asks. “How do they interact?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-female-chimps-menopause">Surprisingly long-lived wild female chimps go through menopause</a></h4>

              
                <p>Female chimps living in an East African forest experience menopause and then survive years, even decades, after becoming biologically unable to reproduce.</p>



<p>The apes are the first known examples of wild, nonhuman primates to go through the fertility-squelching hormonal changes and live well beyond their reproductive years.</p>



<p>The finding <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add5473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raises new questions about how menopause evolved</a>, UCLA evolutionary anthropologist Brian Wood and colleagues conclude in the Oct. 27 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Until now, females who experience menopause and keep living for years have been documented only in humans and five whale species. It’s unclear what evolutionary benefit exists to explain such longevity past the point of being able to give birth and pass on one’s genes.</p>





<p>Although evolutionary explanations for menopause remain debatable, the new finding reflects an especially close genetic relationship between humans and chimps, Wood says. “Both [species] are more predisposed to post-reproductive survival than other great apes.”</p>



<p>Some evidence suggests that female fertility ends at similar ages in humans and chimps (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>) if our ape relatives live long enough, says anthropologist Kristen Hawkes of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. But in other studies, female chimps, such as those studied by Jane Goodall at Tanzania’s Gombe National Park starting in 1960, aged quickly and often died in their early 30s, usually while still having menstrual cycles, she says.</p>



<p>“What’s surprising [in Wood’s study] is so many females living so long after menopause,” Hawkes says.</p>



<p>Wood’s team examined mortality and fertility rates of 185 females in the Ngogo community of wild chimps in Kibale National Park in Uganda during field seasons that ran from 1995 through 2016. By first assessing chimps when they were young or middle-aged, the researchers were able to get an accurate read on the animals’ ages.</p>



<p>Hormonal measures of fertility declined after age 30, and the researchers observed no births in chimps older than 50. A total of 16 Ngogo females lived past age 50, some into their 60s. Urine samples taken from 66 Ngogo females, ages 14 to 67, revealed a decline in fertility starting after age 30 that terminated reproduction by around age 50. Menopause also results in an end to women’s reproduction at about age 50, Wood says.</p>



<p>In the Ngogo community, females, on average, live 20 percent of their adult years — defined as starting at age 14 — after having lost the ability to reproduce, the scientists estimate.</p>

<p>Wild chimps’ social lives do not fit a scenario, previously suggested by Hawkes and others, for the evolution of human menopause. Women, the idea goes, may live so long past their reproductive years because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grandmothers-survival-evolution">grandmothers provide vital care to their grandchildren</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/19</em>). But female chimps move to new communities from their native ones during adolescence. Grandmothers usually have no breeding daughters nearby whom they can assist.</p>



<p>Another possibility is that older female chimps may possess experience and knowledge necessary for group survival. Related evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-whales-follow-postmenopausal-leaders">older female killer whales often lead salmon hunts</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/15</em>).</p>



<p>Or, the researchers suggest, an absence of predation by leopards due to human hunting in the 1960s, plentiful food sources and successful competition with nearby chimp groups may have supported a temporary emergence of long life spans among Ngogo females. Similarly, female survival long beyond the reproductive years also occurs in chimps, and some other mammals, that are fed and protected from predators in zoos and other captive settings.</p>





<p>But responses of captive animals offer little insight into how menopause may have evolved in the wild, Wood says.</p>



<p>Ngogo chimps inhabit a forest that has been protected from logging and exposure to deadly respiratory infections carried by humans, perhaps aiding male and female chimp longevity, the researchers say. Male chimps in the group live about as long as females do. Menopause may have evolved in chimps living in relatively undisturbed settings, such as Kibale, due to young females migrating to new groups, Wood says. <a></a></p>



<p>After these moves, aging females having kids become increasingly related to other breeders of both sexes and their offspring. At advanced ages, females with local kin — perhaps in ancient human groups as well as chimp communities — evolved to stop reproducing so that young females bringing fresh genes to the community could conceive new generations, the team suggests.</p>



<p>But Duke University evolutionary biologist Susan Alberts doubts that females in a slow-reproducing species such as chimps become genetically related to enough individuals in a new group for that evolutionary scenario to have played out.</p>



<p>Instead, the unusually potent longevity-enhancing conditions for Ngogo chimps may enable females to display an evolved capacity for surviving well beyond the reproductive years, Alberts says.</p>



<p>Alberts and colleagues previously analyzed long-term reproductive data for seven nonhuman primate species — including chimps — and a population of African hunter-gatherers. Females in the nonhuman primate species could survive reproductive declines for a year or two, but lower death rates in hunter-gatherers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1311857110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulted in extended lives after menopause</a>, Alberts says. “Menopause may be a latent trait in primates that gets revealed as mortality rates decline,” she says.</p>



<p>Few wild chimp communities have been studied as thoroughly and for as long as the Ngogo crowd. That makes the new menopause findings tough to generalize to wild chimps living elsewhere. “We still don’t know much about most chimps’ lives,” Alberts says.</p>

<p>A controversial paper on the safety and immunogenicity of an Iran-made COVID-19 vaccine is being investigated by the U.S.-based publisher Wiley, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>Iran reportedly has already administered <a href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1101482/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85%DB%8C-%DB%B2-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85">3 million doses</a> of the vaccine, dubbed Noora, which the country <a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/470601/Noora-vaccine-receives-emergency-use-license">licensed for emergency use</a> last year.</p>



<p>The paper describes the vaccine’s first test in humans, marking the only time results from the clinical development of the homegrown shot have been reported in international journals.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28097">Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant receptor-binding domain-based protein subunit vaccine (Noora vaccine<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) against COVID-19 in adults: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial</a>” was published in 2022 in the <em>Journal of Medical Virology</em>, an achievement <a href="https://www.farsnews.ir/news/14010720000204/%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-2-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1">highlighted</a> in Iranian news media. One report said the study showed a dose of 80 micrograms of the vaccine was <a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/477532/Clinical-studies-of-Noora-vaccine-published-in-Medical-Virology">“safe” and provided “adequate immunity in adults.”</a> </p>



<span id="more-128108"></span>



<p>But in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28731">a commentary</a> published in May 2023, in the same journal, <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=2934">Donald Forthal</a>, chief of the University of California, Irvine&#8217;s Division of Infectious Diseases, expressed surprise that “a manuscript containing so many serious flaws would have been accepted for publication following peer review, and given these issues, a retraction may be in order.”</p>



<p>Among several problems, Forthal wrote, was that more than 80% of the placebo group had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, “which is very surprising and unexpected, and raises the possibility that occult COVID‐19 infections could have confounded the results across all cohorts.”</p>



<p>Forthal, who studies the immune response to viral infections, also raised doubts about the serum samples from convalescent patients, which were used as a benchmark to gauge the vaccine’s ability to elicit protective antibodies:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Who are the convalescent serum donors? If they are largely asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, or if they are months out from infection, the titers will be low, thereby providing a favorably biased comparator for the vaccine‐induced titers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The results overall also raise concern about the clinical efficacy of the Noora vaccine at preventing COVID‐19 infection in a population, as 60% (9/15) of recipients of the 80 mcg dose series developed virus‐neutralizing antibody titers of less than 1/16th the level observed in most of the convalescent serum samples tested. By contrast, the Novavax recombinant spike protein vaccine generated mean virus‐neutralizing antibody titers greater than fourfold that of symptomatic COVID‐19 outpatients.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Forthal also flagged “a systematic problem with the references, as many of the citations are incorrect and not relevant to the issue discussed.” And he said a glaring conflict of interest had not been stated: Several authors were employees of Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, in Iran, “which funded the study and has developed the vaccine for commercial purposes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, an anonymous commenter <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/179DB7875D6760293758F6CBD3900D">summarized Forthal’s concerns</a> on PubPeer, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The deficiencies in this publication raise serious questions about the effectiveness of the Noora vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection. More than four months after publication of the Letter to the Editor, there has been no published response from the authors of the original paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither the corresponding authors nor the university responded to requests for comments.</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson said the publisher was “aware of the concerns” and that an “investigation is currently ongoing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shou-Jiang Gao, the journal’s editor-in-chief, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Upon receiving the comments [from Forthal], the authors have submitted a &#8220;response&#8221; and it is currently under a third round of revision. </p>



<p>The original article had undergone rigorously [sic] review by experts of the field before it was published. In fact, it underwent 2 rounds of reviews, each with 2 reviewers. The &#8220;response&#8221; that the authors have submitted has already undergone 3 rounds of review, each with 2 reviewers. The last decision was made on October 24, 2023 and deadline for submitting the revision is November 23, 2023. So, we are waiting for the authors to submit the last revision before accepting and publishing it. This should fully address the issues that are raised.  </p>



<p>Dr. Donald Forthal has reached out to us many, many times and we have updated him the status [sic]. We believe this should go through a fair evaluation and peer review process, which takes some time. We ask you and him to be patient when this runs through the due review course.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Noora vaccine is among several COVID-19 vaccines available in Iran. Only the results of the phase 1 trial have been published in an international journal, but the vaccine reportedly has also undergone phase 2 and 3 testing and was found to be <a href="https://dolat.ir/detail/391516">94% effective</a>, according to Iranian health authorities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-squeezing-ligo-gravitational-waves">How quantum ‘squeezing’ will help LIGO detect more gravitational waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Putting the squeeze on light improves gravitational wave observatories.</p>



<p>An upgrade to one such observatory, LIGO, that comes from exploiting a quantum rule known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle makes it easier to spot spacetime ripples that arise from some of the cosmos’s most violent events.</p>



<p>As a result, LIGO should detect up to 65 percent <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/2507bK60Qb81c00f36d98e151e24c0cc4de92490e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more collisions between massive objects like black holes and neutron stars</a> than it would without the upgrade, researchers report in an upcoming issue of <em>Physical Review X</em>.</p>





<p>To look for gravitational waves, LIGO researchers rely on laser light that moves in a detector between mirrors placed four kilometers apart. But light is subject to a version of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that ensures the more you know about the intensity of a light signal, the less you know about its frequency. That limits how well researchers can spot gravitational waves.</p>



<p>In 2019, LIGO scientists turned to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-gravitational-wave-detector-quantum-upgrade">quantum “squeezing,”</a> which, in effect, reduced uncertainty in the laser’s frequency and increased uncertainty in its intensity (<em>SN: 2/15/19</em>). That allowed the researchers to turn up the laser’s power and improve LIGO’s ability to spot waves of higher frequencies. But turning the power up further would have made measuring lower-frequency waves harder by adding a low-frequency rumble to the signal.</p>



<p>The solution, described in the new study, was to use quantum squeezing to reduce uncertainty in the laser’s intensity at low frequencies, while reducing the frequency uncertainty in higher-frequency measurements.</p>



<p>Even next-generation gravitational wave observatories will benefit from the new result, says physicist Lisa Barsotti of MIT. “The beauty is you can do both. You can push the limit of what is possible from the technology of laser power and mirror [design], and then do squeezing on top of that.”<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

<p>A cancer researcher who lost nine papers in one day as a publisher purged articles offered in “authorship-for-sale” schemes told Retraction Watch he and his co-authors “will soon defend ourselves legally.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, the publisher Frontiers announced it had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/08/frontiers-retracts-nearly-40-papers-linked-to-authorship-for-sale/">retracted 38 papers</a> after its research integrity team found links to the practice of buying and selling authorship positions. Brokers list advertisements for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/">authorships of scientific papers</a> on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/07/introducing-two-sites-that-claim-to-sell-authorships-on-scientific-papers/">dedicated websites</a> as well as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/13/after-a-sleuth-reveals-a-paper-with-authorships-advertised-for-sale-its-retracted/">social media</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nine of the 38 articles Frontiers retracted listed <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dJarahian%252c%2bMostafa">Mostafa Jarahian</a>, formerly of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, as a co-author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we initially reported on the large batch of retractions, one of Jarahian’s co-authors shared an article from Frontiers&nbsp; indicating the publisher had decided to retract the paper after “concerns were brought to our attention from the German Cancer Research Center regarding the authorship of the article.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128102"></span>



<p>A draft retraction notice included in the email said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the German Cancer Research Center contacted the editorial office stating that the author Mostafa Jarahian is not an employee.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We reached out to Jarahian at the time, but didn’t hear back until recently. He shared with us an email from Martin R. Berger, who had led the DKFZ’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210928074332/https://www.dkfz.de/en/abteilungen/fspg/g401.php">Toxicology and Chemotherapy</a> research group with Jarahian as a member, to Frontiers. Berger confirmed to us that he sent the email, which disputed the publisher’s reasons for retracting Jarahian’s articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Berger wrote that Jarahian had been a member of the DKFZ since 2001, and part of Berger’s department from 2017 until leaving in 2020. All <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dJarahian%252c%2bMostafa">nine retracted papers</a> were submitted in 2021, according to the articles’ webpages, and published either that year or in 2022. Berger wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As I understand the situation, the only allegation, which is correct, is that the article(s) under concern was (were) labelled with his old affiliation. On the other hand, there is some period after leaving an institution, during which it is normal to use the old affiliation, as the work originated and was carried out there. In addition, during the period in question, Dr. Jarahian did not have a new position / new employer. In this situation, he used his private email address, which clearly differs from official DKFZ email addresses.</p>



<p>Finally, the science of the article(s) is not being disputed. In addition, the co-authors have not been involved in any accusation regarding science integrity. Therefore, it does not seem appropriate, to harm all authors because of a minor mistake of one author. If you deem it necessary to establish justice in this regard, I suggest that you allow Dr. Jarahian to write a short erratum.</p>



<p>If you can follow this suggestion, you would solve the underlying problem with distinction and grace and avoid the punishment of many co-authors. In the case, in which a PhD is pending on a publication, this would seem clearly unfair and exaggerated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Berger told us he had not received any response from Frontiers, which he said was “sad as well as a nuisance.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jarahian said he and his co-authors had not taken legal action yet, “but we intend to do it.” He did not respond further when we asked him to comment on Frontiers’ finding that his retracted papers had author positions posted for sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Frontiers spokesperson told us the publisher was “confident in our decision” and had “received no indication of legal action by Mostafa Jarahian against Frontiers to date.” The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction decision was a result of a thorough investigation by the Frontiers’ Research Integrity team. The concerns over ‘authorship for sale’ were flagged via Pubpeer, a valuable source of community feedback, of the adverts for several of Dr Jarahian&#8217;s publications (<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/3E7C467522CEB092CBB5307B59E0DF#12">here</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/CE62E7EA89923F67BCE0AD9030A73C#2">here).</a> Similar concerns of authorship abnormalities were highlighted in articles published by the same author group elsewhere (for example, see <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8CAE625CBAB294FEF50B2ABC1011B1#1">here</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E0115C166B09F70885F7452CF6AFD1#1">here</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the direct discussions with the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), the institution confirmed that&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Dr Jarahian was no longer an employee (the tenure finished in February 2020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>DKFZ was not aware of any of the 9 articles, all of which were submitted and published in 2021.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We shared the details of our investigation with the Committee on Publication Ethics (<a href="https://publicationethics.org/">COPE).</a> The Committee subsequently confirmed that Frontiers had followed adequate processes consistent with COPE expectations to assess the concerns and correct the published record.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-water-river-salmon-fish-climate">Pumping cold water into rivers could act as ‘air conditioning’ for fish</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PITTSBURGH</strong> — Salmon may now have their own version of human air conditioning. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This past summer, hundreds of fish in the Wrights River in Nova Scotia, Canada, found reprieve from the heat in <a href="https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2023AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/392393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human-generated plumes of cold water</a>, civil engineer Kathryn Smith reported October 17 at the Geological Society of America meeting. The work, though only proof of concept, could aid efforts to conserve cold-water species amid the widespread <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-waves-rivers-united-states-fish-plants-water-quality">warming of rivers</a> due to climate change (<em>SN: 10/20/22</em>).</p>





<p>When water temperatures get too hot, fish can become stressed or even die. In rivers, Atlantic salmon and other cold-water species sometimes escape the heat by flocking to cooler areas, which often arise near groundwater springs or relatively cool tributaries.</p>



<p>Lots of work has been done to preserve and augment these naturally occurring refuges, said Smith, of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, “but there hasn’t really been an emphasis or focus on if we can create cold-water habitat.”</p>



<p>So she and her colleagues pumped groundwater that was about 9° Celsius (or about 48° Fahrenheit) from a nearby well into the river, manifesting an artificial plume of water that could be as much as 20 degrees Celsius cooler than the surrounding water.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="266" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/102423_N_fish-cooling-stations_thermal_inline.jpg" alt="Two images side by side.

A thermal image (right) shows the effect: Cooler water appears darker purple while warmer water and sun-baked rocks are orange and yellow.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132582">Kathryn Smith</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The plume attracted several hundred fish of varying life stages and species, including Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Most were alevins — juvenile fish still attached to yolk sacs — that occupied the plume throughout the tests. But when a heat wave brought on maximum water temperatures of about 30° C, more mature fish also took shelter in the plume.</p>



<p>For a pump-free approach, the team also rerouted some water from the river into an underground trench, where it cooled before reentering the river. Though this method lowered the water temperature by only a few degrees Celsius, fish were observed frequenting the passively cooled flow throughout the summer.</p>



<p>More work lies ahead to determine how many of these sites would need to be constructed and sustained to significantly benefit fish populations, and how to do so while keeping energy costs low, says John Ackerman, a consulting engineer based in Hazleton, Pa., who was not involved in the research. But the researchers are demonstrating that these solutions can work, he says. “The concept is solid.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-feathers-bird-fossils">Dinosaur feathers may have been more birdlike than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many feathered dinosaurs couldn’t fly — at least, not like birds do today. But the reptiles’ feathers may have been more birdlike than scientists thought.</p>



<p>In 2019, fossil analyses found that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1815703116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feathers from a flightless dinosaur</a> mostly contained a different, more flexible form of the keratin protein that makes up modern bird beaks, scales and feathers. Researchers suggested then that feathers had evolved molecularly over time to become stiffer as birds — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-shrank-continually-birds">the last living dinosaurs</a> — took to the skies (<em>SN: 7/31/14</em>).</p>





<p>Yet <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02177-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fossilization can change feather proteins</a>, making one keratin protein resemble another, researchers report in the October <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>. &nbsp;The team also presented their findings on October 19 at the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology&#8217;s annual meeting in Cincinnati.</p>



<p>The study raises the possibility that dinosaur feathers may have mainly contained the beta-keratin proteins found in bird feathers. While such a finding would not imply all feathered dinosaurs flew, it does raise new questions about feather evolution.</p>



<p>The work also gives scientists valuable insight into one way the fossil record may transform over time, says Julia Clarke, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the new research. “There’s still a lot more to discover about the process of chemical alteration that all structures undergo during the process of rock formation, liquification and burial,” she says.</p>



<p>For the new study, paleontologist Tiffany Slater of University College Cork in Ireland and colleagues placed modern bird feathers under heat conditions that mimic what deeply buried dinosaur feathers may have endured during fossilization. Beta-keratins in the feathers unfolded and reformed in the shape of alpha-keratins, the more flexible form previously found to be dominant in dinosaur feathers, suggesting that a similar process had occurred in those feathers.</p>



<p>The researchers next examined a roughly 50-million-year-old bird feather and a 125-million-year-old feather from the nonavian dinosaur <em>Sinornithosaurus</em>. To their surprise, the bird feather seemed to consist mainly of alpha-keratins. Since it should have been rich in the beta variety, the team suspects that the proteins transformed during fossilization. The dinosaur feather, by contrast, contained mainly beta-keratins, suggesting it wasn’t exposed to enough heat to morph its proteins.</p>



<p>The simplest interpretation is that the distorting effects of fossilization led previous researchers astray in thinking dinosaur and bird feathers were so different molecularly, Slater says.</p>



<p>But the conditions the team tested in the new study may not accurately replicate what occurred during centuries of burial, says molecular paleontologist Mary Schweitzer of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who was involved in the 2019 research.</p>



<p>In her own work, feathers exposed to even higher temperatures preserved their proteins well when kept in sediment, rather than removed from it as in the current study. The effect fossilization has on feather proteins may be more complex and as yet misunderstood, she believes.</p>



<p>Scientists increasingly think that feathers did not evolve for flight. Instead, they probably kept dinosaurs warm and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-feathered-dino-shows-its-colors">helped them attract mates</a> (<em>SN: 2/4/10</em>). But some nonavian dinosaurs did <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-birds-could-achieve-liftoff">launch themselves into the air</a> and glide from place to place (<em>SN: 10/28/16</em>). And some that couldn’t fly still <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-running-gait-reveals-insights-history-bird-flight">flapped their wings as they ran</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/19</em>).</p>



<p>If feathers are only one piece of the puzzle of how flight evolved, keratin composition may be an even smaller sliver, says Matthew Shawkey, a biologist at Ghent University in Belgium, who wasn’t involved in the new research. “Would a feather made of alpha-keratin really be so flimsy?” he asks. “I just don’t know.”</p>





<p>More important for the evolution of flight, he thinks, may be the shape of feathers, whether they have veins, and how they are arranged relative to one another.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/berkley-walker-photosynthesis-photorespiration-climate">Berkley Walker wants to revamp photosynthesis for a changing climate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Berkley Walker didn’t plan on becoming a scientist; he wanted to be an entrepreneur. And he got started early on that goal: In high school in Portland, Ore., he started a granola bar company, which helped pay for his bachelor’s degree in microbiology.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>After college, Walker went to work as a product manager at an instrumentation company in Washington state, planning to go to business school and then into biotech. But a class on environmental biophysics at nearby Washington State University in 2009 changed his trajectory. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The course was about using mathematics to model physical systems in nature. “Working that math out to understand how energy and matter exchange within the environment,” Walker says — that was all it took. He decided to pursue a career as a plant scientist. “I wanted to have some kind of usefulness to the world,” Walker says. “Feeding people is where I settled.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Amazing but inefficient plants</h4>



<p>Today, at Michigan State University, Walker wants to understand the intricate details of how photosynthesis works, with the ultimate aim of improving it.</p>



<p>He remains deeply fascinated by plants: “You just take this little seed, you put it in the dirt and then you get this plant,” he says. “And it spreads these leaves out. And those leaves just take the sun, and they scrub carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and they use that to make the food that we eat, the clothes that we wear, the air that we breathe, energy that we consume. And that’s just miraculous.”</p>



<p>But as impressive as photosynthesis is, it is surprisingly inefficient. A leaf converts just around 1 percent of the sun’s light into usable energy, Walker says. In part that’s because of mistakes in the first step of photosynthesis. The enzyme that captures CO<sub>2</sub> molecules and sticks them to sugar makes a lot of mistakes, often grabbing oxygen instead. Those mistakes result in a compound that actually inhibits photosynthesis. Photorespiration, a kind of recycling process, gets rid of that compound — but photorespiration requires a lot of energy.</p>



<p>Losses due to this recycling in the American Midwest over an average wheat and soybean growing season <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-043015-111709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add up to about 148 trillion dietary calories</a>, Walker says. “If you were to convert these calories into doughnut equivalents,” he says, “you would have a stack of doughnuts that would go to the moon and back about 11 times.”</p>



<p>Any efficiency gain could make a huge difference in agricultural productivity. But first scientists have to better understand how photorespiration works.</p>



<p>To that end, Walker came up with an innovative technique to trace carbon molecules in leaves, research reported in a 2022 paper in <em>Nature Plants</em>. The researchers were using flux analysis, which reveals the movements of molecules through plants’ metabolic network. But they needed a better way to freeze the metabolism of a plant. The problem was, there was no way to spray liquid nitrogen into the instrument chamber that held the leaves.</p>



<p>After talking to engineers at the company that makes the instrument, Walker decided to drill a hole in the chamber so his team could insert a nozzle to spray in liquid nitrogen and hit the leaf surface instantaneously. “That’s a really critical step,” says Xinyu Fu, who has been a postdoc in Walker’s lab for the past four years. A lot could change in the 10 seconds it would take to open the chamber and take the leaf out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Berkley_Walker_inline-675x450.jpg" alt="Close-up of the hand of Xinyu Fu, a postdoc in Berkley Walker’s lab, as he prepares to rapidly freeze a leaf for metabolic analysis." class="wp-image-3132319" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Berkley_Walker_inline-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Berkley_Walker_inline-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Berkley_Walker_inline-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Berkley_Walker_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132319">Xinyu Fu, a postdoc in Berkley Walker’s lab, prepares to rapidly freeze a leaf for metabolic analysis.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132319">Chelsea Mamott/Wisconsin Energy Institute</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The work revealed that up to about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-022-01294-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent of the carbon-bearing amino acid serine that is produced during photorespiration</a> gets diverted by the plant to be used for something — perhaps protein synthesis — rather than going all the way through the recycling process. That suggests optimizing photorespiration in the context of climate change could result in more nutritious, protein-rich crops. But, “as we’re trying to change it,” Walker says, “we need to understand what trade-offs there might be.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A generosity of spirit</h4>





<p>Colleagues who know Walker best point to his eagerness to collaborate as one of his strengths, along with his generosity of spirit.</p>



<p>Don Ort, a plant scientist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Walker’s postdoc adviser for nearly three years, says Walker is a committed teacher and colleague. “Being involved in the education of graduate students and postdocs is a passion for him,” Ort says. “He’s very passionate about what he does. He does it with a very high level of enthusiasm and a very high level of optimism. And it’s infectious to people around him.”</p>



<p>Walker sees plant science as one big community that is trying to solve two big problems: How to make crops more productive to feed a growing population, and how to do it in a changing climate, which may pose any number of challenges to agriculture. And he believes we’ll start seeing solutions in the coming decades, whether they come out of his lab or someone else’s.</p>



<p>“Whoever comes up with those, and if they’re shown to work and work repeatedly in a lot of crops, then that&#8217;s a really big deal,” he says. “That&#8217;s the kind of idea that we&#8217;re chasing.”</p>

                <p><strong>A STEM degree can take you many places besides the lab but deciding what to do after graduating can be tricky. Ana Mosciuk reflects on her own journey back and forth between the lab and 'alternative' careers, with insights on the realities of these various jobs to help you match your own skills and interests to the right path.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_1fddd2d37eae47049a8ebd29f1a6acf6~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_940,h_658,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>I have finished my MSc dissertation and completed my research internship. After the 'congratulations', the question everyone has been asking is 'which lab will you work at?'. But the truth is, I'm not sure whether I want to stay in research at all.</p>

<p>Going into this MSc in Clinical, Social and Cognitive Neuroscience at City, University of London, my plan was to apply for a PhD and pursue a traditional career in a research lab but the more I think about it, I no longer feel that it’s the right path for me. </p>

<p>I decided to take some time and explore other career options in neuroscience, and reflecting on my study and work experiences has helped me to figure out what I want to do next. </p>

<p>I came to the UK from Lithuania in 2013 to study a BSc in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Westminster (London) with a dream to become a research scientist. In the summer following my second year, I landed my first research placement.</p>

<p>I worked on the kinetic analysis of oestrogen receptor ligand interactions in breast cancer tissue, and learnt a whole range of cell biology techniques, but my first lab experience wasn’t what I expected it to be. I thought that I’d spend a lot of time conducting experiments and analysing results but in reality, many of my lab days consisted of filling out health and safety forms and doing literature reviews. I didn’t really get a chance to learn about the topic in more depth, and the tasks I was assigned were often repetitive. I did find a positive result in the end, but I was frustrated to not participate in the analysis of this data. It’s fairly typical for an early undergraduate student interning in the lab for the first time to have limited  responsibilities. Your first lab experience gives you a chance to build some initial lab skills under the supervision of lecturers or postgraduate students and then, as you become a more experienced student, you can be given more responsibility and time to invest in the background of the research. </p>

<p>My hope was that working on my own research project during my final year of my undergraduate degree would be different because I would be in charge of choosing the research question, designing the experiment and analysing data. This was true but unfortunately, I ended up assigned to a project outside of my interests. Although I enjoyed being at the forefront of research with that buzz of discovery, it was quite discouraging to keep working on the subject I wasn’t passionate about, and my love for science started to fade away. </p>

<p>6 months passed, I handed in my dissertation, graduated, and told myself I was done with the lab once and for all.</p>

<p>The first stop on my career journey was trying out teaching because I had some tutoring experience and I enjoy explaining scientific concepts to others. I thought it could be fun working on school projects and encouraging young people to get into science. </p>

<p>After a year of giving private science lessons, I enjoyed thinking about science from a new angle and finding new ways to make difficult concepts engaging and accessible, but I felt that I was no longer learning anything new myself. I wanted to stay up to date with scientific discoveries and contribute to new ones - my passion for science was starting to come back! </p>

<p>In my free time I continued reading scientific papers that interested me. I started to search for new opportunities and came across science writing vacancies. </p>

<p>I landed a job with a media agency and began writing health articles for a self-care app. I also started freelance writing for medical professionals and lifestyle companies. I enjoyed writing on various health topics, knowing that my articles could help people improve their lives and learn how to be healthier. </p>

<p>Then, in January 2020, the pandemic hit and soon we entered lockdown. Like many, I was working long and lonely hours at home and it had a serious impact on my mental health. </p>

<p>A few of my clients were asking me to write more articles about mental health problems and I began to learn more about how the brain works in health and disease. That’s when my love for science and discoveries was properly sparked again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I started to think about research again. I finally knew my area of interest and had read a lot of literature for my writing job, so it was time to give my research career another go!</p>

<p>That’s when I decided to pursue a graduate degree in neuroscience. I applied and got accepted for an MSc in Clinical, Social and Cognitive Neuroscience at City, University of London which combined teaching with a research internship.</p>

<p>I started my studies in October 2021 and, dedicated to my reignited goal of being a research scientist, I reached out to one of my lecturers for a chance to work with him on a decision-making study alongside the course. I also conducted my own research for my dissertation, studying emotion recognition.</p>

I was often frustrated by the slow progress of data collection by factors outside of my own control, like participants cancelling their appointments at the last minute. </p>

<p>What I <em>did </em>really enjoy was reading scientific literature and explaining neuroscientific concepts in simple terms to wider audiences - it felt more immediately impactful.</p>

<p>Realising this, when I finished my dissertation, I decided to explore options outside the lab that would bring me closer to people. Luckily, when I started my Master’s, I applied for a Student Communications Assistant job in the Marketing Department at my university to build experience in marketing and communications. I learnt how to write newsletters, student hub stories, manage social media channels and work on campaigns helping students to make the most of their time at uni. This helped me to land an internship at a mental health startup. There, I worked with the product team and gained experience in producing web content, designing landing pages and improving user experience. </p>

<p>Compared to the lab where I was working alone for long hours without a regular working schedule, in this role I felt more like I was part of the team. I enjoyed having group meetings, brainstorming ideas and then seeing them come to life. The job is very creative and I'm constantly thinking of new ways to design solutions to peoples' problems.</p>

<p>I also continued freelance writing throughout my masters. Since I’ve always maintained these writing and communication skills, I found a few clients in the health and wellness niche through networking and on freelance platforms. My days consist of creating and editing web content about mental health, healthy lifestyle and news in neuroscience research. </p>

<p>Now, I want to combine the aspects I most enjoyed from all these work and study experiences together - the excitement of scientific research with the creativity and human contact of communications - so I’m exploring different career roles in science writing and communications. </p>

<p>My current goal is to improve my skills as a science communicator. I’m doing a <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/cx/get-started?src=go-pa&#38;trk=sem-ga_campid.1399342497_asid.54056821126_crid.311040980383_kw.linkedin%20learning_d.c_tid.kwd-310582843911_n.g_mt.e_geo.1006996&#38;mcid=6841864363146670249&#38;cid=&#38;gclid=Cj0KCQjwmICoBhDxARIsABXkXlLumW3EanQXtRMO2c-o5JmENgjc--pi8OZQ4bwjxu49UzymvsWPYsQaAkiMEALw_wcB&#38;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" >,<u>LinkedIn Learning</u></a> course (students can often access these for free through their university) about creating a communications strategy, and I am working towards qualifications in online email marketing and social media advertising. </p>

<p>Attending events is also a great way to learn more about science writing and communications. Back in April, I attended an <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/events" target="_blank" >,<u>online event organised by WiNUK</u></a> about alternative careers in neuroscience. It was very inspiring to hear from amazing women working in science communications, illustrations and presenting and learn about their journeys - I definitely recommend checking it out if anyone is interested in these fields.</p>

<p>It’s also important to build up your portfolio to showcase your work to potential clients and employers. You can create an online portfolio with <a href="https://contently.net/why-create-a-portfolio/" target="_blank" >,<u>Contently</u></a> and upload content that you’ve written and published. I’m trying out different writing styles and have produced long-form and short-form articles for my clients, wrote research study summaries, LinkedIn posts, podcast descriptions, newsletters and performed desk research. Now I want to learn how to write engaging and informative blog posts, which is why I’ve joined the incredible Women in Neuroscience UK’s guest writers group. </p>

<p>To get more science comms experience, my fellow coursemate Adrianna, who also opted for an ‘alternative’ career, and I have started a blog, <a href="https://neurobirdies.com/" target="_blank" >,<u>neurobirdies.com</u></a><u>,</u> where we’re documenting our neuroscience journeys while sharing studying tips and exploring various neuroscience-related careers.

<p><strong>Neglected dangers of thermal pollution </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environmental-sciences-20"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 20, 1973</p>



<p>Most urban dwellers have experienced the swelter of a summer night in the city, but higher temperatures in the atmosphere over such “heat islands” may have more insidious effects, which urban planners seldom consider.… Urban-rural temperature differences can be as high as 18&nbsp;degrees [Fahrenheit]. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Today, excess heat from pavement and buildings cause U.S. cities to run <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/explainer-urban-heat-islands-and-how-to-cool-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half&nbsp;a degree to 4 degrees Celsius</a> (1 to 7 degrees F) higher on average than outlying areas. This heat island effect is expected to worsen as a side effect of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-heat-wave-summer">climate change</a>. Because urban areas are expanding, that means their growing populations are at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-human-body-climate">risk for heat-related illness or death</a>, scientists reported in 2019 in <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>. To stay cool, some cities are switching to roofs and surfaces that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reflective-paint-could-keep-sunbaked-buildings-cool">reflect a lot of sunlight and heat</a>. Adding trees helps too: Trees provide shade and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">emit water vapor</a> that lowers air temperature, almost like if a city could sweat (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 18</em>).</p>

<p>This study brings us back in time to the Middle to Late Pleistocene (about 0.46 − 0.012 million years ago, Ma), when our far away ancestors were living alongside the woolly rhinoceros (<em>Coelodonta antiquitatis</em>), an extinct rhino of the genus <em>Coelodonta</em> that was particularly well adapted to cold climates and widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. Traces of their cohabitation has been found in caves such as <a href="https://www.lascaux-dordogne.com/en/lascaux-cave">Lascaux</a> and <a href="https://archeologie.culture.gouv.fr/chauvet/en">Chauvet</a> but sadly the phylogenetic trees of the woolly rhinoceros was not included!</p>
<p>Investigation of rhinoceros fossils previously uncovered in Northern China and Siberia led to the hypothesis that the Chinese fossils are the descendants of the Siberian relatives. The increasing availability of ancient DNA samples has led to a refinement of the phylogeny of the Rhinocerotidae family and the woolly rhinoceros now appears to be more closely related to the Sumatran rhinoceros than any other extant rhinoceros.</p>
<p>The authors generated four mitogenomes from 16 Late Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros in Northern China and carried out a comparison with previously published genomes in order to investigate the maternal lineage of the Chinese woolly rhinoceros. They also calculated the nucleotide diversity of woolly rhinoceros’ specimens from different regions in Asia thus providing insights into the molecular evolution of Chinese woolly rhinoceros and shedding light on of past dispersal events of this extinct rhino. They detected a new early separating maternal clad, deeply divergent, that could represent the first woolly rhinoceros population before its dispersal into Asia. Alternatively, this newly discoverer clade could point to this extinct rhino having evolved in Northern China rather than in Europe! This theory would indeed require further investigation. In any case, these findings highlight Northern China as a possible refugium for Quaternary mammals under pressure of climate and environmental changes and a key evolution center of the Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros.</p>

Harvesting the killing potential of phages could be a solution to the emerging antibiotic crisis. Despite their abundance (they are predicted to be the most abundant biological entities on the planet), the availability of phages genomes is still limited with only 26 <em>Providencia</em> phage genomes deposited in the NCBI GenBank as of July 2023.

<p>This study set out to characterize exposure to PM in a typical workplace for the whole duration of the production cycle in order to quantify the risks of respiratory symptoms and lung function in a cohort of reinforced concrete parts production industry in Almaty, Kazakhstan.<br />
50 personal samples were collected from workers in the factory in the summer of 2023 using portable PM2.5 cyclones and filters. 10 samples at each of the five different locations included: the concrete-mixing unit, the armature shop, the metal working workshop, the molding workshop and finally the office as a control. The workers were also asked to complete a questionnaire about their working history, respiratory symptoms which was followed by a lung function test.</p>
<p>The highest PM2.5 concentrations were found in the concrete-mixing unit (median 1180 µg/m3), followed by metalworking (510 µg/m3), armature workshop (375 µg/m3) and molding site (245 µg/m3), different from the concentrations in the office (29.5 µg/m3).<br />
The authors concluded that mixing concrete and metalworks are the steps that pose the greatest risk for worker’s health due to the higher exposure. It is due to the exposure to aerosol via inhalation which are adversely affecting respiratory health by causing more respiratory symptoms, independently of smoking and past respiratory diagnoses. Therefore wider use if PPE and exposure control measures should be put in place in reinforced concrete parts production in order to preserve workers’ health.</p>

<p>This paper describes a novel method NLP that implements unsupervised learning of word embeddings and allows for the clinical language to be automatically learnt with only minimal manual feature engineering and tagging required from clinical experts. This pipeline enables a gradual refinement of the data in a transparent way and the predictions are interpretable, a key factor for healthcare.</p>
<p>The method was put to the test using real EHR dataset and evaluating its performance at a classification task which in this case was used to detect patient’s allergies compared to a range of common supervised learning algorithms. The new, combined method performed much better than the other method evaluated. These promising results suggest that more research should be aimed at exploiting the inherent synergies between unsupervised, supervised, and rule-based paradigms for clinical NLP.</p>

<p>A visit to the dentist can easily make the list of the most universally disliked activities. However, despite their unpopularity, these visits are nonetheless essential for buccal hygiene and to avoid complications. In this study, researchers tackle the oral health perceptions, practices and care-seeking experiences of slum residents in Ibadan, Nigeria. Indeed the WHO has recommended inclusion of disadvantaged populations in their new global oral health strategy.</p>

<p>This was an exploratory qualitative study making use of face-to-face-focus group discussions with representative households between September and October 2019.The participants were between 25 and 59 years old. Dental pain was the most commonly reported oral health issue mentioned by the participants and they mostly describes the intensity and severity of the pain. The consequences of these pain were severe sometimes even resulting in the death of the patient!</p>
<p>The study concluded that the residents had preconceived ideas about dental clinics such as them being unaffordable that precluded them from visiting them. Instead they preferred self-care remedies and engaged in sometimes harmful oral health practices. Policymakers would need to take these findings into account in order to provide better education on early dental care as well as available, and affordable oral healthcare to slum residents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/10/community-over-commercialization-oa-week-2023/">Community Over Commercialization: OA Week 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>Open Access Week is a special commemoration for us as one of the original co-founders of the event, along with <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc">SPARC</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a>. It shows <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/10/oa-weeks-past/">how far we&rsquo;ve come</a>, but also what we still have to accomplish. This year&rsquo;s theme is <a href="https://www.openaccessweek.org/theme">&ldquo;Community over Commercialization,&rdquo;</a> and we&rsquo;re giving you a sneak peek into how PLOS prioritizes that ethos in our day-to-day thinking.</p>



<p>PLOS started with an <a href="https://plos.org/open-letter/">open letter</a>. A call to the research community to build a better future through transparency and inclusion, standing in direct opposition to the profit-motivated practices at large commercial journal publishers. That spirit still drives the organization today.</p>



<p><strong>Community Publishing</strong></p>



<p>We are a mission-driven organization that aims to transform scholarly research communication. Most of our readers know PLOS best as a nonprofit, Open Access publisher. The research communities we serve are at the heart of each of our journals. We only launch new journals and open research initiatives after consulting with representatives of the relevant research communities. It&rsquo;s not our goal to simply add more options to the list researchers have to choose from today, but to consider journals as vehicles for change and identify the role PLOS can play in providing a venue for researchers to share their work more openly. Journal attributes, such as the level of editorial selectivity, scope, editorial policies, leadership/Editorial Board membership and our business models are shaped by community consultation, centering on their unmet needs, and aim to shift research behaviors from closed to open.</p>



<p>Here are just a few ways that we think about <a href="https://plos.org/your-journal-options/">our journals</a> and our <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science </a>mission.</p>



<ul><li>Many of our journals are interdisciplinary in order to draw together disparate but connected stakeholders and facilitate discussion between researchers, policymakers, and individuals</li><li>We created a new policy on&nbsp;<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inclusivity in Global Research</a>&nbsp;(i.e. anti-&lsquo;parachute/helicopter/neo-colonial&rsquo; research)</li><li>We are now permitting non-human authors&nbsp;<a href="https://latitude.plos.org/2023/09/applying-inclusive-authorship-criteria-two-examples-from-plos-water/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in exceptional circumstances</a></li><li>We require <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandatory availability of data underlying published articles</a></li><li>We <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strongly encourage preprint posting</a>; provision of service to deposit submitted papers to preprint servers</li><li>We endorse <a href="https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/#:~:text=PLOS%20authors%20can%20opt%2Din,the%20reviews%20will%20appear%20anonymously." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparent peer review</a>; publishing peer-review reports and editor decision letters with published papers</li></ul>



<p>Although the theme of &ldquo;Community over Commercialization&rdquo; is evident everywhere at PLOS, it is perhaps best expressed through our <strong>publishing program</strong>, which is also the truest expression of our Open Science mission.&nbsp; PLOS partners with like-minded organizations and scholars, and our unique editorial approach is closely aligned with the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science">UNESCO recommendation for Open Science</a> which emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and inclusion; and the<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals"> </a><a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>, which have a global community perspective.</p>



<p>When PLOS decided to launch<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new journals</a>, we knew had to build them from a new blueprint in order to fulfill our aims and mission namely by:</p>



<ul><li>including the broadest range of researchers&rsquo; voices globally</li><li>ensuring that these new Open Science platforms would be shaped at every level by the communities they aimed to serve</li><li>striving to amplify the perspectives of all researchers and stakeholders in global issues including from Lower middle-income countries</li><li>leveraging the diversity of the editorial boards, which shape content, policies, and practices that are reflective of the research communities working in these fields</li></ul>



<p><strong>Community funding</strong></p>



<p>As Open Access has grown, we saw a need to try something new: supporting its cost in a regionally equitable way with <strong><u>our focus on community, not profits,</u></strong> which brings us to our business models, which underpin our approach. At issue: Article Processing Charges (APCs) helped demonstrate that Open publishing could be viable and allowed Open Access to become a meaningful force in scholarly communication.</p>



<p>But APCs don&rsquo;t work for everyone. Not all disciplines or regions have the same level of funding, and publishing costs can deplete author grants and reduce the amount available for research, while for publishers, administering individual publication fees carries significant overhead which leads to higher costs overall.</p>



<p>We firmly believe that all researchers should have the opportunity to both read and publish under an <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Open Access license</a>, and that solutions for sustainable Open Access publishing need to involve all stakeholders. That&rsquo;s why PLOS is leading the charge in developing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-alternative-models-continue-to-grow-in-2023/">non-APC alternative funding models.</a> All these business models address specific challenges in Open Access publishing and were created with input from the community.</p>



<p><strong>A future of Openness through community</strong></p>



<p>Although PLOS is primarily a publisher, we advocate for Open Research practices because we believe that Open Science is better science&mdash;more rigorous, more trustworthy, more equitable, more reproducible, more creative, faster, and more impactful for society. PLOS&rsquo; has a built-in philosophy of sharing what we learn (e.g. OS research) and openly seeking input and collaboration in how we innovate is a defining principle of how we work.</p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; mission is to lead a transformation in scholarly publishing from a closed to an Open model. We believe we can best accomplish that by empowering our community to engage in Open Science practices on a large scale, as part of their regular scientific communications while collaborating with other actors in scholarly communication such as institutions, funders, and policymakers to move towards a better Open Science ecosystem.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/8-gmo-history-genetic-modification">These 8 GMOs tell a brief history of genetic modification</a></h4>

              
                <p>Half a century ago, the first genetically modified organism ushered in a new era of biological innovation. To mark this anniversary, here are eight milestone GMOs. Many have had, or are poised to have, a dramatic impact on our lives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <em>Escherichia coli</em></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline1.jpg" alt="An image of red, pink, and orange E. coli on a black background that are engineered to produce human insulin." class="wp-image-3132376" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline1-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline1-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132376">These <em>E. coli</em> are engineered to produce human insulin.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132376">Volker Steger/Science Source</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In November 1973, geneticist Stanley Cohen and colleagues <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.70.11.3240?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that they had built a plasmid, a ring of DNA, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/animal-genes-transplanted-bacteria">carried a gene from another organism into an <em>E.&nbsp;coli </em>cell</a> — the birth of genetic engineering (<em>SN:&nbsp;6/1/74</em>). The team later showed that such modified cells could produce the protein associated with a foreign gene. <em>E.&nbsp;coli</em> has since been modified to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3179032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass-produce therapeutic drugs</a>, <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2016/11/harnessing-bacteria-fight-ocean-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break down plastics</a> and more. “The most important GMO is the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.76.1.106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microbes that are used to make insulin</a>,” says geneticist Matthew Cobb of the University of Manchester in England. In 1978, facing problems with insulin derived from pigs and cows, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/human-insulin-seizing-golden-plasmid">engineered <em>E.&nbsp;coli</em> to make human insulin</a> for treating diabetes (<em>SN:&nbsp;9/16/78</em>). The lifesaving drug <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/human-insulin-sale">hit the market</a> in 1982 (<em>SN: 10/9/82</em>).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Transgenic mice</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline2.jpg" alt="A photo of two brown mice sitting in the hand of a person wearing a purple latex glove." class="wp-image-3132377" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline2-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline2-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132377">The genetically engineered mouse on the left is missing a gene affecting hair growth. The mouse on the right retains the gene.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132377">Maggie Bartlett, NHGRI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mouse models are a go-to for scientists who want to study human disease in a controlled way in the lab. In 1974, biologists Rudolf Jaenisch and Beatrice Mintz laid the groundwork for these models by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC388203/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">injecting DNA from simian virus into mouse embryos</a>, which were later born with viral DNA in their genomes. In papers published in 1980 and 1981, a team led by biologists Jon Gordon and Frank Ruddle incorporated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/transplanted-gene-egg-mouse">viral DNA into mouse genomes</a> so that it was passed on to subsequent generations (<em>SN:&nbsp;9/13/80</em>). The star rodents were called “transgenic” mice. Since then, transgenic and knockout mice, where a single gene is broken or removed, have been developed to mimic and study human diseases from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/msj.20159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alzheimer’s</a> to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6709737/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcoholism</a> to <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2012.0212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression </a>and cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Bt tobacco and more</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline3.jpg" alt="A photo of Bt cotton on the left and non-Bt cotton on the right." class="wp-image-3132378" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline3-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline3-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132378">Bt cotton (left) is more resistant to bollworm attacks than non-Bt cotton (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132378">Dominic Reisig, Ph.D.</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In 1987, geneticist Mark Vaeck and colleagues reported that they had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/328033a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically engineered tobacco</a> to produce Bt toxins. These toxins, made by the bacterium <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>, affect only certain insects, including several common agricultural pests. Pesticides derived from the toxins take time and money to spray, but the new tobacco plant had built-in protection. Estimates suggest that more than 1&nbsp;billion hectares of Bt crops — corn, cotton, soybeans and more — have been grown since, with no known safety issues for consumers. These crops have improved yields while reducing the need for pesticides. They “are grown on massive scales, in many countries around the world,” says Emma Kovak, a food and agriculture analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental think tank in Berkeley, Calif. “They’ve had a massive impact.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Flavr Savr tomato</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline4.jpg" alt="A photo of six tomatoes on a white background. The three on the left are non-GMO and appear to be going bad while the three on the right appear fresh." class="wp-image-3132379" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline4-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline4-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132379">Flavr Savr tomatoes (right) stay firm longer than their ordinary counterparts (left).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132379">MARTYN F. CHILLMAID/Science Source</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The impact of the Flavr Savr tomato, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/tomato-biotechnology-heads-market">introduced in 1994</a>, is largely symbolic (<em>SN: 5/28/94</em>). Its genome was modified to block the production of an enzyme responsible for fruit softening, thus <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00022530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping the fruit firm longer</a>. High production and distribution costs ultimately doomed the Flavr Savr, but it was the first genetically engineered crop to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and to be commercially sold. GM&nbsp;crops have boomed since the Flavr Savr flopped. In 2019, more than 190 million hectares were planted with GM crops. Such crops include potatoes, squash, sugar beets, papayas and corn.</p>



<p>Some people also trace a rise in GMO opposition back to the Flavr Savr tomato, Kovak says. The tomato went through intense safety tests, but people opposed to GMO foods more generally, then and now, point to potential health and environmental risks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Biofortified rice</h3>

<p>More than 2 billion people worldwide face micro­nutrient deficiencies. Traditional breeding and genetic engineering can amp up those nutrients, and <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/86511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rice has been an obvious target</a>. “More than half of the world’s population, including many of those living in poverty, rely on rice for most of their daily calories,” says B.P. Mallikarjuna Swamy, a rice biofortification researcher at the International Rice Research Institute in Los Baños, Philippines.</p>



<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/125/3/1157/6109908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden rice</a>, developed in the late 1990s by a team led by biologists Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer, contains genes from a daffodil and a soil bacterium that enable it to produce a precursor to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vitamin A</a>. Food safety regulators have approved it in the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and it was recently <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912421001048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved for commercial use</a> in the Philippines. Despite its promise, though, golden rice has not yet seen widespread adoption due to regulatory hurdles and GMO opposition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. AquAdvantage salmon</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gmo_inline6.jpg" alt="A photo of two fish on a blue background.

<p>The FDA approved AquAdvantage salmon for human consumption <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/intentional-genomic-alterations-igas-animals/aquadvantage-salmon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2015</a> — making the salmon the first GMO animal to be OK’d as human food in the United States. Canada followed in 2016. With a growth hormone gene from Chinook salmon, AquAdvantage salmon reach full size in half the time of traditional farm-raised Atlantic salmon. Fast-growing farmed salmon could have widespread appeal, but there are concerns that if the engineered salmon escape, they could push out wild salmon.

<p>Some researchers are turning to GMOs for conservation. The American chestnut, which once dominated the eastern seaboard, offers an early example of what such efforts might look like. These “redwoods of the East” were severely reduced by the mid-1900s by a parasitic fungus introduced from imported trees. Historical efforts to develop a blight-resistant chestnut using traditional breeding haven’t panned out, but the Darling chestnut might be the answer. This <a href="https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mpp.13165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically engineered tree</a> is more resistant to the fungal blight disease thanks to a wheat gene that breaks down the harmful chemical the pathogen produces. The tree has been under review by regulatory agencies since January 2020. After approval, the <a href="https://www.esf.edu/chestnut/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.esf.edu/chestnut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project</a> at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse plans to start distributing it to restoration programs and the public.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Mosquitoes</h3>

Researchers hope releasing such genetically modified insects can help fight the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132383">MIGUEL SCHINCARIOL/AFP via Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Genetically modifying animals that spread disease, including mosquitoes, could save a lot of lives; malaria alone kills hundreds of thousands of people each year. “We’re already using genetically modified mosquitoes for disease control,” says biologist Vanessa Macias of the University of North Texas in Denton. Tests in 2021 in Florida, for example, released male <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes genetically engineered so <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">female offspring die before adulthood</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>). The goal? Reduce the population of insects that spread the Zika and dengue viruses. Modified mosquitoes have also been released in Brazil, the Cayman Islands, Panama and India. </p>



<p>Other research teams are adding genes that make mosquitoes resistant to a pathogen, says Macias, thereby preventing disease spread. And advances in gene editing mean it’s now possible to use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-spread-their-wings">what are known as gene drives</a> to spread genetic modifications through entire populations (<em>SN: 12/2/15</em>). Yet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-mosquito-malaria-crispr-africa-public-outreach">open questions remain</a>, including whether it is ethical or wise to transform entire animal populations (<em>SN: 6/3/22</em>). “We’re talking about unknown unknowns,” Macias says.</p>

<p>The publisher PLOS appears close to an agreement with a scientist who sued to stop the addition of an expression of concern to one of her articles, according to a recent filing in the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/research/office-of-research-and-graduate-education/research-faculty/clinical-and-translational-science/singh-soudamani/">Soudamani Singh</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Clinical and Translational Sciences at Marshall University’s Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine in Huntington, W. Va., filed suit against PLOS in April, as we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/scientist-sues-publisher-to-block-expression-of-concern/">previously reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Singh’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Singh-complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, the publisher planned to place an expression of concern on one of her papers after she and her co-authors had requested a correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh’s suit sought a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction preventing PLOS from publishing the expression of concern, as well as damages and legal fees.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128095"></span>



<p>The paper at issue, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203552">Cyclooxygenase pathway mediates the inhibition of Na-glutamine co-transporter B0AT1 in rabbit villus cells during chronic intestinal inflammation</a>,” published in <em>PLOS ONE</em> in September 2018, currently has no notice of any sort. The article has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On October 12, the federal judge assigned to the case <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Singh-5-pending-settlement.pdf">ordered</a> a stay of the action, citing a “pending settlement.” The judge also ordered the parties to submit an order dismissing the case by November 13, or the court would dismiss the case, allowing the possibility for Singh to re-file.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We could not learn the terms of the settlement. Singh’s lawyer did not respond to our request for comment, and David Knutson, senior communications manager for PLOS, said the publisher “cannot comment because this is an ongoing case.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-supernova-stars-die-hubble">A rare glimpse at a relatively nearby supernova offers clues to how stars die</a></h4>

              
                <p>In May, a star in the Pinwheel galaxy exploded in just the right place at nearly the right time for astronomers to unravel details of its death. It was the closest supernova to go off in the last five years.</p>



<p>Astronomers have long been fascinated with these stellar explosions, which signal the end of life for the universe’s biggest stars. Not only are they dramatic — a supernova can shine 5 billion times as bright as our sun — but the explosions seed the universe with gold, silver, zinc and other elements forged only in a dying star’s last moments.</p>





<p>And this supernova — designated SN 2023ixf — was perfectly placed for astronomers to capture it relatively soon after it went off.</p>



<p>Because researchers can’t predict when a star will die, they typically wouldn&#8217;t have lots of images of a supernova from shortly after it happened, says Edo Berger, an astronomer at Harvard University. But thanks to the supernova’s position in a nearby galaxy that’s popular with stargazers, scientists were able to use images from amateur astronomers to pin down when the star exploded to within just a few hours, says astronomer Daichi Hiramatsu, also at Harvard.</p>



<p>Having data on the explosion not long after it happened is crucial to answering many open questions about how stars’ dying moments play out. Here are three things to know about this stunning supernova.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">SN 2023ixf used to be a dust-shrouded red supergiant</h4>



<p>SN 2023ixf was first discovered by Japanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki a few days after the star exploded. Almost immediately after learning about the supernova, researchers started scouring archival data for the star it used to be, says astronomer Charlie Kilpatrick of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “We looked at the imaging within hours of the report,” he says.</p>



<p>Right away, he and his colleagues found something in Hubble Space Telescope images of the Pinwheel galaxy taken between 5 and 24 years earlier that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ace4ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked like it could be the star</a>, the supernova progenitor, that exploded as SN 2023ixf. It was a lucky find, as astronomers had no idea that the star would explode when the Hubble images were taken. Since then, other research teams have used other telescope images to independently confirm the identity of SN 2023ixf’s progenitor&nbsp;— a red supergiant cloaked in a dusty veil.</p>



<p>Stars like this one are the most common progenitors for explosions like SN 2023ixf, Kilpatrick says. And “in a lot of ways,” he notes, SN 2023ixf “is kind of a normal supernova.”</p>



<p>That’s a good thing, Berger says. It’s easy to get excited about supernovas that are particularly unusual. “But here we have a supernova that&#8217;s actually representative of the way that most stars die,” he says, which helps with astronomers’ overall understanding of stellar evolution.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="409" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101723_ec_new-supernova_original_inline.jpeg" alt="An image of supernova SN2023ixxf" class="wp-image-3132485" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101723_ec_new-supernova_original_inline.jpeg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101723_ec_new-supernova_original_inline-637x383.jpeg 637w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101723_ec_new-supernova_original_inline-309x186.jpeg 309w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132485">Japanese citizen scientist Koichi Itagaki was the first to spot SN 2023ixf, a supernova shown here (adjacent to the two lines at lower left) in one of Itagaki&#8217;s telescope images.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132485">Koichi Itagaki</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">SN 2023ixf’s final years involved extreme weight loss</h4>



<p>Studying stellar deaths requires a bit of forensic analysis, Berger says. The star dies, but you don’t see it happen. “Then you kind of have to backtrack what the star was doing all the way up to that point,” he says. “And tracking how the star was losing mass is a critical part of that.”</p>





<p>Berger and Hiramatsu recently published results&nbsp;suggesting that the star that exploded as SN 2023ixf <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf299" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost an incredible amount</a> of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ace0c4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass in its final years</a> — an entire sun’s worth, which was far more than expected.</p>



<p>To reconstruct these dramatic stellar death throes, the researchers scrutinized the light cast as SN 2023ixf exploded. As the star collapsed, it emitted a shock wave that set off a bright flash of light as the wave collided with material surrounding the star — including mass lost before the explosion. Using the explosion’s light to map out this material allowed the team to reconstruct SN 2023ixf’s mass loss rates leading up to the explosion.</p>



<p>Red supergiants are known to lose mass leading up to a supernova, but far less than in the final years before this latest explosion, Hiramatsu says. Something changed for SN 2023ixf’s progenitor star —&nbsp;something that might happen to other stars, too, and that researchers still don’t understand.</p>



<p>“Stellar evolution theory is just not up to the task” to tell us, Berger says. To figure out what happens in the last moments of a star’s long life, “we have to do it from data.” And this supernova is a rare chance to gather some of that data.</p>



<p>“It’s an incredible opportunity,” Kilpatrick says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">SN 2023ixf is the nearest supernova of the multi-messenger era</h4>



<p>Historically, light cast by a supernova would be the only cosmic “messenger” astronomers could use to learn about the event. But “one type of messenger is not enough for us to recover all the mysterious things about this kind of collapsing star,” says astrophysicist Zidu Lin of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who studies ghostly subatomic particles called neutrinos, which interact only very weakly with matter.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it’s now possible to detect neutrinos or gravitational waves streaming away from certain celestial objects — possibly including stellar explosions like SN 2023ixf. At just more than 21 million light-years away, the supernova is the closest of its kind to light up the sky within the era of modern “multi-messenger” astronomy. Today’s technology isn’t quite sensitive enough to catch gravitational waves or low energy neutrinos from supernovas outside the Milky Way, including SN 2023ixf, Lin says. However, it is possible to detect a few high energy neutrinos from supernovas in nearby galaxies, like the Pinwheel.</p>



<p>It was a bit surprising, then, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none were detected from SN 2023ixf</a>, researchers reported in September. “The nondetection of the high energy neutrinos, combined with some optical signals, might be able to form a multi-messenger analysis,” Lin says. In particular, it could help astronomers constrain ideas about exactly how high energy neutrinos are generated within dying stars.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-anemones-vents-metal-poisoning">How sea anemones living on deep-sea hydrothermal vents avoid metal poisoning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Life near deep-sea hydrothermal vents can be pretty metal — literally.</p>



<p>In addition to crushing pressures, total darkness and scorching temperatures, poisonous plumes belch from beneath the Earth’s surface. Exhaust from these underwater chimneys contains particles of heavy metals like iron and manganese, which become toxic at high concentrations. But many animals cozy up next to these vents and form thriving communities, seemingly able to withstand the dangerous metals around them.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have a hint of how one creature survives this hard-core environment. The sea anemone <em>Alvinactis idsseensis</em> has a surprising abundance of genes geared toward producing proteins that move metals into a cellular area where they can’t cause harm, researchers report October 20 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Many organisms have a few of these <em>MTP</em> genes for normal metal metabolism. For instance, a related sea anemone that lives in shallow waters has one <em>MTP</em> gene. In comparison, <em>A. idsseensis</em> has 13 <em>MTP</em> genes, marine biologist Haibin Zhang and colleagues found.</p>



<p>The Edmond and Kairei vent fields in the southwest Indian Ocean are home to this abundant, unassuming sea anemone. <em>A. idsseensis “</em>is the dominant species living in these vent fields, and preys on blind shrimps as food,” says Zhang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering in Sanya. “But how these anemones adapt to the vent’s extreme conditions is not well understood.”</p>



<p>The researchers discovered the anemone’s secrets when they <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh0474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed the genome of one of the tentacled invertebrates</a>, collected from the Edmond vent field by the human-occupied vehicle <em>Shenhaiyongshi</em> in 2019. Genetically engineering two of the sea anemone’s most active <em>MTP </em>genes into yeast protected the yeast from toxic levels of iron and manganese, the most common metals in the vent environment.</p>



<p>The proliferation of <em>MTP</em> genes is a metal detoxification strategy also found in plants. The mustard plant <em>Arabidopsis halleri</em>, for example, thrives in soils rich with zinc and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has more <em>MTP</em> genes than its relatives</a>, which can’t withstand too much metal.</p>



<p>Zhang thinks the new finding is evidence of “convergent evolution” between anemones and plants, where similar environmental pressures lead to the development of the same solution in distantly related organisms.</p>



<p>“I do believe that they actually found a good convergence, or at least a similar strategy to detoxify metals,” says Felipe Klein Ricachenevsky, a plant physiologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>How exactly the anemone <em>MTP</em> genes work to prevent metal poisoning remains to be seen. In plants, MTPs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinese-brake-fern-arsenic-fronds">sequester metals into large cellular compartments, or organelles, called vacuoles</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/19</em>). But animal cells don’t have those kinds of vacuoles. “Which organelle is doing that in those animals?” Ricachenevsky asks. “I think that will be very interesting to address in the future.”</p>

                <p>We are proud and grateful to announce that the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have generously dedicated a total of more than $10 million in gifts and grants, respectively, to the support of arXiv. Over 30 years since its founding, arXiv has grown exponentially &#8211; arxiv.org is now home to more than 2 million articles across 8 subject areas. This continued support and generous funding on behalf of both the Simons Foundation and the NSF will allow arXiv to scale sustainably and better serve the arXiv scientific community.</p>
<p>Specifically, the funding from the Simons Foundation will allow arXiv to migrate to the cloud and modernize its code to ensure reliability, fault tolerance, and accessibility for researchers. The next stage of arXiv&#8217;s development will include hiring multiple software developers to support the modernization effort.</p>
<p>“I am deeply grateful for this tremendous support from both the Simons Foundation and the NSF,” said <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/people/greg-morrisett/">Greg Morrisett</a>, the Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of Cornell Tech. “This investment ensures that the arXiv service will continue to scale, to serve an even broader constituency, and better serve the arXiv scientific community.”</p>
<p>“This generous funding from the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation will allow arXiv to expand its critical growth in the scientific community, where it allows thousands of researchers to freely disseminate, exchange, and explore their findings,” said <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/people/ramin-zabih/">Ramin Zabih</a>, arXiv faculty director and professor of computer science at Cornell Tech. “By modernizing the code base and transitioning to the cloud, we are strengthening arXiv’s infrastructure and ensuring that it will continue to be a source of innovation in the sharing of scholarly publications. We are grateful to the Simons Foundation and the NSF for their support and for sharing in our vision for arXiv.”</p>
<p>Funding from NSF grant 2311521 will allow faculty members in Cornell University&#8217;s Department of Computer Science to develop new search and recommendation techniques to be tested and deployed on arXiv, supported by state of the art privacy guarantees.

<p>A professor in France who plagiarized extensively in a review article and then blamed the offense on an undisclosed medical writer will lose the publication, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>“We have decided to retract this paper,” Yi-Xiang Wang, editor-in-chief of <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em>, told us by email.</p>



<p>The move comes one day after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/19/exclusive-professor-in-france-blames-alleged-ghostwriter-for-plagiarism/">a Retraction Watch exclusive</a> describing how the professor, <a href="https://archive.fo/Dvmw6">Romaric Loffroy</a> of CHU Dijon Bourgogne, claimed he had not written the offending paper despite being listed as its first and corresponding author. Instead, Loffroy put the blame on an alleged medical writer.</p>



<p>The retraction will be Loffroy’s first. He did not immediately respond to our request for comments.</p>



<span id="more-128081"></span>



<p>Wang said he was looking into whether the paper, <a href="https://qims.amegroups.org/article/view/8064/html">“Current role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer,”</a> had undergone a plagiarism check.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said the article’s speedy acceptance in just 14 days was “not common, but not very rare. Back in 2015, we have many invited papers, I assume that was an invited review, the review was done by editorial board members, this can be done in 7-10 days’ time.”</p>



<p>But he chided Loffroy, who since 2017 has been deputy editor of the journal, for allegedly having others write his papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I personally do not think using medical writer is a good idea at all,” said Wang. “In any case, the 1st author/corresponding author should take full responsibility.”</p>



<p>Whether the case will affect Loffroy’s position at the journal “will be up to the publisher,” Wang said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-planet-destabilization-earth-moon-meteorite">Giant planet ‘destabilization’ may have coincided with the birth of Earth’s moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>A long-ago reshuffling of the giant planets in our solar system may have been instrumental in giving Earth its moon.</p>



<p>For decades, planetary scientists have hypothesized that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were born much closer to the sun and that gravitational interactions among those planets <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-radiation-solar-system-planet-orbit-astronomy">jolted them into their contemporary trajectories</a> (<em>SN: 5/10/22</em>). But the timing of that “giant planet orbital instability” has been tricky to nail down.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of meteorite data suggests that the instability took place between 60 million and 100 million years after the solar system started forming, planetary scientist Alessandro Morbidelli reported October 5 in San Antonio at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society’s Division for Planetary Sciences. That timing also roughly coincides with when Earth’s moon is thought to have formed in the wake of a Mars-sized planet running into our own.</p>





<p>The instability of the giant planets “is related to a complete reshaping of the solar system, the formation of the cometary reservoirs, the sculpting of the asteroid belt,&#8221; says Morbidelli, of the Observatoire de la Côte d&#8217;Azur in Nice, France. &#8220;Understanding when it occurred means fixing a milestone in the history of the solar system.&#8221;</p>



<p>The giant planet migration, first proposed by Morbidelli and colleagues in 2005, is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a widely accepted hypothesis</a> for explaining much about the solar system. In particular, the giant planets travel along slightly elongated orbits that are askew to one another. But observations of other planetary systems and computer simulations of planet formation suggest that giant planets, in general, form on closer-in orbits that are circular and coplanar. Using simulations, Morbidelli and others showed that if the giant planets in our solar system formed like that, they wouldn’t stay that way. Gravitational interactions would eventually knock the planets into the orbits they have today.</p>



<p>At first, the team thought this instability occurred about 600 million years after the birth of the solar system. That timing meant the migration of the giant planets <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could also explain an apparent asteroid bombardment</a> of the terrestrial planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — as evidenced by craters on the moon and lunar rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts. More recent work, however, has cast doubt on the reality of this “lunar cataclysm.”</p>



<p>Now, Morbidelli suspects the orbital instability came a lot earlier. His reasoning starts with a rare type of meteorite called EL enstatite chondrites.</p>



<p>The mix of elements in these meteorites suggests they must be the remnants of a large rocky body, a few hundred kilometers across, born near the terrestrial planets in the dusty disk that once swirled around our sun.</p>



<p>Then, in 2022, Morbidelli and colleagues showed that any of these enstatites that land on Earth today must come <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/09/aa44590-22/aa44590-22.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from a collection of bits and pieces in the asteroid belt</a> between Mars and Jupiter. Those bits all broke off Athor, one of the many asteroids there, after it collided long ago with some other object in the belt. Altogether, that family of material adds up to an asteroid roughly 60 kilometers across — much smaller than the one thought to have birthed the enstatites in the first place. That means Athor must be only one piece of that larger rocky body, left over from a collision that destroyed it much closer to the sun.</p>



<p>&#8220;The question is, which dynamical mechanism can allow the implantation of Athor in the asteroid belt?&#8221; Morbidelli said at the meeting.</p>



<p>He tried computer simulations of several possibilities, but so far, only the giant planet instability seems capable of sending Athor to a stable orbit in the asteroid belt.</p>



<p>This couldn&#8217;t have happened earlier than 60 million years after the birth of the solar system, Morbidelli said. Radioactive elements in the enstatite chondrites indicate their parent body was slowly cooling until then, which means it was still large. It hadn&#8217;t yet collided with one of the many other planetesimals stirred around by the forming terrestrial planets.</p>



<p>On the other hand, simulations suggest the instability can&#8217;t have occurred later than about 100 million years after the solar system began. A study in 2018 concluded that if the giant planets migrated later, a pair of asteroids dubbed Patroclus-Menoetius, trailing Jupiter around the sun while orbiting each other, would have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0564-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been pulled apart</a>.</p>





<p>That 60-million- to 100-million-year window makes the instability a prime suspect in the diversion of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-planet-collision-earth-plate-tectonics">a hypothesized planet that hit Earth</a>, creating the moon (<em>SN: 3/15/23</em>).&nbsp; The timing &#8220;seems right,&#8221; says Matthew Clement, an astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.&nbsp; &#8220;Lots of things were happening in the solar system&#8217;s early history. However, dynamically speaking, we don&#8217;t have a whole lot of reason to believe that things changed much after the moon-forming impact.&#8221;</p>



<p>But he cautions that Morbidelli&#8217;s estimate is based on &#8220;one data point, of the breakup of one asteroid, pieces of which serendipitously happened to get to Earth.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, &#8220;it&#8217;s nice that [the new result] is actually based on some real data, even if it&#8217;s indirectly, rather than just computer models,&#8221; says planetary scientist John Chambers. He has questions, though. &#8220;They suggest this happened when the formation of the terrestrial planets was more or less complete, apart maybe from the giant impact that formed the moon,” says Chambers, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. “But then there&#8217;s a good chance it would have messed up the orbits of the terrestrial planets and possibly led to some of them colliding,” which the current lineup of planets suggests did not happen.</p>



<p>Both Chambers and Matthews have worked on scenarios in which the orbital instability occurred even earlier, just a few million years after the solar system began. That earlier time for the instability would help explain one of the outstanding riddles of the solar system: the relatively small size of Mars compared with Earth and Venus. That’s because the instability would have removed many objects from near the orbit of Mars before it could grow to the size of Earth or larger. The new result from Morbidelli’s team seems to exclude that solution.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m prepared to rely on the evidence,&#8221; Chambers says. But he isn&#8217;t convinced yet because many facets of the solar system&#8217;s present structure must be reconciled with any date for the giant planet instability.</p>



<p>Clement agrees. &#8220;There&#8217;s problems if the instability happened at 500 million years. There&#8217;s still problems that we have to resolve if it happened when they say it happened,” he says. “And there&#8217;s still problems if it happened immediately after the planets formed, in the first few million years. This story is not done being told yet.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-virus-crispr-editing-disease">Most of today’s gene therapies rely on viruses — and that’s a problem</a></h4>

              
                <p>Will Ungerer isn’t a typical fourth-grader.</p>



<p>The 10-year-old from Midlothian, Va., plays tag with his friends and swims in the ocean. “I think his peers would describe him as someone who is kind, sweet and funny, and supersmart,” says his mother, Sheila Ungerer. He won a countywide citizenship award and was named classroom student of the year.</p>



<p>But “he’s not a really fast runner,” his peers might say. “He doesn’t really run.” Will was born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease that causes muscles throughout the body to break down over time. That includes not only skeletal muscles, but also the heart and diaphragm, which controls breathing. Eventually those important muscles stop working properly, leading to death. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene responsible for dystrophin, a protein that acts as a shock absorber to prevent damage as muscles contract. It affects an estimated 4.8 out of 100,000 people worldwide, mainly boys and young men. About 10,000 people in the United States have Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>





<p>Will celebrated his birthday last year at a laser tag park, his mother says, but other kids his age with Duchenne’s “don’t ride the bus. They don’t carry their tray in the lunchroom.”</p>



<p>The difference is that Will received an experimental gene therapy when he was 5 years old. Just before Christmas in 2018, doctors at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, gave Will an infusion of viruses. Those viruses delivered instructions to his muscles for making a short form of the dystrophin protein. Scientists at Sarepta Therapeutics in Cambridge, Mass., the company that makes the gene therapy, developed this version, called microdystrophin, to act as a replacement, hopefully protecting muscles from harm.</p>



<p>Though the therapy did not show statistically meaningful improvements compared with a placebo in one randomized controlled trial and results of an ongoing clinical trial to determine efficacy aren’t yet published, Will and the 83 other boys in Sarepta’s clinical trials now make the microdystrophin protein. Based in part on that evidence, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-gene-therapy-muscular-dystrophy-kids">approved the therapy</a> earlier this year for use in 4- and 5-year-olds, and the <a href="https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-announces-second-quarter-2023-financial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first child to get the therapy after approval</a> was infused on August 2.</p>

<p>For Sheila Ungerer, there’s no question that the gene therapy is working for Will. He now does everyday things he couldn’t before, such as climb stairs easily and brush his teeth and get dressed on his own. He can ride a bike and swims up to 500&nbsp;meters at swim team practice.</p>



<p>A few months after the infusion, Sheila overheard Will talking to his younger brother Adam. “I was just outside the door, and he said, ‘Adam, remember when my legs used to hurt all the time? They don’t hurt anymore,’ ” she recalls. “That was his experience of life with inflamed muscles in his legs that were being damaged constantly. And then for that to subside is just an immeasurable impact on his life.”</p>



<p>The FDA has approved seven other gene therapies for rare genetic diseases, all since 2017. Each puts a healthy copy of a gene into cells to compensate for a missing or mutated one. Some potential treatments for rare diseases that use gene editing, a type of gene therapy that makes targeted changes at the DNA level, may soon win approval too.</p>



<p>Around the world, more than 2,000 gene therapies are in development, according to the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy. That figure includes cells that have been genetically engineered to fight diseases, such as immune cells called CAR-T&nbsp;cells <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">programmed to kill cancer</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lupus-car-t-cell-therapy-remission-autoimmune-disease">keep lupus from attacking the body</a> (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>;<em> SN: 9/15/22</em>). But unlike these therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases — which could treat potentially millions of people, making them financially attractive to drug companies — each gene therapy for a rare disease may help thousands of patients or fewer.</p>



<p>Since gene therapy was first proposed to treat such genetic diseases in the 1970s, it has had thrilling highs — including the first successful gene therapy, in 1990, in a 4-year-old born with severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID — and deeply troubling lows. Clinical trial participants have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-history-high-profile-failures">ended up with cancer and other serious health complications</a> and have even died. The biggest problem appears to be the viruses used to ferry replacement genes where they need to go. Viruses are the obvious choice for delivery: They can carry the replacement gene in their own DNA or RNA and have built-in mechanisms for getting into cells. But viruses can’t always get the genes to the right cells, can slip their cargo into the wrong spot in the DNA and can trigger the immune system to set off deadly inflammation.</p>



<p>Challenges and setbacks, including the death of a teenager named Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, nearly derailed gene therapy. But researchers, companies and patient advocacy groups persevered. Today, researchers are finding new ways to tackle their delivery dilemmas. Some are developing better viruses or nonviral ferries, while others are using new tools to repair or replace damaged genes in place. One technique, tested so far only in mice, relies on technology similar to what has been used in COVID-19 vaccines.</p>





<p>Some researchers say the outlook has never been brighter for gene therapy for a wide variety of inherited diseases. Others are frustrated by the slow progress.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s the current state of gene therapy?</h4>



<p>When scientists discovered the gene that is mutated in cystic fibrosis in 1989, gene therapy was just about to be demonstrated in clinical trials in people. “We were all saying, ‘There’s going to be gene therapy next year,’ ” says Garry Cutting, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University who studies the disease.</p>



<p>But that prediction didn’t pan out. There have been at least <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.1015926/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36&nbsp;gene therapy trials</a> involving more than 600 people with cystic fibrosis, none with lasting success, researchers reported in 2022 in <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em>.</p>



<p>“And what’s the problem? The problem has always been delivery,” Cutting says. “How do you get it in the right place?”</p>



<p>For cystic fibrosis, which affects more than 160,000 people worldwide, the right place is the lungs, where mutations in a gene called <em>CFTR</em> result in the buildup of sticky mucus that makes it hard to breathe. Numerous clinical trials have attempted to slip a healthy copy of the gene into stem cells that replenish the airway lining. But it’s not easy for viruses to get through the sticky mucus, past patrolling immune cells, through layers of unrelated cells and into the stem cells. “It’s a harsh environment. It’s a tough problem,” Cutting says.</p>



<p>Because of similar struggles, many of the first gene therapies to win approval instead harvest a patient’s blood-forming stem cells, grow and genetically modify the cells in the lab and then return the modified cells to the patient, usually in the form of a bone marrow transplant. That is also the approach that CAR-T&nbsp;cell therapies for cancer use.</p>



<p>Editing cells outside the body, or ex vivo, has worked for rare diseases that affect the blood or immune system. Yet it comes with limitations, since scientists haven’t worked out ways to extract stem cells from tissues other than blood and bone marrow and replace them later. It also comes with its own dangers. It typically requires chemo­therapy to kill existing bone marrow so the modified cells can take hold and replicate. And the viruses ferrying the replacement genes into the cells in the lab can still be problematic.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ex vivo versus in vivo therapy</h3>



<p>Many early gene therapies remove stem cells (circles) from a patient’s body, modify them with the help of viruses (hexagons) and then return the modified cells. This ex vivo approach often requires chemotherapy and only works for some diseases. In vivo therapies modify cells in the body, but getting the therapies to the right cells can be a problem.</p>

<p>Early gene therapies used retroviruses, which often insert their DNA cargo near active genes. Some children who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delivering-goods">got gene therapy in 1999 and 2000</a> for inherited diseases that disable the immune system <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-treats-children-rare-diseases">developed leukemia</a> when the inserted gene ramped up activity of nearby cancer-causing genes (<em>SN:&nbsp;1/14/03</em>;<em> SN: 7/11/13</em>).</p>



<p>Most gene therapies today instead rely on viruses engineered to deliver their cargo to safer locations and to cause less of an immune response. But still, the track record is far from spotless.</p>



<p>In September 2022, for example, the gene therapy company bluebird bio, based in Somerville, Mass., received FDA approval for an ex vivo lentivirus-delivered gene therapy for children with a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease known as <a href="https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-receives-fda-accelerated-approval-skysonar-gene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy</a>. About 1 in 4,000 to about 1 in&nbsp;50,000 babies born will have adrenoleukodystrophy, and 35 percent to 40 percent of boys with the disease develop the severe form, which typically leads to death within five to 10 years if treatment doesn’t work. The approval came despite three cases of a type of cancer called myelodysplastic syndrome among clinical trial participants. The company determined that the lentivirus was indeed at fault and the therapy, called Skysona, comes with a warning about the cancer risk and recommendation for yearly cancer screening for 15 years.</p>



<p>Researchers have had successes with gene therapies that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blindness-retinitis-pigmentosa-gene-therapy-vision-optogenetics">work in the body for some forms of blindness</a> (<em>SN: 5/24/21</em>) and with a degenerative nervous system disorder called <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-innovative-gene-therapy-treat-pediatric-patients-spinal-muscular-atrophy-rare-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spinal muscular atrophy</a>. Will Ungerer’s gene therapy also relies on an in vivo approach. In all three cases, the replacement genes are delivered by adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs. These viruses usually drop their cargo in the nucleus where it hangs out separately from the rest of a person’s DNA.</p>



<p>But the payload size of AAVs is limited, they may not infect all cells equally, and they can trigger dangerous and deadly immune responses. Patients who have gotten gene therapies delivered by AAVs have also developed liver damage or failure and microscopic blood clots that can lead to organ damage.</p>



<p>On top of all those risks, once the immune system of a patient receiving in vivo gene therapy makes antibodies and defenses against a delivery virus, redosing becomes difficult or impossible.</p>



<p>On March 22, 2018, Conner Curran of Ridgefield, Conn., then 7&nbsp;years old, became the first person to get an experimental in&nbsp;vivo gene therapy developed by Pfizer for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. “Before gene therapy, he really struggled to go up the stairs,” says Conner’s father, Chris Curran. “Two months after gene therapy, he’s running up the stairs.”</p>



<p>Chris and his wife, Jessica, founders of the nonprofit Kindness Over Muscular Dystrophy, an organization that raises money for muscular dystrophy research, marveled at the improvements in Conner’s strength and agility. That’s just not something that happens for children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Chris says. “It’s a progressive muscle-wasting disease.… You don’t ever get better. You just get worse and worse and worse, and we actually saw him getting better.”</p>



<p>Though the improvement continued for three to four years, Chris and Jessica have observed a slow decline over the last year. “We knew going into this that it wasn’t necessarily a cure,” Chris says. He is hopeful that the gene therapy may still buy Conner and other boys time by strengthening their heart and diaphragm muscles, but Conner may need another dose of gene therapy to keep his skeletal muscles from deteriorating.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, now age 13, Conner has high levels of antibodies against the AAVs that delivered Pfizer’s version of micro­dystrophin to his muscles. He will be one of six children who previously got gene therapy to enter <a href="https://www.mda.org/press-releases/cureduchenne-mda-and-parent-project-muscular-dystrophy-announce-collaborative-project-to-focus-on-re-dosing-gene-therapy-in-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a clinical trial aimed at lowering their antibody levels</a> against the AAVs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Getting healthy cells in</h3>



<p>All gene therapies for rare diseases that are approved today put a healthy copy of a gene into cells, but the therapies differ in how they get the gene in.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">CRISPR gene therapy comes along</h4>



<p>Even when a virus gets its cargo to the right cells — the right zip code — that doesn’t mean it’ll find the right address. Even today’s viruses don’t usually deliver the gene to its normal location in the DNA, says Matthew Porteus, a physician-scientist at Stanford School of Medicine. The delivery locations aren’t completely haphazard, but they’re not entirely predictable either. It’s a bit like ordering a pair of pants for store pickup at Old Navy. The pants will get to <em>an</em> Old Navy, but until they arrive, you won’t know exactly which one.</p>



<p>For some genes, it’s fine to place them elsewhere in the genome or let them hang out outside of chromosomes, Porteus says. Other genes have to be turned on at just the right time or active in precise amounts. That’s hard to do when the genes aren’t in their native habitat. Getting a gene to its normal location was no easy feat when Porteus started working on gene therapy in 1997, he says.</p>



<p>Then CRISPR gene editing came along. CRISPR is something like a molecular, GPS-guided pair of scissors — usually a protein called Cas9 — that seeks out and cuts DNA at precise locations. Since it debuted in 2012, researchers have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">using the tool to cut, repair or insert genes</a> in exactly the desired place in experiments with human cells grown in lab dishes and with animals (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Some companies have begun using CRISPR-based gene therapies in clinical trials with people. Several are taking blood-forming stem cells from patients, editing the cells in a lab, then giving the cells back to patients in a bone marrow transplant. And again, transplanting edited cells back into a patient first requires chemotherapy to kill existing bone marrow to make way for the engineered cells. But viruses aren’t always necessary to deliver the CRISPR scissors and GPS locator to the cells to be edited.</p>



<p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals, based in Boston, is collaborating with CRISPR Therapeutics, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, to use CRISPR/Cas9 to break the DNA in a way that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-editor-first-human-clinical-trials">turns on fetal hemoglobin</a> in people with either beta-thalassemia or sickle-cell disease (<em>SN: 8/14/19</em>). Both conditions mess with oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in red blood cells. About 60,000 people worldwide are born with symptomatic cases of beta-thalassemia each year, and sickle-cell disease is estimated to affect about 100,000 people in the United States alone, with Black and Hispanic people most likely to get the disease.</p>



<p>Victoria Gray, the first person to get the therapy for sickle-cell disease, in 2019, recounted her experience March 6 in London at the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2023/03/2023-human-genome-editing-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing</a>. When her red blood cells collapsed into sickles and clogged blood vessels because of faulty hemoglobin, Gray faced sudden, unpredictable bouts of intense pain, she said. “The pain I would feel in my body was like being struck by lightning and hit by a freight train all at once.” She was often hospitalized to get blood transfusions and opioid painkillers that didn’t always help. One particularly bad episode struck in October 2010. Gray, a 37-year-old mother of four from Mississippi, said she didn’t leave the hospital until the following January. Even afterward, she couldn’t feed herself or walk on her own.</p>



<p>But on July 2, 2019, Gray got three vials of her own bone marrow cells edited to make fetal hemoglobin. The worst part was the recovery from chemotherapy, she said. “It took about seven to eight months for me to physically feel and mentally accept that I was better,” she told the crowd of scientists, ethicists and other experts. Thanks to her “super cells,” she now has a full-time job, attends her children’s football games and cheerleading events and can enjoy family outings. “The life that I once felt like I was only existing in, I’m now thriving in.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://news.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/positive-results-pivotal-trials-exa-cel-transfusion-dependent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preliminary results of the clinical trials</a>, announced in June, showed that 24 of 27 people with beta-thalassemia who previously required blood transfusions hadn’t needed a transfusion for at least a year after getting the therapy. Of 17 sickle-cell disease patients analyzed, 16 had made it at least a year without a pain crisis. All 17 avoided hospitalization for at least a year.</p>



<p>This approach and <a href="https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-positive-initial-edit-301-safety-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another sickle-cell therapy</a> from Editas Medicine in Cambridge, Mass., break one gene to compensate for another. Porteus, of Stanford, is instead interested in using CRISPR to get a healthy replacement gene in. Such a strategy might work well for diseases where any one of thousands of mutations in a gene can be to blame, Porteus says. For cystic fibrosis, for example, 719 different mutations in the <em>CFTR</em> gene have been shown to cause the disease.</p>



<p>The team is working on techniques to increase the chances that the cuts the CRISPR scissors make will be repaired by inserting a healthy copy of the gene into the breach. This copy-and-paste method, known as homology-directed repair, rarely works, but Porteus and colleagues are making improvements. In one study, cells taken from patients with sickle-cell disease were edited and then transplanted into mice. Up to 20&nbsp;percent of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abf2444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defective genes had been replaced</a>, his team reported in 2021 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>

<p>Other researchers are pursuing what’s called CRISPR base editing to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03609-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alter just the typo that causes a genetic disease</a>. This tool can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-crispr-gene-editors-can-fix-rna-and-dna-one-typo-time">fix single DNA-letter mutations</a>, chemically changing one DNA base, the information-carrying portion of the DNA molecule (<em>SN: 10/25/17</em>).</p>



<p>Cells edited outside the body can be examined before they go back in, to ensure safety. But researchers are also trying to push CRISPR editing into the body. Those strategies, though, come with concerns over misplaced cuts that can cause stray mutations, plus some still may require potentially risky viral delivery.</p>



<p>In October 2022, 27-year-old <a href="https://www.cureraredisease.org/blog-posts/to-our-community-an-update-on-our-crd-tmh-001-clinical-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terry Hogan died</a> after getting an AAV-delivered CRISPR gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in a trial sponsored by the nonprofit organization Cure Rare Diseases. Hogan’s death was the result of an immune reaction to high doses of the AAV9 virus needed to carry the gene therapy to his muscles. That immune reaction set off <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2307798" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cytokine storm that damaged his lungs and led to his death</a>, researchers reported September 28 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Viral delivery isn&#8217;t the only option</h4>



<p>Cutting, the geneticist at Johns Hopkins, has high hopes for nonviral delivery vehicles for in vivo therapies. These molecular FedEx trucks are usually composed of lipids, proteins and chemicals that form bubbles that protect the genetic cargo and transport it to where it needs to go. If you got a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, you’ve already had such nanoparticles — in this case carrying messenger RNA — injected into your body. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is an RNA copy of DNA’s instructions for building a protein.</p>



<p>Researchers have deployed nanoparticles to edit blood-forming stem cells in mice without removing the cells. The nanoparticles were studded with antibodies that targeted them to blood-forming stem cells in the bone marrow, says Hamideh Parhiz, a pharmacologist and biotechnologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The researchers also edited human cells carrying the sickle-cell mutation in the lab. In that case, the mRNA carried instructions for making a CRISPR base editor, which converted the sickle-cell mutation to a base that doesn’t cause sickling. Up to 88 percent of cells were edited, and under conditions that usually cause sickling, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade6967" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the crescent shapes were almost absent</a>, Parhiz and colleagues reported July 28 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“In proof of principle, this paper is basically talking about the medicine of [the] future,” says Stefano Rivella, coauthor of the paper and a molecular biologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He predicts such in vivo editing — because it dispenses with harvesting stem cells and chemotherapy — will be much cheaper than current gene therapies, which can cost millions of dollars. Rivella imagines vials of mRNA-loaded nanoparticles shipped to Africa or other places where there are many people with sickle-cell disease.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What does success look like?</h4>



<p>But that’s not where we are today. Consider, for example, 14-year-old Antonio Vento. He was born with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, which is caused by a mutation in a gene that produces a collagen protein that helps layers of skin stay together. Antonio and others with the condition develop blisters and wounds when even slight friction tears the outer layer of their skin or mucus membranes away from the middle layer. Scarring in the mouth and esophagus can make swallowing difficult.</p>



<p>Extensive scarring also obscured Antonio’s vision. He had two surgeries in 2016 and 2017 on his left eye to remove the scars, but they came back two to three months later. The procedures kept failing, so “we decided not to do any additional surgeries,” ophthalmologist Alfonso Sabater of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami Health System and the Miller School of Medicine said July 24 during a news conference. There appeared to be little hope for saving Antonio’s vision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3-675x450.jpg" alt="Antonio Vento leans in and looks into an ophthalmoscope as a doctor examines his eyes while his mom looks on in the background." class="wp-image-3132429" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132429">Antonio Vento has a rare genetic disease that causes blisters and wounds on his skin. Scarring had obscured his vision until a gene therapy he’d been using for his skin was reformulated as eye drops.

OF MIAMI MILLER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But in 2020, as part of a clinical trial, Antonio had been using a gene therapy gel developed by Krystal Biotech in Pittsburgh to keep his skin from blistering. The therapy, which is applied to the skin, uses herpes simplex virus to deliver the collagen <em>COL7A1 </em>gene to skin cells. It <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-topical-gene-therapy-treatment-wounds-patients-dystrophic-epidermolysis-bullosa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received FDA approval</a> in May.</p>



<p>Desperate for a solution for his patient, Sabater worked with Krystal Biotech to reformulate the gene therapy as eye drops that might work for Antonio. The eye drops went through two years of testing for safety and efficacy. After that long haul, last year, the FDA granted permission for Antonio to get the eye drops on a compassionate use basis.</p>



<p>He’s the only person in the world getting the drops, which he started using weekly after surgeries to remove existing scarring. “It’s hard to say that this treatment is effective for these type of patients just with one case,” Sabater said. “But so far, the results look promising. And we’re very excited about the future, because definitely this treatment may open new possibilities.”</p>



<p>Antonio has recovered nearly all of his vision in one eye and about 60 percent in the other, and the scars haven’t returned. But since the effects are temporary, it’s likely that he will need regular doses for years.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignright">

<p>Antonio’s situation highlights one of the big challenges of gene therapy. For now, it’s a boutique treatment, Porteus says, and that is expensive. The rarity of the diseases makes it hard for drug companies to recoup what they’ve invested, and thus makes them reluctant to invest to begin with.</p>



<p>Having the technology is not enough, notes Maria Grazia Roncarolo, the cofounder, president and head of research and development for Tr1X, a biotech company in La Jolla, Calif.</p>



<p>In the 1980s, Roncarolo helped pioneer a gene therapy for “bubble babies,” children with SCID caused by mutations in the gene encoding adenosine deaminase, also called ADA-SCID. While at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy in Milan, Roncarolo and colleagues <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1070104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported curing two children</a> in 2002. The pharmaceutical giant GSK licensed the therapy, called Strimvelis, and <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-gene-therapy-treatment-children-ultra-rare-immune-disorder-recommended-approval" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got approval</a> from the European Medicines Agency in 2016 to use the treatment for children who don’t have a suitable bone marrow donor. “This was a beautiful story. And when the product was approved in 2016, we celebrated [with] champagne,” Roncarolo says.</p>



<p>Despite this approval though, patients can get the therapy only by going to Italy for compassionate use treatment. “GSK decided to disinvest in rare genetic diseases because they thought that was a market which was not big enough and profitable enough,” Roncarolo says. Orchard Therapeutics, based in London, which inherited the therapy, announced in 2020 that it was reducing its investment in ADA-SCID to focus on less rare diseases. The Telethon Institute now holds rights to the therapy and is trying to commercialize it, she says. “You can imagine the frustration for me and all the people that contributed to bring this product to the market.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the European Medicines Agency <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-gene-therapy-treat-rare-inherited-blood-condition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved an AAV-based gene therapy</a> for beta-thalassemia from bluebird bio in March 2019, but the company pulled the product from the European market in 2021. European health care systems were trying to negotiate lower prices for the therapy than the company thought it was worth.</p>



<p>Showing that a therapy is safe and effective is just one part. “The real challenge for these products,” Roncarolo says, “is to make sure — especially for rare genetic diseases — that they find a home in a company that has the motivation and resources to commercialize them.”</p>



<p>The stories of Antonio Vento, Will Ungerer, Victoria Gray and others show that patients are benefiting from gene therapy today. There are plenty of signs of progress over the last decades. But even if the biggest scientific hurdles fall, there remain many hurdles to fixing broken genes.</p>

<p>A neuroscientist who studies alcohol and stress faked data in two published studies and two grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), according to a U.S. government watchdog.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://psychologyneuroscience.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/lara-s-hwa-phd">Lara S. Hwa</a>, an assistant professor of neuroscience at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, since January 2021, “engaged in research misconduct by knowingly or recklessly falsifying and/or fabricating data, methods, results, and conclusions in animal models of alcohol use disorders,” the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-hwa-lara-s">concluded in its findings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI found Hwa, who has not immediately responded to our request for comment, “falsified and/or fabricated experimental timelines, group conditions, sex of animal subjects, mouse strains, and behavioral response data” in the grant applications and papers. The articles were published when she was a postdoc at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. </p>



<span id="more-128076"></span>



<p>One of the grant applications in which ORI said Hwa submitted fake data, “Long-term Alcohol Drinking Alters Stress Engagement of BNST Circuit Elements,” was funded for $734,145. The other grant application was “administratively withdrawn” last December. Hwa was a principal investigator on another grant, not included in ORI’s findings, that received $84,218 from 2013-2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59709">Alcohol drinking alters stress response to predator odor via BNST kappa opioid receptor signaling in male mice</a>,” one of the papers included in ORI’s findings, appeared in <em>eLife</em> in July 2020. The authors <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/74986">retracted it</a> in November 2021 “based on error [sic] in methods and data reporting, which they identified following publication, that cast doubt on the conclusions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extensive retraction notice stated that five co-authors, not including Hwa, the first author, notified the senior author of an error in the published data. Then, the authors “deeply examined the results and identified several more errors” in the paper, which are detailed in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For several figures, the authors determined the published data “did not match the raw data values,” and after re-analyzing the raw data, “there were multiple changes in statistical significance, leading to an overall change in the interpretation of the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The changes that would be required to correct the paper are sufficiently extensive that its overall conclusions must currently be considered to be in doubt. All of the authors are in agreement that retraction is the appropriate course of action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0279-2">Predator odor increases avoidance and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the prelimbic cortex via corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 signaling</a>,” published in <em>Neuropsychopharmacology</em> in 2018, has not been flagged. As part of the settlement agreement Hwa agreed to, she must request that the paper – which has been cited 24 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – be corrected or retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hwa also agreed to four years of supervision of her research, beginning on August 18 of this year. During the four years of supervision, she also may not serve on any NIH advisory or peer review committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Baylor University has not immediately responded to our request for comment on the findings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/10-billion-snow-crabs-disappeared-alaska">10 billion snow crabs have disappeared off the Alaskan coast. Here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p>From 2018 to 2021, an estimated 10 billion snow crabs disappeared from the eastern Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, with the population plummeting to record lows in 2021. Researchers had only speculated as to what happened to the missing crabs. Now, a study in the Oct. 20 <em>Science </em>finds that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk7565" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a marine heat wave probably spurred a mass die-off</a>, in part by causing crabs to starve.</p>



<p>“It’s a fishery disaster in the truest sense of the word,” says Cody Szuwalski, a fishery biologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle.</p>





<p>On average, snow crabs bring in about $150 million of annual revenue for Alaskan fisheries. In the 2021-2022 crabbing season, that revenue fell to around $24 million. With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">marine heat waves becoming more common</a> because of human-caused climate change, the future of such fisheries and arctic marine ecosystems, more broadly, is uncertain, researchers say (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>)<em>.</em></p>



<p>The new research can help fishery managers anticipate and prepare for similar events such as the crab collapse in the future, Szuwalski says, particularly when it comes to getting proper disaster aid to affected fishers quickly.</p>



<p>Usually, cold, arctic water makes ideal habitat for snow crabs (<em>Chionoecetes opilio</em>) and other crustaceans. As winter’s thick sea ice melts, the frigid meltwater settles on the seafloor, creating a cold-water pool with temperatures below 2˚ Celsius. Crabs thrive in this chilly sanctuary on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. But a marine heat wave in the region in 2018 and 2019 prevented the usual amount of sea ice from forming, and, according to yearly temperature and population survey data, the cold pool never appeared and then the crab population collapsed.</p>



<p>Szuwalski and colleagues used computer models to analyze temperature data combined with population surveys, fishing catch numbers and lab experiments to look for drivers behind the sudden collapse. Two causes stood out: higher water temperatures and an initially dense crab population.</p>



<p>The water temperature probably didn’t kill the crabs directly, as snow crabs in laboratories can survive in waters up to 12° C. Instead, the crabs might have starved to death, Szuwalski says.</p>



<p>Data show the crab population initially boomed in 2018 — reaching historic highs — thanks to ideal ocean conditions for newborn crabs around 2010. But the crabs also occupied a smaller area than normal, though Szuwalski and colleagues are uncertain why. That means more crabs were crammed onto less space on the shelf. Then came the heat wave. Higher water temperatures can rev the cold-blooded crabs&#8217; metabolism; previous research has shown that the calorie requirements of snow crabs in labs almost double as water temperature rises from 0° to 3° C.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the crowded crabs probably needed more food, but because of the smaller foraging area they had even fewer resources to sink their claws into. Compared with similar-sized crabs from the previous year, those surveyed in 2018 had lower body weights, another clue starvation played a role in the missing crabs.</p>



<p>“It’s just yet another example of something we didn’t expect, but now we have to live with,” says Christopher Harley, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who was not involved with the research. In the eastern Bering Sea, it could take at least four years before more crabs of a fishable size start showing up, meaning fishers there will remain in a lurch.</p>



<p>Such effects of marine heat waves are likely to extend beyond snow crabs. Ecosystems in northern latitudes, such as Alaska’s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">are changing more rapidly</a> in response to climate change than anywhere else (<em>SN: 8/11/22)</em>. Scientists can typically use data from the past to help predict and prepare for changes in the future. But the future increasingly holds events that have never happened on record before — like the snow crab population collapse — so they’re harder to prepare for, Harley says.</p>



<p>That’s especially true, he says, because there hasn’t been enough attention on the secondary effects of marine heat waves on cold-blooded creatures, such as higher calorie needs and the risk of starvation.</p>

<p>The sole author of the article, Sara Gershfeld Litvak, “decided to retract the article due to her commitment to scientific integrity and ethical values,” following “a rigorous review process,” according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/issue/view/61/65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">undated retraction notice</a>&nbsp;on page 266 of the special issue. Litvak is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhcoe.org/about-bhcoe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founder and CEO</a>&nbsp;of the Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (BHCOE), a company that offers accreditation for organizations that provide ABA services, and she co-founded the Autism Investor Summit, an annual meeting focused on the business side of autism services. She is also an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calexpartners.com/sara-gershfeld-litvak.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advisory board member</a>&nbsp;for Calex Partners, a firm that provides advice on mergers and acquisitions for autism-related businesses.</p>



<p>The original retraction notice did not mention any specific issues with the article, which is no longer available on the journal’s website. A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/article/view/2141/649" target="_blank">correction notice</a>&nbsp;to the issue’s introduction, published 4 October, says that the editors retracted Litvak’s article “due to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that led to numerous inaccuracies within the reference and the body of the paper.” A close examination of a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spectrumnews-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/19124325/Litvak-Private-Equity-Investment-Friend-or-Foe-highlighted.pdf" target="_blank">PDF copy</a>&nbsp;of the article obtained by&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Retraction Watch</em>&nbsp;revealed that nearly two-thirds of the article’s references appear to not exist.</p>



<p>Litvak did not respond to an email request for comment and is on “personal leave” from BHCOE, according to an autoreply message. The journal’s editor-in-chief deferred questions to the special issue’s editors, who said they “do not have anything additional to add beyond the retraction notice and erratum to the introduction article.”</p>



<p>Of the 36 references in Litvak’s article, the DOI hyperlinks given for 18 of them either link to a different article or return an error message stating that the DOI is “not found,” <em>Spectrum</em> and <em>Retraction Watch</em>’s analysis shows. The article titles provided in 22 of the references do not appear in the cited journals’ table of contents or in Google search results. An additional three references appear to contain errors, such as an incorrect author or year of publication.</p>



<p>The ABA services market — and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/optimism-greets-investors-sudden-interest-autism-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">private-equity investment in service providers</a>&nbsp;— has been expanding over the past decade, amid an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-by-the-numbers-explaining-its-apparent-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparent rise in autism prevalence</a>&nbsp;and changes in U.S. federal and state laws that began compelling insurance companies to cover autism treatment. The field has had its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/low-standards-corrode-quality-popular-autism-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing pains</a>, and investors’ growing involvement has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/private-equity-harms-autism-service-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial</a>: Some private-equity-backed ABA firms have provided substandard services for children or even engaged in fraudulent billing, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/15/private-equity-autism-aba-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>.</p>



<p>In her article, Litvak argued that concerns about the quality of care and ethics should not be “isolated to the ownership or oversight of the organization.” She included many positive points about private-equity involvement in ABA — often citing the nonexistent references. For example, one sentence that cited a source&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Retraction Watch</em>&nbsp;could not locate stated that “Investment capital in ABA-based therapy has resulted in some benefits such as increased innovation, increased access to care, and greater adherence to regulations and guidelines.”</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://cepr.net/report/pocketing-money-meant-for-kids-private-equity-in-autism-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>&nbsp;published in July by the Center for Economic and Policy Research appears to be the only work that has cited Litvak’s paper, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11289751974135314981&amp;as_sdt=5,33&amp;sciodt=0,33&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Scholar</a>. The report’s authors noted that Litvak’s article “conflated” for-profit and private-equity-owned companies, and that much of the evidence it cited was from the 2000s, before private equity became involved in behavioral health. Litvak’s article “does not address private equity ownership, despite its title,” they wrote.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Romaric.Loffroy.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="120" height="165" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Romaric.Loffroy.jpg?resize=120%2C165&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128061" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Romaric Loffroy</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A professor of interventional radiology in France pointed the finger at an alleged ghostwriter after he was caught plagiarizing large portions of text in a review article, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>“After careful checking, I noticed that I am not the author of this paper despite my first authorship since it has been written by our previous medical writter [sic],” <a href="https://archive.fo/Dvmw6">Romaric Loffroy</a> of CHU Dijon Bourgogne wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Loffroy also toned down the offense, saying he wouldn’t care if others had plagiarized his work.</p>



<span id="more-128060"></span>



<p>The review, <a href="https://qims.amegroups.org/article/view/8064/html">“Current role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer,”</a> was published in October 2015 in <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em> and has been cited 28 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Nowhere does it mention the involvement of a medical writer.</p>



<p>The paper borrows heavily from two other reviews published in 2015. Its entire introduction was lifted verbatim from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495493/">an article</a> in the <em>Indian Journal of Urology</em>, while its conclusions were copied from <a href="https://doi.org/10.4111/kju.2015.56.5.337">a paper</a> in the <em>Korean Journal of Urology</em>.</p>



<p>Audrey Licandro, research director at CHU Dijon Bourgogne, told Retraction Watch the institution was “currently conducting an internal investigation of this matter and will get back to you as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>After discovering the plagiarism, the authors of the paper in the <em>Korean Journal of Urology</em> contacted Loffroy. They did not hear back. Then a colleague, Henry Woo of the Australian National University, took it upon himself to try as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought that I would see if I would have any more success,” Woo told us. On October 16, he emailed Loffroy and his coauthors, as well as the journal’s editor-in-chief, Yi-Xiang Wang of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>“Significant amounts of text from your paper have in fact been copied word for word from two manuscripts. Whether intentional or not, it constitutes serious academic misconduct,” Woo wrote in his email. He added that he found it “disturbing” the journal had not spotted the plagiarism and recommended Loffroy request a retraction.</p>



<p>In a reply sent that same day, Loffroy downplayed Woo’s concerns. Besides claiming he had not written the article, he pointed out that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The paper you talk about is a review paper published more than 8 years ago and not an original article, not involving any relevant or original data, which is no more excusable but much less harmful in terms of scientific impact, since most journal review articles are just repetitions. You probably know that better than me. Third, the article certainly went through the journal’s plagiarism software which did not identify any significant word duplication at that time and which is not my responsability [sic]. In addition to that, it seems that word duplication here represents roughly less than 8% of the paper, which is largely within the limits of what is acceptable, although I am not an expert on that topic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Last but not least, I am very impressed by the time it takes for certain people to check for plagiarism. I would like to have that much time to check plagiarism of my own articles but my schedule unfortunately doesn’t allow it, and I must admit that I really don’t care. My interest is elsewhere. In conclusion, I consider that it is not my role to initiate any action and let the Editor decide but I remain available to the competent authorities for additional information if needed, in complete transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Loffroy, who did not answer emails or phone calls asking for comment, has been a deputy editor of <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery </em>since 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. The extent of his ties to the journal, if any, prior to that is unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em> is published by AME Publishing Company. It was one of many “potentially predatory” titles on the now-defunct <a href="https://beallslist.net/">Beall’s List</a>, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/05/board-members-decry-their-own-journals-retraction-of-paper-on-predatory-publishers/">many find controversial</a>. Wang, the journal’s editor-in-chief, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>In a reply to Loffroy, Woo pointed out that the offensive review had been accepted “an almost unbelievable 14 days” after submission. He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You cannot absolve your academic misconduct by blaming an undisclosed ghost medical writer. The failure to declare involvement by a ghost writer in itself represents academic misconduct and this could be even worse had you not disclosed this to your co-authors. It would be interesting if your co-authors were to comment on this and whether they would support you or distance themselves from the academic misconduct associated with this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Woo also pointed out:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The failure of the journal software system to detect your plagiarism does not absolve you of having undertaken plagiarism. When complete sections, and which in your case includes the abstract, introduction and conclusions having <strong>entire word for word duplication </strong>from two other manuscripts, the percentage of duplication is irrelevant. … My personal belief is that this article did not go through a plagiarism check and particularly given the track record of AME publications on the former Beall List of predatory journals.</p>



<p>The reason that I think it appropriate to check your other submissions to journals that were on the Beall List is that blatant plagiarism is not usually an isolated event. Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aging-enzyme-restore-muscle-strength">Blocking an aging-related enzyme may restore muscle strength</a></h4>

              
                <p>As people age, their muscles tend to dwindle and weaken, especially with lack of use. With continued muscle loss, daily tasks are harder to perform and the risk of falling increases. One research team is teasing apart what’s behind this muscle loss by focusing on an enzyme associated with aging, which they’ve named a “gerozyme.”</p>



<p>The enzyme is 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, or 15-PGDH. It breaks down a protein called prostaglandin E2. That protein activates the proliferation of muscle stem cells, regenerating damaged muscles.</p>





<p>Stem cell biologist Helen Blau of Stanford University School of Medicine and colleagues previously found that blocking 15-PGDH in old mice restored their withered muscles and improved their strength after a month of treatment. On the flip side, young mice lost muscle and became weaker after their levels of this enzyme were increased for a month.</p>



<p>Blau’s team has now found that 15-PGDH accumulates in the muscles of old mice as the connections that allow communication between muscles and nerves are lost, another consequence of aging. Treating old mice for one month with a drug that inhibits 15-PGDH <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adg1485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restored these connections, called synapses</a>, between muscle fibers and motor nerve cells, and boosted the animals’ strength, the team reports in the Oct. 11 <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. Those synapses are how the brain directs muscles to move.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that blocking the gerozyme 15-PGDH may be a way to help recover strength that has diminished due to nerve injuries, motor nerve cell diseases or aging.</p>
