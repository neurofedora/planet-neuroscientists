              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-mate-penis-penetration-birds-mammals-serotine">These bats are the only mammals known to mate more like birds</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the only mammals that can fly, bats are the oddballs of the mammalian world. But serotine bats stand out for another, glaringly obvious reason — when erect, a male’s penis can swell to almost a quarter of its body length. How these bats use their humongous genitals to mate — <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01304-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without penetration</a> — is a method never seen in a mammal before, researchers report in the Nov. 20 <em>Current Biology</em>.  </p>



<p>At more than 16 millimeters when erect, the penis of male serotine bats (<em>Eptesicus serotinus</em>) has no chance of fitting inside the female’s approximately 2-millimeter-long vagina, a discrepancy that prompted biologist Nicolas Fasel to wonder how these bats go about getting it on. Videos collected at the Ukrainian Bat Rehabilitation Center in Kharkiv from 2018 to 2021 and the attic of St. Matthias Church in Castenray, Netherlands, from 2016 to 2022 revealed the answer. With footage, taken from underneath the bats, “we could see actually what was happening,” says Fasel of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.</p>





<p>Instead of inserting its penis into the vagina, a male uses it to move aside a membrane covering the female’s genitals and then presses the penis against the female’s vulva and holds it there, often for just under an hour. In one observation, the behavior lasted more than 12 hours.</p>



<p>Once the deed was done, the fur around the female’s vulva appeared wet, which Fasel and colleagues suspect is due to semen. Other scientists told Fasel the wet spots look similar to those in which they’ve found semen after mating in other bat species, he says. These observations suggest the serotine bats are mating without penetration, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-private-evolution">common practice in birds</a> but one never observed in a mammal before (<em>SN: 1/16/09</em>).</p>



<p>“I think it’s super interesting because it sort of brings up a different function for a penis” aside from penetration, says Patricia Brennan, an evolutionary biologist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass. “It doesn’t surprise me that this is a bat because bats have some of the craziest reproductive strategies in mammals,” such as females being able to store sperm for six months or males having spines on their penises.</p>



<p>Fasel agrees. Among mammals, bats “just have to be the weirdos of the group.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-automated-device-anesthesia-dose">A brain-monitoring device may one day take the guesswork out of anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new brain-monitoring device aims to be the Goldilocks of anesthesia delivery, dispensing drugs in just the right dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>No physician wants a patient to wake up during surgery — nor do patients. So anesthesiologists often give more drug than necessary to keep patients sedated during medical procedures or while on lifesaving machines like ventilators.</p>



<p>But anesthetics can sometimes be harmful when given in excess, says David Mintz, an anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins University. For instance, elderly people with cognitive conditions like dementia or age-related cognitive decline may be at higher risk of post-surgical confusion. Studies also hint that long periods of use in young children might cause behavioral problems. “The less we give of them, the better,” Mintz says.</p>





<p>An automated anesthesia delivery system could help doctors find the right drug dose. The new device monitored rhesus macaques’ brain activity and supplied a common anesthetic called propofol in doses that were automatically adjusted every 20 seconds. Fluctuating doses ensured the animals <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received just enough drug — not too much or too little</a> — to stay sedated for 125 minutes, researchers reported October 31 in <em>PNAS Nexus</em>. The study is a step toward devising and testing a system that would work for people.</p>



<p>Normally, an anesthetic dose is based on body measurements like weight and age. But that calculation is not a perfect science. There is no clear relationship between dose and likelihood that patients will be fully anesthetized with propofol and similar drugs, says Mintz, who was not involved with the new study. So anesthesiologists give amounts on the higher end of the spectrum to ensure their patients remain unconscious.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not acceptable for doctors to work with doses that aren’t necessarily going to work for everyone, Mintz says. “You’re shooting for the 99th percentile… like 99.999” percent of patients should not wake up.</p>



<p>While patients are under anesthesia, physicians keep a close eye on indirect markers of consciousness such as breathing rate and heart rate. Anesthetics like propofol also alter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/going-under">brain waves</a>, so tracking brain activity can help anesthesiologists keep tabs on patient awareness, says neuroscientist and anesthesiologist Emery Brown (<em>SN: 5/6/11</em>). In practice, however, few physicians are trained to do so.</p>



<p>Brown and colleagues developed a device to do that work for anesthesiologists. The system requires limited human input, combining brain-monitoring medical equipment with a computer that uses algorithms to determine how the body processes propofol. Every 20 seconds, the machine calculates how much drug is needed to maintain a preset level of brain activity that previous work has shown is <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicative of unconsciousness</a> in macaques.</p>



<p>After computer simulations suggested the model would work, the team completed nine trials with two macaques. The researchers first manually administered the anesthetic for half an hour. Then they let the automated delivery system take over for 125 minutes. In all nine experiments, the system accurately shifted the macaques between a lighter sedation and a deeper sleep, each lasting 40 or 45 minutes.</p>



<p>The system isn’t the first of its kind to be developed. Some existing devices — which are not approved for use in the United States — can distribute a single, predetermined amount of drug. But because the new Goldilocks version relies on feedback from the brain, it’s a bit like flying a plane on autopilot, says Brown, of MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Just as autopilot is key for helping pilots navigate long flights, using a brain-monitoring machine to automatically adjust anesthesia doses would help during long surgeries and most likely reduce patients’ post-surgery delirium.</p>



<p>“Doesn’t mean the pilot can decide to take the day off,” Mintz says. But because machines don’t get sleepy or need a bathroom break, the new device “is a very helpful tool … because it complements human weakness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next steps include repeating the experiments with more animals to refine the system and make the brain monitoring steps less invasive. The device from the study measured brain activity from electrodes that had been directly implanted in the monkeys’ brains, Brown says, but the goal is to switch to using EEG electrodes that attach to the scalp.</p>



<p>Consciousness is difficult to define, and even EEGs aren’t a perfect tool, Mintz says. People with brain diseases, for instance, may have EEGs that look slightly different than people with healthy brains. Still, blending technology with anesthesiologists’ watchful eyes can take the guesswork out of hitting the sweet spot that slips people into oblivion.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kumar.jpeg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" width="128" height="128" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kumar.jpeg?resize=128%2C128&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128301" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Avinash Kumar</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On Feb. 10, 2022, <a href="https://archive.fo/UfNxc">Avinash Kumar</a>, a PhD student at one of India’s top technical schools, sent a trove of research data to his adviser. But when the same data appeared in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13399-023-04242-5">a paper</a> in a scientific journal earlier this year, Kumar’s name wasn’t on it.</p>



<p>“I have done the experimental and analysis part of this work,” Kumar, who has since graduated, wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. “I am in deep shock after seeing this article online.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seemed like a solid case of plagiarism. </p>



<span id="more-128300"></span>



<p>In support of his claim, Kumar, whose <a href="https://archive.fo/Uo9PA">award-winning</a> work on sustainable food packaging <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/sustainable-food-packaging-iit-roorkee-develops-paper-from-pine-needle-waste-1829319-2021-07-17">made national news</a> in 2021, shared a PDF of the email he sent to his former adviser, <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/~DPT/Kirtiraj_K__Gaikwad">Kirtiraj Kundlik Gaikwad</a>, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. He included a side-by-side comparison of the graphs and images in the email and the offending paper. The two data sets were clearly identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kumar also questioned how Prachi Jain, who according to her <a href="https://archive.fo/gD415">LinkedIn profile</a> began her PhD studies at IIT Roorkee in January of this year, the same month the paper was submitted to the journal <em>Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery</em>, could have become its first author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Date stamps on electron microscopy images in the article show that when the research was done, Jain was still a master’s student at a university more than 1,500 miles away. Yet the paper, “Functionalization of sugarcane bagasse-based paper with amla pomace/titanium dioxide nanoparticles providing antimicrobial protection for food safety,” listed her contributions as “Formal Analysis, investigation, visualization, data curation, writing.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Gaikwad, however, called Kumar’s allegations “completely false.” Whereas the article in <em>Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery </em>was about a material created from sugarcane fibers, Kumar’s PhD dissertation, and <a href="https://archive.fo/UfNxc">his published work</a>, focused on pine-needle waste. The research Kumar alleged was plagiarized was “not his work,” Gaikwad said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the professor’s version of events, all Kumar did was ferry the data from the person who did the technical analysis to Gaikwad – while making it look as if Kumar had performed the work. He explained that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the paper tech department, all paper-related testing is done in a [National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories]-accredited laboratory where equipment is handled by well-trained technical staff … and students are not allowed to handle these equipments [sic] as per the guidelines of NABL.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gaikwad had asked Kumar “to collect the data from the technical person who did the experimental thing” and email it to him, he said. “That is the only thing he did.”</p>



<p>The professor sent us a copy of Kumar’s dissertation, which indeed was about a material derived from pine needles. He also passed along other documentation suggesting that the sugarcane research had originated with another researcher, Suman Singh of VCSG Uttarakhand University of Horticulture and Forestry. Singh and Gaidwak were co-corresponding authors on the paper in <em>Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery</em>.</p>



<p>“I believe this is a clear case of defaming me,” Gaikwad told Retraction Watch. “Such fake allegations against supervisors are increasing day by day, which is also a matter of concern and demotivates us. I have published a number of papers in my research career, and I understand the ethics of research in academia.”</p>



<p>Gaikwad also said Kumar had complained to the school’s ethics committee, which, according to Gaikwad, “found that it was a false claim.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>IIT Roorkee and its ethics committee did not respond to repeated requests for comment. We also contacted Kumar to inquire about the information Gaikwad had provided, but follow-up emails, text messages and phone calls all went unanswered.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes <em>Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery</em>, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We take concerns of alleged plagiarism in papers we publish very seriously. When we become aware of such concerns, we investigate them carefully following an established process and in line with best-practice COPE guidelines. In this specific case, the journal editors are looking into the matter, but I’m afraid we cannot share further information at this time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We could not find contact information for Jain, and neither the school nor Gaikwad would provide it. In a <a href="https://archive.fo/IuRIB">LinkedIn post</a> announcing the paper’s publication, Jain thanked both Singh and Gaikwad, as well as two other coauthors, but did not mention Kumar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaikwad said Jain had been working with Singh on the sugarcane research for a “long time” before becoming his graduate student. In a phone interview, Singh told us she is currently Jain’s co-adviser and confirmed that Jain had worked with her on the sugarcane research “last year.” Asked when the collaboration started, however, Singh hung up. She did not respond to a follow-up email.</p>

                <p>Planning a submission to arXiv in the next few weeks? The 2023 end-of-the-year holiday stretch will be temporarily impacting arXiv&#8217;s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This temporary change only affects the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>The arXiv team primarily takes time off according to the holiday schedule of the United States, which at the end of the year includes many holidays in quick succession, leading to several announcement delays.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-mammal-embryos-grown-space">The first embryos from a mammal have now been grown in space</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mouse embryos can make it to an early stage of development in space.</p>



<p>In an experiment conducted in 2021, a few hundred frozen two-cell embryos from mice thawed and grew over four days on the International Space Station. Of the several dozen embryos that made it back to Earth, nearly a quarter formed healthy clusters of cells known as blastocysts.</p>



<p>The finding suggests that the radiation and weightlessness of space <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(23)02254-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might not pose immediate obstacles to mammalian reproduction</a>, researchers report October 27 in <em>iScience</em>.</p>





<p>The new study isolates only one part of the complicated process of reproduction and development. A blastocyst typically forms after fertilization and implants in the uterus before developing into the placenta and fetus. </p>



<p>But the result provides a starting point for biologists, says Christiane Hahn, a space biologist at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, Netherlands, who wasn’t involved in the research. Mouse embryos are the first mammal embryos that researchers have grown in space, an important step in understanding how space affects human reproduction. Other experiments have involved animals such as salamanders, rice fish and quail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous research suggested that the conditions in space are particularly harmful to the early stages of reproduction in mice. When in space, the animals have been too stressed to mate, and studies of the rodents’ eggs showed that they accumulated several mutations due to the heavy radiation. Freeze-dried mouse sperm, however, did <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-sperm-dna-space-radiation-exposure-six-years">remain viable after one six-year stint on the space station</a> (<em>SN: 6/11/21</em>).</p>



<p>To overcome these challenges, biologist Teruhiko Wakayama and colleagues launched two-cell embryos to the ISS. A device specially made for the experiment held the fragile, developing cells. After the experiment ended, the cells were then sent back to Earth for analysis. Out of 360 samples, 72 survived the trip, and 17 of those developed into normal blastocysts. The undamaged cells successfully multiplied and took on new identities as either precursors of fetal tissue or the placenta.</p>



<p>Future alterations to the procedure could potentially increase the success rate, says Wakayama, of the University of Yamanashi in Kofu, Japan. The absence of perfectly sterile conditions in the space experiment probably exacerbated cell death, he says.</p>



<p>Blastocysts cannot survive for long outside of uteruses, so the experiment was designed to last only a few days. It’s unclear how the cells would fare as development unfolds. In future experiments, the team would like to implant any viable embryonic cells from space experiments in mice to find out.</p>



<p>The researchers are especially interested in further testing the impact of microgravity on the positioning of different cells in a blastocyst. The cells that give rise to the fetus usually all sink to the bottom of the cluster, encased by cells that will become placenta. Were the fetal cells to split into two spots instead, they’d create identical twin mice. Were they to split into more, the blastocysts would probably become unviable.</p>



<p>In the new study, three-quarters of the fetal precursors appeared to settle in the right location. But more research is needed to fully understand the effect of microgravity on the developing cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thanksgiving-myth-persists-history-memory-science">Why the Thanksgiving myth persists, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask someone in the United States to name five events important to the country’s foundation and there’s a good chance they’ll mention the Pilgrims.</p>



<p>That’s what researchers found a few years ago when they put that question to some 2,000 people. The Revolutionary War, Declaration of Independence, Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of the Americas and the Civil War topped the list. But <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1750698019856065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming in seventh place were the Pilgrims</a>, the team reported in 2022 in <em>Memory Studies</em>.</p>





<p>Their inclusion in the list is bizarre, says coauthor Abram Van Engen, an English professor at Washington University in St. Louis interested in national origin stories. “There’s no great reason why we start America with the Pilgrims…. They’re kind of late to the game.”</p>



<p>Before them, after all, came the Native Americans, Spanish settlers in St. Augustine, Fla., and European settlers — and the slaves they brought with them — in Jamestown, Va. But the Pilgrims’ tale of religious persecution, perseverance and self-governance provides people with a tidy, if aggrandized, national origin story, says Van Engen.</p>



<p>The “Thanksgiving myth” is part of that tale, says coauthor and cognitive psychologist Henry Roediger, also at Washington University. The shorthand for that story, he says, goes like this: In 1621, the Pilgrims and Native Americans “had this peaceful meal and powwow [while] singing kumbaya.”</p>



<p>The two groups did engage in a peaceful harvest celebration in the fall of 1621, history suggests. But historians are quick to point out that the tidy tale ignores context, particularly the deadly diseases and bloody wars that devastated Indigenous populations both before and after the occasion.</p>



<p>Despite persistent efforts to <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/thanksgiving-myth-and-what-we-should-be-teaching-kids-180973655/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flesh out the historical record</a>, the kumbaya vision persists. That’s because history and memory, far from being interchangeable as commonly assumed, often exist in opposition. History is rooted in fact, while memory is rooted in story. When shared across individuals, those stories — with their half-truths, exaggerations and elisions — foster unity.</p>



<p>Origin stories like the Thanksgiving one are particularly sticky as they underpin a group’s raison d’être. Fixing or changing the story risks muddying the plot and tearing apart the group, says Van Engen. “The Pilgrims just become right for telling [the] stories … that we want to tell about ourselves.”</p>



<p>Mythological origin stories are not unique to the United States. “Each nation has its heroic story. That is the tradition of collective memory,” says Chana Teeger, a sociologist at the London School of Economics and Political Science who studies how South Africans teach about apartheid.</p>



<p>But scholars are starting to grapple with how nations should contend with difficult pasts. “How do you keep a strong national identity and patriotism while at the same time acknowledging the more negative aspects of your history?” Roediger asks. The answer, as evidenced by increasing calls for racial reckonings in the United States and elsewhere, is very much a work in progress.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Thanksgiving has become a “mental habit”</h4>



<p>Stories, Aristotle observed some 2,400 years ago, contain a distinct beginning, middle and end strung together via a causal chain, or plot.</p>





<p>Our brains are wired for such stories, psychologists discovered much later. People rely on clear narratives to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612322001613?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid information overload</a>, anthropologist James Wertsch and psychologist Olivia Jäggi, both of Washington University, reported in 2022. Our story-minded brains turn us into “cognitive misers,” they wrote in <em>Progress in Brain Research</em>. The pared-down nature of stories, in other words, is much easier for us to remember than the complex, often ugly, arcs of history.</p>



<p>For that 1621 Thanksgiving, the complex historic arc goes like this. Up to 90 percent of the Wampanoag population had died from an epidemic brought by a previous wave of European explorers by the time the Pilgrims arrived in December 1620 in what’s now Massachusetts. The weakened community faced threats from an encroaching neighboring tribe. Meanwhile, the Pilgrims, unaccustomed to the new environment and climate, were dying of starvation and disease.</p>



<p>In March 1621, those struggling groups formed an alliance. The Wampanoag people could teach the Pilgrims how to harvest crops and the Pilgrims could protect the Wampanoag people from invaders. The peace did not last. Over the next several decades, the settlers&#8217; population exploded and European leaders displaced the Wampanoag community, often through dishonest or violent means. War broke out in 1675, killing hundreds of colonists and thousands of Native Americans. Settlers killed the Wampanoag leader and displayed his head on a spike for two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The common narrative makes the settlers look like the good guys. Once you start chipping away at it, then everything falls apart,” says social studies educator John Bickford of Eastern Illinois University in Charleston.</p>



<p>History and memory have different relationships to the past, Wertsch explains. Historians will sacrifice narrative to preserve the facts. Agents of collective memory, such as political leaders, museum curators, teachers and family members, will sacrifice the facts to preserve the narrative — and group solidarity.</p>



<p>Consequently, memory and history are often at loggerheads, wrote French historian Pierre Nora in the 1989 <em>Representations</em>. “Memory and history, far from being synonymous, appear now to be in <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/representations/article-abstract/doi/10.2307/2928520/82272/Between-Memory-and-History-Les-Lieux-de-Memoire?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundamental opposition</a>.”</p>



<p>Moreover, the narrative habits offered up by memorable, though potentially fictitious, stories are just as hard to break as other habits, such as stopping nail-biting or forgoing that daily cup of coffee. For instance, we hear the word “bread” and we think “butter.” We hear “Thanksgiving” and we think Pilgrims and Native Americans singing kumbaya.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Thanksgiving myth came together slowly</h4>



<p>But in fact, adding Pilgrims to the Thanksgiving narrative is a surprisingly recent affair, beginning some 200 years after their arrival in New England.</p>



<p>Thanksgiving was initially an altogether more informal affair. European settlers celebrated thanksgivings, or harvest festivals, even before the Pilgrims’ arrival. And the Pilgrims themselves were somewhat sporadic with their feasts, celebrating the day when new friends or supplies arrived from Europe or when they defeated the Native Americans in various wars. In 1789, Thanksgiving wasn’t a national holiday but George Washington issued a proclamation celebrating the day in the name of an “Almighty God.”</p>





<p>In the 1820s, when the United States was roughly 50 years old, things started to formalize. Research into nation building shows that the half-century point is about when official histories, such as those in textbooks, begin to appear, Van Engen says. Such histories typically double as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-identity-nationalism-independence-putin-russia">memory projects</a> (<em>SN: 4/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>In the United States, those projects began at a time when the young nation was shifting from an agrarian to an industrial society. As people moved away from their birthplaces for work, kinship ties were weakening. Starting in 1827, Sarah Josepha Hale, author and editor of a prominent women’s magazine<em>, </em>began calling for an official and family-oriented Thanksgiving holiday to bring families back together. Nearly four decades later in 1863, with the country in the midst of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln took heed and turned Thanksgiving into a national holiday to promote unity.</p>



<p>From that point, presidents — powerful players in building a nation’s collective memory, and the accompanying feelings of national pride — began issuing annual Thanksgiving proclamations, says political scientist Judd Birdsall. Birdsall, of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., has read every one of those speeches to see how those memories evolve and coalesce over time to eventually capture the modern-day Thanksgiving spirit. “It’s a very niche specialty,” Birdsall admits.</p>



<p>Theodore Roosevelt made the earliest <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15570274.2021.1954408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vague reference to “the first settlers”</a> in his 1905 proclamation, by noting their many hardships, Birdsall reported in 2021 in the <em>Review of Faith &amp; International Affairs</em>. Franklin Delano Roosevelt identified the Pilgrims by name in 1939. But only after World War II do Pilgrims come to regularly feature in these proclamations, morphing into “archetypical Americans,” Birdsall says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pilgrims&#8217; progress</h2>



<p>When researchers asked some 2,000 U.S. survey respondents to list five events “important to the foundation of America,” top choices included the Revolutionary War and Declaration of Independence. But Pilgrims, who arrived after many others and had little to do with American origins, still came in seventh with 17 percent of the vote, researchers found. That could be due to the fact that, centuries after their arrival, the Pilgrims’ story of dining with the area’s Native Americans became Thanksgiving folklore.</p>

<p>Those speeches also show how America’s founders and political leaders have typically either ignored Native Americans or treated them as supporting actors to the main story. Their first appearance in the Thanksgiving story is in 1908, with Teddy Roosevelt’s pejorative mention of an “Indian haunted wilderness.” In 1980, President Jimmy Carter obliquely referenced the Native Americans by calling Thanksgiving “a commemoration of the day America’s earliest inhabitants sat down to a table with European colonists.” Ronald Reagan made Native Americans more central to the story, noting in 1986: “Indeed, the Native American Thanksgivings antedated those of the new Americans.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">America’s origin story is still in its messy middle</h4>



<p>Breaking up with the Thanksgiving narrative is no easy feat. But some people in the United States are starting to question Thanksgiving and other stories pointing to the country’s rosy beginnings, Wertsch says. “How do you [begin to] break a bad habit? You have somebody point it out to you.”</p>



<p>That’s what happened, say Wertsch and others, when a group of journalists at the <em>New York Times </em>launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1619 Project</a> a few years ago. Led by journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, that long-term endeavor began the U.S. story with slaves’ arrival in Virginia in August 1619. The nation’s story, they argued, spirals outward from that ugly point.</p>



<p>“If there’s anything that debunks our national origins, it’s the 1619 Project,” Bickford says.</p>



<p>Today, that project has come to frame many of the country’s ongoing culture wars, especially fights over how to teach history. Institutions, such as schools and museums, become places where history and national identity collide, says Teeger. “History education [is] a site where collective memories are negotiated.”</p>



<p>Social scientists refer to conflicts over how events ought to be remembered as “mnemonic standoffs.” In the case of Thanksgiving, the standoff is over whether Thanksgiving ought to be remembered as a day of celebration or, as a growing chorus of Indigenous people and their allies call for, a day of mourning. Such standoffs illuminate the central tension between history and collective memory, researchers say. How do people maintain unity while acknowledging their difficult pasts?</p>



<p>Historians and social scientists used to assume that collective memories need to be positive, even mythological, to succeed. “Forgetting, I would go even as far as to say historical error, is a crucial factor in the creation of a nation,” French philosopher and historian Ernest Renan <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7312/rena17430/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued in 1882</a>.</p>



<p>Contemporary researchers question that view. Georgian people’s collective memories, for instance, include ideas of the Eastern European country as a perpetual underdog, says anthropologist Nutsa Batiashvili of the Free University of Tbilisi in Georgia. “The skeleton narrative, which repeats itself, is that a big enemy comes, and Georgians fight heroically, but they have traitors inside. And they lose the war but still manage to save the culture and integrity and identity.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Can people in the United States rewrite their national story to reflect this sort of complexity? That remains an open research question, Wertsch says. Stories work best when they have a neat beginning, middle and end. But Thanksgiving, and the broader American origin story, remain caught in the messy narrative middle. “We don’t have an ending of racism in America. It’s still here,” he says.</p>



<p>The more optimistic framing, Batiashvili says, is that the American story is still being written. “It’s a narrative in the making.”</p>

                <p><strong>Through this series, we will be sharing first-hand advice on applying for postgraduate courses. This time, Katie Birditt shares her own tips for choosing and applying to Masters courses after getting onto her programme of choice this year. </strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_1cd87bbd15754ff8a4d56255068f7da1~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Image credit: Annie Spratt via Unsplash" ></figure><p>Applying to a Masters course can feel daunting. You must collect recommendation letters, update that CV from three years ago, and write a strong personal statement, often whilst juggling multiple other commitments.  As someone who recently went through this process, I am going to share some of my tips on how to research different Masters courses and craft a good personal statement!</p>
<h5>Research, research, research!</h5><p>One of your earliest considerations should be whether you are interested in pursuing a Master of Research (MRes) or a Master of Science (MSc) degree. These two programmes have slightly different focuses and purposes. Although both involve independent research, the MSc is a taught programme aiming to expand your theoretical knowledge of a subject and provide some foundational training in relevant techniques and skills whilst the MRes is research-based and quite specialised with fewer taught modules. Coming from a Biomedical Science background rather than pure neuroscience, I selected an MSc style programme to diversify my research skills and broaden my knowledge on the subject. However, if you are passionate about a specific area of research or have a strong grounding in the subject already, see yourself pursuing a PhD so want to gain maximum hands-on research experience, or you simply hate the idea of long coursework essays, then an MRes is worth looking into!</p>

<p>It is then important to investigate the ways in which programmes align with your specific interests and ambitions. Have a look through their  specialisations and faculty research output before making any firm decisions. Is the department renowned for a particular type of neuroscience, like behavioural or molecular? Who are some of the leading researchers in this field and are they working on projects that excite you? It is useful to ask yourself these questions early in the application process. Normally, all the course-specific information is available on department websites and will provide you with a good idea of how you could fit within the course and the wider department. If any burning questions are left unanswered by the website, then get in touch with the admissions team or perhaps even the course directors. </p>

<p>Everyone will have slightly different priorities when it comes to selecting a Masters course. An array of factors should be considered and researched, alongside the ones already mentioned. These could include the programme’s reputation and length or what the university’s surrounding city is like. I would be cautious about selecting a university based on prestige alone, as you wouldn’t want to find yourself stuck in a neuroscience department that is renowned for research you are not interested in or one that is in a city far away from friends and family.</p>
<h5>Personal statement</h5><p>Once you have thoroughly researched different Masters degrees and shortlisted a few, it is personal statement time. I believe that this component is one of the most important parts of the application. It is here that you sell yourself and place all the experiences and achievements your CV holds into a meaningful context that relates to your future ambitions and why the university and particular course are the perfect fit for you. An excellent personal statement coupled with good grades could be the reason you are selected for interviews at leading institutions. Now, how to begin writing it?</p>
<h5>Overcoming Blank Page Phobia </h5><p>In my experience the hardest part of personal statement writing is always starting. I struggle with that initial blank page. For anyone else who shares this fear I suggest brainstorming some ideas about why you are applying and writing down whatever comes to mind. Once those phrases are out the page, start slowly structuring them into sentences and paragraphs. There will be many iterations of the statement so do not worry about perfection in these initial stages. The main aim is to string your thoughts together into sentences and gradually start building up the personal statement.</p>
<h5>Show your passion and commitment to a specific field </h5><p> As an undergraduate the world of research can seem so broad and intimidating that it may be hard to select a single area of interest. You could be intrigued by two completely unrelated topics in neuroscience. If this is the case, I would suggest trying to focus on only one specific area because this makes your personal statement easy to follow and shows that you have given careful thought to further study. You’re not expected to have mapped out your five-year plan, so don’t worry! My advice is to simply be guided by your current interests and genuine motivations to study the degree. </p>
<h5>Talk about relevant experience</h5><p>Discuss any work experience that you have had and how it has influenced your trajectory up to this point.  This doesn’t have to be laboratory placements or internship: you could talk about your dissertation, volunteering experiences, or any other experience that will show the person reading your application who you are or the passion you have for the field. Do not just list these experiences in your CV! There are very few spaces where you can boast about all you’ve done, so seize this opportunity to talk about how brilliant you are! It can be hard, but capitalise on your own unique selling points because this will give your application an authentic voice and make it stand out. For example, having lived all my life in Zimbabwe I am aware that there is not much research there on dementia. Therefore, I framed my interest in neurodegenerative disease research within this unique context to ensure that my passion for this area of neuroscience came across clearly. </p>

<p>When mentioning your experience, try using the Situation Task Action Result (STAR) method. The technique encourages you to talk about a certain situation and reflect on all the ways in which you worked towards achieving a desired outcome. This approach is effective in producing clear, concise sentences that demonstrate all you learnt or accomplished during an experience. However, course leaders are not only interested in how wonderful you are, but also if you would fit well within that Masters degree. Be sure to talk about why your interests overlap well with various aspects of a programme. Maybe UCL has a whole course dedicated to dementia and this aligns well with the experiences you have had in a patient-centred volunteering role. Perhaps Cambridge has a focus on computational neuroscience, and you have just used some of these methods in a dissertation. All these details will make your application interesting and memorable.</p>
<h5>Some closing tips</h5><p>Let other people read through your personal statement when you’re finished. This could be anyone, but ideally someone who is more detached from the work and able to provide objective insights and different points of view. Ask your academic tutor, friends or even parents. My mum is my go-to application editor, even though she is not a scientist! </p>

<p>Give yourself regular, frequent breaks throughout the entire process. Approaching the application with fresh eyes and a rested mind helps far more than sitting in front of a computer for hours, frustrated and uninspired!</p>

<p>A professor at the University of Pittsburgh who sued the institution for racial discrimination and retaliation has refiled his suit after a federal judge dismissed his claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/11/author-of-paper-on-covid-19-and-jade-amulets-sues-employer-for-mental-anguish-discrimination/">previously reported</a>, <a href="https://www.sph.pitt.edu/directory/moses-bility">Moses Bility</a>, an assistant professor of infectious diseases and microbiology in the university’s School of Public Health, sued the school earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among many claims of racial discrimination, Bility alleged the school’s response to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720363592">2020 paper</a> he published and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/11/16/co-authors-of-paper-on-covid-19-and-jade-amulets-blames-the-online-press-and-social-media-for-misinterpretation-in-retraction-letter/">later withdrew</a> that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/29/amulets-may-prevent-covid-19-says-a-paper-in-elsevier-journal-they-dont/">proposed jade amulets may prevent COVID-19</a> was discriminatory. (In the process of our previous reporting on the article, Bility <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Gmail-STOTEN-paper.pdf">accused</a> Retraction Watch of racism.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Bility’s complaint, Pitt officials demanded an investigation of his research, which found he “did not violate any academic integrity standard.” However, at a departmental town hall meeting over Zoom, presenting the investigation’s findings, “students in Defendant Pitt’s School of Public Health called Dr. Bility derogatory names, such as stupid, retarded, unintelligent, etc.” Bility later received two emails “from anonymous individuals who Dr. Bility assumes came from the Defendant Pitt community” that included racial slurs.  </p>



<span id="more-128298"></span>



<p>Bility also alleges the school denied his application for tenure as retaliation for his complaints of discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pitt and two administrators named in the suit, the former and current deans of the School of Public Health, filed a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> the case in August. Last month, the judge assigned to the case granted that motion, but allowed Bility to update and refile his complaint. He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/28-second-amended-complaint.pdf">did so</a> earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/26-dismissal-opinion.pdf">opinion</a>, Judge Marilyn J. Horan wrote that Bility had not established that the majority of the claimed discriminatory acts were connected to his race.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Horan wrote that Bility’s allegations the school denied his application for tenure as retaliation was “conclusory,” and “not enough to suggest that there is a causal relationship between his formal complaints about racial discrimination and the denial of his tenure.” She wrote:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The substantial passage of time between his formal discrimination complaints and the tenure decisions does not support or even suggest that any causal connection existed between the alleged protected activity and the tenure decision.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to our request for comment, Bility’s lawyer, <a href="https://www.ohanlonschwartz.com/about-us/">Steven O’Hanlon</a> of the firm O’Hanlon Schwartz, pointed us to the updated complaint Bility filed on November 8. The new complaint alleges Pitt informed him his employment will end in August 2024.</p>



<p>Pitt’s lawyer <a href="https://marcus-shapira.com/attorneys/jonathan-d-marcus/">Jonathan Marcus</a>, of the firm Marcus &amp; Shapira (no connection to Retraction Watch co-founder Adam Marcus), declined to comment.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Pinaki Saha will talk about his work in the talk entitled &quot;Olfaction prediction using 3DCNN and molecular electron density.&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is a complex and poorly understood phenomenon that
involves the interaction of odorant molecules with olfactory receptors. The molecular
structure and properties of odorants determine their affinity and specificity for
different olfactory receptors, and thus their perceived odor quality and intensity. In
this presentation, I talk about a novel approach for olfaction prediction based on 3D
convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) and promolecule electron density of odorant
molecules.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crabs-left-sea-several-times-evolution">Crabs left the sea not once, but several times, in their evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Most terrestrial plants and animals left the ocean a single time in their evolutionary history to live ashore. But crabs have seemingly scuttled out of the sea more than a dozen times, with at least two groups later reverting back to a marine lifestyle, a study finds.</p>



<p>The research, published November 6 in <em>Systematic Biology</em>, sheds new light on <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syad066/7370615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the evolutionary history of the group Brachyura</a>, which includes roughly 7,600 species of “true crabs,” and includes the most comprehensive evolutionary tree yet created for the group. And the study offers clues about how other early invertebrates may have evolved a terrestrial lifestyle, researchers say.</p>





<p>Unlike for well-studied animals such as birds and mammals, a unified crab tree of life has been lacking, says Kristin Hultgren, an invertebrate zoologist at Seattle University. “While the authors have developed a useful framework for understanding the complexity of transitioning to terrestrial life, one of the most important contributions is the extensive, well-dated evolutionary tree.”</p>



<p>Crabs are an extremely diverse group and have colonized nearly every type of habitat on Earth. It’s been a challenge to study when crabs first shifted from one habitat to another during evolution because, like some other invertebrates, crabs don’t have the extensive fossil trail that early vertebrates do, says Joanna Wolfe, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University.</p>



<p>Past research has also often treated marine, freshwater and land crabs as discrete subgroups when they’re more like a continuum, Wolfe says. “They’re not distinct and actually have a lot in common, and looking at them together helps trace their evolution.”</p>



<p>Wolfe and her colleagues collected genetic data from 333 species of crabs in the group Brachyura. These crustaceans are evolutionarily distinct from, although closely related to, another group of crustaceans that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/copy-crab-dna-confirms-crab-forms-have-several-origins">independently evolved crablike bodies</a> and are often erroneously referred to as crabs, including animals like the hermit and king crabs.</p>



<p>The team then combined that genetic data with dozens of fossils to generate a crab evolutionary tree, layering on details about each species’ life history and adaptations for living on land to reconstruct a possible timeline of when crabs colonized drier ground.</p>



<p>True crabs diverged from other crustacean lineages roughly 230 million years ago during the Triassic Period, the researchers found, refining previous estimates. Over the next hundred or so million years, brachyurans diversified widely during a period previously dubbed the “Cretaceous crab revolution.”</p>



<p>The study also showed that during their evolution, crabs appear to have adapted to a more terrestrial lifestyle as many as 17 times, either by shifting from the ocean to the intertidal zone or similarly salty habitats like mangroves, or by colonizing freshwater estuaries and rivers on route to land. In at least two cases, crabs reverted to a marine lifestyle long after they’d left.</p>



<p>The amount of times that crabs independently left the ocean is “astonishing,” says Katie Davis, an evolutionary paleobiologist at the University of York in England who was not involved in the research. “And it&#8217;s really fantastic that molecular biology, fossils and modern numerical techniques can be combined to provide insight into previously unanswerable questions.”</p>



<p>The study also hints at what other early arthropods that ventured onto the land may have been like, Wolfe says. Past studies have shown that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2004.2917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crabs and insects share a common, if unknown, aquatic ancestor</a>. By looking at the types of crabs that successfully left the ocean, it’s possible to guess at what adaptations early insects might have needed to do the same. Modern crabs living out of the water today, for example, excel at keeping themselves from drying out and have limited their dependence on water for reproduction.</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re going to be the first proto-insect to come out of the ocean … you’re probably going to need those kinds of adaptations,” Wolfe says.</p>

<p>After his father’s unexpected death from alcohol use disorder in 2017, evolutionary biologist Noah Whiteman undertook a journey to understand how nature’s toxins affect the world. The result is his debut book, <em>Most Delicious Poison: The Story of Nature’s Toxins — From Spices to Vices</em>.</p>



<p>The book weeds through chemistry, evolution and world history to explore the origins of toxins and how humans have co-opted them for everything from medicines to spices to pesticides. “The chemicals in these products of nature are not a sideshow — they are the main event,” Whiteman writes, “and we’ve unwittingly stolen them from a war raging all around us.”</p>





<p>That tussle, part of what Charles Darwin called the “war of nature,” is the innovative ways plants and animals continuously evolve traits that one-up their predators or competitors. Many of the chemicals that we stock in our cabinets and pharmacies, for instance, originated in plants as deterrents against insects snacking on them, Whiteman points out. These chemicals act on our brains and bodies thanks to the surprising neurological similarities between insects and humans.</p>



<p>Whiteman, who studies how insects adapt to plant toxins, is a knowledgeable tour guide through this greenhouse of poisons and cures. And it is a greenhouse. Though people put some animal-made toxins to use, the plant derivatives steal the show.</p>



<p>Chrysanthemums with their insecticidal compound, pyrethrin, make an appearance in the book, as do terpenoid-wafting pines, calming chamomile and morphine-like water lilies. To tame the tangle of chemicals and their interactions, Whiteman dedicates each chapter to a couple of toxin classes and lays out their source in the natural world, their chemical mechanisms and historical context for their use by people.</p>



<p>Take tannins. They show up in a wide array of plants, including oaks, tea plants and grapes. Whiteman muses that these chemical compounds may protect plants by inhibiting the ability of microbes and herbivores to absorb nutrients. Tannins also bind to salivary proteins, resulting in the “rough, dry puckering sensation” that many people enjoy while sipping a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Humans have also long put the protein-binding properties of tannins to use in tanning animal hides for leather. For nearly 1,500 years, Europe and then its colonies relied on ink manufactured from tannin-rich oak galls for drafting important documents, including the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most important role of toxins in the human world can be found in our pantries and medicine cabinets. Whiteman focuses on pharmacological heavyweights such as the antimalarial drug quinine, derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, and salicylates, such as aspirin and oil of wintergreen. Curare, cocaine and scopolamine demonstrate how we’ve wrangled these alkaloids into anesthetics. It’s one of many instances where Whiteman nods to Indigenous communities around the world that have been repeatedly exploited or gone uncompensated for their medicinal discoveries.</p>



<p>“It is no wonder that many countries in Latin America and elsewhere in the global tropics now have biopiracy laws that strictly regulate the export of natural products,” Whiteman notes.</p>



<p>Whiteman closes by examining how medieval Europe’s lust for spices catapulted the world into five centuries of geopolitical upheaval. The Columbian exchange, the Opium Wars and the founding of the East India Company are all pit stops along Whiteman’s exploration of how the pursuit of all things psychoactive and medicinal fueled European colonialism. The lasting consequences, Whiteman argues, include infringement on Indigenous rights, global biodiversity loss and the climate crisis.</p>



<p>The opioid epidemic and alcohol use disorder also loom large in the book. Here, Whiteman’s assertion that our use of toxins “walk[s] a knife’s edge between healing and harm” is loudest. His father haunts many of the personal anecdotes sprinkled throughout the 304-page read. Whether he’s recalling the toxicology report from his father’s autopsy or noting his family’s fondness for black pepper, Whiteman explores grief as much as he does science: “My attempt to grasp why [my father] died allowed me to identify and then draw together the many ways that nature’s toxins affect the world.” </p>



<p>Personal and well-researched, <em>Most Delicious Poison</em> has wide appeal, in part, as Whiteman points out, because indulging in nature’s toxins “is an essential part of what it means to be human.” So go ahead. Pour a cup of herbal tea, add some drops of lavender oil to the diffuser and enjoy this mind-bending read.</p>

<p><strong>Putting smell back in the whiffer</strong> – <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/putting-smell-back-whiffer"><em>Science News</em>, November 17, 1973</a></p>



<p>P.P.C. Graziadei and J.F. Metcalf of Florida State University have been producing … ever more detailed, evidence for olfactory nerve regeneration in mammals…. Might olfactory nerves be regenerated in people who have trouble smelling, thereby restoring or improving their sense of smell? “The phenomena of regeneration are applicable to all vertebrates and most likely to humans,” says Graziadei.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update </h4>



<p>The scientists’ hunch was right on the nose: The human cells that detect scent information and send it to the brain can replenish themselves, though exactly how is unclear. Experimental therapies to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-smell-sense-loss-olfactory-training-treatment">help people who have lost their sense of smell due to COVID-19</a> could help researchers figure it out (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 14</em>). Smell training, which involves regularly and deeply smelling various scents, might rewire cells’ connections to the brain or stimulate new cell growth. Treating damaged cells with steroids and blood plasma might aid healing. More invasive treatments such as nasal lining transplants aim to boost regenerative stem cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breast-cancer-drug-tamoxifen-less-effective-africans">Why a popular breast cancer drug may be less effective for some Africans</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — A genetic variant commonly found in some Africans may stymie the effects of a popular breast cancer drug.</p>



<p>The variant produces a sluggish version of the enzyme known to activate tamoxifen. People who inherit two copies of the variant show five times less active drug in their bloodstreams compared with people who don’t have that variant, researchers reported November 2 at the American Society of Human Genetics’ annual meeting. As a result, many of these patients may receive a dose that’s insufficient to treat their cancer.</p>





<p>The gene, called <em>CYP2D6</em>, that produces the crucial enzyme differs dramatically among people. On average, a fifth of Africans carry at least one copy of the variant that the researchers studied. Across the continent, however, that figure ranges from a slim 5 percent to over 34 percent.</p>



<p>Preemptive genetic screening that identifies patients with the genetic variant would probably cost too much for local clinics and hospitals, says molecular geneticist Comfort Kanji, who is based at the African Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology in Harare, Zimbabwe. But he imagines that his team’s findings could inspire clinical trials that test larger starting doses of tamoxifen in heavily affected groups.</p>



<p>Kanji and his colleagues collected daily blood samples from 42 Zimbabweans taking tamoxifen. Some of the participants had one copy of the variant, while others had two. A third group had a different version of the gene with no known effect on the enzyme. The differences in how they metabolized the medication emerged right away and remained for the duration of the monthlong experiment.</p>



<p>Doubling the prescribed amount of the drug for participants with two copies of the variant, the researchers found, brought levels of active drug in the blood back to normal — and with few short-term consequences.</p>



<p>The study provides powerful results despite a small sample size, says David Twesigomwe, a pharmacogeneticist at the Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience in Johannesburg who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>It offers a clear-cut case for metabolic screening, he says. Even as comprehensive genetic testing remains out of reach for many Africans, he believes simpler, narrower tests could do the trick, potentially laying the foundation for clinicians to incorporate screening more widely in treatment.</p>



<p>Each year, around 200,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa receive diagnoses of breast cancer. Fewer than<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15353702211006047" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 40 percent survive for longer than five years</a> past their diagnosis, unlike 86 percent in the United States. The main reason is that many patients in Africa struggle to access or afford treatment, and as a result show up to clinics with late-stage cancers. This new finding is unlikely to turn those cases around, but it could help make timely care more effective, Kanji says.</p>



<p>Worldwide, about 30 percent of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer — the most common type — <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304383507001541?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show little improvement on tamoxifen</a>. That proportion is even higher among African women, Kanji says. The prevalence of the studied gene variant, or others with a similar effect, could offer a partial explanation.</p>



<p>A separate study would be required to see if the findings extend to African Americans, Kanji and Twesigomwe both say. In the United States, Black women are 40 percent more likely to die of breast cancer— with about 28 deaths per 100,000 for Black women compared with 20 per 100,000 for white women — despite a similar rate of diagnosis.</p>



<p>Experts caution that the reasons why are multifaceted, including biological, sociological and historical. The role that a variant of <em>CYP2D6</em> plays may constitute a sliver of a sliver.</p>





<p>The enzyme that the gene generates metabolizes more than just tamoxifen. It’s responsible for breaking down many other drugs, including opioids, beta-blockers and a common class of antidepressant drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. That means that people with different variants of the gene may respond better or worse to those medications too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bonobos-humans-cooperation-evolution">Bonobos, like humans, cooperate with unrelated members of other groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans regularly cooperate and share resources with other, unrelated humans in different social groups, often without any immediate, reciprocated benefits. The phenomenon has been considered unique to our species. But some bonobos appear to share this social trait, a study finds.</p>



<p>This type of cooperation is thought to underpin human civilization. So bonobos’ ability to <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg0844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bond and cooperate with groups of nonrelatives</a> across group boundaries, even when there’s no immediate payoff, may provide some insight into the kinds of evolutionary conditions that led to the development of humankind’s large-scale societies, researchers report November 16 in <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Both chimpanzees (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>) and bonobos (<em>P. paniscus</em>) live in social groups with individuals that may not be very closely related. But compared with territorial and aggressive chimpanzees, bonobos have a more easygoing, tolerant attitude toward other groups. Bonobos occasionally groom and share food with unrelated individuals from other social groups and have even been known to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bonobos-first-great-apes-adopt-orphan-infant-outside-group">adopt outsiders’ young</a> (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). But the extent of the apes’ cooperative behavior has been unclear.</p>



<p>So behavioral ecologists Liran Samuni of the German Primate Center in Göttingen and Martin Surbeck of Harvard University studied two bonobo groups in the Congo’s Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve.&nbsp;Over two years, the team recorded which bonobos exchanged grooming services and shared food, and when.</p>



<p>Conflict and competition are not completely absent among bonobos. So the researchers also recorded when the apes formed alliances with members of the other group, cooperating to attack a third individual.</p>



<p>The two groups encountered each other frequently. They interacted with each other nearly 100 times over the study, sharing 20 percent of the two-year observation period in each other’s company. Some meetings lasted for just an hour, others for multiple weeks, allowing for longer-term bonds to be forged.</p>



<p>While the bonobos were together, the researchers documented many instances of cooperative behavior. Of the more than 3,700 grooming interactions observed, 10 percent were between bonobos of different social groups. Of all partnerships formed to attack a third individual, 15 percent were between bonobos of different groups.</p>



<p>“This is not a one-off kind of thing,” Samuni says, where individuals share food very occasionally, for example.&nbsp;In the Kokolopori bonobos, 6 percent of all food shares were across groups.</p>



<p>The cooperation wasn’t random. Individuals that tended to engage in cooperative behavior within their group were more likely to interact with bonobos in the other group that had the same tendency. This cooperation doesn’t appear to be solely motivated by immediate reciprocation, the researchers say. For instance, during the study, only 14 percent of bonobos that shared food with a partner in the other group had the deed reciprocated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study’s overall findings build on evidence from bonobos in captivity behaving similarly and raises the possibility that cooperating with nonrelatives across social groups is intrinsic to the species. Many animals will aid and cooperate with relatives, since such behavior encourages the survival and proliferation of one’s own genes, albeit indirectly. When helping nonrelatives, the evolutionary benefit is even more indirect, and doesn’t evolve as readily.</p>

Samuni/Kokolopori Bonobo Research Project</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Bonobos aren’t the only nonhuman animals known to behave in this way. Male dolphins will cooperate with other unrelated males to guard females, which increases their own chances of mating. But, unlike with a lot of the bonobo cooperation observed in the new study, there’s a clear, self-directed benefit involved in the dolphins’ behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Food sharing between unrelated individuals, though, is rare, Samuni says. Vampire bats, bonobos and humans are among the few species known to do it. Chimps also do this, but share food only within the social group, Surbeck says. In human evolution, such sharing “is considered one of those behaviors that supported our societies, that allowed us to sustain each other in terms of food shortfalls,” Samuni says.</p>





<p>Our own species’s behavior is what makes the new result particularly interesting, says Shinya Yamamoto, a comparative cognitive psychologist at Kyoto University in Japan.</p>



<p>“Humans sometimes compete or fight with neighboring groups, but other times we cooperate even with outgroup members,” Yamamoto says. Among our primate relatives, it’s been easier to find examples of aggression and competitiveness, especially in humans’ close relatives, chimpanzees. But the evolutionary origins of humankind’s cooperative side remain unclear.</p>



<p>Humans are equally related to chimpanzees and bonobos, and the new research doesn’t tell us whether early human ancestors were more like chimps with their universally rigid territories and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strategy-not-habitat-loss-leads-chimps-kill-rivals">lethal patrol groups</a>, or like the more relaxed bonobos (<em>SN: 9/17/14</em>). But the finding could lead to insights into the types of conditions in which either side of the coin evolves, Surbeck says.</p>



<p>“Under which circumstances do you see this cooperation? Under which circumstances do you see more of a chimpanzee pattern, in permanently hostile relationships between groups?” he asks. “What shifts the needle from one to the other?”</p>



<p>The finding also suggests that extensive, long-term cooperation between groups can occur without the heavy influence of cultural factors and social norms. In humans, these have been considered necessary to build and sustain between-group cooperation, Samuni says.</p>



<p>“We are showing quite a simple system,” she says. “And we still see it emerging and in a way that is quite similar [to humans].”</p>



<p>There could still be a cultural component at play with these two bonobo groups, Yamamoto says. It’s possible that over generations, some bonobos have learned to be particularly social, similarly to how elements of human culture form.</p>



<p>This study looked at just two wild bonobo groups, and other bonobo groups are known to have variable rates of interaction with other groups, Yamamoto says. So studying more of the apes might reveal something akin to social norms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flint-water-crisis-mental-health-community">Flint grapples with the mental health fallout from the water disaster</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">On a Saturday in May in Flint, Mich., residents took seats in one of three rings of chairs at a local food bank. The 50 or so participants, spanning three generations, would spend time that morning sharing stories and practicing deep listening as part of a healing circle. It’s one component of a wider community-based movement to <a href="https://healourcommunities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build relationships and challenge racist beliefs and systems</a>.</p>



<p>In one circle, healing practitioner Todd Womack asked participants to introduce themselves and describe their favorite desserts. Fingers snapped softly to signal mutual enjoyment. Next, participants paired off, with instructions to take turns asking about something that recently made them smile or laugh — and to listen without interruption. From there, new pairs moved to other topics, such as an accomplishment they were proud of.</p>





<p>Healing circles are a space to foster community, says Lynn Williams, the director of equity and community engagement at the Community Foundation of Greater Flint, who helped organize the event that morning. The circles allow room for “healing of trauma from systems, from oppression, from negativity,” she says. And they provide a place to tell a community’s full story, to “highlight the assets and the cultural contributions.”</p>



<p>The circles are one way to let people know they matter when society keeps telling them they don’t.</p>

<p>The residents of Flint — a city with a majority Black population and many people experiencing poverty — know this disregard well. In April 2014, to cut costs, state officials switched the city’s water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River without an adequate treatment plan. The public health catastrophe that has followed “is a story of government failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction and environmental injustice,” according to <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/formergovernors/Folder6/FWATF_FINAL_REPORT_21March2016.pdf?rev=284b9e42c7c840019109eb73aaeedb68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the final report from the Flint Water Advisory Task Force</a>, commissioned to find the causes of the water disaster. The human-made crisis turned a necessity into a hazard for the residents of the city, which had a population of around 99,000 at the time. The lack of proper treatment exposed people to bacteria, excessive disinfection chemicals and lead.</p>



<p>Residents reported that their physical health suffered. People <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/flintwater/documents/2016/CASPER_Report.pdf?rev=d49ce88517a34da9b3b8887076e07e10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke out in rashes, lost hair</a> and had <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5722721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gastrointestinal illnesses</a>. Researchers found an association between a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1718679115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local, deadly Legionnaires’ disease outbreak</a> in 2014–15 and insufficient disinfection in the water system. Many children have developed <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health and behavioral problems</a> from lead poisoning. “I am so upset,” says Bishop Bernadel Jefferson of Faith Deliverance Center in Flint, speaking of her grandson’s lead exposure and subsequent learning difficulties. “The system failed him.”</p>



<p>Mental health has suffered, too. Residents have reported experiencing depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. With disasters, especially those that involve toxic exposures, “the emotional consequences are long-term, because they’re fueled by this concern [that] health or cognitive functioning has been forever adversely affected,” says Evelyn Bromet, a psychiatric epidemiologist at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University in New York who has studied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.</p>



<p>For a year and a half, officials dismissed residents’ concerns about the safety of the water. “It was horrifying, because not only were they not believed, but they weren’t taken seriously,” Bromet says. The anger that goes along with that “is of course a detrimental emotional state to be in for a long period of time.”</p>



<p>Other difficult experiences compounded the anguish that came with the water disaster. “This community has been exposed to multiple traumas,” says Womack, a social worker at the University of Michigan–Flint. When the disaster began, Flint was still struggling with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs due to General Motors’ layoffs and plant closures from the 1970s to the 1990s. The COVID-19 pandemic began as the water disaster continued.</p>



<p>Mental health remains a pressing concern for the community. But there aren’t enough mental health providers to meet the need, says Barbara Wolf, a clinical health psychologist at McLaren Health Care in Flint. Genesee County, which includes Flint, is among the areas in the United States with a shortage of mental health professionals, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>So, as they’ve done before, Flint residents are finding a way. It was the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9869341/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community’s organizing and activism</a> that brought attention to the water disaster. And as Flint approaches 10 years since the disaster began, local organizations continue to help the community heal. There are <a href="https://genhs.org/free-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health and resiliency trainings</a>, mindfulness meditation and <a href="https://gfhc.org/events/talk-about-it-tuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community conversations</a> about mental health. “There’s not just one approach,” says Kristin Stevenson, project manager for the Flint Resiliency in Communities After Stress and Trauma, or ReCAST, program at the Greater Flint Health Coalition, and a healing practitioner. “All of these things combined are what create the impact.”</p>



<p>What has happened in Flint — and what continues there — illustrates a community’s activism and perseverance, as well as the mental health fallout of a disaster. But this story won’t end in Flint. Communities across the country could find themselves part of the next chapter, their lives upended by catastrophe. The United States’ <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/Final_DWINSA%20Public%20Factsheet%204.4.23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aging water infrastructure</a> has led to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2212978" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other water crises</a> and could trigger more. <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wildfires</a>, <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurricanes </a>and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heavy-precipitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floods</a>, fueled by climate change and other human-caused environmental changes, are increasing in frequency and destructiveness. Mental health will <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffer in the aftermath</a> of these traumatic events. The water disaster in Flint can be seen as both a warning and a model of community response.</p>





<p>“We recognize that our struggle, if not now, will become yours,” Womack says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The making of the water disaster in Flint</h4>



<p>A decorative archway spanning one of downtown Flint’s main thoroughfares reads “Flint: Vehicle City.” The city was home to a booming carriage business before General Motors was founded there in 1908. Residents look back with pride on the community’s activism during GM workers’ <a href="https://sloanlongway.org/flint-sit-down-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous sit-down strike</a> for better pay and recognition of their union, the United Auto Workers. For around six weeks in 1936–37, striking workers occupied factories to stop production. Family and community members <a href="https://www.geneseehistory.org/genora-johnson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided supplies and support from the outside</a>. The strike heralded the rise of the labor movement in the automotive industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="447" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-2_680.jpg?resize=680%2C447&#038;ssl=1" alt="Workers sit reading papers on couches in a factory setting with partially built automobiles in the background." class="wp-image-3133033" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-2_680.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-2_680.jpg?resize=583%2C383&amp;ssl=1 583w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-2_680.jpg?resize=283%2C186&amp;ssl=1 283w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133033">Flint residents have a long history of activism, including the sit-down strike of 1936–37 by General Motors workers, who remained in the plants to stop production (Fisher body plant factory No. 3 is shown).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3133033">SHELDON DICK/LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As in other cities, Flint’s industrial growth was detrimental to its river, as factories would discharge waste directly into the water. The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Water Act of 1972</a>, which regulates pollution from industrial and municipal sources, has improved the health of U.S. waterways, including Flint’s. In 1974, the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-safe-drinking-water-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safe Drinking Water Act</a> was enacted to safeguard the country’s drinking water. The law sets standards for levels of contaminants, including microorganisms, chemicals and metals such as lead.</p>



<p>In 2014, Flint’s water treatment plant hadn’t been fully operational for almost 50 years. Instead, the city had been purchasing treated Lake Huron water from Detroit’s water utility. But an unelected emergency manager, placed in charge of Flint’s finances by Michigan’s then-Governor Rick Snyder, had authorized a switch to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure. Water treatment is a complex process, and the Flint River water was more corrosive than other water sources. But the Flint plant <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5353852/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t test its treatment procedures sufficiently</a>, according to an analysis by water treatment experts. In violation of federal requirements, there was no corrosion control treatment, which <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b04034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helps prevent lead from leaching into the water</a> as it moves through the distribution system’s pipes.</p>



<p>When residents turned on their faucets in the weeks after the switch on April 25, they were unsettled by what came out. “I used to love tap water, just to run it and let it get cold,” Jefferson says. But after the switch, the water left a film in her mouth. Flint resident Gina Luster liked to chew ice, but it started to taste “like metal, like I’m chewing steel.” Cynthia Watkins, apostle at the Well International Church Ministries in Flint, remembers the water “just smelling, it was horrible.” For Roshanda Womack, a professional storyteller and spouse of Todd Womack, the water had a strong odor and was sometimes cloudy or had a slight brown tinge to it.</p>



<p>People in the community spoke out about the poor water quality, with some reporting rashes from exposure to the water. But officials maintained that the water was safe for use.</p>



<p>Warning signs mounted in the following months. The water in the distribution system tested positive in August for <em>E. coli</em>, which can indicate fecal contamination and inadequate disinfection. This prompted a boil water advisory. In October, General Motors announced that it would stop using the city’s water at an engine plant over concerns about corrosion. While the company switched to a different water supply for manufacturing, officials still claimed Flint’s water met safety standards for people. Throughout 2014, church leaders and other community members worked to elevate people’s concerns about the water.</p>



<p>At the end of 2014, the city was served with a Safe Drinking Water Act violation, having <a href="https://www.cityofflint.com/wp-content/uploads/City-of-Flint-Violation-Notice-MCL-TTHM-12_16_14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exceeded allowable levels of trihalomethanes</a>, disinfection by-products tied to an increased risk of cancer. These chemicals form when disinfectant added during treatment reacts with naturally occurring materials in river and lake water. One of the challenges of water treatment is maintaining proper disinfection while limiting by-product chemicals.</p>



<p>After the public notice of the violation in January 2015, Flint resident LeeAnne Walters asked the city to test her water. Samples from February and March revealed lead levels around seven and 27 times what spurs regulatory action. Walters’ home plumbing was plastic. An analysis of the city service line to the house <a href="https://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Miguels-Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed it was the source of the lead</a>. When Walters’ 4-year-old son was tested for lead in March, his level was 6.5&nbsp;micrograms per deciliter. No amount of lead is considered safe. At the time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used a reference value of 5 µg/dL, developed based on national surveys, to identify kids with the highest lead levels. In 2021, the CDC lowered that reference value to 3.5&nbsp;µg/dL.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="433" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-3_680.jpg?resize=680%2C433&#038;ssl=1" alt="A person holds a jug of brown water with a pink &quot;Safe Water&quot; sign in the background." class="wp-image-3133034" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-3_680.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-3_680.jpg?resize=601%2C383&amp;ssl=1 601w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111823_flint_inline-3_680.jpg?resize=292%2C186&amp;ssl=1 292w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3133034">Community activism was instrumental in bringing attention to the Flint water crisis.

<p>As the year continued, local organizations and churches formed the Coalition for Clean Water, which passed out flyers to inform residents of the water safety issues and collected water samples for testing. People protested, with rallies in Flint, Detroit and Lansing, the state capital. In August, organizers delivered to the mayor a petition, with more than 26,000 signatures, demanding to switch back to water from the Detroit system.</p>



<p>Then, at a September news conference, local researchers announced an alarming rise in the percentage of Flint children with lead levels of 5 µg/dL or higher. The analysis included children younger than age 5 who had had their levels checked as part of routine lead screening — 736 children in 2013, before the water source changed, and 737 after, in 2015. The percentage of kids <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered to have high lead levels</a> increased from 2.4&nbsp;percent in 2013 to 4.9 percent in 2015, the researchers reported in 2016 in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>. In neighborhoods with the most lead in the water, the jump was from 4.0 to 10.6 percent. A similar change was not seen in 2,202 children who lived outside of the city and had a different water source.</p>





<p>Lead harms children’s developing brains and nervous systems. Studies have found that the metal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338437/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupts communication between nerve cells and impairs the hippocampus</a>, a brain region important in learning and memory. Children exposed to lead can develop learning disabilities, speech and hearing disorders, and behavioral problems. The damage can shape the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>Officials ultimately couldn’t brush aside the evidence of poisoned children. The city reconnected to the Detroit water system on October 16, 2015. But that water still had to flow through Flint’s pipes, which had become corroded. The city has been replacing its lead service lines but has repeatedly missed court-ordered deadlines and still isn’t finished. Lead levels have been in compliance with federal regulations since 2016 but <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/flintwater/-/media/Project/Websites/flintwater/images/Graph-2023-07-02-Lead-Copper-Rule.jpg?rev=b0e3936df9e44957bbe60f7ff4473c94" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have fluctuated recently</a>. In 2022, lead levels rose to the highest seen in six years.</p>



<p>“We’re still not fixed,” says Kent Key, a health disparities researcher at the Flint campus of Michigan State University’s College of Human Medicine.</p>



<p>The Flint Water Advisory Task Force reported that the state government was primarily responsible for the water disaster.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The anguish Flint residents have felt</h4>



<p>The Flint community organized, rallied and distributed testing kits and bottled water while people there lived through a disaster. “The water disaster was a traumatic experience,” Todd Womack says. “At the time, I don’t think people were saying it was traumatic. I think they were saying, ‘How do we get this basic need?’”</p>



<p>Eventually, the trauma rose to the surface. There had been so much worry, stress, anger and grief. Parents who had cajoled their kids to choose water over soda and juice were distraught. “I feel so guilty now,” Luster says. “I was poisoning my kid.” Pets died unexpectedly, which seemed to be tied to drinking the water. “I ended up losing both my dogs,” Watkins says. “That was just devastating.” Getting enough bottled water was a financial hardship for many. “I watched people, low-income families or on a fixed income … take half of their money to buy water every month,” Jefferson says.</p>



<p>And for so long, residents were told, “ ‘You’re paranoid, you’re crazy, the water is fine,’ ” Roshanda Womack says, “when you can see it’s not fine.” Jennifer Carrera, an environmental sociologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing, says there were “so many ways in which the treatment of the residents minimized their experiences…. Gaslighting is a very fair way of characterizing what happened to Flint residents.”</p>



<p>Yet General Motors got a different water supply for its plant. “For parts, for automobile parts,” Jefferson says, but not for people. “It was all right for us to be poisoned. It was all right to be sick. It was all right to die.”</p>



<p>Dionna Brown, a sociology graduate student at Wayne State University in Detroit, grew up in Flint and was a teenager during the water disaster. Brown felt “like the government is trying to poison a Black city.” She realized, “Black children, we can’t have a childhood. We have to grow up fast.”</p>



<p>“To live with that level of betrayal,” says Bromet, the Stony Brook psychiatric epidemiologist, “of course it takes its toll.”</p>



<p>As does the lack of justice. “The perpetrator, in a just and fair society, is held accountable,” Key says. “In the Flint water crisis, that still hasn’t happened.” The city has been “forced to work with the perpetrator, the state, to work towards recovery.”</p>



<p>The experience has left many unconvinced that the city’s water is safe. “I think you’re just going to have a large portion of the population that is never going to drink the water again,” says social epidemiologist Jerel Ezell of the University of California, Berkeley, who grew up in the Flint suburbs.</p>



<p>Worrying about water “puts a strain on you,” says Flint resident Tyshae Brady. “I don’t want to always go over to a friend’s house and go, ‘Hey, is your water safe to drink?’ ” The unease extends beyond Flint, too. Flint church elder Sarah Bailey, who has worked on stroke prevention in the community and other projects, recalls being at a Boston restaurant with colleagues. “The waitress brings some water to the table in glasses, and I reach over and say, ‘Do you happen to have any bottled water?’ ” One of her colleagues told Bailey the water was safe. “I said, ‘For you…. The water was not safe for me.’ ”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The mental health aftermath of the water crisis</h4>



<p>The disaster has weighed heavily on the mental health of residents, both children and adults. From December 2018 to March 2020, researchers surveyed the caregivers of 1,203 children, ages 3 to 17. The caregiver-reported <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2023.307406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rates of anxiety and depression</a> among the children were 13&nbsp;percent for anxiety and 8&nbsp;percent for depression, higher than the national rates of 9 and 4 percent for that age group, the researchers reported in September in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>.</p>



<p>A different research team surveyed 1,970 adult residents from August 2019 to April 2020 — around that time, Flint’s total population was just over 81,000. Twenty-two percent of the respondents had experienced symptoms of depression in the past year, while <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 percent met criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder</a>. That’s higher than the estimated past-year rates, 8&nbsp;percent for depression and 5 percent for PTSD, for the U.S. population. Extending the findings to Flint’s population suggests that around 13,600 adults may have experienced depression and around 15,000 may have had PTSD, the researchers reported in 2022 in<em> JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>



<p>People who were worried the water had harmed their or their family’s health were more than twice as likely to meet the criteria for depression and about 1.7 times as likely for PTSD, compared with people without this concern.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lingering mental health effects</h3>



<p>More than 20 percent of nearly 2,000 adult Flint residents surveyed about five years after the water crisis began met the criteria for past-year depression. Nearly 25 percent met the criteria for past-year post-traumatic stress disorder, above the percentage for postdeployment Gulf War veterans.</p>

<p>Past tragedies, such as a serious accident, physical abuse, sexual assault or a previous environmental calamity, can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096796/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase mental health risks</a> when disaster strikes. “Your cumulative exposure to potentially traumatic events drives a lot of the risk for either developing or maintaining PTSD or depression,” says Dean Kilpatrick, a clinical psychologist at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston and one of the authors of the study in adults. Kilpatrick and colleagues found that the risk of developing symptoms of depression increased by a factor of close to three, and for PTSD symptoms by a factor of 4.6, for Flint residents with past exposure to a potentially traumatic event, compared with those without.</p>



<p>For some, mental health issues from disasters <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735822000885" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may persist for years</a>. Researchers followed mothers who experienced Hurricane Katrina and had incomes less than twice the federal poverty line. The women were surveyed at three points after August of 2005, when the storm hit the U.S. Gulf Coast. Although rates of post-traumatic stress symptoms declined over time among the women, 1 in 6 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still had symptoms 12 years after the hurricane</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in <em>Social Science &amp; Medicine</em>. Mothers with young children who were evacuees after the Chernobyl disaster and Chernobyl cleanup workers have had <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0936655511005334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-lasting mental health consequences</a>.</p>



<p>Despite the potential impacts, only 35 percent of respondents in the study in J<em>AMA Network Open </em>reported that they had ever been offered mental health care to attend to issues that arose from the water disaster. If offered, most people — 79&nbsp;percent — took advantage.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, another traumatic experience, hit the community while they were still dealing with the water disaster. In the most recent Community Health Needs Assessment for Flint and surrounding Genesee County, from 2022, 45&nbsp;percent of respondents to the assessment’s resident survey indicated that they were dealing with stress, and 33 percent said they had <a href="https://gfhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hc726-CHNA-Report-2022_web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health problems such as depression or anxiety</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How the community is helping and healing</h4>



<p>Having too few mental health care practitioners is not an issue unique to Flint. Nearly 166 million people in the United States, about half the population, live in areas with <a href="https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/shortage-areas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a shortage of mental health professionals</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has<a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/practitioner/2022-covid-psychologist-workload" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> only exacerbated the problem</a>.</p>



<p>Treatment options did recently expand somewhat in Flint. In May, local mental health services provider Genesee Health System opened a new outpatient clinic that serves uninsured county residents. The treatment facility is funded in part by a recently passed property tax increase to support mental health in the county.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Flint organizations are taking community-based approaches to help residents cope. The Flint ReCAST program, supported with a grant from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, funds local organizations seeking to address trauma and stress in the community. ReCAST has supported art, music and dance programs for young people and an initiative to build mindfulness skills among the police and community members.</p>



<p>ReCAST also funds Genesee Health System to offer free community mental health and resiliency trainings, on topics ranging from recognizing suicidal ideation to learning about mental health and stigma to building resiliency. ReCAST and Genesee mental health professionals have teamed up for virtual conversations about mental health called Talk About It Tuesdays.</p>



<p>The Flint Public Health Youth Academy, which Key began developing in 2014, is a homegrown initiative to inspire Flint’s young people to pursue careers in public health. “I wanted to create a youth group that did not allow the water crisis to be a sentence of doom and gloom,” he says, but rather a jumping-off point to create the next generation of public health professionals. Among the academy’s activities is an annual summer camp that centers on a public health topic, such as environmental justice.</p>



<p>Looking to the future, Stevenson, the project manager for ReCAST, is interested in bringing training of mental health ambassadors to Flint. The idea is to train trusted community members to be a source of mental health information for their neighborhoods. Stevenson is also a big proponent of healing circles as a way to help people heal and build resilience.</p>

<p>At the close of one healing circle on that Saturday in May, Todd Womack took out a skein of moss green yarn. Womack asked the participants to be ready to share something they appreciate about themselves. Womack went first, then tossed the skein to another participant while holding on to a piece of the yarn. As each person took a turn, the skein zigzagged across the space, unwinding along the way. In the end, everyone in the circle was holding on to the web of yarn, a physical reminder of the community and connections created that morning.</p>



<p>That afternoon, three different groups formed to discuss changes residents would like to see in Flint. People responded on sticky notes to different questions, such as what Flint would look like without gun violence. People talked about the city’s history, GM’s layoffs and the abandoned homes that still dot many neighborhoods, the result of years of population loss. After a peak of nearly 197,000 in 1960, the latest population estimate, from 2022, is under 80,000.</p>



<p>The people gathered that Saturday are among those who have stayed. They are Flintstones, as residents call themselves. While brainstorming about Flint’s future, playful chants broke out between the groups, each of which had taken on a Flint-related name. “Flintstones!” one group cried. “810!” another responded, referring to the local area code. “Bedrock!” boomed the third, naming the town from the old <em>The Flintstones </em>cartoon.</p>



<p>When residents reflect on Flint, the strong sense of community comes up again and again. It’s how residents have stood up for their health and safety during a disaster, and it’s how they continue to care for each other.</p>



<p>“There’s really this unity and connectedness with anyone who has lived here,” Todd Womack says.</p>



<p>“We’re a loving city,” Dionna Brown says, “and we’re going to be OK.”</p>



<p>“There are amazing, deeply committed people that live here … there’s a lot of commitment, there’s a lot of passion,” Lynn Williams says. “And that’s why we stay.”</p>

<p>Researchers apparently don’t need to be real to publish in scientific journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take Nicholas Zafetti of Clemson University, in South Carolina, who has at least <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?search_mode=content&amp;and_facet_researcher=ur.011133550723.76">nine publications</a> to his name. Or Giorgos Jimenez of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EFB4C7C007DEDF4D152FD720A6E6FD">12 papers</a> under his belt.</p>



<p>Both identities seem to be bogus, according to Alexander Magazinov, a scientific sleuth and software engineer based in Kazakhstan. They add to a short but growing list of ostensibly fictitious researchers who appear as coauthors on real papers. </p>



<span id="more-128271"></span>



<p>We’ve written about Beatriz Ychussie of Roskilde University, in Denmark, whose <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/18/another-whodunit-the-author-no-one-can-find/">work was marred by plagiarism and faked peer review</a>; Dragan Rodriguez of Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/15/who-are-you-dragan-rodriguez-fifteen-studies-have-the-same-fake-author-sleuth-finds/">whose name adorned 15 articles</a> on anything from cancer detection to “renewable energy systems optimization;” and Toshiyuki Bangi of Nanyang Technological University, in Singapore, who apparently was added to manuscripts by researchers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/05/eight-papers-retracted-after-author-found-to-be-fictional/">looking to boost their “chances in the review process</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Zafetti nor Jimenez responded to interview requests sent to the email addresses listed on their papers.</p>



<p>Magazinov spotted Zafetti, as he did Rodriguez, while investigating a potential citation ring linked to an Iranian paper mill. Intriguingly, Zafetti had published almost exclusively with Chinese researchers. And his papers – appearing in titles from Springer Nature, Elsevier and Taylor &amp; Francis – included an unusually high number of references to work by Noradin Ghadimi, a researcher at Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University, in Turkey. (Ghadimi did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p>In October, Magazinov contacted Clemson University to share his concerns. In an email to Tracy Arwood, associate vice president and chief ethics and compliance officer at the institution, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This case is similar to several others, where fictional identities of US-based researchers were used in scientific publications. …</p>



<p>The similarities with the &#8220;Rodriguez&#8221; case include complete absence of domestic collaboration (the coauthors are mostly Chinese, with one exception: a single paper signed by Charalampos Baniotopoulos from Birmingham, UK), as well as an unexpected abundance of citations to one specific person, Noradin Ghadimi.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Arwood promised to investigate. On November 6, she circled back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have completed our review. We are reaching out to the journal editors to share our findings and ask for any information they may have that is contrary to our findings. We will also ask that they take appropriate action if they agree with our findings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Arwood nor the university’s newsroom responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three affected publishers all told us they were looking into the concerns about Zafetti. An Elsevier spokesperson added that the company was investigating authorship changes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544221011580?via%3Dihubhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544221011580">two</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484720306156">of</a> Zafetti’s papers “that were not approved by the Editors.”<em>.</em></p>



<p>We also reached out to two of Zafetti’s (seemingly real) coauthors, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231114151542/https:/orcid.org/0000-0003-2784-7706">Ziyu Wang</a> of the University of Birmingham, in the U.K., and Yongtang Wu of Weifang University of Science and Technology, in China, but did not hear back.</p>



<p>Magazinov shared with us three other apparently fake identities he had stumbled on during his sleuthing: a &#8220;<a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?search_mode=content&amp;and_facet_researcher=ur.011731403107.18">Benjamin Badami</a>&#8221; of the University of Georgia, in Athens, Georgia; an &#8220;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isatra.2021.01.043">Achla Anderson</a>&#8221; of Texas Tech University, in Lubbock; and a &#8220;<a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?search_mode=content&amp;and_facet_researcher=ur.07403031537.97">Scott Mizzi</a>&#8221; of Northeastern University, in Boston. They all published exclusively with international coauthors, mainly from China, and none appeared on the websites of the institutions with which they were allegedly affiliated.</p>



<p>As to Jimenez, SAGE Publications publicly called the bluff last year. In a pair of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09544119221134231">retraction</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09544119221134230">notices</a>, the publisher stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following publication of the article, the Journal became aware that the identity of one of the authors, G Jimenez, cannot be confirmed at their listed institution. The authors were asked for an explanation of the involvement of an unauthorised third party and did not provide a response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But that didn’t stop Jimenez’ work from being <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809422008886?via%3Dihub">published elsewhere</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/obesity-semaglutide-wegovy-heart-attack-stroke">The weight loss drug Wegovy lowered heart attack risk in a large trial</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PHILADELPHIA ­</strong>—&nbsp;At the recent American Heart Association meeting, a cavernous room full of doctors erupted into applause. Cleveland Clinic cardiologist A. Michael Lincoff had just presented the dramatic&nbsp;—&nbsp;and at times enigmatic&nbsp;—&nbsp;results of a new clinical trial on the weight loss drug semaglutide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drug, sold under the brand name Wegovy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/?_ga=2.241453762.1720669771.1692203876-1411015482.1692203876#!/10871/presentation/16575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut patients’ risk of major cardiovascular problems</a>&nbsp;by 20 percent, Lincoff reported November 11. It also reduced the risk of dying&nbsp;—&nbsp;from any cause&nbsp;—&nbsp;over the roughly 40 months patients participated in the study on average.</p>





<p>Lincoff’s work notches yet another role for semaglutide, which doctors currently use to treat diabetes and obesity. Previous work had already uncovered a cardiovascular benefit in people with type 2 diabetes. The new study, which targeted overweight or obese patients with cardiovascular disease, is the first to show that semaglutide can help the hearts of people without diabetes too.</p>



<p>That’s important because it expands the number of people who could benefit from the drug, says Tiffany Powell-Wiley, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the National&nbsp;Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. In the United States alone, more than 6 million obese or overweight people have cardiovascular disease but not diabetes. Semaglutide could be a game changer for these people, says Powell-Wiley, who was not part of the new trial. Still, she and others at the meeting recognized the limitations of the study&nbsp;—&nbsp;and the limitations of the drug.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As much as we may want a quick fix for the rising levels of obesity seen around the world, Powell-Wiley says, “it’s important to understand that this isn’t the panacea.” We still don’t know how well semaglutide works in a diverse group of people, she says. And the drug doesn’t fix the&nbsp;societal, environmental and social factors that lead to obesity — and its potential health consequences — in the first place.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Semaglutide reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke and death</h4>



<p>Semaglutide is one among a family of drugs gaining popularity for treating obesity. On November 8, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-medication-chronic-weight-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved&nbsp;a new one</a>: tirzepatide, a relative of semaglutide that goes by the brand name Zepbound.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic-strokes-heart#faq">[See also:&nbsp;<strong>Semaglutide FAQ</strong>&nbsp;]</a></p>



<p>Semaglutide, sold under the brand name Ozempic, first came on the market for treating diabetes in 2017. Since then, the drug’s slew of uses has kept growing. In 2020, the FDA OK’d it for cutting cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes and heart disease. And in 2021, treatment for obesity (with the higher dose Wegovy) joined the list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lincoff’s semaglutide trial, called SELECT, included more than 17,000 people, half of whom received weekly injections of semaglutide for roughly three years; the other half got a placebo.&nbsp;By the end of the trial, 8 percent of the people in the placebo group had had a nonfatal stroke or heart attack or died due to cardiovascular causes. That number&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped to 6.5 percent in the semaglutide group</a>, Lincoff reported at the meeting and online November 11 in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk reduction</h3>



<p>In a trial of 17,000 adults, those taking the drug Wegovy were less likely to experience nonfatal heart attacks, nonfatal heart strokes or death due to cardiovascular causes than those taking a placebo. This reduction in risk occurred early in the trial — before participants had lost a lot of weight. That suggests the drug may somehow be boosting heart health directly.</p>

<p>The difference between the two groups may not sound like much, but “it’s a massive result,” says Amit Khera, a cardiologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas who was not part of the trial. One can’t underestimate the importance of finding a new treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The illness is “the largest source of mortality in the world,” Lincoff said at a news conference on November 10, and there’s no single therapy that can eliminate it. Instead, doctors try to chip away at it with various treatments that offer incremental benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For overweight or obese people with heart disease, Khera says, semaglutide is another tool in cardiologists’ toolkits.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Questions remain about how the drug works — and for whom</h4>



<p>The new study results flesh out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic-strokes-heart#faq">earlier news of the trial released by funder Novo Nordisk in August</a>&nbsp;<em>(SN: 8/29/23</em>). At the time, doctors wanted to know who the drug helped, how it worked and what side effects it set off. The latest report offers answers to some questions but kicks others wide open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants on semaglutide were slightly more likely to drop out of the trial than those taking the placebo. That difference seemed to be driven by the drug’s gastrointestinal side effects, which include nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. The number of serious issues that occurred, like cancer or infection, was slightly lower in the semaglutide group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though semaglutide offered clear cardiovascular benefits for patients, one mysterious aspect of the data snagged researchers’ attention. The drug’s protective effects became apparent early in the trial&nbsp;—&nbsp;well before participants had shed lots of pounds.</p>



<p>That’s a big deal because it suggests semaglutide may be boosting heart health directly, perhaps in addition to the typical benefits that accompany weight loss, says&nbsp;Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. She was not involved in the study but is on Novo Nordisk’s scientific advisory board. Lincoff said his team is “working feverishly” on analyzing the SELECT data to better understand semaglutide’s actions.</p>



<p>Those data include demographic and medical information on thousands of trial participants. But the trial does have one “huge limitation,” says Powell-Wiley: 84 percent of the study’s participants were white and 72 percent were men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expanding the diversity of people represented in clinical trials like these is crucial, she said. It’s a point she brought up in a panel discussion after Lincoff’s talk, and one that — like the trial’s results — garnered widespread applause. In the United States, African-American, Hispanic and Indigenous people are most impacted by obesity, Powell-Wiley says, and the new trial doesn’t tell us much about how semaglutide works in those groups.</p>

<p>A former PhD student at Auburn University in Alabama relabeled and reused images inappropriately in a grant application, published paper, and several presentations, a U.S. government watchdog has found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Office of Research Integrity says Sarah Elizabeth Martin “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally or knowingly falsifying and/or fabricating experimental data and results obtained under different experimental conditions,” according to a <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/case-summary-martin-sarah-elizabeth">case summary</a> posted online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The published paper, “<a href="https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/27/9/1102.short">The m6A landscape of polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA and its related methylome in the context of KSHV replication</a>,” appeared online in advance of publication in <em>RNA</em> in June 2021. The journal <a href="https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/28/2/274.full">retracted</a> the article last year, with the following notice:</p>



<span id="more-128267"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>RNA</em> is retracting the above-mentioned article because the authors have lost confidence in the validity of some of the data and conclusions drawn from them. This action has been agreed to by all of the authors. The authors regret any inconvenience that this has caused to the scientific community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited a total of nine times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science, seven of the citations coming after the retraction.</p>



<p>ORI’s findings include an extensive and detailed list of images Martin reused and relabeled to represent different experiments, including original gel images in PowerPoint presentations she provided to <em>RNA</em> to support her data. </p>



<p>We sent an email requesting comment to Martin’s Auburn email address and did not immediately receive a response or a bounce back. Martin’s former advisor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-sztuba-soli%C5%84ska-phd-18830094/">Joanna Sztuba-Solińska</a>, was the principal investigator on the grant application ORI said contained fake data. That grant garnered $188,451 in funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Sztuba-Solińska now works in vaccine development at Pfizer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martin agreed to a three-year ban from all federal contracting, including grant funding, as well as a two-year supervision period for any federally-funded research to begin after the ban lapses. During the five-year period, Martin may not serve in any advisory or consulting role with the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the National Institutes of Health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-scans-how-teens-handle-pandemic-stress">Brain scans give clues to how teens handle pandemic stress</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON </strong>— Brain scans could be used to predict how teenagers’ mental health will fare during a stressful time, an analysis that spanned the COVID-19 pandemic suggests.</p>



<p>The findings, presented November 13 in a news briefing at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, may help explain <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10892/presentation/22261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why some people succumb to stress</a> while others are more resilient.</p>



<p>For a lot of research, “the study happens, and you report on the results, and that’s about it,” says Margot Wagner, a bioengineer at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved in the new work. But this research followed hundreds of teenagers over time, a study design that “means you can intervene and help way sooner than otherwise,” Wagner says.</p>





<p>The pandemic was particularly tough for many teenagers, as isolation, worry and upheaval of daily routines affected them in ways that scientists are just now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-prematurely-aged-teens-brains">starting to see</a> (<em>SN: 1/3/23</em>). A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boys-experience-depression-differently-girls">record number of young people</a> are struggling with depression and anxiety, a mental health crisis that some scientists are calling “the second pandemic” (<em>SN: 6/30/23</em>).</p>



<p>While many teenagers struggled during the pandemic, others did OK. Computational neuroscientist Caterina Stamoulis of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital investigated why responses differed using data collected as part of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development, or ABCD, study. That larger study — involving scientists at 21 research sites across the United States — aims to figure out how teenagers’ brains grow over the years.</p>



<p>“This is the first time in history we’re looking at thousands of participants and getting these measures over time,” Wagner says. “It’s truly remarkable.”</p>



<p>The ABCD study, begun in 2015, was well under way when COVID hit, so researchers possessed brain scans from before the pandemic. “Without the pandemic, we would not have been able to understand the impact of a long-lasting adverse event” that deeply affected the participants’ lives, changing their interactions with their family and friends, Stamoulis says.</p>



<p>At the outset of the project, fMRI brain scans measured blood flow — a proxy for brain cell activity — in 1,414 teenagers, a subset of the more than 11,000 adolescents enrolled in the ABCD study. The fMRI images recorded how certain regions of the brain behave in tandem with each other, a clue that those regions work together in what neuroscientists call a brain circuit.</p>



<p>“Neuroimaging data is particularly useful for developing predictive models of future outcomes,” says neuroscientist and engineer Vince Calhoun of Georgia Tech, “including resilience to stress, depression and many other things.”</p>



<p>In May 2020, as the world shut down, researchers started surveying the teenagers in the study about how they were holding up. These surveys, sent every few months, measured aspects of mental health, stress and sadness, among other things.</p>



<p>Teenagers who had weaker neural connections between certain parts of the brain before the pandemic fared worse than teenagers with stronger neural connections, the team found. These brain regions included the prefrontal cortex, a brain area that gets drastically reshaped during adolescence, and the amygdala, a structure on each side of the brain that’s involved in emotions. Weaker brain connections were associated with kids having more sadness and stress during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Weaker and more fragile networks predicted harder times during the pandemic, Stamoulis says. But “stronger and more resilient brain networks predicted better mental health, lower stress and lower sadness.”</p>



<p>She and her colleagues plan to study these brain circuits as time goes on. As brains develop, they respond to experiences and environments. If those are positive, Stamoulis says, they can be “protective factors for the brain and how its circuits evolve and become wired.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/AdobeStock_610377029-1-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Oral cancer, also known as mouth cancer, refers to cancers that develop in any part of the mouth including the lips, tongue, gums, palate, inner cheeks, and minor salivary glands. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common oral cancer and ranks as a “top 10” cancer globally in the male population. Annually, approximately 370,000 new cases of oral cancer are recorded worldwide, with an incidence rate of 7.1 per 100,000 people. Moreover, approximately 200,000 deaths related to oral cancer are estimated each year, with a mortality rate of 3.8 per 100,000 people. The highest mortality rates are observed in Eastern Europe, South Asia and Southeast Asia as well as in Latin America. Incidence and mortality rates are higher in men than in women across all age groups.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13388" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13388" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-13388" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/AdobeStock_116110879-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13388" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© freshidea / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Disparities in the worldwide occurrence of this disease are primarily attributed to differences in lifestyle and exposure to risk factors, such as tobacco, alcohol, betel quid and sun exposure, in the case of lip cancer. Although it may not be as widely discussed as other types of cancer, oral cancer is a significant health issue that affects people of all ages. It not only results in significant mortality but also causes extensive facial disfigurement, loss of oral functionality (including speech and swallowing), economic and psychological burden.</p>
<h3><strong>The importance of early diagnosis</strong></h3>
<p>Early diagnosis and effective treatment play a pivotal role in improving patient outcomes and reducing the mortality rates associated with oral cancer. However, most cases are detected at a late stage, when treatment is complex, costly, and yields poor results. Early diagnosis is a cornerstone of mitigating the impact of oral cancer, but its importance is a particularly critical dimension in a global context. Access to healthcare services, awareness, and resources varies significantly from region to region. Therefore, it is paramount to develop strategies that can be effectively implemented in diverse healthcare settings to ensure equitable access to early diagnosis at a global scale.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the current perspectives on global oral health?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2015, the United Nations formulated 17 <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) within the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">Agenda 2030 Action Plan</a> to achieve peace, prosperity, and well-being for all by 2030. <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">SDG 3</a> aims to ensure a healthy life and promote well-being for people of all ages. However, achieving this goal is not possible unless countries adopt integrated approaches to address non-communicable diseases, including strategies to combat the burden of oral diseases.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/inequalities-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© Natalia / stock.adobe.com</div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, oral health is not explicitly mentioned or addressed within the context of SDG 3. Conditions such as dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer affect a staggering 3.58 billion people worldwide, making them the most common and preventable non-communicable diseases afflicting humanity, so oral health is fundamental to achieving good health and well-being and serves as the foundation for SDG 3.</p>
<p>In response to this, the International Dental Federation (FDI) and the International Association of Dental Research (IADR) have issued a <a href="https://www.fdiworlddental.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/fdi-wha72-11_4_implementation_sdgs_0.pdf">joint statement</a> advocating for the inclusion of oral health in Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interplay between oral health, general health, and overall well-being is undeniable and should not be underestimated. It is imperative to raise global awareness within the dental and oral health sciences community to prioritize oral health care, promote oral health, and ensure universal health coverage.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategies for reducing risk</strong></h3>
<p>Strategies to reduce the risk factors associated with oral cancer, such as tobacco and alcohol cessation, as well as promoting regular oral examination, must be tailored to the unique challenges faced by communities worldwide. Cultural factors, socioeconomic disparities, and healthcare infrastructure/access play a role in shaping the landscape of prevention efforts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13387" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13387" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-13387" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/iStock-1403523137-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13387" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© fizkes / Getty Images / iStock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oral cancer disproportionately affects economically vulnerable individuals, and reducing social inequalities necessitates the implementation of national policies coordinated with broader health and social initiatives. This approach, known as the common risk factor approach, is based on controlling the environment, ensuring access to safe water, providing adequate food, conducting public and professional education campaigns on early signs and symptoms, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment, applying evidence-based treatments appropriate to available resources, and offering thoughtful rehabilitation and palliative care.</p>
<h3><strong>Call for Papers!</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dentalhealth.org/mouthcanceractionmonth2023">Mouth Cancer Awareness Month</a> is an annual initiative that encourages individuals and communities to learn more about the disease, its risk factors, and, most importantly, how early detection and prevention can be achieved to save lives. In line with this alarming international scenario, <em>BMC Oral Health</em> has recently launched a new Collection ‘<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/EDPOC">Early detection and prevention of oral cancer</a>’ dedicated to recruiting cutting-edge research advancements, innovative methodologies, and clinical insights for the early diagnosis and prevention of oral cancer.</p>

<p>A public health journal intends to retract an article that estimated how many unintentional pesticide poisonings happen each year worldwide, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the authors hired a lawyer to represent them in contesting the retraction, and maintain the journal’s decision “undermines the integrity of the scientific process.” This is the second time within a few months that the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/04/authors-file-complaint-with-publisher-as-journal-retracts-vaping-paper/">retracted an article</a> through a process authors said was problematic.</p>



<span id="more-128259"></span>



<p><em>BMC Public Health</em> published the article, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09939-0">The global distribution of acute unintentional pesticide poisoning: estimations based on a systematic review</a>,” in December 2020. It has been cited 145 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors are all affiliated with the Pesticide Action Network, a collection of organizations “working to replace the use of hazardous pesticides with ecologically sound and socially just alternatives,” as they disclosed in the paper. In their review, they concluded that unintentional pesticide poisoning “is an ongoing major global public health challenge” and “a problem that warrants immediate action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Wolfgang-quote-for-retraction-watch.docx.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch, first author Wolfgang Boedeker called the journal’s process for deciding to retract the paper “problematic from the beginning.” He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There was no information provided to the authors about any kind of investigation into our paper prior to being informed about the planned retraction. We, the authors, were piece-wise informed about the reasons, only after repeatedly asking for them. We learned by email that the details of the investigation remained confidential.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper previously attracted criticism from the pesticide industry. In October 2021, the journal published a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0#author-information">letter to the editor</a> in which employees of Bayer and CropLife International claimed the numbers in the article “appear to overestimate the global burden of pesticide poisonings.” The authors <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11941-z">responded</a> that the critics “do not seem to have understood our estimation method.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the journal informed Boedeker’s group of a separate critique from a reader alleging they had overestimated the number of pesticide poisonings in France. The authors responded, but their response was apparently unsatisfactory. In April, an editor told the authors that the journal would retract their article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the authors’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/retraction-BMC-PH-final-080523.pdf">rebuttal</a> to the retraction, they were told the decision was based on the assessment of one editorial board member. After further back-and-forth, the authors learned the critical reader and editorial board member had concerns about the data the authors had sourced for other countries in addition to France. They defended their methods in detail in their rebuttal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boedeker told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The critique suggests that using an ‘ever’ prevalence of poisoning to denote annual frequency may result in an overestimation. We agreed on this and discussed this at length as a possible source for bias in our publication. However, the question is if such an overestimation has taken place. We detailed in our rebuttal that the prevalences used in our extrapolations are not higher than “true” annual ones and therefore no overestimation has taken place. For countries without a strict annual prevalence the effect on the extrapolations is negligible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On May 24, Natalie Pafitis, senior editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, emailed the authors saying the journal would still retract the article following “further advice” from an editorial board member on their rebuttal. Pafitis shared the editorial board member’s comments and wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As stated previously, and in light of the advice received above, we no longer have confidence in the data you are reporting in your study and will be proceeding with a retraction using the following text:</p>



<p>============</p>



<p>The Editor has retracted this article because concerns were raised about the use of&nbsp; ‘ever’ prevalence of pesticide poisoning to represent annual frequency in the extrapolations. Expert assessment has confirmed the validity of this concern and also concluded that the assumption of annual exposure for countries where the time frame is not reported is unreliable.&nbsp; The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented. [The authors agree/do not agree with this retraction].</p>



<p>===========</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pafitis has not responded to our request for comment. Last month, the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/27/exclusive-public-health-journal-says-it-will-retract-vaping-paper-for-questions-authors-say-were-addressed-in-peer-review/">retracted a paper</a> on e-cigarettes and smoking rates, also following a reader critique and assessment by an editorial board member, which the authors of that paper said was flawed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the pesticide paper <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rebuttal-BMC-PH-retraction-extension.pdf">responded</a> to the editorial board member’s new comments, disputing them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On July 14, their lawyer sent the journal a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-07-14-Letter-Resp.-to-Editors-re-Global-UAPP-Article-Retraction.pdf">letter</a> arguing that the retraction would be “inappropriate.” The lawyer proposed that the paper receive an expression of concern instead of a retraction notice, and that the authors be allowed to republish it elsewhere. The letter stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Authors feel strongly that the importance of the topic of their work requires more scientific debate, not the complete elimination of their findings from scientific discourse.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Boedeker said the journal should have asked the critical reader to submit a letter to the editor, “which would have generated an interesting dialogue on the science around estimations of pesticide poisoning,” and “could have encouraged further discussion of how to improve on data collection on pesticide poisonings, by governments and other institutions, in order to work towards preventing harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if the critique of the paper was correct, Boedeker said, the effect on the study’s results would be negligible, and the journal’s decision to retract wouldn’t line up with its own <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#corrections+and+retractions">policies</a>. &#8220;The retraction of our paper is an unacceptable result from an unacceptable process,&#8221; he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/huntingtons-disease-development-gene-brain">Why Huntington’s disease may take so long to develop</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> <strong>— </strong>Scientists have uncovered a clue about why it takes so long for Huntington’s disease to develop. And they may have a lead on how to stop the fatal brain disease.</p>



<p>Huntington’s is caused by a mistakenly repeated bit of a gene called <em>HTT.</em> Until recently, researchers thought the number of repeats a person is born with doesn’t change, though repeats may expand when passed to future generations.</p>



<p>But in some brain cells, the repeats <a href="https://eppro01.ativ.me/src/EventPilot/php/express/web/planner.php?id=ASHG23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can grow over time to hundreds of copies</a>, geneticist Bob Handsaker reported November 2 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. Once the number of repeats passes a certain point, the activity of thousands of other genes in the brain cells changes drastically, leading the cells to die.</p>





<p>These findings suggest that adding repeats to the <em>HTT</em> gene in vulnerable brain cells is what is driving Huntington’s disease, says Handsaker, of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Mass. The research also suggests that preventing the repeats from growing may stop the development of the disease.</p>



<p>The new work gives “serious insight into the disease mechanism,” says Russell Snell, a geneticist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>About 41,000 people in the United States have symptomatic Huntington’s disease, and another 200,000 are at risk of developing it. Inheriting just one copy of a repeat-riddled <em>HTT</em> gene produces symptoms.</p>



<p>Even though individuals are born with the disease-causing gene, symptoms don’t usually appear until people are in their 30s to 50s. Those symptoms include depression, mood swings, forgetfulness, balance problems, involuntary movements and slurred speech. Eventually, a person with the disease may be paralyzed and can die from complications such as pneumonia or heart failure.</p>



<p>In one part of the <em>HTT</em> gene, the DNA bases cytosine, adenine and guanine — CAG — are repeated over and over. Most people have 26 or fewer repeats, but people who have 40 or more repeats will develop Huntington’s disease. The more repeats, the earlier symptoms start.</p>



<p>Previously, researchers thought that long-term exposure to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/signs-huntingtons-show-brain-childhood">toxic huntingtin protein</a> — made from the disease-causing version of <em>HTT</em> — damaged and killed brain cells, much like smoking does to lung cells, Snell says (<em>SN: 10/18/15</em>).</p>



<p>In the new research, Handsaker and colleagues examined individual brain cells in donated brains from people with and without the disease. After measuring the length of the repeated genetic bit in all the cells, the researchers found a “dramatic expansion” of the repeats in brain cells called striatal projection neurons, also known as medium spiny neurons, in people with Huntington’s, Handsaker said. The extra DNA wasn&#8217;t found in other types of brain cells in people with or without the disease.</p>



<p>“Some cells had up to 1,000 CAG repeats,” Handsaker said. The additions “occurred only in the vulnerable cell types that are lost to” Huntington’s disease. Exactly why the repeats grow longer in those cells and not others is not yet known.</p>



<p>Only a few cells had such long stretches of repeats. Most spiny neurons had added more modest numbers, he said. Based on the ages of the donors when they died and on computer simulations, the researchers noticed an unusual pattern to the ever-accumulating repeats. It can take decades to go from about 40 repeats to 80, but then the process picks up steam. It takes only a few years to go from 90 repeats to 100s, Handsaker said.</p>



<p>It wasn’t clear at first whether additional repeats affected the brain cells. So, the researchers examined the activity of thousands of genes by charting RNA levels in the donated cells. The activity of those genes remained stable until the disease-causing version of <em>HTT</em> had about 150 repeats. Then, gene activity altered drastically: Thousands of genes increased activity, while thousands of others decreased.</p>





<p>Since precise levels of activity are needed to keep cells healthy, it’s probably this change that leads to the death of the cells within months of reaching 150. “It looks like a switch,” Snell says. “It looks like you’re OK, more or less, to 150.”</p>



<p>But, Handsaker said, why things are generally fine until that point and then go awry is another mystery. “We really don’t know what goes wrong at 150.”</p>



<p>Regardless, keeping the growth of the repeats in check may be a way to stop the disease from progressing. CAG sequences might inadvertently get added when a protein called MSH3, which is involved in repairing DNA, loses its place. Lowering levels of that protein may prevent the expansion, Handsaker said.</p>



<p>Current experimental techniques for managing Huntington’s focus on lowering the levels of huntingtin. Another insight of the new research, Snell says, is these strategies may not be necessary.</p>



<p>The “work represents a very interesting potential paradigm shift for [Huntington’s] research,” says Leora Fox, Assistant Director of Research and Patient Engagement for the Huntington’s Disease Society of America in New York City. “Huntingtin lowering is not dead, but targeting [DNA] instability holds therapeutic potential.”</p>



<p>Computational biologist Liana Lareau agrees. The work is “a success story for single-cell sequencing,” which the researchers used to examine DNA and RNA in individual cells. The new insights would not have been possible without examining how DNA changes and gene activity are coordinated, says Lareau, of the University of California, Berkeley. And brain donations were also key, she says. “We can’t see this type of thing when we look at cells … in a dish. You need the full complexity of the natural environment.”</p>

                <p>Smallpox, measles, mumps. These are among the contagious diseases that European colonists likely brought to the Americas at the turn of the 16th century, prompting the collapse of Indigenous populations. But the exact viruses that caused the millions of deaths remain unknown.</p>

<p>Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks to solve that historical puzzle. An evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, he uses cutting-edge tools to study ancient viruses and illuminate how they have shaped human evolution and history. In recent work, Blanco-Melo and colleagues reconstructed two viruses circulating in Mexico at the time of European colonization.</p>



<p>“Our research on ancient viruses is really appealing to the curiosity of the people and how we can study history,” Blanco-Melo says. But this work also holds personal meaning for Blanco-Melo as someone who was born and raised in Mexico. Through genetic sleuthing, he is able to study “something that is very dear in my heart,” he says, “really understanding, with molecular biology, those historical events.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Viruses shape human evolution</h4>



<p>Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school when he had a chance encounter with Matt Ridley’s book <em>Genome</em>. Blanco-Melo had bought it as a Father’s Day gift for his dad but ended up reading it himself. Later, with encouragement from his biology teacher, he enrolled in an undergraduate program in genomics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, campus in Cuernavaca.</p>



<p>He had his first encounter with ancient viruses as a Ph.D. student at the Rockefeller University in New York City. His research focused on particular viruses called endogenous retroviruses, remnants of past infectious viruses that have become integrated into a host’s genetic instruction book.</p>



<p>Blanco-Melo first cataloged the genetic remains left behind by an ancient retrovirus called HERV-T that spread among our primate ancestors tens of millions of years ago. Further analysis revealed that a gene responsible for producing the virus’s outer envelope stuck around throughout primate history; even modern humans retain an inactive version. This gene encodes the envelope protein that helps the virus enter and infect a cell by interacting with another protein on the cell surface.</p>



<p>Why would such a viral gene be so well preserved, Blanco-Melo wondered. What kind of evolutionary advantage could it have offered? Based on studies of cells in a lab dish, he hypothesizes that ancient primates <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/22519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must have co-opted the viral gene</a> and used the related protein to get rid of the cell surface protein, essentially blocking the virus’s entry into cells.</p>



<p>This example highlights how a virus’s own genetic material, over the course of evolution, can be used against it. “This project not only satisfied my curiosity, but we were able to push it into a full-blown story of how a virus evolved, emerged, but also how that virus ceased to exist,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>



<p>Perhaps today’s researchers can exploit similar strategies to combat current retroviruses — “the big goal being HIV,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Delineating historical events</h4>



<p>More recently, Blanco-Melo has teamed up with María Ávila-Arcos, an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM and an old friend, to study viral epidemics that largely wiped out Indigenous populations in the Americas.</p>



<p>Blanco-Melo, Ávila-Arcos and a team of researchers extracted and isolated viral DNA from skeletal remains that they dated to somewhere between the 15th and 17th centuries. These remains come from mass graves at a colonial hospital and a chapel in what is now Mexico City. Archaeological and hospital autopsy records suggest that the remains in the graves belonged to Indigenous people and enslaved Africans who were victims of epidemics that occurred during the 1540s and 1570s.</p>





<p>Based on those findings, the team reconstructed the genetic instruction books of two viruses not previously known to be circulating at that time — human parvovirus B19 and a human hepatitis B virus.</p>



<p>The study, published in 2021 in the journal <em>eLife</em>, is perhaps the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first to obtain ancient viral sequences from the Americas</a>, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutch who wasn’t involved in this work.</p>



<p>“Knowing about the ancient viruses that were infecting people hundreds of years ago is of great scientific and historical interest throughout the world, but especially of interest in the Americas,” Bloom says.</p>



<p>The team found that the ancient viruses were similar to contemporary African strains. They “seem to have arrived in Mexico shortly after the European arrival,” Blanco-Melo says, “but they did not come from Europe. They came from Africa, basically through the transatlantic slave trade.”</p>



<p>Through the collaboration, Blanco-Melo has been careful to avoid helicopter research, where outsiders come to a place, get the data and take credit for the resulting work. “These samples should stay in Mexico, should be analyzed by Mexican researchers … and all those results are, of course, going to be communicated back into the communities. That’s our goal,” he says.</p>



<p>Though the two viruses the team identified aren’t likely to have caused massive epidemics, they could have exacerbated some of the symptoms of other diseases. Ongoing projects based on the same samples from Mexico are looking for other viruses and even peptides to get a fuller picture of the viruses from that time — and perhaps pin down big culprits. “There&#8217;s a lot more research that needs to be done in order to capture those other causative agents,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>
