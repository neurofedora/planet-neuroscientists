              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-anemones-vents-metal-poisoning">How sea anemones living on deep-sea hydrothermal vents avoid metal poisoning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Life near deep-sea hydrothermal vents can be pretty metal — literally.</p>



<p>In addition to crushing pressures, total darkness and scorching temperatures, poisonous plumes belch from beneath the Earth’s surface. Exhaust from these underwater chimneys contains particles of heavy metals like iron and manganese, which become toxic at high concentrations. But many animals cozy up next to these vents and form thriving communities, seemingly able to withstand the dangerous metals around them.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have a hint of how one creature survives this hard-core environment. The sea anemone <em>Alvinactis idsseensis</em> has a surprising abundance of genes geared toward producing proteins that move metals into a cellular area where they can’t cause harm, researchers report October 20 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Many organisms have a few of these <em>MTP</em> genes for normal metal metabolism. For instance, a related sea anemone that lives in shallow waters has one <em>MTP</em> gene. In comparison, <em>A. idsseensis</em> has 13 <em>MTP</em> genes, marine biologist Haibin Zhang and colleagues found.</p>



<p>The Edmond and Kairei vent fields in the southwest Indian Ocean are home to this abundant, unassuming sea anemone. <em>A. idsseensis “</em>is the dominant species living in these vent fields, and preys on blind shrimps as food,” says Zhang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering in Sanya. “But how these anemones adapt to the vent’s extreme conditions is not well understood.”</p>



<p>The researchers discovered the anemone’s secrets when they <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh0474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed the genome of one of the tentacled invertebrates</a>, collected from the Edmond vent field by the human-occupied vehicle <em>Shenhaiyongshi</em> in 2019. Genetically engineering two of the sea anemone’s most active <em>MTP </em>genes into yeast protected the yeast from toxic levels of iron and manganese, the most common metals in the vent environment.</p>



<p>The proliferation of <em>MTP</em> genes is a metal detoxification strategy also found in plants. The mustard plant <em>Arabidopsis halleri</em>, for example, thrives in soils rich with zinc and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has more <em>MTP</em> genes than its relatives</a>, which can’t withstand too much metal.</p>



<p>Zhang thinks the new finding is evidence of “convergent evolution” between anemones and plants, where similar environmental pressures lead to the development of the same solution in distantly related organisms.</p>



<p>“I do believe that they actually found a good convergence, or at least a similar strategy to detoxify metals,” says Felipe Klein Ricachenevsky, a plant physiologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>How exactly the anemone <em>MTP</em> genes work to prevent metal poisoning remains to be seen. In plants, MTPs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinese-brake-fern-arsenic-fronds">sequester metals into large cellular compartments, or organelles, called vacuoles</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/19</em>). But animal cells don’t have those kinds of vacuoles. “Which organelle is doing that in those animals?” Ricachenevsky asks. “I think that will be very interesting to address in the future.”</p>

<p>A professor in France who plagiarized extensively in a review article and then blamed the offense on an undisclosed medical writer will lose the publication, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>“We have decided to retract this paper,” Yi-Xiang Wang, editor-in-chief of <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em>, told us by email.</p>



<p>The move comes one day after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/19/exclusive-professor-in-france-blames-alleged-ghostwriter-for-plagiarism/">a Retraction Watch exclusive</a> describing how the professor, <a href="https://archive.fo/Dvmw6">Romaric Loffroy</a> of CHU Dijon Bourgogne, claimed he had not written the offending paper despite being listed as its first and corresponding author. Instead, Loffroy put the blame on an alleged medical writer.</p>



<p>The retraction will be Loffroy’s first. He did not immediately respond to our request for comments.</p>



<span id="more-128081"></span>



<p>Wang said he was looking into whether the paper, <a href="https://qims.amegroups.org/article/view/8064/html">“Current role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer,”</a> had undergone a plagiarism check.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said the article’s speedy acceptance in just 14 days was “not common, but not very rare. Back in 2015, we have many invited papers, I assume that was an invited review, the review was done by editorial board members, this can be done in 7-10 days’ time.”</p>



<p>But he chided Loffroy, who since 2017 has been deputy editor of the journal, for allegedly having others write his papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I personally do not think using medical writer is a good idea at all,” said Wang. “In any case, the 1st author/corresponding author should take full responsibility.”</p>



<p>Whether the case will affect Loffroy’s position at the journal “will be up to the publisher,” Wang said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-planet-destabilization-earth-moon-meteorite">Giant planet ‘destabilization’ may have coincided with the birth of Earth’s moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>A long-ago reshuffling of the giant planets in our solar system may have been instrumental in giving Earth its moon.</p>



<p>For decades, planetary scientists have hypothesized that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were born much closer to the sun and that gravitational interactions among those planets <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-radiation-solar-system-planet-orbit-astronomy">jolted them into their contemporary trajectories</a> (<em>SN: 5/10/22</em>). But the timing of that “giant planet orbital instability” has been tricky to nail down.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of meteorite data suggests that the instability took place between 60 million and 100 million years after the solar system started forming, planetary scientist Alessandro Morbidelli reported October 5 in San Antonio at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society’s Division for Planetary Sciences. That timing also roughly coincides with when Earth’s moon is thought to have formed in the wake of a Mars-sized planet running into our own.</p>





<p>The instability of the giant planets “is related to a complete reshaping of the solar system, the formation of the cometary reservoirs, the sculpting of the asteroid belt,&#8221; says Morbidelli, of the Observatoire de la Côte d&#8217;Azur in Nice, France. &#8220;Understanding when it occurred means fixing a milestone in the history of the solar system.&#8221;</p>



<p>The giant planet migration, first proposed by Morbidelli and colleagues in 2005, is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a widely accepted hypothesis</a> for explaining much about the solar system. In particular, the giant planets travel along slightly elongated orbits that are askew to one another. But observations of other planetary systems and computer simulations of planet formation suggest that giant planets, in general, form on closer-in orbits that are circular and coplanar. Using simulations, Morbidelli and others showed that if the giant planets in our solar system formed like that, they wouldn’t stay that way. Gravitational interactions would eventually knock the planets into the orbits they have today.</p>



<p>At first, the team thought this instability occurred about 600 million years after the birth of the solar system. That timing meant the migration of the giant planets <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could also explain an apparent asteroid bombardment</a> of the terrestrial planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — as evidenced by craters on the moon and lunar rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts. More recent work, however, has cast doubt on the reality of this “lunar cataclysm.”</p>



<p>Now, Morbidelli suspects the orbital instability came a lot earlier. His reasoning starts with a rare type of meteorite called EL enstatite chondrites.</p>



<p>The mix of elements in these meteorites suggests they must be the remnants of a large rocky body, a few hundred kilometers across, born near the terrestrial planets in the dusty disk that once swirled around our sun.</p>



<p>Then, in 2022, Morbidelli and colleagues showed that any of these enstatites that land on Earth today must come <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/09/aa44590-22/aa44590-22.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from a collection of bits and pieces in the asteroid belt</a> between Mars and Jupiter. Those bits all broke off Athor, one of the many asteroids there, after it collided long ago with some other object in the belt. Altogether, that family of material adds up to an asteroid roughly 60 kilometers across — much smaller than the one thought to have birthed the enstatites in the first place. That means Athor must be only one piece of that larger rocky body, left over from a collision that destroyed it much closer to the sun.</p>



<p>&#8220;The question is, which dynamical mechanism can allow the implantation of Athor in the asteroid belt?&#8221; Morbidelli said at the meeting.</p>



<p>He tried computer simulations of several possibilities, but so far, only the giant planet instability seems capable of sending Athor to a stable orbit in the asteroid belt.</p>



<p>This couldn&#8217;t have happened earlier than 60 million years after the birth of the solar system, Morbidelli said. Radioactive elements in the enstatite chondrites indicate their parent body was slowly cooling until then, which means it was still large. It hadn&#8217;t yet collided with one of the many other planetesimals stirred around by the forming terrestrial planets.</p>



<p>On the other hand, simulations suggest the instability can&#8217;t have occurred later than about 100 million years after the solar system began. A study in 2018 concluded that if the giant planets migrated later, a pair of asteroids dubbed Patroclus-Menoetius, trailing Jupiter around the sun while orbiting each other, would have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0564-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been pulled apart</a>.</p>





<p>That 60-million- to 100-million-year window makes the instability a prime suspect in the diversion of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-planet-collision-earth-plate-tectonics">a hypothesized planet that hit Earth</a>, creating the moon (<em>SN: 3/15/23</em>).&nbsp; The timing &#8220;seems right,&#8221; says Matthew Clement, an astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.&nbsp; &#8220;Lots of things were happening in the solar system&#8217;s early history. However, dynamically speaking, we don&#8217;t have a whole lot of reason to believe that things changed much after the moon-forming impact.&#8221;</p>



<p>But he cautions that Morbidelli&#8217;s estimate is based on &#8220;one data point, of the breakup of one asteroid, pieces of which serendipitously happened to get to Earth.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, &#8220;it&#8217;s nice that [the new result] is actually based on some real data, even if it&#8217;s indirectly, rather than just computer models,&#8221; says planetary scientist John Chambers. He has questions, though. &#8220;They suggest this happened when the formation of the terrestrial planets was more or less complete, apart maybe from the giant impact that formed the moon,” says Chambers, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. “But then there&#8217;s a good chance it would have messed up the orbits of the terrestrial planets and possibly led to some of them colliding,” which the current lineup of planets suggests did not happen.</p>



<p>Both Chambers and Matthews have worked on scenarios in which the orbital instability occurred even earlier, just a few million years after the solar system began. That earlier time for the instability would help explain one of the outstanding riddles of the solar system: the relatively small size of Mars compared with Earth and Venus. That’s because the instability would have removed many objects from near the orbit of Mars before it could grow to the size of Earth or larger. The new result from Morbidelli’s team seems to exclude that solution.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m prepared to rely on the evidence,&#8221; Chambers says. But he isn&#8217;t convinced yet because many facets of the solar system&#8217;s present structure must be reconciled with any date for the giant planet instability.</p>



<p>Clement agrees. &#8220;There&#8217;s problems if the instability happened at 500 million years. There&#8217;s still problems that we have to resolve if it happened when they say it happened,” he says. “And there&#8217;s still problems if it happened immediately after the planets formed, in the first few million years. This story is not done being told yet.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-virus-crispr-editing-disease">Most of today’s gene therapies rely on viruses — and that’s a problem</a></h4>

              
                <p>Will Ungerer isn’t a typical fourth-grader.</p>



<p>The 10-year-old from Midlothian, Va., plays tag with his friends and swims in the ocean. “I think his peers would describe him as someone who is kind, sweet and funny, and supersmart,” says his mother, Sheila Ungerer. He won a countywide citizenship award and was named classroom student of the year.</p>



<p>But “he’s not a really fast runner,” his peers might say. “He doesn’t really run.” Will was born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease that causes muscles throughout the body to break down over time. That includes not only skeletal muscles, but also the heart and diaphragm, which controls breathing. Eventually those important muscles stop working properly, leading to death. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene responsible for dystrophin, a protein that acts as a shock absorber to prevent damage as muscles contract. It affects an estimated 4.8 out of 100,000 people worldwide, mainly boys and young men. About 10,000 people in the United States have Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>





<p>Will celebrated his birthday last year at a laser tag park, his mother says, but other kids his age with Duchenne’s “don’t ride the bus. They don’t carry their tray in the lunchroom.”</p>



<p>The difference is that Will received an experimental gene therapy when he was 5 years old. Just before Christmas in 2018, doctors at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, gave Will an infusion of viruses. Those viruses delivered instructions to his muscles for making a short form of the dystrophin protein. Scientists at Sarepta Therapeutics in Cambridge, Mass., the company that makes the gene therapy, developed this version, called microdystrophin, to act as a replacement, hopefully protecting muscles from harm.</p>



<p>Though the therapy did not show statistically meaningful improvements compared with a placebo in one randomized controlled trial and results of an ongoing clinical trial to determine efficacy aren’t yet published, Will and the 83 other boys in Sarepta’s clinical trials now make the microdystrophin protein. Based in part on that evidence, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-gene-therapy-muscular-dystrophy-kids">approved the therapy</a> earlier this year for use in 4- and 5-year-olds, and the <a href="https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-announces-second-quarter-2023-financial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first child to get the therapy after approval</a> was infused on August 2.</p>

He’s also on a swim team.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132433">S. UNGERER</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>For Sheila Ungerer, there’s no question that the gene therapy is working for Will. He now does everyday things he couldn’t before, such as climb stairs easily and brush his teeth and get dressed on his own. He can ride a bike and swims up to 500&nbsp;meters at swim team practice.</p>



<p>A few months after the infusion, Sheila overheard Will talking to his younger brother Adam. “I was just outside the door, and he said, ‘Adam, remember when my legs used to hurt all the time? They don’t hurt anymore,’ ” she recalls. “That was his experience of life with inflamed muscles in his legs that were being damaged constantly. And then for that to subside is just an immeasurable impact on his life.”</p>



<p>The FDA has approved seven other gene therapies for rare genetic diseases, all since 2017. Each puts a healthy copy of a gene into cells to compensate for a missing or mutated one. Some potential treatments for rare diseases that use gene editing, a type of gene therapy that makes targeted changes at the DNA level, may soon win approval too.</p>



<p>Around the world, more than 2,000 gene therapies are in development, according to the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy. That figure includes cells that have been genetically engineered to fight diseases, such as immune cells called CAR-T&nbsp;cells <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">programmed to kill cancer</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lupus-car-t-cell-therapy-remission-autoimmune-disease">keep lupus from attacking the body</a> (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>;<em> SN: 9/15/22</em>). But unlike these therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases — which could treat potentially millions of people, making them financially attractive to drug companies — each gene therapy for a rare disease may help thousands of patients or fewer.</p>



<p>Since gene therapy was first proposed to treat such genetic diseases in the 1970s, it has had thrilling highs — including the first successful gene therapy, in 1990, in a 4-year-old born with severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID — and deeply troubling lows. Clinical trial participants have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-history-high-profile-failures">ended up with cancer and other serious health complications</a> and have even died. The biggest problem appears to be the viruses used to ferry replacement genes where they need to go. Viruses are the obvious choice for delivery: They can carry the replacement gene in their own DNA or RNA and have built-in mechanisms for getting into cells. But viruses can’t always get the genes to the right cells, can slip their cargo into the wrong spot in the DNA and can trigger the immune system to set off deadly inflammation.</p>



<p>Challenges and setbacks, including the death of a teenager named Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, nearly derailed gene therapy. But researchers, companies and patient advocacy groups persevered. Today, researchers are finding new ways to tackle their delivery dilemmas. Some are developing better viruses or nonviral ferries, while others are using new tools to repair or replace damaged genes in place. One technique, tested so far only in mice, relies on technology similar to what has been used in COVID-19 vaccines.</p>





<p>Some researchers say the outlook has never been brighter for gene therapy for a wide variety of inherited diseases. Others are frustrated by the slow progress.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s the current state of gene therapy?</h4>



<p>When scientists discovered the gene that is mutated in cystic fibrosis in 1989, gene therapy was just about to be demonstrated in clinical trials in people. “We were all saying, ‘There’s going to be gene therapy next year,’ ” says Garry Cutting, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University who studies the disease.</p>



<p>But that prediction didn’t pan out. There have been at least <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.1015926/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36&nbsp;gene therapy trials</a> involving more than 600 people with cystic fibrosis, none with lasting success, researchers reported in 2022 in <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em>.</p>



<p>“And what’s the problem? The problem has always been delivery,” Cutting says. “How do you get it in the right place?”</p>



<p>For cystic fibrosis, which affects more than 160,000 people worldwide, the right place is the lungs, where mutations in a gene called <em>CFTR</em> result in the buildup of sticky mucus that makes it hard to breathe. Numerous clinical trials have attempted to slip a healthy copy of the gene into stem cells that replenish the airway lining. But it’s not easy for viruses to get through the sticky mucus, past patrolling immune cells, through layers of unrelated cells and into the stem cells. “It’s a harsh environment. It’s a tough problem,” Cutting says.</p>



<p>Because of similar struggles, many of the first gene therapies to win approval instead harvest a patient’s blood-forming stem cells, grow and genetically modify the cells in the lab and then return the modified cells to the patient, usually in the form of a bone marrow transplant. That is also the approach that CAR-T&nbsp;cell therapies for cancer use.</p>



<p>Editing cells outside the body, or ex vivo, has worked for rare diseases that affect the blood or immune system. Yet it comes with limitations, since scientists haven’t worked out ways to extract stem cells from tissues other than blood and bone marrow and replace them later. It also comes with its own dangers. It typically requires chemo­therapy to kill existing bone marrow so the modified cells can take hold and replicate. And the viruses ferrying the replacement genes into the cells in the lab can still be problematic.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ex vivo versus in vivo therapy</h3>



<p>Many early gene therapies remove stem cells (circles) from a patient’s body, modify them with the help of viruses (hexagons) and then return the modified cells. This ex vivo approach often requires chemotherapy and only works for some diseases. In vivo therapies modify cells in the body, but getting the therapies to the right cells can be a problem.</p>

<p>Early gene therapies used retroviruses, which often insert their DNA cargo near active genes. Some children who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delivering-goods">got gene therapy in 1999 and 2000</a> for inherited diseases that disable the immune system <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-treats-children-rare-diseases">developed leukemia</a> when the inserted gene ramped up activity of nearby cancer-causing genes (<em>SN:&nbsp;1/14/03</em>;<em> SN: 7/11/13</em>).</p>



<p>Most gene therapies today instead rely on viruses engineered to deliver their cargo to safer locations and to cause less of an immune response. But still, the track record is far from spotless.</p>



<p>In September 2022, for example, the gene therapy company bluebird bio, based in Somerville, Mass., received FDA approval for an ex vivo lentivirus-delivered gene therapy for children with a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease known as <a href="https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-receives-fda-accelerated-approval-skysonar-gene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy</a>. About 1 in 4,000 to about 1 in&nbsp;50,000 babies born will have adrenoleukodystrophy, and 35 percent to 40 percent of boys with the disease develop the severe form, which typically leads to death within five to 10 years if treatment doesn’t work. The approval came despite three cases of a type of cancer called myelodysplastic syndrome among clinical trial participants. The company determined that the lentivirus was indeed at fault and the therapy, called Skysona, comes with a warning about the cancer risk and recommendation for yearly cancer screening for 15 years.</p>



<p>Researchers have had successes with gene therapies that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blindness-retinitis-pigmentosa-gene-therapy-vision-optogenetics">work in the body for some forms of blindness</a> (<em>SN: 5/24/21</em>) and with a degenerative nervous system disorder called <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-innovative-gene-therapy-treat-pediatric-patients-spinal-muscular-atrophy-rare-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spinal muscular atrophy</a>. Will Ungerer’s gene therapy also relies on an in vivo approach. In all three cases, the replacement genes are delivered by adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs. These viruses usually drop their cargo in the nucleus where it hangs out separately from the rest of a person’s DNA.</p>



<p>But the payload size of AAVs is limited, they may not infect all cells equally, and they can trigger dangerous and deadly immune responses. Patients who have gotten gene therapies delivered by AAVs have also developed liver damage or failure and microscopic blood clots that can lead to organ damage.</p>



<p>On top of all those risks, once the immune system of a patient receiving in vivo gene therapy makes antibodies and defenses against a delivery virus, redosing becomes difficult or impossible.</p>



<p>On March 22, 2018, Conner Curran of Ridgefield, Conn., then 7&nbsp;years old, became the first person to get an experimental in&nbsp;vivo gene therapy developed by Pfizer for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. “Before gene therapy, he really struggled to go up the stairs,” says Conner’s father, Chris Curran. “Two months after gene therapy, he’s running up the stairs.”</p>



<p>Chris and his wife, Jessica, founders of the nonprofit Kindness Over Muscular Dystrophy, an organization that raises money for muscular dystrophy research, marveled at the improvements in Conner’s strength and agility. That’s just not something that happens for children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Chris says. “It’s a progressive muscle-wasting disease.… You don’t ever get better. You just get worse and worse and worse, and we actually saw him getting better.”</p>



<p>Though the improvement continued for three to four years, Chris and Jessica have observed a slow decline over the last year. “We knew going into this that it wasn’t necessarily a cure,” Chris says. He is hopeful that the gene therapy may still buy Conner and other boys time by strengthening their heart and diaphragm muscles, but Conner may need another dose of gene therapy to keep his skeletal muscles from deteriorating.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, now age 13, Conner has high levels of antibodies against the AAVs that delivered Pfizer’s version of micro­dystrophin to his muscles. He will be one of six children who previously got gene therapy to enter <a href="https://www.mda.org/press-releases/cureduchenne-mda-and-parent-project-muscular-dystrophy-announce-collaborative-project-to-focus-on-re-dosing-gene-therapy-in-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a clinical trial aimed at lowering their antibody levels</a> against the AAVs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Getting healthy cells in</h3>



<p>All gene therapies for rare diseases that are approved today put a healthy copy of a gene into cells, but the therapies differ in how they get the gene in.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">CRISPR gene therapy comes along</h4>



<p>Even when a virus gets its cargo to the right cells — the right zip code — that doesn’t mean it’ll find the right address. Even today’s viruses don’t usually deliver the gene to its normal location in the DNA, says Matthew Porteus, a physician-scientist at Stanford School of Medicine. The delivery locations aren’t completely haphazard, but they’re not entirely predictable either. It’s a bit like ordering a pair of pants for store pickup at Old Navy. The pants will get to <em>an</em> Old Navy, but until they arrive, you won’t know exactly which one.</p>



<p>For some genes, it’s fine to place them elsewhere in the genome or let them hang out outside of chromosomes, Porteus says. Other genes have to be turned on at just the right time or active in precise amounts. That’s hard to do when the genes aren’t in their native habitat. Getting a gene to its normal location was no easy feat when Porteus started working on gene therapy in 1997, he says.</p>



<p>Then CRISPR gene editing came along. CRISPR is something like a molecular, GPS-guided pair of scissors — usually a protein called Cas9 — that seeks out and cuts DNA at precise locations. Since it debuted in 2012, researchers have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins">using the tool to cut, repair or insert genes</a> in exactly the desired place in experiments with human cells grown in lab dishes and with animals (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Some companies have begun using CRISPR-based gene therapies in clinical trials with people. Several are taking blood-forming stem cells from patients, editing the cells in a lab, then giving the cells back to patients in a bone marrow transplant. And again, transplanting edited cells back into a patient first requires chemotherapy to kill existing bone marrow to make way for the engineered cells. But viruses aren’t always necessary to deliver the CRISPR scissors and GPS locator to the cells to be edited.</p>



<p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals, based in Boston, is collaborating with CRISPR Therapeutics, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, to use CRISPR/Cas9 to break the DNA in a way that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-editor-first-human-clinical-trials">turns on fetal hemoglobin</a> in people with either beta-thalassemia or sickle-cell disease (<em>SN: 8/14/19</em>). Both conditions mess with oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in red blood cells. About 60,000 people worldwide are born with symptomatic cases of beta-thalassemia each year, and sickle-cell disease is estimated to affect about 100,000 people in the United States alone, with Black and Hispanic people most likely to get the disease.</p>



<p>Victoria Gray, the first person to get the therapy for sickle-cell disease, in 2019, recounted her experience March 6 in London at the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2023/03/2023-human-genome-editing-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing</a>. When her red blood cells collapsed into sickles and clogged blood vessels because of faulty hemoglobin, Gray faced sudden, unpredictable bouts of intense pain, she said. “The pain I would feel in my body was like being struck by lightning and hit by a freight train all at once.” She was often hospitalized to get blood transfusions and opioid painkillers that didn’t always help. One particularly bad episode struck in October 2010. Gray, a 37-year-old mother of four from Mississippi, said she didn’t leave the hospital until the following January. Even afterward, she couldn’t feed herself or walk on her own.</p>



<p>But on July 2, 2019, Gray got three vials of her own bone marrow cells edited to make fetal hemoglobin. The worst part was the recovery from chemotherapy, she said. “It took about seven to eight months for me to physically feel and mentally accept that I was better,” she told the crowd of scientists, ethicists and other experts. Thanks to her “super cells,” she now has a full-time job, attends her children’s football games and cheerleading events and can enjoy family outings. “The life that I once felt like I was only existing in, I’m now thriving in.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://news.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/positive-results-pivotal-trials-exa-cel-transfusion-dependent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preliminary results of the clinical trials</a>, announced in June, showed that 24 of 27 people with beta-thalassemia who previously required blood transfusions hadn’t needed a transfusion for at least a year after getting the therapy. Of 17 sickle-cell disease patients analyzed, 16 had made it at least a year without a pain crisis. All 17 avoided hospitalization for at least a year.</p>



<p>This approach and <a href="https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-positive-initial-edit-301-safety-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another sickle-cell therapy</a> from Editas Medicine in Cambridge, Mass., break one gene to compensate for another. Porteus, of Stanford, is instead interested in using CRISPR to get a healthy replacement gene in. Such a strategy might work well for diseases where any one of thousands of mutations in a gene can be to blame, Porteus says. For cystic fibrosis, for example, 719 different mutations in the <em>CFTR</em> gene have been shown to cause the disease.</p>



<p>The team is working on techniques to increase the chances that the cuts the CRISPR scissors make will be repaired by inserting a healthy copy of the gene into the breach. This copy-and-paste method, known as homology-directed repair, rarely works, but Porteus and colleagues are making improvements. In one study, cells taken from patients with sickle-cell disease were edited and then transplanted into mice. Up to 20&nbsp;percent of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abf2444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defective genes had been replaced</a>, his team reported in 2021 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>

<p>Other researchers are pursuing what’s called CRISPR base editing to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03609-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alter just the typo that causes a genetic disease</a>. This tool can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-crispr-gene-editors-can-fix-rna-and-dna-one-typo-time">fix single DNA-letter mutations</a>, chemically changing one DNA base, the information-carrying portion of the DNA molecule (<em>SN: 10/25/17</em>).</p>



<p>Cells edited outside the body can be examined before they go back in, to ensure safety. But researchers are also trying to push CRISPR editing into the body. Those strategies, though, come with concerns over misplaced cuts that can cause stray mutations, plus some still may require potentially risky viral delivery.</p>



<p>In October 2022, 27-year-old <a href="https://www.cureraredisease.org/blog-posts/to-our-community-an-update-on-our-crd-tmh-001-clinical-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terry Hogan died</a> after getting an AAV-delivered CRISPR gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in a trial sponsored by the nonprofit organization Cure Rare Diseases. Hogan’s death was the result of an immune reaction to high doses of the AAV9 virus needed to carry the gene therapy to his muscles. That immune reaction set off <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2307798" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cytokine storm that damaged his lungs and led to his death</a>, researchers reported September 28 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Viral delivery isn&#8217;t the only option</h4>



<p>Cutting, the geneticist at Johns Hopkins, has high hopes for nonviral delivery vehicles for in vivo therapies. These molecular FedEx trucks are usually composed of lipids, proteins and chemicals that form bubbles that protect the genetic cargo and transport it to where it needs to go. If you got a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, you’ve already had such nanoparticles — in this case carrying messenger RNA — injected into your body. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is an RNA copy of DNA’s instructions for building a protein.</p>



<p>Researchers have deployed nanoparticles to edit blood-forming stem cells in mice without removing the cells. The nanoparticles were studded with antibodies that targeted them to blood-forming stem cells in the bone marrow, says Hamideh Parhiz, a pharmacologist and biotechnologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The researchers also edited human cells carrying the sickle-cell mutation in the lab. In that case, the mRNA carried instructions for making a CRISPR base editor, which converted the sickle-cell mutation to a base that doesn’t cause sickling. Up to 88 percent of cells were edited, and under conditions that usually cause sickling, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade6967" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the crescent shapes were almost absent</a>, Parhiz and colleagues reported July 28 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“In proof of principle, this paper is basically talking about the medicine of [the] future,” says Stefano Rivella, coauthor of the paper and a molecular biologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He predicts such in vivo editing — because it dispenses with harvesting stem cells and chemotherapy — will be much cheaper than current gene therapies, which can cost millions of dollars. Rivella imagines vials of mRNA-loaded nanoparticles shipped to Africa or other places where there are many people with sickle-cell disease.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What does success look like?</h4>



<p>But that’s not where we are today. Consider, for example, 14-year-old Antonio Vento. He was born with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, which is caused by a mutation in a gene that produces a collagen protein that helps layers of skin stay together. Antonio and others with the condition develop blisters and wounds when even slight friction tears the outer layer of their skin or mucus membranes away from the middle layer. Scarring in the mouth and esophagus can make swallowing difficult.</p>



<p>Extensive scarring also obscured Antonio’s vision. He had two surgeries in 2016 and 2017 on his left eye to remove the scars, but they came back two to three months later. The procedures kept failing, so “we decided not to do any additional surgeries,” ophthalmologist Alfonso Sabater of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami Health System and the Miller School of Medicine said July 24 during a news conference. There appeared to be little hope for saving Antonio’s vision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3-675x450.jpg" alt="Antonio Vento leans in and looks into an ophthalmoscope as a doctor examines his eyes while his mom looks on in the background." class="wp-image-3132429" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100723_gene_inline3.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132429">Antonio Vento has a rare genetic disease that causes blisters and wounds on his skin. Scarring had obscured his vision until a gene therapy he’d been using for his skin was reformulated as eye drops. Vento is shown here getting an eye exam with his mother and ophthalmologist Alfonso Sabater.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132429">UNIV. OF MIAMI MILLER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But in 2020, as part of a clinical trial, Antonio had been using a gene therapy gel developed by Krystal Biotech in Pittsburgh to keep his skin from blistering. The therapy, which is applied to the skin, uses herpes simplex virus to deliver the collagen <em>COL7A1 </em>gene to skin cells. It <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-topical-gene-therapy-treatment-wounds-patients-dystrophic-epidermolysis-bullosa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received FDA approval</a> in May.</p>



<p>Desperate for a solution for his patient, Sabater worked with Krystal Biotech to reformulate the gene therapy as eye drops that might work for Antonio. The eye drops went through two years of testing for safety and efficacy. After that long haul, last year, the FDA granted permission for Antonio to get the eye drops on a compassionate use basis.</p>



<p>He’s the only person in the world getting the drops, which he started using weekly after surgeries to remove existing scarring. “It’s hard to say that this treatment is effective for these type of patients just with one case,” Sabater said. “But so far, the results look promising. And we’re very excited about the future, because definitely this treatment may open new possibilities.”</p>



<p>Antonio has recovered nearly all of his vision in one eye and about 60 percent in the other, and the scars haven’t returned. But since the effects are temporary, it’s likely that he will need regular doses for years.</p>

<p>Antonio’s situation highlights one of the big challenges of gene therapy. For now, it’s a boutique treatment, Porteus says, and that is expensive. The rarity of the diseases makes it hard for drug companies to recoup what they’ve invested, and thus makes them reluctant to invest to begin with.</p>



<p>Having the technology is not enough, notes Maria Grazia Roncarolo, the cofounder, president and head of research and development for Tr1X, a biotech company in La Jolla, Calif.</p>



<p>In the 1980s, Roncarolo helped pioneer a gene therapy for “bubble babies,” children with SCID caused by mutations in the gene encoding adenosine deaminase, also called ADA-SCID. While at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy in Milan, Roncarolo and colleagues <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1070104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported curing two children</a> in 2002. The pharmaceutical giant GSK licensed the therapy, called Strimvelis, and <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-gene-therapy-treatment-children-ultra-rare-immune-disorder-recommended-approval" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got approval</a> from the European Medicines Agency in 2016 to use the treatment for children who don’t have a suitable bone marrow donor. “This was a beautiful story. And when the product was approved in 2016, we celebrated [with] champagne,” Roncarolo says.</p>



<p>Despite this approval though, patients can get the therapy only by going to Italy for compassionate use treatment. “GSK decided to disinvest in rare genetic diseases because they thought that was a market which was not big enough and profitable enough,” Roncarolo says. Orchard Therapeutics, based in London, which inherited the therapy, announced in 2020 that it was reducing its investment in ADA-SCID to focus on less rare diseases. The Telethon Institute now holds rights to the therapy and is trying to commercialize it, she says. “You can imagine the frustration for me and all the people that contributed to bring this product to the market.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the European Medicines Agency <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-gene-therapy-treat-rare-inherited-blood-condition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved an AAV-based gene therapy</a> for beta-thalassemia from bluebird bio in March 2019, but the company pulled the product from the European market in 2021. European health care systems were trying to negotiate lower prices for the therapy than the company thought it was worth.</p>



<p>Showing that a therapy is safe and effective is just one part. “The real challenge for these products,” Roncarolo says, “is to make sure — especially for rare genetic diseases — that they find a home in a company that has the motivation and resources to commercialize them.”</p>



<p>The stories of Antonio Vento, Will Ungerer, Victoria Gray and others show that patients are benefiting from gene therapy today. There are plenty of signs of progress over the last decades. But even if the biggest scientific hurdles fall, there remain many hurdles to fixing broken genes.</p>

<p>A neuroscientist who studies alcohol and stress faked data in two published studies and two grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), according to a U.S. government watchdog.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://psychologyneuroscience.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/lara-s-hwa-phd">Lara S. Hwa</a>, an assistant professor of neuroscience at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, since January 2021, “engaged in research misconduct by knowingly or recklessly falsifying and/or fabricating data, methods, results, and conclusions in animal models of alcohol use disorders,” the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-hwa-lara-s">concluded in its findings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI found Hwa, who has not immediately responded to our request for comment, “falsified and/or fabricated experimental timelines, group conditions, sex of animal subjects, mouse strains, and behavioral response data” in the grant applications and papers. The articles were published when she was a postdoc at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. </p>



<span id="more-128076"></span>



<p>One of the grant applications in which ORI said Hwa submitted fake data, “Long-term Alcohol Drinking Alters Stress Engagement of BNST Circuit Elements,” was funded for $734,145. The other grant application was “administratively withdrawn” last December. Hwa was a principal investigator on another grant, not included in ORI’s findings, that received $84,218 from 2013-2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59709">Alcohol drinking alters stress response to predator odor via BNST kappa opioid receptor signaling in male mice</a>,” one of the papers included in ORI’s findings, appeared in <em>eLife</em> in July 2020. The authors <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/74986">retracted it</a> in November 2021 “based on error [sic] in methods and data reporting, which they identified following publication, that cast doubt on the conclusions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extensive retraction notice stated that five co-authors, not including Hwa, the first author, notified the senior author of an error in the published data. Then, the authors “deeply examined the results and identified several more errors” in the paper, which are detailed in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For several figures, the authors determined the published data “did not match the raw data values,” and after re-analyzing the raw data, “there were multiple changes in statistical significance, leading to an overall change in the interpretation of the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The changes that would be required to correct the paper are sufficiently extensive that its overall conclusions must currently be considered to be in doubt. All of the authors are in agreement that retraction is the appropriate course of action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0279-2">Predator odor increases avoidance and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the prelimbic cortex via corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 signaling</a>,” published in <em>Neuropsychopharmacology</em> in 2018, has not been flagged. As part of the settlement agreement Hwa agreed to, she must request that the paper – which has been cited 24 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – be corrected or retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hwa also agreed to four years of supervision of her research, beginning on August 18 of this year. During the four years of supervision, she also may not serve on any NIH advisory or peer review committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Baylor University has not immediately responded to our request for comment on the findings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/10-billion-snow-crabs-disappeared-alaska">10 billion snow crabs have disappeared off the Alaskan coast. Here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p>From 2018 to 2021, an estimated 10 billion snow crabs disappeared from the eastern Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, with the population plummeting to record lows in 2021. Researchers had only speculated as to what happened to the missing crabs. Now, a study in the Oct. 20 <em>Science </em>finds that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk7565" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a marine heat wave probably spurred a mass die-off</a>, in part by causing crabs to starve.</p>



<p>“It’s a fishery disaster in the truest sense of the word,” says Cody Szuwalski, a fishery biologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle.</p>





<p>On average, snow crabs bring in about $150 million of annual revenue for Alaskan fisheries. In the 2021-2022 crabbing season, that revenue fell to around $24 million. With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">marine heat waves becoming more common</a> because of human-caused climate change, the future of such fisheries and arctic marine ecosystems, more broadly, is uncertain, researchers say (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>)<em>.</em></p>



<p>The new research can help fishery managers anticipate and prepare for similar events such as the crab collapse in the future, Szuwalski says, particularly when it comes to getting proper disaster aid to affected fishers quickly.</p>



<p>Usually, cold, arctic water makes ideal habitat for snow crabs (<em>Chionoecetes opilio</em>) and other crustaceans. As winter’s thick sea ice melts, the frigid meltwater settles on the seafloor, creating a cold-water pool with temperatures below 2˚ Celsius. Crabs thrive in this chilly sanctuary on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. But a marine heat wave in the region in 2018 and 2019 prevented the usual amount of sea ice from forming, and, according to yearly temperature and population survey data, the cold pool never appeared and then the crab population collapsed.</p>



<p>Szuwalski and colleagues used computer models to analyze temperature data combined with population surveys, fishing catch numbers and lab experiments to look for drivers behind the sudden collapse. Two causes stood out: higher water temperatures and an initially dense crab population.</p>



<p>The water temperature probably didn’t kill the crabs directly, as snow crabs in laboratories can survive in waters up to 12° C. Instead, the crabs might have starved to death, Szuwalski says.</p>



<p>Data show the crab population initially boomed in 2018 — reaching historic highs — thanks to ideal ocean conditions for newborn crabs around 2010. But the crabs also occupied a smaller area than normal, though Szuwalski and colleagues are uncertain why. That means more crabs were crammed onto less space on the shelf. Then came the heat wave. Higher water temperatures can rev the cold-blooded crabs&#8217; metabolism; previous research has shown that the calorie requirements of snow crabs in labs almost double as water temperature rises from 0° to 3° C.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the crowded crabs probably needed more food, but because of the smaller foraging area they had even fewer resources to sink their claws into. Compared with similar-sized crabs from the previous year, those surveyed in 2018 had lower body weights, another clue starvation played a role in the missing crabs.</p>



<p>“It’s just yet another example of something we didn’t expect, but now we have to live with,” says Christopher Harley, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who was not involved with the research. In the eastern Bering Sea, it could take at least four years before more crabs of a fishable size start showing up, meaning fishers there will remain in a lurch.</p>



<p>Such effects of marine heat waves are likely to extend beyond snow crabs. Ecosystems in northern latitudes, such as Alaska’s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">are changing more rapidly</a> in response to climate change than anywhere else (<em>SN: 8/11/22)</em>. Scientists can typically use data from the past to help predict and prepare for changes in the future. But the future increasingly holds events that have never happened on record before — like the snow crab population collapse — so they’re harder to prepare for, Harley says.</p>



<p>That’s especially true, he says, because there hasn’t been enough attention on the secondary effects of marine heat waves on cold-blooded creatures, such as higher calorie needs and the risk of starvation.</p>

<p>An article that proposed potential benefits of private equity firms investing in autism service providers has been removed from the journal in which it was published.</p>



<p>The article, “Private equity investment: Friend or foe to applied behavior analysis?” was originally published in the&nbsp;<em>International Electronic Journal of Elementary Education</em>&nbsp;as part of a January 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/issue/view/61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special issue</a>&nbsp;devoted to applied behavior analysis (ABA) for autism.</p>



<p>ABA is the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/controversy-autisms-common-therapy/" target="_blank">most widely used therapy</a>&nbsp;for autism, and companies that provide it have faced a flood of interest from private equity firms in the past decade.</p>



<span id="more-128065"></span>



<p>The sole author of the article, Sara Gershfeld Litvak, “decided to retract the article due to her commitment to scientific integrity and ethical values,” following “a rigorous review process,” according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/issue/view/61/65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">undated retraction notice</a>&nbsp;on page 266 of the special issue. Litvak is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhcoe.org/about-bhcoe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founder and CEO</a>&nbsp;of the Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (BHCOE), a company that offers accreditation for organizations that provide ABA services, and she co-founded the Autism Investor Summit, an annual meeting focused on the business side of autism services. She is also an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calexpartners.com/sara-gershfeld-litvak.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advisory board member</a>&nbsp;for Calex Partners, a firm that provides advice on mergers and acquisitions for autism-related businesses.</p>



<p>The original retraction notice did not mention any specific issues with the article, which is no longer available on the journal’s website. A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/article/view/2141/649" target="_blank">correction notice</a>&nbsp;to the issue’s introduction, published 4 October, says that the editors retracted Litvak’s article “due to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that led to numerous inaccuracies within the reference and the body of the paper.” A close examination of a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spectrumnews-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/19124325/Litvak-Private-Equity-Investment-Friend-or-Foe-highlighted.pdf" target="_blank">PDF copy</a>&nbsp;of the article obtained by&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Retraction Watch</em>&nbsp;revealed that nearly two-thirds of the article’s references appear to not exist.</p>



<p>Litvak did not respond to an email request for comment and is on “personal leave” from BHCOE, according to an autoreply message. The journal’s editor-in-chief deferred questions to the special issue’s editors, who said they “do not have anything additional to add beyond the retraction notice and erratum to the introduction article.”</p>



<p>Of the 36 references in Litvak’s article, the DOI hyperlinks given for 18 of them either link to a different article or return an error message stating that the DOI is “not found,” <em>Spectrum</em> and <em>Retraction Watch</em>’s analysis shows. The article titles provided in 22 of the references do not appear in the cited journals’ table of contents or in Google search results. An additional three references appear to contain errors, such as an incorrect author or year of publication.</p>



<p>The ABA services market — and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/optimism-greets-investors-sudden-interest-autism-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">private-equity investment in service providers</a>&nbsp;— has been expanding over the past decade, amid an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-by-the-numbers-explaining-its-apparent-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparent rise in autism prevalence</a>&nbsp;and changes in U.S. federal and state laws that began compelling insurance companies to cover autism treatment. The field has had its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/low-standards-corrode-quality-popular-autism-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing pains</a>, and investors’ growing involvement has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/private-equity-harms-autism-service-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial</a>: Some private-equity-backed ABA firms have provided substandard services for children or even engaged in fraudulent billing, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/15/private-equity-autism-aba-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>.</p>



<p>In her article, Litvak argued that concerns about the quality of care and ethics should not be “isolated to the ownership or oversight of the organization.” She included many positive points about private-equity involvement in ABA — often citing the nonexistent references. For example, one sentence that cited a source&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Retraction Watch</em>&nbsp;could not locate stated that “Investment capital in ABA-based therapy has resulted in some benefits such as increased innovation, increased access to care, and greater adherence to regulations and guidelines.”</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://cepr.net/report/pocketing-money-meant-for-kids-private-equity-in-autism-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>&nbsp;published in July by the Center for Economic and Policy Research appears to be the only work that has cited Litvak’s paper, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11289751974135314981&amp;as_sdt=5,33&amp;sciodt=0,33&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Scholar</a>. The report’s authors noted that Litvak’s article “conflated” for-profit and private-equity-owned companies, and that much of the evidence it cited was from the 2000s, before private equity became involved in behavioral health. Litvak’s article “does not address private equity ownership, despite its title,” they wrote.</p>

<p>Update, 10/19/23, 1915 UTC:</p>



<p>This article has been updated to include a mention of a correction notice published by the journal on 4 October 2023. We have also updated the response from the special issue’s editors. And the number of references in Litvak’s articles with apparently erroneous DOI hyperlinks is 18, not 17 as originally stated.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Romaric.Loffroy.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="120" height="165" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Romaric.Loffroy.jpg?resize=120%2C165&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128061" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Romaric Loffroy</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A professor of interventional radiology in France pointed the finger at an alleged ghostwriter after he was caught plagiarizing large portions of text in a review article, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>“After careful checking, I noticed that I am not the author of this paper despite my first authorship since it has been written by our previous medical writter [sic],” <a href="https://archive.fo/Dvmw6">Romaric Loffroy</a> of CHU Dijon Bourgogne wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Loffroy also toned down the offense, saying he wouldn’t care if others had plagiarized his work.</p>



<span id="more-128060"></span>



<p>The review, <a href="https://qims.amegroups.org/article/view/8064/html">“Current role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer,”</a> was published in October 2015 in <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em> and has been cited 28 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Nowhere does it mention the involvement of a medical writer.</p>



<p>The paper borrows heavily from two other reviews published in 2015. Its entire introduction was lifted verbatim from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495493/">an article</a> in the <em>Indian Journal of Urology</em>, while its conclusions were copied from <a href="https://doi.org/10.4111/kju.2015.56.5.337">a paper</a> in the <em>Korean Journal of Urology</em>.</p>



<p>Audrey Licandro, research director at CHU Dijon Bourgogne, told Retraction Watch the institution was “currently conducting an internal investigation of this matter and will get back to you as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>After discovering the plagiarism, the authors of the paper in the <em>Korean Journal of Urology</em> contacted Loffroy. They did not hear back. Then a colleague, Henry Woo of the Australian National University, took it upon himself to try as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought that I would see if I would have any more success,” Woo told us. On October 16, he emailed Loffroy and his coauthors, as well as the journal’s editor-in-chief, Yi-Xiang Wang of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>“Significant amounts of text from your paper have in fact been copied word for word from two manuscripts. Whether intentional or not, it constitutes serious academic misconduct,” Woo wrote in his email. He added that he found it “disturbing” the journal had not spotted the plagiarism and recommended Loffroy request a retraction.</p>



<p>In a reply sent that same day, Loffroy downplayed Woo’s concerns. Besides claiming he had not written the article, he pointed out that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The paper you talk about is a review paper published more than 8 years ago and not an original article, not involving any relevant or original data, which is no more excusable but much less harmful in terms of scientific impact, since most journal review articles are just repetitions. You probably know that better than me. Third, the article certainly went through the journal’s plagiarism software which did not identify any significant word duplication at that time and which is not my responsability [sic]. In addition to that, it seems that word duplication here represents roughly less than 8% of the paper, which is largely within the limits of what is acceptable, although I am not an expert on that topic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Last but not least, I am very impressed by the time it takes for certain people to check for plagiarism. I would like to have that much time to check plagiarism of my own articles but my schedule unfortunately doesn’t allow it, and I must admit that I really don’t care. My interest is elsewhere. In conclusion, I consider that it is not my role to initiate any action and let the Editor decide but I remain available to the competent authorities for additional information if needed, in complete transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Loffroy, who did not answer emails or phone calls asking for comment, has been a deputy editor of <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery </em>since 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. The extent of his ties to the journal, if any, prior to that is unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em> is published by AME Publishing Company. It was one of many “potentially predatory” titles on the now-defunct <a href="https://beallslist.net/">Beall’s List</a>, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/05/board-members-decry-their-own-journals-retraction-of-paper-on-predatory-publishers/">many find controversial</a>. Wang, the journal’s editor-in-chief, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>In a reply to Loffroy, Woo pointed out that the offensive review had been accepted “an almost unbelievable 14 days” after submission. He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You cannot absolve your academic misconduct by blaming an undisclosed ghost medical writer. The failure to declare involvement by a ghost writer in itself represents academic misconduct and this could be even worse had you not disclosed this to your co-authors. It would be interesting if your co-authors were to comment on this and whether they would support you or distance themselves from the academic misconduct associated with this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Woo also pointed out:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The failure of the journal software system to detect your plagiarism does not absolve you of having undertaken plagiarism. When complete sections, and which in your case includes the abstract, introduction and conclusions having <strong>entire word for word duplication </strong>from two other manuscripts, the percentage of duplication is irrelevant. … My personal belief is that this article did not go through a plagiarism check and particularly given the track record of AME publications on the former Beall List of predatory journals.</p>



<p>The reason that I think it appropriate to check your other submissions to journals that were on the Beall List is that blatant plagiarism is not usually an isolated event. Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aging-enzyme-restore-muscle-strength">Blocking an aging-related enzyme may restore muscle strength</a></h4>

              
                <p>As people age, their muscles tend to dwindle and weaken, especially with lack of use. With continued muscle loss, daily tasks are harder to perform and the risk of falling increases. One research team is teasing apart what’s behind this muscle loss by focusing on an enzyme associated with aging, which they’ve named a “gerozyme.”</p>



<p>The enzyme is 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, or 15-PGDH. It breaks down a protein called prostaglandin E2. That protein activates the proliferation of muscle stem cells, regenerating damaged muscles.</p>





<p>Stem cell biologist Helen Blau of Stanford University School of Medicine and colleagues previously found that blocking 15-PGDH in old mice restored their withered muscles and improved their strength after a month of treatment. On the flip side, young mice lost muscle and became weaker after their levels of this enzyme were increased for a month.</p>



<p>Blau’s team has now found that 15-PGDH accumulates in the muscles of old mice as the connections that allow communication between muscles and nerves are lost, another consequence of aging. Treating old mice for one month with a drug that inhibits 15-PGDH <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adg1485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restored these connections, called synapses</a>, between muscle fibers and motor nerve cells, and boosted the animals’ strength, the team reports in the Oct. 11 <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. Those synapses are how the brain directs muscles to move.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that blocking the gerozyme 15-PGDH may be a way to help recover strength that has diminished due to nerve injuries, motor nerve cell diseases or aging.</p>

                <p>Calcium imaging with two-photon point scanning is <em>the</em> technique to chronically record from identified neurons in the living brain of animals. The central piece of two-photon point scanning microscopes is a scan engine. This can be a complex optical device like a deformable mirror or an acousto-optical deflector; but more often, it is just a mirror sitting on a rod and scanning forth and back as fast as possible. The fastest such mirrors are so-called resonant mirrors.</p>



<p>Currently, there is only one major provider of resonant scan mirrors for microscopy, and only few months ago, the lead times had risen to &gt;1 year. Resonant mirrors are therefore much more precious than their mere price tag, and it is worth trying to get the best out of existing resonant scanners, instead of replacing them with new scanners at the sight of the slightest problem.</p>

<p>Recently, I have been working with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johanna-A-Nieweler">Johanna Nieweler</a>, a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">Helmchen lab</a>, to piece together her two-photon microscope from the remains of a previous microscope. Among the surprisingly numerous problems that Johanna encountered and fixed during this work was a problem that was ultimately due to the resonant scanner. In this blog post, I will describe how we identified the problem and came up with a &#8211; in my opinion &#8211; very elegant solution. This might be a useful resource for optical engineers who are dealing with similar problems and for microscopists who want to understand more about resonant scanners.</p>



<p><strong>A periodic line jitter for high-zoom scanning</strong></p>



<p>The problem was not immediately apparent. An image of small fluorescent beads acquired with the scanning microscope looked fine when zooming out:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>However, to evaluate the imaging quality, but also for real experiments that resolve subcellular structures, zoomed-in imaging is essential. In our case, we noticed some kind of irregular distortion of the scan pattern, as if the beads were changing their shapes or dancing around:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>To better understand this distortion, we switched off the slow galvo scanners and performed a line scan with the fast resonant scanners only. This configuration clearly revealed a periodic jitter of the scan phase of the resonant scanner.</p>

<p>Such an artefact could be due to many possible sources. First, it could be that the software to acquire and bin the incoming data stream might have a bug. Second, there could be a vibration responsible for sample movement. Third, it could be some line noise coupling into the &#8220;sync signal&#8221; emitted by the resonant scanner. Fourth, the mechanical scanning itself could be governed by this period modulation.</p>



<p><strong>Finding the problem</strong></p>



<p>The resonant scanner under scrutiny was a 4 kHz resonant scanner from Cambridge Technology. First, we measured the periodicity of the signal distortion &#8211; the frequency was around 270 Hz. So it was unlikely to be line noise, which is at 50 Hz or multiples thereof in Europe.</p>



<p>Next, we also did not find any vibrations that might have caused this problem.</p>



<p>We checked and replaced the the power supplies of the resonant scanner, without any improvement.</p>



<p>Finally, we turned our attention to the resonant scanner. The resonant scanner produces a so-called &#8220;sync signal&#8221;, which is a TTL signal that indicates whether the scanner is moving in the clock-wise or counter-clockwise direction. At the turning point of the directional change, the scanner flips the TTL signal and therefore generates the electrical trigger signal for the next line of the imaging frame. This means that an imprecise generation of the TTL signal, or a wobbly oscillation of the mirror itself could generate a jitter of the TTL signal and a modulation of the line signal as we observed.</p>



<p>Indeed, when we looked at the sync signal on the oscilloscope (we triggered on a rising flank and looked at the oscilloscope on the subsequent rising flank of the TTL), we observed a jitter of the signal that would explain the artefact in the image.</p>

<p>Now, this jitter could be due to a physically wobbling scan mirror; or due to an imprecise readout of the turnaround point by the TTL signal generator at the resonant scanner. Is it possible to distinguish between these two options? Yes, it is. If the scanner is scanning properly and only the TTL signal generation is affected, one could in theory simply replace the periodic TTL signal and then observe an artefact-free image.</p>



<p>We therefore replaced the bad TTL signal with an artificial TTL produced by a signal generator, at the exact same frequency as the resonant scanner&#8217;s frequency. Fascinatingly, we observed that this procedure fixed the problem beautifully. One can also notice that the picture drifts away if the signal generator frequency does not exactly match the frequency of the resonant scanner:</p>

</div><figcaption><strong>Video 1.</strong> Linescan of beads, with a signal generator replacing the sync signal of the resonant scanner. While recording the video, we slightly modified the frequency of the signal generator, resulting in a drift of the image to the left or right for even the tiniest mismatch between the scanner&#8217;s frequency and the signal generator&#8217;s frequency. We did not move the sample or the microscope at any time during the recording.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite this limitation, we concluded that the scanner was apparently not wobbling around, and only the generation of the TTL signal was defective.</p>



<p><strong>From a workaround of the problem to a permanent and user-friendly solution</strong></p>



<p>But there is a problem &#8211; we cannot simply use the signal generator with a fixed frequency TTL signal and hope that things will be fixed. First, the resonant scanning frequency of any resonant scanner changes slightly over time as it warms up. Second, the resonant scanning frequency also varies (a few fractions of a percent) when the zoom level of the microscope and therefore also the scan amplitude of the resonant scanner is changed. A mismatch between the scanner&#8217;s frequency and the sync signal would result in the drift that is visible in the video above.</p>



<p>What we therefore needed was a system that uses the jittery TTL sync signal of the resonant scanner and produces an output that is phase-locked to the sync signal, but without the jitter &#8230;</p>



<p>At this point, I vaguely remembered that this can be achieved by a simple analog electric circuit, and after an internet search, I found the Wikipedia article on the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">phase locked loop</a>&#8221; (PLL), which described exactly what we were looking for. A PLL uses an input (in this case, a jittery TTL signal) and creates a synchronized TTL signal that is typically phase-locked and runs at the same frequency but without jitter when the feedback is filtered appropriately. So we only had to implement this circuit, insert this device between the scanner&#8217;s sync signal and the &#8220;line trigger&#8221; input channel of the DAQ board, and our images would look perfectly line-triggered!</p>



<p>The problem here is that neither Johanna nor I had been trained as electrical engineers, so we would have struggled to translate this relatively simple idea into a working device. However, there was a true expert and lover of electrical circuits at the Brain Research Institute in Zürich: Hansjörg Kasper. Working as a support engineer at the institute for several decades, he was not only an expert for basically any practical technical question ranging from laser physics to soldering techniques, but he was also very familiar with analog circuits. While nowadays often replaced by micro-processor-based solutions, analog circuit elements such as PLLs had been standard components of electrical engineering 30-40 years ago and therefore very familiar to Hansjörg. For example, he had used PLLs in a system that he designed more than twenty years ago to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=81566&amp;tag=1">track head and eye movements of small animals</a>.</p>



<p>He was quickly intrigued by our problem and accidentally had such a phase-locked loop circuit at his hand, the &#8220;classic&#8221; &#8211; as he called it &#8211; <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/CD4046B">CD4046</a> PLL element.</p>

<p>By the way, these circuits are quite cheap (&lt;10 Euros). Within one day, Hansjörg soldered the components together to produce the desired behaviour. To this end, he followed the instructions that come with such a circuit element, indicating how to choose resistors and other elements to produce the desired behaviour.</p>



<p>He sent me this circuit diagram of his final circuit, optimized for stabilizing the sync signal of a 4 kHz resonant scanner:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><font size="-1"><strong>Figure 4. </strong>Circuit diagram of a PLL circuit based on a CD4046 element. An inverter (&#8220;U2A 74HC14&#8221;) is included to generate a signal with the same phase shift as the input signal. At the bottom, it is indicated how to re-dimension the capacitor C1 in order to optimize the circuit for a 8 kHz instead of for a 4 kHz resonant scanner. Drawing and annotations were done by Hansjörg Kasper in <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a>.</font></p>



<p>Soldering this circuit requires a bit of practice but could be learned rather quickly by any talented tinkerer. The true challenge, in my opinion, is to start with the <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4046b.pdf?ts=1694374810508&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">CD4046 datasheet</a> (or the datasheet of a similar PLL circuit) and figure out how everything must be connected. It is not much more than 5 pages of the datasheet that are relevant, but I would probably not have understood it easily without Hansjörg&#8217;s explanations. Hopefully the circuit diagram above provided by Hansjörg will make it easy for anybody who will try to replicate our PLL stabilizer!</p>



<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>



<p>The circuit turned out to work beautifully. We hooked it up to the microscope, and within days we had already almost forgotten that it existed &#8211; this is a true hallmark of great engineering: that the problem is solved so perfectly and robustly that you quickly forget about its mere existence. Here is the stabilized line scan, in direct comparison with the line scan without stabilization. The residual slow wiggling of the line is due to 50 Hz line noise (a different problem).</p>

<p>If there is anybody out there struggling with a similar resonant scanner problem, I hope that this blog post will give them the tools to address and solve this problem!</p>



<p>In the end, I was curious whether the same solution could also be helped to generally stabilize resonant scanners. Resonant scanners are known to become &#8220;wobbly&#8221; with age or when scanning with low amplitudes (high zoom-in). I was simultaneously working also on another two-photon resonant scanning setup with an 8 kHz scanner, and I noticed some sort of wobblying and instability for very high zoom settings. Therefore, I used a signal generator to provide a highly stable sync signal to replace the scanner&#8217;s sync signal. Unfortunately, no improvements of the imaging quality could be observed. Apparently, in this case the resonant scanner was indeed wobbling physically, while the 4 kHz scanner was oscillating properly and only the generation of the TTL signal was compromised.</p>



<p>Altogether, this small engineering project with Johanna and Hansjörg was, in my opinion, extremely interesting and valuable. Growing up in the age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduinos</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pis</a>, where every problem can be solved by a bit of code running on a microprocessor, it was impressive to be reminded of the power of analog circuits. Of course, this implementation was only possible because we had an expert for and lover of analog circuits, Hansjörg Kasper, in our institute.</p>



<p>P.S. Hansjörg had been at the heart of the institute for more than 40 years. He retired officially in 2022 but did the work for this PLL project while working part-time at the Brain Research Institute in the Spring of 2023. Unexpectedly and unfortunately, he died in the early Summer of 2023.<br />During his time at the institute, his work had helped many dozens of PhD students and postdocs tremendously, by solving many small and big technical challenges that typical scientists are rarely equipped to address by themselves. Many a small device and machine that was built during his era, from synchronization boxes for behavioural setups to our small PLL circuit, will continue to run in the labs of the Brain Research Institute in the future, many years after him.</p>



<p>P.P.S. Big kudos to Johanna Nieweler, together with whom I worked on this project, to Hansjörg Kasper (R.I.P.), who designed and built the PLL circuit, to Martin Wieckhorst, who helped with the first brainstorming about the PLL circuit, and to Fritjof Helmchen, who supervises both Johanna and me.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/citizen-scientists-2024-solar-eclipse">Here’s how citizen scientists can help during the 2024 solar eclipse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Last Saturday’s “ring of fire” eclipse, which blocked out 98 percent of the sun’s surface, was a rare and spectacular sight for those who got to view it. But the total solar eclipse in 2024 is going to be a particularly special event.</p>



<p>On April 8, when the eclipse will cross the United States, the sun will be nearing its most active phase. Solar maximum, as it’s known when the sun acts up every 11 years, features more sunspots, increased light and radiation, and frequent blasts of charged particles from the sun’s surface in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-solar-storms-earth-havoc-space-weather-forecasts">solar storms</a> that threaten satellites and may even disrupt communications and power grids on Earth (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>).</p>





<p>Being on the brink of a solar maximum also means it’s a great time for an eclipse.</p>



<p>The combination of high solar activity and a total eclipse provides a rare view of the outer edges of the sun at a time when researchers have more scientific instruments to study our star than ever before, says astrophysicist Kelly Korreck of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. That’s leading to a flurry of activity and a host of projects to take advantage of the opportunity to learn about the sun and its effects on our planet and atmosphere.</p>



<p>The benefits extend beyond working scientists. “There&#8217;s a lot of emphasis on citizen science and having folks join NASA in doing [solar] science projects,” Korreck says.</p>



<p>Here are a few of the ways you can contribute to science during the upcoming eclipse.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Help make an improved eclipse megamovie</h4>



<p>Volunteers along the path of totality, where the sun is fully blocked by the moon, will take pictures of the eclipse to be stitched together into a movie covering the event as it moves from Texas to Maine. The 2024 <a href="https://eclipsemegamovie.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eclipse Megamovie</a> will be an improved follow-up to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/citizen-science-solar-eclipse">2017 effort</a> that was the first crowdsourced collection of total eclipse images turned into a movie (<em>SN: 8/2/17</em>).</p>



<p>The primary goal of the 2017 version was to inspire people to get out to see the eclipse, says physicist Laura Peticolas of Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, Calif. This time around, the intent is to “gather data in a more structured way in 2024 to increase our likelihood of having publishable results.”</p>



<p>Volunteers with access to high-quality cameras, on mounts that allow them to precisely follow the sun’s path in the sky, will collect images aligned and sized to optimize the scientific value of the movie.</p>



<p>“We are one of the only [volunteer-based] teams looking at how the [visible plasma jets] move from the bright sun&#8217;s photosphere out to the solar wind, where NASA can watch the features continue into the solar system,” Peticolas says.</p>



<p>To contribute images for the movie, volunteers need <a href="https://eclipsemegamovie.org/team/volunteers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to apply by October 31</a>. The Eclipse Megamovie collaboration will provide the sun-tracking mounts for free to up to 100 volunteers. People who miss the volunteer application deadline or don’t have the right equipment to take pictures can participate in efforts to analyze the data in the months following the eclipse.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Help nail down the shape of the sun</h4>



<p>If all you have is a smartphone camera, you can still contribute to science, provided you can get to the path of totality.</p>





<p>With the <a href="https://sunsketcher.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SunSketcher</a> app, you can help time the appearance of bright spots of light, known as Baily’s beads, that appear when sunlight shines through valleys on the moon just before and after the total eclipse. Data from volunteers who install the app “will allow us to precisely determine the shape of the sun,” says astrophysicist Gordon Emslie of Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green.<strong></strong></p>



<p>The results, Emslie says, will help test theories of gravity by looking at how the shape of the sun affects the orbits of planets. “By including as many phones as possible, spread out over the 2,000-mile-long, 100-mile-wide path of the April 2024 eclipse, we will get views of the solar shape from a very large number of vantage points.”</p>



<p>You can take part without interrupting your other eclipse-watching activities. Just install the app on your phone, prop it up facing the sun and start the app running at least five minutes before totality. The app will handle the rest, and you get to keep copies of the pictures as a souvenir.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Help listen to the effects on wildlife</h4>



<p>Eclipses have a dramatic effect on animals, as first scientifically <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20023118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observed in 1932</a>. Volunteers with the <a href="https://eclipsesoundscapes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eclipse Soundscapes</a> project will expand on earlier studies by using sound data they collect on or near the path of totality.</p>



<p>Instructions for building the equipment you’ll need are on the Eclipse Soundscapes website. You can also apply to get a completed kit. But if you don’t get one of the prebuilt ones and don’t want to put a data recorder together from scratch, or if you won’t be close to the path of totality, you can still participate by observing the impacts of the eclipse on the environment, wherever you happen to be.</p>



<p>After you upload your observations to the Eclipse Soundscapes website, volunteers will analyze them along with all the other submitted observations.</p>



<p>There’s more to it than sound, says MaryKay Severino, who is a science education expert with the ARISA Lab in Medford, Mass. Eclipses “are multisensory events, which makes them more powerful and more accessible,” she says. “Eclipse Soundscapes focuses heavily on the sound in addition to other sense observations to help us begin to understand how solar eclipses affect nature.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More citizen science opportunities</h4>



<p>Some projects rely on teams sharing specialized equipment to observe the eclipse. The <a href="https://debinitiative.org/main/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamic Eclipse Broadcast Initiative</a> will provide cameras and telescope systems, along with training, for 60 teams who will estimate the speed and acceleration of plumes ejected from the solar corona.</p>



<p>Upwards of 35 teams taking part in the <a href="https://eclipse.boulder.swri.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizen Continental-America Telescope Eclipse</a> project will use cameras that can record the corona with polarized light in a quest to understand how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">solar wind emerges</a> from the sun (<em>SN: 6/7/23</em>).</p>



<p>Both projects have limited supplies of equipment, which means limited opportunities for volunteers, so get in touch with them soon if you want to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other projects involve repurposing equipment intended for different uses. Ham radio buffs can join the <a href="https://hamsci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HamSCI</a> community to see how eclipses change the way radio signals propagate through the atmosphere. NASA’s <a href="https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radio JOVE project</a> includes eclipse-monitoring information for amateur astronomers who typically rely on radio telescopes to study the sun, Jupiter and the Milky Way galaxy.</p>



<p>Whether you set up a camera, install an app, join a team or fire up your radio receiver, Korreck says there has never been a better time for citizen scientists to contribute to solar eclipse research. And if you miss the event on April 8, you’ll have to wait a while for another chance, she says. “This is the last one for 20 years that covers any major part of the U.S.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-accelerators-electrons-lasers">Tiny accelerators get electrons up to speed using lasers</a></h4>

              
                <p>One day, powerful particle accelerators might fit in your pocket.</p>



<p>Two teams of physicists have built tiny structures that both accelerate electrons and keep them confined in a manageable beam, instead of spewing them willy-nilly. That’s a first for such mini accelerators, and a crucial step toward making these devices more useful and widespread.</p>



<p>“One of the main problems with particle accelerators … is that they’re too big and they’re too expensive,” says physicist Jared Maxson of Cornell University, who was not involved with the new research. Miniaturizing the devices means scientists could make high-energy electrons on a tabletop, Maxson says. That could open up new possibilities for medicine and science.</p>





<p>Constructed on silicon chips, the accelerators are composed of two rows of pillars about 2 micrometers tall, reminiscent of miniature rows of skyscrapers. When hit with laser light, the pillar structure generates electromagnetic fields that push the subatomic particles faster and faster along an extremely narrow alley between the pillars, less than a micrometer wide.</p>



<p>Electrons in one device <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06602-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained 12.3 kiloelectron volts</a> of energy over a distance of half a millimeter, a 43 percent bump that brought the particles to 40.7 kiloelectron volts, physicist Peter Hommelhoff and colleagues report October 18 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, carefully placed gaps between the pillars help keep the beam of electrons in focus, mimicking the capabilities of larger accelerators. “This is really the first accelerator based on nanophotonics that contains all the features any modern accelerator contains,“ says Hommelhoff, of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany.</p>



<p>Physicist Robert Byer of Stanford University and colleagues reported a similar achievement October 3 at arXiv.org, with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy gains up to 23.7 kiloelectron volts</a>. The two groups are part of a larger collaboration called the Accelerator on a Chip International Program, or ACHIP, which unifies efforts to build these small accelerators.</p>



<p>The world’s most powerful particle accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva, with a ring that’s a whopping 27 kilometers around. Protons in the LHC reach energies of trillions of electron volts. The new tiny accelerators, with mere thousands of electron volts, &nbsp;won’t be creating Higgs bosons anytime soon — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-boson-particle-physics-standard-model-discovery-anniversary">the particle famously found</a> at the LHC in 2012 (<em>SN: 6/29/22</em>). But such devices have their own set of potential applications.</p>



<p>For example, high-energy electrons can treat skin cancer by damaging the DNA within cancer cells, killing them. But generating the energetic electrons currently requires a roomful of bulky machinery. With an accelerator on a chip, electron beam therapy could become more accessible.</p>



<p>And similar treatments could go more than skin-deep. “The dream is to be able to have a fiber that can go in a human body to do a local radiation treatment … because the whole accelerator can fit inside you,” says Pietro Musumeci of UCLA, who is a member of ACHIP but was not involved with the new results.</p>



<p>Another application could involve using the devices to create special states of light that could be useful for quantum computing. Or the accelerators might be useful for materials research, for example, for making images of thin materials with ultrahigh time resolution.</p>



<p>But the accelerators still have a long way to go. Electrons emerge from the devices at a rate that’s many orders of magnitude below conventional accelerators. And while the devices focus the beam in two dimensions (in the direction of the beam and perpendicular to it horizontally), further work is needed to focus the beam vertically.</p>



<p>The devices’ energy gains still need to be scaled up, too. The energy the electrons accumulate over a given acceleration distance is on par with conventional accelerators, tens of millions of electron volts per meter. But scientists want to far surpass those accelerators with billions of electron volts per meter.</p>





<p>Even so, the work demonstrates techniques that once seemed absurd to attempt. At first, when Byer described the idea to colleagues, “they’d all break out in hilarious laughter,” he says. “We don’t get laughter anymore; we now get appreciation.”</p>

<p>In February, <a href="https://publichealth.indiana.edu/research/faculty-directory/profile.html?user=allison">David Allison</a> came across a study with a familiar problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the study purported to show an educational program helped women lose weight, but they had not directly compared the treatment and control groups. Instead, they’d used a statistically invalid method to compare changes within the groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Allison, the dean at Indiana University’s School of Public Health in Bloomington, along with researcher Luis-Enrique Becerra-Garcia and other colleagues, in July submitted a critique of the study to the journal that had published it. Four days later, Nauman Khalid, the journal’s editor in chief, wrote to the study’s lead author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I got excellent feedback from Dr. Becerra-Garcia,” Khalid wrote. “According to their analysis, the statistical tool that you used in your research is wrong and not well-validated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, after a lack of adequate response from the authors, the study will be retracted, according to Khalid. </p>



<span id="more-128057"></span>



<p>Becerra-Garcia called Khalid&#8217;s action “prompt and decisive.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Although the study has not yet been retracted, the response from the journal is a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/26/when-editors-confuse-direct-criticism-with-being-impolite-science-loses/">departure</a> from the back-and-forth between authors and publishers that can stall retractions. Another paper Allison’s group critiqued was <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2023/9829387/">recently retracted</a> – more than three years after they first raised concerns about the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study to be retracted, “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02601060231153947?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">Effects of the application of a food processing-based classification system in obese women: A randomized controlled pilot study</a>,” was published in the journal <em>Nutrition and Health</em> this past February.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers examined the&nbsp; effects of an educational program based on Brazil’s new dietary guidelines, and found the program led to significantly decreased body mass and increased quality of life for the women who followed it compared to women in a control group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02601060231194653">commentary</a> by Allison’s group critiquing the study appeared in the same journal in September.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=david+allison">Allison</a> has been working for years&nbsp; to correct statistical errors in the nutrition literature. He told Retraction Watch that studies that use these kinds of invalid statistical methods “are more likely to mislead readers to think that effectiveness of some intervention has been shown by accepted statistical procedures with known and stated error rates when it has not been. This may lead to the unwitting adoption or investment of time, money, effort, and risk in inert interventions.”</p>



<p>Becerra-Garcia told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Regarding statistical methods, it is pertinent to note that in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design like the one used in Giacomello et al., 2023, to test for the effectiveness of an intervention, it is crucial to directly compare differences between groups in a significance test rather than relying solely on inspecting changes within each group. This entails testing whether the control and the intervention group differ in their respective change in outcomes from before to after treatment. This study only analyzed within-group changes (before vs. after) without statistically comparing between groups, which is a statistical error known as the “Differences in Nominal Significance” (DINS) error.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Becerra-Garcia added that he and his colleagues have detected the same error in other studies, and the mistake can sometimes lead to incorrect conclusions, as it did with this study.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On July 25, well before the critique was published, Khalid emailed Daniel Fernandes Martins, the senior author of the study and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern Santa Catarina in Brazil, informing him of the critique.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Per their commentary, they recommend correcting or retracting your original article,” he wrote.</p>



<p>He also wrote that Martins, who did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch, would have 15 days to take either action, according to the journal’s policy. However, the study remained online for many months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the critique of the study was published in September, Becerra-Garcia asked Khalid about the status of the study, writing that he and his coauthors “believe it is essential to address these issues to maintain the integrity of the scientific literature.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reply, Khalid said the authors of the study had requested the study be withdrawn without comment. To do so would be against the journal’s ethical standards, he said, and instead, the study would soon be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Khalid told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The main reason for retraction includes significant issues in statistical analysis of data and wrong presentation of conclusion. The initial research data was cross-verified by Prof. Allison&#8217;s group, and the re-evaluated data was shared with original authors via published commentary. Moreover, the original authors wanted to withdraw their manuscript, which I didn’t agree.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that “the authors need to be more vigilant in statistical analysis with human subjects since the minute change in conclusion has significant impact on what we see in this research.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Sage, the journal’s publisher, said that they were “actively investigating this [case] in accordance with COPE guidelines.” The retraction guidelines set out by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) state that a study should be retracted if there is “clear evidence that the findings are unreliable,” including “as a result of major error (eg, miscalculation or experimental error).”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debunk-periodic-cicada-myth-guts">Scientists debunked a long-standing cicada myth by analyzing their guts</a></h4>

              
                <p>There are at least three certainties in life: death, taxes and the periodic emergence of millions of cicadas. But one big cicada uncertainty has finally been put to rest — the question of whether the adult insects eat.</p>



<p>Periodical cicadas (<em>Magicicada </em>spp.) live in various broods across the eastern United States. Every 13 or 17 years, depending on the brood, adult cicadas emerge from the ground en masse and embark on a four-to-six-week saga of mating and laying eggs on young trees before dying. When the baby cicadas hatch, they fall to the ground, burrow into the earth and feed on plant roots until they’re ready for the next emergence. But there’s long been a popularly accepted idea that once adults emerge, they don’t eat.</p>





<p>That perception might stem from cicadas’ lack of obvious chewing mouthparts, like those possessed by very hungry caterpillars, says James Hepler, a research entomologist at the U.S. Arid Land Agricultural Research Center, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in Maricopa, Ariz.</p>



<p>The idea has even been perpetuated in some scientific papers, including one published by a USDA scientist in the 1970s, Hepler says. That’s despite the fact that other scientists had reported seeing cicadas sticking their tubular mouthparts into plant stems, possibly to access sap. “We decided to kind of settle it once and for all,” he says.</p>

Hepler <em>et al</em>/<em>Journal of Insect Science </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While working at the USDA’s Appalachian Fruit Research Station in West Virginia, Hepler and colleagues analyzed the gut contents of 75 periodical cicadas collected from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cicada-science-brood-x-2021">Brood X, which emerged in 2021</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/21</em>). Since the cicadas were suspected to feed on plant sap, which is mostly water and wouldn’t leave much of a trace in their innards, the team used a highly sensitive technique capable of picking up and decoding minuscule amounts of DNA.</p>



<p>Far from finding empty stomachs, the researchers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jisesa/iead082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified DNA from 22 kinds of plant</a>, including box elder, ash, oak and even cannabis. Given that “the cicadas are ingesting very minute quantities of DNA,” Hepler says, “we were pleasantly surprised that we were able to find DNA in there at all.” The results appear in the Oct. 18 <em>Journal of Insect Science</em>.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s really nice that they actually looked at the gut content,” says Chris Simon, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs who works on cicadas but wasn’t involved in the study. “We see them feeding,” she says, but this is “verification that they&#8217;re actually ingesting these particular things.”</p>



<p>Hepler is now interested in the timescale of adult feeding. “Do the cicadas move around from plant to plant on a daily basis, on a weekly basis?” he asks. There’s also the question of what effect this mass sap-sucking has on plants. “An individual cicada seems to have a relatively low impact,” Hepler says. But when hundreds of thousands of them descend on greenery almost at once, the plants face “the potential for pretty significant water loss.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/how-does-boredom-impact-our-mental-health">How does boredom impact our mental health?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Boredom is something that we’re all familiar with, regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity. For instance, as the PM declared the first COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020, most of us stopped going to work and school, meaning we now had all the time in the world and nothing to keep us occupied. As a result, the percentage of adults in Great Britain who reported feeling depressed skyrocketed. This shocking news became a common topic of discussion, and made many re-evaluate the impact that boredom has on our mental health.</p>

<h2>1.   What is boredom?</h2>
<p>At first glance, boredom may seem like a simple and easy-to-understand concept - when you have nothing to do, or when an activity is not engaging enough. While that definition isn’t incorrect, it doesn’t tell us a lot about its nature. Instead, we’ll define it as the feeling of wanting stimulation while not having access to it, and it can be both a personality trait (boredom proneness) and a temporary state. </p>

<p>One thing we can all agree on is that boredom makes us feel uncomfortable. A 2014 study claimed that people are likely to pick a painful stimulation over no stimulation at all. In this experiment, subjects were kept in an empty room for 15 minutes, next to a button that if pressed, would inflict a mild electric shock. The aim of this study was to investigate whether imagination and thoughts alone were enough to keep us entertained in the face of boredom. Surprisingly, 18 out of the 42 participants (mostly men) ended up pressing the button, fully aware of its consequences. Although this experiment failed to account for differences in pain tolerance, it does correlate with what we see outside the lab – for example, the fact that some people pick at painful scabs when they’re bored. That brings us to our next question: why do we hate being bored?</p>
<h2>2.   Why do we get bored?</h2>
<p>To answer this question, we must understand why we get bored in the first place. Scientists believe that our ancestors greatly benefitted from the feeling of boredom as it pushed them to try new things in pursuit of novel stimulation, such as seeking the company of others and forming meaningful bonds. Staying in groups meant a higher chance of survival, so it makes sense why our brains, even to this day, are so afraid of being alone. Natural selection favoured those who actively sought human connections as they were more likely to find a mate and survive to pass on their advantageous genes. Activities such as socialising also prompt the creation of connections in the brain; conversely, avoiding these activities could result in neurodegeneration and brain atrophy. Because we don’t like feeling uncomfortable, we are compelled to look for new stimuli and therefore, we’re able to increase our chances of survival and prevent damage to our brains in the long run. We are also rewarded with dopamine, which explains why completing these activities feels so fulfilling and gratifying. So, to put it simply, boredom has to feel uncomfortable, or else we would simply swipe it under the rug and go about our same old routine without a second thought.</p>
<h2>3.   Lack of stimulation and depression</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve discussed the benefits of boredom and how it motivates us to seek stimulation. However, that’s only one side of the argument. What about people who suffer from boredom proneness? And what if you simply ignore it? That brings us back to the COVID-19 example. Although necessary, our daily lives were severely disrupted, and we experienced never-seen-before levels of boredom. That, subsequently, caused our mental health to decline. According to the Office for National Statistics, 1 in 5 adults in Great Britain reported feeling depressed during quarantine, whereas before the pandemic it was around 1 in 10. Of course, that wasn’t single-handedly caused by boredom; financial stress, the loss of loved ones and several other factors also played a key role. Having said that, it would be fallacious to sit here and discredit its contribution to the numbers. Since that dull and monotonous lifestyle was forced upon us, we had no chance to act on or tend to our brain’s needs, and so, the uneasy feeling never went away and our dopamine levels remained low. </p>

<p>Moreover, boredom as a personality trait is closely linked to drug abuse, gambling addiction and depression. Research shows that individuals who are prone to feeling bored have fewer dopamine receptors in the brain, meaning that they need more stimulation to feel satisfied and consequently partake in riskier activities. This has been shown to affect men more than women as was suggested by the electric shock experiment, though, scientists are not entirely sure of the underlying reasons. </p>
<h2>4.   Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Boredom is our brain’s response to lack of stimulation. Its main functions are to instigate the search for novel stimuli and to push us away from activities we don’t enjoy. We can, therefore, conclude that boredom in moderation is a sign of a healthy brain, one that recognises it as a threat and tries to eliminate it. Even though we sometimes have no control over our surroundings, such as how you can’t stop going to school just because you find it boring; take it as a friendly reminder to make the most out of your spare time to ensure that your brain is getting the stimulation it needs. </p>

                <p><em>Since 2015 Charla Lambert, Diversity Equity &amp; Inclusion Officer for CSHL, and Stephen Matheson, Associate Editorial Director at PLOS have collaborated to coach researchers to improve the clarity and effectiveness of their professional writing through their annual <a href="https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=c-write&amp;year=23">Scientific Writing Retreat</a>. We caught up with them just before their 8th annual retreat, taking place this November at the Banbury Conference Center in Long Island.</em></p>



<h2 class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>The Scientific Writing Retreat has been a long term partnership (8 years now!). What changes have you observed in scientific writing norms and best practices in the time you&rsquo;ve been running the retreat? Has your advice to writers changed at all?

<p><strong>Stephen Matheson (SM): </strong>Preprinting has gone from a semi-controversial practice that was resisted by some publishers, to a practice that is still misunderstood and opposed by some subcommunities in science but is overall uncontroversial and broadly embraced. We used to discuss preprints as a separate topic in our session on publishing&mdash;we stopped doing that a couple years ago.</p>



<p>I think our advice to writers is&hellip; well, timeless. Two of our fundamental principles are that good scientific writing is just good writing; and that one must know oneself as a writer before trying to adopt particular practices or habits. Those things haven&rsquo;t changed at all, though I think it will soon get harder to find oneself (as a writer) than it was before Bard and ChatGPT. GPTs will change scientific writing, and all writing, and we&rsquo;ll start addressing that this year using materials developed by Charla in her teaching at CSHL.</p>



<p><strong>Charla Lambert (CL): </strong>I think the rise of generative AI this year will be the biggest change, though its effects on scientific writing norms are TBD and playing out in real time. It will certainly affect people&rsquo;s writing, editing, and creation processes in ways that we don&rsquo;t yet foresee. It has the potential to be really beneficial for people who struggle with writing, people whose primary language isn&rsquo;t English, people who don&rsquo;t have access to or funds for professional editing services or training, etc.&nbsp; But I agree with Stephen that it also has the potential to mask people&rsquo;s individual style in writing and, as a scientific community we&rsquo;d then lose out on a lot of distinct and engaging voices.</p>



<h2 class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>I&rsquo;m curious how bringing together expertise from different organizations and different areas of scientific communications has helped shape the training that you&rsquo;ve created. What are some of the benefits and/or challenges of collaboration? Has your work together impacted how you think about scientific writing and science communications broadly?</em></strong></h2>



<p><strong>SM:</strong> There is no single good/best way to write. That&rsquo;s one principle we emphasize from the beginning, so we are effectively obligated to provide students with diverse writing coaches who come from different areas of science and who have different (sometimes strikingly different) habits and practices in writing. We all enjoy our collaboration very much, which is good because the retreat would be ineffective without that diversity.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> There is no single good/best way to write.  </p></blockquote>



<p>The only challenge created by our collaboration is the fact that our course only happens once a year and is planned by a team that is dispersed among as many as four different institutions in three states. Charla and the CSHL courses team do the vast bulk of the preparation.</p>



<p>How has our collaboration changed how I think about scientific writing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Teaching and coaching in the retreat has led me to more strongly emphasize the (potential) importance of dramatic flair (e.g. &ldquo;twists&rdquo;, pause for effect) and similar tactics that seem at first to be inappropriate in scientific writing. It is all too common for the pursuit of precision and completeness to overshadow and doom the more important pursuit of clarity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. We urge students to reflect on their strengths and especially on their weaknesses (&ldquo;Identify your kryptonite&rdquo;) and then work with both. This is great advice in any part of life and I actively include it in mine.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Charla_Lambert-1-300x300.jpg" alt="Charla Lambert photo" class="wp-image-21663" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Charla_Lambert-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Charla_Lambert-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Charla_Lambert-1.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Charla Lambert, CSHL</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>CL: </strong>Stephen&rsquo;s correct that we place an intentional emphasis on diversity when assembling the slate of coaches in a given year&mdash;diversity in backgrounds, experiences, positions, writing styles, and approaches to coaching writers. One of the amazing things that happens each year is a recognition among the &ldquo;students&rdquo; that there really are core principles they keep hearing from all the different coaches. Everything we suggest tends to stem from the audience for a given piece, the goals in writing to that audience, and clarity in the writing to achieve those goals. We don&rsquo;t prescribe an abstract set of do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts&mdash;there&rsquo;s an explicit recognition that everyone&rsquo;s writing process is different and what works well for one person won&rsquo;t necessarily work for another&mdash;but everyone leaves the retreat with some tools for examining clarity in their own writing.</p>



<p>And yes, the big challenge to collaboratively running this retreat is getting to do it only once a year! There have been many jokes over the years about starting a consulting company, a train-the-trainer model, or even a podcast about writing (I&rsquo;m still not sure who&rsquo;d listen to that, haha). The curriculum and experience are definitely ongoing needs in science. I love running the retreat with Stephen and the great coaches and co-instructors we work with, but we all have limited bandwidth.</p>



<h2 class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>Do you find that trainees benefit from working together as part of the course? Are there benefits or challenges to workshopping with researchers from different disciplines and institutions?</em></strong></h2>



<p><strong>SM: </strong>Small groups are a HUGE part of the retreat and are consistently rated very favorably by students.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>CL: </strong>Absolutely. Peer feedback groups are essential, and we spend time talking about how to give and receive feedback constructively so the time in small groups is effective. We intentionally create the groups so that, as much as possible, people are working on similar things (manuscripts, grants, fellowships, job applications, etc.) and are from very different subdisciplines. There&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers what you do well when writing, and there&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers in different subdisciplines what might be confusing in your writing. The small groups help develop empathy for and a sharp focus on the audience.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Peer feedback groups are essential, and we spend time talking about how to give and receive feedback constructively so the time in small groups is effective.</p></blockquote>



<p>One anecdote I&rsquo;ll share: One year, the work in small groups spun out into a full-class discussion on journal clubs and the climate in science. As coaches, we give both positive and constructive feedback, and we ask the students to give positive feedback in small groups before getting mired in more critical comments of someone else&rsquo;s writing. This often takes a lot of practice because the students are typically used to seeing science function only on critical or &ldquo;negative&rdquo; feedback. At the end of the retreat, one of the students expressed surprise that they benefited from hearing positive feedback instead of just critical comments from their peers. Another student asked why journal clubs don&rsquo;t typically prescribe both positive and constructive feedback&mdash;the class agreed that journal clubs often devolve into negative commentary, sometimes even <em>ad hominem</em> attacks. Finally, a third student who was an early-career faculty member realized they could run their journal clubs differently, and vowed to do so in the future. It was a really satisfying integration of all the different professional hats I wear!</p>

                <p>An eye full of cellular stars is a stunning example of the beauty that exists in nature’s smallest sizes.</p>



<p>A glimpse of the back of a rat’s eye, and the immune cells that keep it healthy, won first place in the 2023 Nikon Small World photomicrography competition. The image, composed of multiple snapshots captured with a confocal microscope, was taken by neuroscientist Hassanain Qambari of the Lions Eye Institute’s Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science in Perth, Australia.</p>

<p>The photo is artificially colored to showcase the eye’s optic nerve — the black spot in the center — and surrounding structures in the retina, a layer of cells within the eye that captures light. A protein that helps blood vessels contract is shown in red and cell nuclei are blue. In yellow are astrocytes, a kind of immune cell that helps control inflammation in the retina. </p>





<p>The image is part of research that aims to uncover how diabetic retinopathy — a disease where high blood sugar damages retinal blood vessels — can alter the function and structure of the retina, Qambari says. When people are diagnosed, the disease is typically already in a late stage and the retina has sustained irreversible damage. Some people can go blind.</p>



<p>By pinpointing any changes that happen early on, researchers may be able to develop a drug to reverse those changes before the disease advances and causes damage.</p>



<p>The inner workings of the rat eye is one of <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86 photos recognized in this year’s competition</a>, the winners of which were announced October 17.

Cell nuclei are magenta.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132400">Vaibhav Deshmukh</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some of these cells are in fix-it mode.</p>



<p>The photo, snapped by molecular physiologist Vaibhav Deshmukh, showcases cells called myoblasts that build muscle. These myoblasts are from mice and can be grown indefinitely in lab dishes. With dyes and antibodies, Deshmukh, then studying heart myoblasts as a graduate student at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, marked different parts of the cells in blue, orange and magenta. </p>



<p>One cell, in the image&#8217;s center, is in metaphase, a stage of the cycle that divides a single cell into two. During metaphase, the nucleus dissolves, and DNA-carrying chromosomes line up in the center of the cell. In the next step of the cycle, the chromosomes will be pulled apart. The image shows “how a dividing cell changes its shape and navigates through a crowded space to complete the cell cycle,” Deshmukh says.</p>



<p>In the body, myoblasts kick into high gear when muscle is damaged. Muscle fibers can’t repair themselves after injuries like sprains and cuts. Instead, myoblasts fuse to the fibers to help muscle regenerate. </p>

<p>Allergy sufferers, beware — this photo may cause phantom itchiness or sneezing.</p>



<p>Educator John-Oliver Dunn of Bendorf, Germany, took more than 600 images to piece together a view of sunflower pollen on an acupuncture needle. Dunn wanted to showcase how small pollen is relative to a needle, first attempting to take photos with an insulin needle. But as acupuncture needles have a finer point, they hold the pollen better, Dunn says.</p>





<p>A sunflower is not actually a single flower. The brown center of just one is filled with hundreds of tiny flowers. The male flowers of this bunch are responsible for the pollen, sprouting long filaments covered in pollen for insects to pick up and take to other plants.</p>

<p>Bright butterflies often steal the spotlight from duller-colored moths. But the scales on this Chinese moon moth (<em>Actias ningpoana</em>) are snatching it back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Photographer Yuan Ji snapped this photo of a dead moth in his studio at the World Expo Museum in Shanghai. Many photographs focus on moon moths’ flashiest features: spots that adorn their wings or long tentacle-like extensions. But Ji zoomed in on a different spot at the top border of the insect’s left wing.</p>



<p>Microscopic butterfly and moth scales give the insects their wing decor, which can sometimes help the organisms blend into their surroundings to hide from predators. For Ji, the scales resemble cars on a road.</p>

<p>Biologists Priscilla Vieto Bonilla and Brandon Antonio Segura Torres spent days shadowing one amphibian egg from zygote to hatch day.</p>



<p>What emerged was this small axolotl (<em>Ambystoma mexicanum</em>), shown at 1 week of age. Axolotls are salamanders native to just two lakes in Mexico, one of which no longer exists and another that has been reduced to mainly canals. The young creature will retain its youthful features throughout its life, a phenomenon called neoteny, Vieto Bonilla says.</p>



<p>It’s unclear why the animals look forever young, but it may be because their native lakes never dried up, at least not before Spanish colonizers started draining lakes near present-day Mexico City to control flooding in the 1600s. Other amphibians that live in areas with transient streams or lakes mature from water-living young into adults capable of thriving on land or in water. But year-round access to lakes may have helped axolotls hold onto larvae-esque features, such as gills, that allow them to stay in water full time.</p>



<p>The pair of photographers, both undergraduates at the Universidad Nacional del Comahue in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, were delighted to watch a new life develop. “While studying the theory in the classroom is one thing,” Vieto Bonilla says, “observing the zygote dividing in real time was an entirely different experience.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenhouse-gas-climate-change-roisin-commane-scientists-to-watch">Róisín Commane sleuths out greenhouse gas leaks to fight climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>New York has a greenhouse gas accounting problem. The state broadly tracks its sources of air pollution, from energy production to transportation to waste management, but the books don’t always match what’s actually in the air. The amount of methane over New York City, for example, is puzzlingly higher than expected.</p>



<p>It’s a mystery that Róisín Commane is trying to solve. Part accountant, part sleuth, the Columbia University atmospheric chemist scours the city from pavement to rooftop looking for unidentified or incorrectly cataloged sources of greenhouse gases — and uses this information to improve our understanding of the city’s anthropogenic emissions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>There are two primary strategies to quantify emissions. Bottom-up models calculate total pollution from individual sources using representative values for each type of emissions. Top-down models describe total pollution moving through an area using measurements taken directly from tower sensors or planes.</p>



<p>The challenge lies in reconciling the two, Commane says. “These models can be tweaked to make sure that they represent the atmosphere as we understand it now.”</p>





<p>It’s important work. Urban areas account for about 70 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, and among cities in the United States, New York City is the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.</p>



<p>A better accounting of greenhouse gas emissions could help New York reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and assess how well its reduction efforts are working, Commane says. “We all have great intentions, but if we can show it’s reducing emissions, that’s a much more tangible thing.”</p>



<p>And the findings in New York City could inform similar efforts elsewhere, especially in places with comparable natural gas infrastructure.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Emissions estimates don’t match reality</h4>



<p>Commane compares atmospheric modeling to solving a complicated puzzle. “I’ve always enjoyed playing with numbers,” she says.</p>



<p>After studying chemistry and mathematical physics at University College Dublin in Ireland, Commane got a Ph.D. in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Leeds in England. There, she learned to build tools that measure atmospheric gases, including laser systems.</p>



<p>Atmospheric scientist Steven Wofsy, who advised Commane while she was a research associate at Harvard University, praises her ability to “think about problems holistically.” She’s very creative, he says, pointing to work she did on Arctic carbon. Many existing models focused solely on the summer growing season, when carbon uptake from photosynthesis is at its peak. But Commane extended her experiment to include the winter months, when the ground layer finally freezes and soil microbes that break down and release organic matter as carbon become dormant.</p>



<p>Commane found that, in warmer years, delays in Arctic freezing could lead to <a href="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~rcommane/publications-/5361full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enough soil emissions to offset summer uptake</a> and turn the tundra into a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.</p>



<p>The work in the Arctic is “slightly depressing” because “things are thawing very quickly up there,” Commane says. “The Arctic is suffering from what we&#8217;re emitting down here.”</p>



<p>Moving to Columbia University in 2018 to start her own lab gave Commane the opportunity to help address emissions at their source. In addition to New York City’s status as the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, it ranks third worldwide.</p>





<p>She started by characterizing the city’s greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. In collaboration with scientists from the City University of New York, Stony Brook University and the University of Rochester, she developed a network of monitors to sample gases around the city and state.</p>



<p>She also noticed how verdant the city was. New York City is home to an estimated 7 million trees, yet vegetation is left out from most of the city’s carbon accounting models, Commane says.</p>



<p>Commane wondered whether the trees might help explain why carbon emissions measured in the atmosphere were slightly lower than what the bottom-up models predicted. Using the latest high-resolution land cover maps to incorporate vegetation into their model, she and Dandan Wei, a postdoc in her lab, found that the city’s trees were absorbing <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aca68f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a surprisingly large amount of carbon dioxide</a> during the afternoon, about 40 percent of the city’s emissions on a summer’s day.</p>



<p>“So the trees do really matter,” Commane says, and models need to account for them. Otherwise, attempts to measure total emissions from human activity in the atmosphere would miss the chunk of carbon that is temporarily taken up by the trees.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Eyes on methane</h4>



<p>As for methane, levels in the air above the city are at least three times as high as those predicted by bottom-up models. But no one knows what causes the excess.</p>



<p>To figure that out, Commane looks for methane relative to other gases, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ethane. When the sensors pick up large plumes of gas, Commane uses a technique called source attribution to determine how the plumes were produced. Wind speed and plume intensity provide information about the direction to and distance from the source.</p>



<p>Then it’s a matter of hopping into a car or going on foot to measure and confirm the exact location of the emissions with portable sensors, Commane says.</p>



<p>So far, her group has attributed a surprisingly large amount of the unaccounted-for methane to chimneys and rooftops. These are likely due to incomplete combustion of natural gas associated with building heating systems. The researchers also detected localized spikes of methane around certain equipment in now-closed landfills, which could be reduced through engineering solutions that prevent leakage. The largest signals came from older wastewater treatment plants, Commane says, but on the bright side, refurbished facilities barely produced any methane at all.</p>



<p>“The ground-truthing that Dr. Commane is doing is really important,” says Ellen Burkhard, a senior adviser at the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the state agency that funds this part of Commane’s research.</p>



<p>“By making these measurements in a sophisticated way, repeatedly, we can characterize the source and [how] that source may change over time,” Burkhard says. “It&#8217;s sort of the old adage: You can&#8217;t manage what you don&#8217;t measure.”</p>



<p>Though Commane continues to work on other projects, she finds the partnership between her lab and the energy research agency particularly rewarding because it’s so solutions-oriented. It keeps her realistic but hopeful in the fight against climate change. “If we didn&#8217;t have a way of trying to help fix things, it would feel a lot more futile,” she says. “Here, I can do something about it. And that makes a big difference, I think.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Alireza Poshtkohi will talk about his PhD research in the talk entitled: &quot;Mathematical Modelling of Plasma Membrane Electrophysiology and Calcium Dynamics in Microglia&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Microglia, a type of glial cell, perform many tasks while interacting with neurons,
astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Despite moderate advances in the characterisation of
microglia in laboratory rodents, very little information is known about the physiology of
microglia in the human brain. This is a challenging task and consequently this research
attempts to advance knowledge of microglia function through mathematical modelling.
Microglia restructure their intracellular actin cytoskeleton to enable motility; this
requires a complex molecular cascade involving a set of ionic channels, membrane-coupled
receptors, and cytosolic components. In this research, we develop a theoretical foundation
for studying P2-mediated calcium and PI3K/Akt signalling in human microglial cells.
Firstly, a detailed mathematical model is built for the dynamics of human P2XRs in
microglia. Subsequently, experimental whole-cell currents are used to derive the
P2X-mediated electrophysiology of human microglia (sodium and calcium dynamics, and
membrane potential). Secondly, microglial-directed motility involves a complex family of
intracellular signalling pathways that are mainly controlled by P2Y-mediated cytosolic
calcium (Ca2+) signalling and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. This work addresses the
development of mathematical models for these two complex aspects of microglial functions
and investigates the interconnecting role of PI3K pathway to Ca2+.
Our predictions reveal new quantitative insights into how P2Rs regulate ionic concentrations
in terms of physiological interactions and transient responses. Simulation results show that
kink-like, intricate Ca2+ responses mediated by P2XRs arise from a complex cooperative
activation of both P2XRs, and ionic extruders and pumps. More importantly, the proposed
model supports our hypothesis that calcium influx via P2YR and P2XR can explain the
experimentally observed twin peaks in the phosphorylated Akt. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first biophysical model that aims to predict complicated Akt and
P2-mediated Ca2+ responses in microglia. The biophysical models provide direction for new
fundamental experimental research.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541601826" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Math Real?</a><br><em>Eugenia Cheng<br>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>Every mathematician has a story that goes something like this. You’re at a party, and someone asks what you do for a living. “I’m a mathematician,” you say. “You must be a genius!” they reply. Or perhaps you end up being an impromptu therapist to someone who needs to vent about traumatic experiences they had in math class decades ago. </p>



<p>Mathematics is treated with both reverence and fear: People often see math as an objective, apolitical tool that can buttress or refute arguments, but they also feel intimidated and anxious when they think they might have to use it.</p>





<p>Mathematician Eugenia Cheng has spent much of her career working to alleviate those anxieties. As scientist in residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, she teaches mathematics to artists, many of whom have never seen themselves as “math people.” She has also written several books, for both adults and children, that seek to cultivate mathematical curiosity and illustrate some of the ways mathematical thinking can enrich our lives. Her latest, <em>Is Math Real?: How Simple Questions Lead Us to Mathematics’ Deepest Truths</em>, demonstrates the ways that seemingly naïve questions can unlock fascinating journeys to understanding math for math’s sake, rather than purely in service of real-world applications.</p>



<p>Math has a reputation for supplying concise, black-or-white answers to questions. Getting straightforward math questions right or wrong is often presented as the litmus test of whether someone has mathematical ability. But that view of math is simplistic, Cheng explains. Rather than a tool for obtaining objective right answers, math is a method for asking questions and exploring the possibilities those questions raise.</p>



<p>Students are naturally curious about numbers and patterns, but math classes often teach them that math facts should be accepted without question. For instance, a student might learn that a prime number is defined as a whole number — a positive number without a fractional or decimal part — that is only divisible by itself and 1. The number 1, however, is not considered a prime number. If a student asks why not, they will likely be told it just isn’t; deal with it.</p>



<p>But in fact, there is a good reason to exclude 1 from the prime numbers. As Cheng describes, the prime numbers are the multiplicative building blocks of the whole numbers; every whole number greater than 1 can be broken down as a product of prime numbers. Because multiplying by 1 doesn’t do anything to a number, 1 isn’t needed to build the other whole numbers, at least when multiplication is considered. (For addition, it’s a whole different story.) Excluding 1 from the primes allows us to break every whole number greater than 1 down into a product of primes in only one way — 12 is the product of two copies of 2 and one copy of 3, for example, and cannot be broken down into any different set of primes. If 1 were a prime number, those products would no longer be unique. You could toss any number of 1s into the mix and still get the same product.</p>



<p>Mathematicians have found the uniqueness of these products useful for exploring properties of numbers, so they came to the consensus not to include 1 in the primes about a century ago. Considering the reasons mathematicians define primes precisely the way they do is more interesting than simply accepting the definition so you can get an A on a math test.</p>



<p>The prime number example is just one of many simple questions that Cheng poses in the book to motivate deep dives into the logical foundations of Western mathematics: Why does 1+1 = 2? Why does −(−1) = 1? Why does 2+4 = 4+2? And, yes, is math real? Cheng’s answers to those questions touch not only on our understanding of mathematics itself, but also on her personal experiences with math education as both student and teacher. </p>



<p>She also examines how mathematical thinking intersects with life within and outside of the classroom, from the subtle imperialism of the commonly used Mercator map projection, which inflates the perceived size of countries that were colonialist powers, to the parallels between open-mindedness to new mathematical ideas and open-mindedness to the experiences of marginalized groups in society.</p>



<p><em>Is Math Real?</em> will help readers understand the questions that drive mathematicians and encourage people to see the value of math in their own lives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strike-against-venus-lightning">Here’s another strike against Venus having copious lightning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Venus has long been depicted as having a hellish atmosphere. Despite that reputation, evidence increasingly suggests that our neighbor’s cloudy shroud isn’t riddled with lightning.</p>



<p>Last month, planetary scientists proposed that most if not all of the bright flashes observed in Venus’ atmosphere <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-atmosphere-meteor-lightning-space">could be explained by meteors</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/23</em>). Now, a separate team suggests that whistling electromagnetic waves often created by lightning on Earth and other planets are not sparked by lightning on Venus.</p>





<p>In 2021, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">Parker Solar Probe</a> swung past the nighttime side of Venus on its way toward the sun (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>). As it did, its instruments picked up radio waves that scientists have dubbed whistler waves. Such disturbances got their name because their frequency quickly changes from high to low before they disappear, says Harriet George, a space physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>Oddly, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL105426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venus’ whistler waves were traveling downward toward the planet</a>, not up and away from it, as they would have been if they’d been caused by lightning, George and her team report in the Oct. 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>An alternate source of energy for these whistler waves could be disturbances in Venus’ weak magnetic fields, the researchers suggest. As magnetic field lines shift and reconnect, they can release prodigious amounts of energy, George says. In other milieus, magnetic reconnections <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">accelerate the solar wind</a>, help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">heat the sun’s outer atmosphere</a> and help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watching-northern-lights-form">trigger Earth’s auroras</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/23; SN: 11/14/19; SN: 7/24/08</em>). They’ve got the right characteristics to create whistler waves on Venus too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/10/15/two-random-but-interesting-papers-on-neurophysiology-with-behavior/">Two random but interesting papers on neurophysiology with behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.14.520391">Bagur, Bourg et al. (2022)</a> from the Bathellier Lab in Paris make the interesting finding that the auditory code is represented as temporal sequences of neuronal activity in early auditory processing stages and as spatial patterns in auditory cortex. I am not an expert for auditory cortex, but I found this paper quite compelling and interesting, both in terms of methodological approaches and in terms of concepts.<br />Sophie Bagur has already published a few very interesting papers that are both excellent and creative and definitely worth a read. For example, in a study published with her as senior author <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100355">Verdier et al. (2022)</a> on an entirely different topic, they showed that optogenetic stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle could be used to improve behavioral training of mice and replace water restriction protocols very effectively.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.07.536077">Lai, Tanaka et al. (2023)</a> from Albert Lee’s lab wrote a very cool paper where they made rats navigate mentally. In short, they used the spiking output of the hippocampus, which they extracted online, to control a virtual reality that (1) represented themselves in a spatial context (&#8220;mental navigation&#8221;), or that (2) represented another object in a spatial context (&#8220;telekinesis&#8221;). Using this approach, the authors tried to show that hippocampus represents mental navigation of the self but also mental navigation of objects in the external world.<br />A minor issue I had with the paper was that the authors write very prominently that they constructed a low-latency (&#8220;real-time&#8221;) closed-loop system, feeding back neuronal activity into the virtual environment. However, this ultra-fast feedback is first going through a decoder that uses a 5-s running window, basically eliminating the speed of the feedback loop. This secret is hidden somewhere in the Methods section.<br />In addition, I had the feeling that the claim of “mental navigation” would require slightly stronger evidence that the animal did not really move physically while performing “mental navigation”. The existing analyses could have been deepened a bit. However, in general I really liked the paper, both for its ideas and for its technical implementation of the brain-machine interface for rats. Definitely worth a read!<br />Let&#8217;s try to dig a bit into the conceptual space around this study. The manuscript made me wonder how different it is whether we mentally move objects (like tetris objects, &#8220;telekinesis&#8221;) or avatars (like in a 1<sup>st</sup> person video game, &#8220;mental navigation&#8221;). Do both situations feel the same for us? We do certainly identify with avatars viewed from a 3<sup>rd</sup> person perspective (as in many video games). The transition from 3rd person avatars (&#8220;mental navigation&#8221;) to movable objects (&#8220;telekinesis&#8221;) seems pretty smooth from my perspective. A pixelized avatar from super mario feels almost like an object, and we treat pacman for sure like an avater, even though it is barely more than an object. There does not seem to be a sharp transition between an eating blob like pacman or snake to something less animated like a tetris element. It seems like introspection might be a good way to better understand how we as humans differentially treat virtual avatars or virtual objects in our mind.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-stem-cells-breast-cancer-spine">Newly identified stem cells can lure breast cancer to the spine</a></h4>

              
                <p>When breast cancer spreads, it often targets the spine. Now scientists may have finally discovered why.</p>



<p>A newfound kind of stem cell <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06519-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drives cancer cells to bones in the vertebrae</a>, pathologist Matthew Greenblatt of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and his colleagues report September 13 in <em>Nature. </em>The find helps explain a long-standing mystery of metastasis: why some cancers break away from their site of origin, journey through the bloodstream and take up residence in the backbone.</p>





<p>“This is a major advance in our understanding of bone metastasis,” says Xiang Zhang, a cancer biologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>In people with metastatic breast cancer, some 70 percent experience subsequent bone cancer. And of the bones in the skeleton, cancer cells preferentially seek out vertebrae. For these patients, “spine metastases are one of the most common complications,” Greenblatt says, “and one of the most dreaded.” Tumors that take root in the spine can crush the spinal cord, which houses nerve bundles crucial for body sensation and movement. Such damage can hamper people’s ability to walk and control their bladder and bowels, and shorten their life spans.</p>



<p>Doctors have known for decades that some cancers preferentially seek out the spine, Greenblatt says, but no one has had a good explanation for why. One idea proposed in 1940, that actions like coughing jolt blood off course and somehow send cancerous cells to the vertebrae, still hangs on today. It’s what Greenblatt learned when he was a medical student. But for him and his team, “that didn&#8217;t make sense to us scientifically.”</p>



<p>What did end up making sense was stem cells. The researchers had a hunch that stem cells inside vertebral bones differed from those in other sites in the skeleton, like the long bones in the arms and legs. In the lab, that’s just what they found. Greenblatt’s team pulled out a population of stem cells from mice vertebrae distinctly unlike ones collected from long bones. These new stem cells switched on a separate set of genes and behaved differently in experiments, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Until now, scientists didn’t know that these two types of bones held distinct populations of stem cells. “We assumed they were the same,” says Geert Carmeliet, a cell and molecular endocrinologist at KU Leuven in Belgium who was not involved with the work, but wrote an accompanying <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02768-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentary</a>. The team’s discovery raised the possibility that spinal stem cells might play a role in spinal disease.</p>

Sun <em>et al</em>./<em>Nature</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In one key experiment, Greenblatt’s team transplanted spinal stem cells into one hind leg of mice and long bone stem cells into the other. Each transplant formed miniature bones, or organoids, in the animals’ bodies — a tiny vertebra on the right, for example, and a bit of long bone on the left. Then, the researchers injected breast cancer cells into the mice and watched where they ended up.</p>



<p>The cells traveled to the mini vertebra nearly twice as often as they did to the little long bone, as if lured by a cancer-calling Pied Piper. It’s an elegant way to show that “tumor cells preferentially come to the [vertebra] organoid and not to the organoid of the long bone,” Carmeliet says.</p>



<p>The newly identified spinal stem cells, found in both mice and humans, secrete a protein called MFGE8 that acts as a tumor attractant, the team discovered, drawing cancer cells to spinal tissue. The protein may not be only factor involved, Greenblatt says, “but it&#8217;s an important one in driving tumor cells to the spine.”</p>



<p>It’s possible that blocking MFGE8 could prevent or treat spine metastasis. “I think it&#8217;s definitely worth further investigation,” Zhang says. But, he notes, it’s still too early to know what the therapeutic implications may be.</p>





<p>Greenblatt’s team is now exploring whether the new stem cells can recruit other types of tumor cells to the spine. When prostate cancer spreads, for example, it also tends to travel to vertebrae over other types of bone. He and his colleagues are also curious whether our bones may be hiding anything else. “We&#8217;re starting to think about what other stem cells may be left to discover in the skeleton.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-jet-nova-blast-m87-galaxy">The black hole–powered jet in galaxy M87 is making stars explode</a></h4>

              
                <p>High-speed gas shooting from the galaxy M87 is causing stars to go nova, a study suggests, and no one knows how.</p>



<p>A nova occurs after a dense star known as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down">white dwarf receives gas from an orbiting star</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). As the white dwarf’s intense gravity squeezes the gas, it heats up and explodes, but both stars survive the violence. In fact, over millions of years, the same star goes nova again and again. Recent observations indicate that these eruptions forged much, and perhaps most, of the universe’s supply of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">the valuable metal lithium</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/19</em>).</p>





<p>Nova explosions erupt in our galaxy as well as others, including the giant elliptical M87, whose jet of fast-moving gas is powered by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">black hole</a> at the galaxy’s center (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Now Hubble Space Telescope data show that there’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an excess of these explosions along M87’s jet</a>, researchers report in a study submitted September 28 to arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Alec Lessing, an undergraduate student at Stanford University, Michael Shara, an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and their colleagues used the telescope to locate 135 nova outbursts in M87, whose jet is many thousands of light-years long. The galaxy itself is 54 million light-years from Earth, at the heart of the nearest galaxy cluster, named Virgo.</p>

<p>After identifying the nova explosions, the team plotted their positions in the galaxy. “It was striking to the eye,” Shara says of the plot. “The novae appeared to be preferentially aligned with the jet.”</p>



<p>By dividing the galaxy into 10 equal sectors, the astronomers found that 25 blasts occurred along the jet — versus only 10 to 16 in each of the galaxy’s other sectors. The chance that this is just a statistical fluke is only about 0.3 percent, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“I was really surprised,” says Massimo Della Valle, an astronomer at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics in Naples, who was not involved with the new study. “If these objects are novae, the jet has to be responsible for this somehow.”</p>



<p>Perhaps, he says, the jet pushes interstellar gas onto white dwarf stars in nova systems, increasing the amount of material that accumulates on the stars’ surfaces. As a result, the white dwarfs explode more frequently than they otherwise would, accounting for the surplus of nova outbursts along the jet.</p>



<p>The jet itself, Shara says, doesn’t seem to supply enough gas or radiation to explain the explosions. “The jet is to blame, but we just don’t know why or how,” he says. “It is somehow causing the novae to be more prevalent in that sector, but whether it’s because it’s triggering the novae somehow or birthing the novae — making more of them there — or some other process … we don’t know.”</p>



<p>For additional clues, Shara hopes to use Hubble to examine other galaxies that resemble M87, to see whether their jets are also accompanied by such eruptions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-genetically-modified-silkworms-spider-silk">In a first, genetically modified silkworms produced pure spider silk</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spider silk is prized for its unrivaled strength and toughness. But figuring out a way to mass-produce it is no easy feat. Spiders cannot be put to work to pump out the fibers the way silkworms can: They’re extremely territorial and inclined to eat their neighbors, and they refuse to keep at the task for long. So for decades, scientists have tried to genetically-engineer various organisms — including bacteria, yeast, mice, hamsters and even goats — to produce spider silk, but with only partial success.</p>



<p>Now, for the first time, researchers from China have coaxed <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(23)00421-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pure spider silk out of genetically modified silkworms</a>. The material is six times as tough as the Kevlar used in bulletproof vests, the team reports in the Oct. 4 <em>Matter</em>.</p>





<p>The fibers flaunt “better mechanical properties than anybody else has been able to show,” says molecular biologist Randy Lewis, a spider silk expert at Utah State University in Logan who wasn’t involved with the study.</p>



<p>The strands are not as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silk">strong or as stretchy as natural spider silk</a>, but they are an advance (<em>SN: 11/7/08</em>). Previous work in silkworms generated weaker fiber blends of only 30 to 50 percent spider silk.</p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to insert the complete instructions for making spider silk protein into silkworms and make sure the protein wound up in the silkworms’ silk-making glands. That allowed the team to take advantage of the insect’s natural machinery. Breeding the tweaked silkworms then resulted in some that inherited the spider silk gene from both parents, meaning they could produce purer spider silk.</p>



<p>If the silk someday makes it out of the laboratory, doctors could use it to sew extra-sturdy sutures. Police officers could don stronger armored vests. And a more environmentally friendly fiber could replace common synthetics like nylon and polyester.</p>



<p>“Spider silk stands as a strategic resource in urgent need of exploration,” Junpeng Mi, a synthetic biologist from Donghua University in Shanghai, said in a news release. Mi estimates that the surgical applications of spider silk alone could aid millions worldwide.</p>



<p>Yet mass production of spider silk faces hurdles. Mi and colleagues will first need to confirm that the genetic changes they induced in the silkworms will last several generations. If not, manufacturers may need to regularly jump-start the engineering process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="368" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/092923_si_spider-silk_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of silk worm spun spider silk wrapped around four black tubes." class="wp-image-3132126" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/092923_si_spider-silk_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/092923_si_spider-silk_inline-330x179.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132126">Genetically modified silkworms produced the spider silk wound around these black tubes.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132126">J. Mi</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers would also confront the same challenges of traditional silkworm farmers, including ensuring the insects’ health. Biologist Justin Jones, another spider silk researcher at Utah State University, notes that silkworms are notoriously vulnerable to infection.</p>



<p>Even when the silkworms are healthy, these factory workers can create disparate silk fibers. “In the silk world, as we’ve discovered, the real problem is that there are hundreds and hundreds of strains of silkworms out there that farms use, and … they don’t give you the same mechanical properties,” Lewis says.</p>



<p>Still, silkworms make one of the most attractive candidates for this type of genetic engineering. Most of the other modified creatures eke out only small amounts of usable fiber, in part because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-can-be-coaxed-making-toughest-kind-spider-silk">their enzymes chop up the DNA responsible for spider silk protein</a> (<em>SN: 4/2/19)</em>.</p>





<p>And pumping out protein is just one part of the process; spiders then dissolve the protein in a liquid called dope, and transform the resulting goop into a sturdy fiber. Although silkworms can be tricky to work with, the worms sidestep both challenges: Their bodies are already accustomed to producing silk.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Mi’s team hopes to develop even stronger and stretchier fibers. By incorporating artificial amino acids into the spider silk protein, Mi imagines the researchers could potentially push past even the upper limits of the natural fiber.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-brain-cells-new-census">What a look at more than 3,000 kinds of cells in the human brain tells us</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new look at the human brain is beginning to reveal the inner lives of its cellular residents.</p>



<p>The human brain holds a dizzying collection of diverse cells, and no two brains are the same, cellularly speaking. Those are the prevailing conclusions of an onslaught of 21 papers published online October 12 in <em>Science</em>, <em>Science Advances</em> and <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The results just start to scratch the surface of understanding the mysteries of the brain. Still,&nbsp;they provide the most intimate look yet at the cells that build the brain, and offer clues about how the brain enables thoughts, actions and memories. The collection of data may also guide researchers in their hunt for the causes of brain disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and depression.</p>





<p>The new brain map is a result of a coordinated international research effort called the National Institutes of Health’s Brain Initiative Cell Census Network, or BICCN, which ramped up in 2017. Many of the studies in the collection are based on a powerful technology called single-cell genomics. The method reveals which genes are active inside of a single cell, information that provides clues about the cell’s identity and job.</p>



<p>As part of the BICCN, researchers examined all sorts of brains. One project detailed the cells in small pieces of live brain tissue taken from 75 people undergoing surgery for tumors or epilepsy, an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experiment-live-human-brain-helps-scientists-map-nerve-cells">approach that’s been used on smaller scales</a> before (<em>SN: 8/7/19</em>). Another looked at samples taken from the brains of 17 deceased children. Still another looked at brain tissue from seven people, seven chimpanzees, four gorillas, three rhesus macaques and three marmosets.</p>



<p>The resolution provided by single-cell genomics revealed details about human brain cells in a way that previous methods couldn’t. “It’s remarkable how well it works,” says Ed Lein, a neuroscientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle and one of the lead researchers in the BICCN group. Collectively, the new studies describe over 3,000 cell types that reside in the human brain.</p>



<p>The main takeaway, Lein says, is that “the brain is really complex, from a cellular perspective.”</p>



<p>Amid that complexity, several key insights have already emerged, including hints about how human brains develop, how they vary among people, and how they differ from the brains of close primate relatives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Growing brains</h4>



<p>Some of the studies focused on very young brains. A study of the first two trimesters of brain growth, for instance, turned up previously <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf9941" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unknown details</a> about the identities of nerve cells in the thalamus, a kind of waystation for information coming into the brain. Many of those cells, called GABAergic neurons, are born elsewhere in the developing brain and migrate into the thalamus.</p>



<p>Other results show that the early years matter, a lot. Seth Ament, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, and his colleagues <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ade1283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked at brain cells in the cerebellum</a>, a brain region at the back bottom of the brain. In children who died with inflammation in their brains, certain kinds of nerve cells there — Purkinje and Golgi neurons — had altered levels of active genes. The pattern, which held across eight brains, suggest that inflammation early in life could alter nerve cell development in certain spots.</p>



<p>“I’m amazed we saw something so consistent across the samples,” Ament says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Unique brains</h4>





<p>Some of the studies focused on variability between brain regions and between people.</p>



<p>One study looked at cells from about 100 spots taken from four adult brains. The researchers found, among many other things, that cells called astrocytes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add7046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used their genes differently </a>depending on where they reside. The finding hints that these cells, which are known to help nerve cells form connections and keep brain tissue healthy, may be specialized for their region.</p>



<p>Another study examined <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf6812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight regions</a> of the neocortex, the wrinkly outer area responsible for sophisticated thinking. &nbsp;Cells in those regions are somewhat standardized, sorting consistently into 24 categories, the scientists found. But the regions do have differences in the proportions of the cells. &nbsp;What that means for how these regions work is anybody’s guess.</p>



<p>Similarities also exist between people. Researchers found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf2359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly consistent patterns</a> of cells when they compared brain cells from 75 people. But there was plenty of wiggle room, too. Microglia, immune cells in the brain that also sculpt nerve cell connections, were especially unique in the genes they use from person to person, for instance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Primate brains</h4>



<p>Some of the research compares human brains with primate relatives, including chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques and marmosets. By looking at cells in other primates’ brains, Lein says, “we finally get to ask the question about what makes humans unique.&#8221;</p>



<p>Overall, cells in the middle temporal gyrus, a part of the brain’s cortex, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t differ a lot between the primate brains</a>. “It’s really remarkable that this complex cellular makeup is so conserved,&#8221; Lein says. &#8220;But you also have these changes.”</p>



<p>Compared with other primates, human brain cells use certain genes differently — in particular, genes related to how the cells form connections and communicate, researchers found. The analysis also turned up a few hundred genes that appear to behave in human-specific ways in brain cells. The researchers don’t yet know what those genes might be doing.</p>



<p>Imaging neuroanatomist Matthew Glasser cautions that it can be hard to tell exactly which brain areas are comparable among primates. Still, the results are “the first step in something really cool,” says Glasser, of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who was not involved in these studies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Even better brain maps are coming</h4>



<p>Overall, the progress represented by these and related results “is truly mind-blowing,” says cortical cartographer David Van Essen, who didn’t work on the new studies. “The community will certainly benefit from what’s coming out in this collection of papers.”</p>



<p>But, more importantly, it’s just a glimpse of what’s to come. “It’s not an end point in my view,&#8221; says Van Essen, also at Washington University. “It’s more a midpoint.”</p>



<p>Ament agrees. “These papers, as important as I think they are, are not the end,” he says. “It’s more the starting of it, and now we have a lot more work to do.”</p>



<p>The new brain maps will probably be revised, refined and added to, Lein says. Scientists are already working on the next iterations, which seek to combine zoomed-out views of brain networks and brain behavior with the ultrafine details provided by single-cell technology.</p>



<p>“Now that we have these techniques,” Glasser says, “we’re trying to combine them with brain imaging and systems neuroscience to actually try and figure out the puzzle.”</p>
