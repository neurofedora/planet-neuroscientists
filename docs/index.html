              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-lightning-rod-electricity">A powerful laser can redirect lightning strikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like a high-tech hammer of Thor, a powerful laser can grab hold of a lightning bolt and reroute its path through the sky.</p>



<p>In a mountaintop experiment, such a laser <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01139-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bent lightning toward a lightning rod</a>, researchers report online January 16 in <em>Nature Photonics</em>. Scientists have used lasers to wrangle electricity in the lab before, but this is the first demonstration that the technique works in real-world storms and could someday lead to better protection against lightning.</p>





<p>Today’s most common anti-lightning tech is the classic lightning rod, a meters-long metal pole rooted to the ground. The metal’s conductivity lures in lightning that might otherwise strike nearby buildings or people, feeding that electricity safely into the earth. But the area shielded by a lightning rod is limited by the rod’s height.</p>



<p>“If you want to protect some large infrastructure, like an airport or a launching pad for rockets or a wind farm … then you would need, for good protection, a lightning rod of kilometer size, or hundreds of meters,” says Aurélien Houard, a physicist at Institut Polytechnique de Paris in Palaiseau, France. Such a tall metal pole would be impractical. But a laser could reach that far, intercepting distant lightning bolts and ushering them down to ground-based metal rods.</p>



<p>Houard and his colleagues tested this idea atop the Säntis mountain in northeastern Switzerland. They set up a high-power laser near a telecommunications tower tipped with a lightning rod that is struck by lightning around 100 times every year. The laser was beamed at the sky for about six hours total during thunderstorms from July to September 2021.</p>

The lightning followed the route of the laser light for some 50 meters.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121065">A. Houard <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Photonics</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The laser blasted short, intense bursts of infrared light at the clouds about 1,000 times per second. This train of light pulses ripped electrons off air molecules and knocked some air molecules out of its way, carving out a channel of low-density, charged plasma. Sort of like clearing a path through the woods and laying down pavement, this combination of effects made it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superfast-laser-pulses-could-pave-way-beam-weapons">easier for electric current to flow</a> along this route (<em>SN: 3/5/14</em>). That created a path of least resistance for lightning to follow through the sky.</p>



<p>Houard’s team tuned their laser so that it formed this electrically conductive pathway just above the tip of the tower. This allowed the tower’s lightning rod to intercept a bolt snagged by the laser before it zipped all the way down to the laser equipment.</p>



<p>The tower was hit by lightning four times while the laser was on. One of those strikes happened in a fairly clear sky, allowing two high-speed cameras to capture the moment. Those images showed lightning zigzagging down from the clouds and following the laser light for some 50 meters toward the tower’s lightning rod.</p>





<p>To track the paths of the three bolts that they could not see, the researchers looked at radio waves shed by the lightning. Those radio waves showed that the three strikes followed the path of the laser much more closely than other strikes that happened when the laser was off. This hinted that the laser guided these three strikes to the lightning rod, as well.</p>

<p>“It’s a real achievement,” says Howard Milchberg, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park not involved in the work. “People have been trying to do this for many years.” Scientists’ main goal in bending lightning to their will is to increase safety, he says. But “if this thing ever became really, really efficient, and the probability of guiding a discharge was increased way beyond what it is now, it could potentially even be useful for charging things up.”</p>



<p>Atmospheric and space scientist Robert Holzworth is more cautious about imagining the applications. “They only showed 50 meters of [guiding] length, and most lightning channels are kilometers long,” says Holzworth, of the University of Washington in Seattle. So scaling the laser system up to have a useful reach may take a lot of work.</p>



<p>Using a higher-frequency, higher-energy laser could extend its reach, Houard says. “This is a first step toward a kilometric-range lightning rod.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-elements-properties-technology">How rare earth elements’ hidden properties make modern technology possible</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In Frank Herbert’s space opera <em>Dune</em>, a precious natural substance called spice melange grants people the ability to navigate vast expanses of the cosmos to build an intergalactic civilization.</p>



<p>In real life here on Earth, a group of natural metals known as the rare earths has made possible our own technology-powered society. Demand for these crucial components in nearly all modern electronics is skyrocketing.</p>



<p>Rare earths fulfill thousands of different needs — cerium, for instance, is used as a catalyst to refine petroleum, and gadolinium captures neutrons in nuclear reactors. But these elements’ most outstanding capabilities lie in their luminescence and magnetism.</p>





<p>We rely on rare earths to color our smartphone screens, fluoresce to signal authenticity in euro banknotes and relay signals through fiber-optic cables across the seafloor. They are also essential for building some of the world’s strongest and most reliable magnets. They generate sound waves in your headphones, boost digital information through space and shift the trajectories of heat-seeking missiles. Rare earths are also driving the growth of green technologies, such as wind energy and electric vehicles, and may even give rise to new components for quantum computers.</p>



<p>“The list just goes on and on,” says Stephen Boyd, a synthetic chemist and independent consultant. “They’re everywhere.”</p>



<h4>Rare earths’ superpowers come from their electrons</h4>



<p>The rare earths are the lanthanides — lutetium and all 14 elements between lanthanum and ytterbium across one row of the periodic table — plus scandium and yttrium, which tend to occur in the same ore deposits and have similar chemical properties to the lanthanides. These gray to silvery metals are often malleable with high melting and boiling points.</p>



<p>Their secret powers lie in their electrons. All atoms have a nucleus surrounded by electrons, which inhabit zones called orbitals. Electrons in the orbitals farthest from the nucleus are the valence electrons, which participate in chemical reactions and form bonds with other atoms.</p>



<p>Most lanthanides possess another important set of electrons called the “f-electrons,” which dwell in a Goldilocks zone located near the valence electrons but slightly closer to the nucleus. “It’s these f-electrons that are responsible for both the magnetic and luminescent properties of the rare earth elements,” says Ana de Bettencourt-Dias, an inorganic chemist at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Place on the periodic table</h3>



<p>The rare earths are a group of 17 elements (highlighted in blue on the periodic table). A subset of rare earths known as the lanthanides (lutetium, Lu, plus the row starting with lanthanum, La) each contain a subshell that typically houses f-electrons, which bestow the elements with magnetic and luminescent properties.</p>

<h4>Rare earths add color and light</h4>



<p>Along some coasts, the night sea occasionally glows bluish green as bioluminescent plankton are jostled in the waves. Rare earth metals also radiate light when stimulated. The trick is to tickle their f-electrons, de Bettencourt-Dias says.</p>



<p>Using an energy source like a laser or lamp, scientists and engineers can jolt one of a rare earth’s f-electrons into an excited state and then let it fall back into lethargy, or its ground state. “When the lanthanides come back to the ground state,” she says, “they emit light.”</p>



<p>Each rare earth reliably emits precise wavelengths of light when excited, de Bettencourt-Dias says. This dependable precision allows engineers to carefully tune electromagnetic radiation in many electronics. Terbium, for instance, emits light at a wavelength of about 545 nanometers, making it good for constructing green phosphors in television, computer and smartphone screens. Europium, which has two common forms, is used to build red and blue phosphors. All together, these phosphors can paint screens with most shades of the rainbow.</p>



<p>Rare earths also radiate useful invisible light. Yttrium is a key ingredient in yttrium-aluminum-garnet, or YAG, a synthetic crystal that forms the core of many high-powered lasers. Engineers tune the wavelengths of these lasers by lacing YAG crystals with another rare earth. The most popular variety are neodymium-laced YAG lasers, which are used for everything from slicing steel to removing tattoos to laser range-finding. Erbium-YAG laser beams are a good option for minimally invasive surgeries because they’re readily absorbed by water in flesh and thus won’t slice too deep.</p>

<p>Beyond lasers, lanthanum is crucial for making the infrared-absorbing glass in night vision goggles. “And erbium drives our internet,” says Tian Zhong, a molecular engineer at the University of Chicago. Much of our digital information travels through optical fibers as light with a wavelength of about 1,550 nanometers — the same wavelength erbium emits. The signals in fiber-optic cables dim as they travel far from their source.

<h4>Rare earths make mighty magnets</h4>



<p>In 1945, scientists constructed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/adds-15000-second">ENIAC, the world’s first programmable, general purpose digital computer</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/46, p. 118</em>). Nicknamed the “Giant Brain,” ENIAC weighed more than four elephants and had a footprint roughly two-thirds the size of a tennis court.</p>



<p>Less than 80 years later, the ubiquitous smartphone — boasting far more computing power than ENIAC ever did — fits snugly in our palms. Society owes this miniaturization of electronic technology in large part to the exceptional magnetic power of the rare earths. Tiny rare earth magnets can do the same job as larger magnets made without rare earths.</p>



<p>It’s those f-electrons at play. Rare earths have many orbitals of electrons, but the f-electrons inhabit a specific group of seven orbitals called the 4f-subshell. In any subshell, electrons try to spread themselves out among the orbitals within. Each orbital can house up to two electrons. But since the 4f-subshell contains seven orbitals, and most rare earths contain fewer than 14 f-electrons, the elements tend to have multiple orbitals with just one electron. Neodymium atoms, for instance, possess four of these loners, while dysprosium and samarium have five. Crucially, these unpaired electrons tend to point — or spin — in the same direction, Boyd says. “That’s what creates the north and the south poles that we classically understand as magnetism.”</p>



<p>Since these lone f-electrons flitter behind a shell of valence electrons, their synchronized spins are somewhat shielded from demagnetizing forces such as heat and other magnetic fields, making them great for building permanent magnets, Zhong says. Permanent magnets, like the ones that hold up pictures on a fridge door, passively generate magnetic fields that arise from their atomic structure, unlike electromagnets, which require an electric current and can be turned off.</p>



<p>But even with their shielding, the rare earths have limits. Pure neodymium, for example, readily corrodes and fractures, and its magnetic pull begins to lose strength above 80° Celsius. So manufacturers alloy some rare earths with other metals to make more resilient magnets, says Durga Paudyal, a theoretical physicist at Ames National Laboratory in Iowa. This works well because some rare earths can orchestrate the magnetic fields of other metals, he says. Just as weighted dice will preferentially land on one side, some rare earths like neodymium and samarium exhibit stronger magnetism in certain directions because they contain unevenly filled orbitals in their 4f-subshells. This directionality, called magnetic anisotropy, can be leveraged to coordinate the fields of other metals like iron or cobalt to formulate robust, extremely powerful magnets.</p>



<p>The most powerful rare earth alloy magnets are neodymium-iron-boron magnets. A three-kilogram neodymium alloy magnet can lift objects that weigh over 300 kilograms, for instance. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than 95 percent of the world’s permanent magnets</a> are made from this rare earth alloy. Neodymium-iron-boron magnets generate vibrations in smartphones, produce sounds in earbuds and headphones, enable the reading and writing of data in hard disk drives and generate the magnetic fields used in MRI machines. And adding a bit of dysprosium to these magnets can boost the alloy’s heat resistance, making it a good choice for the rotors that spin in the hot interiors of many electric vehicle motors.</p>



<p>Samarium-cobalt magnets, developed in the 1960s, were the first popular rare earth magnets. Though slightly weaker than neodymium-iron-boron magnets, samarium-cobalt magnets have superior heat and corrosion resistance, so they’re put to work in high-speed motors, generators, speed sensors in cars and airplanes, and in the moving parts of some heat-seeking missiles. Samarium-cobalt magnets also form the heart of most traveling-wave tubes, which boost signals from radar systems and communications satellites. Some of these tubes are transmitting data from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-exoplanet-century-astronomy-earth-universe">Voyager 1 spacecraft</a> — currently the most distant human-made object — over 23 billion kilometers away (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Because they are strong and reliable, rare earth magnets are supporting green technologies. They’re in the motors, drivetrains, power steering and many other components of electric vehicles. Tesla’s use of neodymium alloy magnets in its farthest-ranging Model 3 vehicles has sparked supply chain worries; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">China provides the vast majority of the world&#8217;s neodymium</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/23</em>).</p>



<p>Rare earth magnets are also used in many offshore wind turbines to replace gearboxes, which boosts efficiency and decreases maintenance. In August, Chinese engineers introduced “Rainbow,” the world’s first maglev train line based on rare earth magnets that enable the trains to float without consuming electricity.</p>



<p>In the future, rare earths may even advance quantum computing. While conventional computers use binary bits (those 1s and 0s), quantum computers use qubits, which can occupy two states simultaneously. As it turns out, crystals containing rare earths make good qubits, since the shielded f-electrons can store quantum information for long periods of time, Zhong says. One day, computer scientists might even leverage the luminescent properties of rare earths in qubits to share information between quantum computers and birth a quantum internet, he says.</p>



<p>It may be too early to predict exactly how the rare earth metals will continue to influence the expansion of these growing technologies. But it’s probably safe to say: We’re going to need more rare earths.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-xbb15-kraken-omicron-variant-virus">Here’s what you need to know about COVID’s XBB.1.5 ‘Kraken’ variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>The omicron variant’s family tree has grown substantially over the last year. The brood now encompasses a subvariant soup with alphanumeric names such as BA.2, BA.5 and BF.7. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that two versions — BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 — caused just over half of new infections in the United States during the week ending January 7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, a newcomer dubbed XBB.1.5 seems poised for a rise to dominance. According to CDC estimates, it accounts for more than 80 percent of new cases in parts of the northeastern United States. For the week ending January 14, it was responsible for 43 percent of new cases across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>But while previous variants such as alpha, delta and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">original omicron</a> were linked to massive surges of new infections, it’s not yet clear whether XBB.1.5 is destined for a similar path (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). Preliminary evidence suggests the subvariant, nicknamed the Kraken in some circles, is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.03.522427v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more transmissible</a> than its predecessors. That trait, however, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-mutations-strains-variants">a hallmark of viral evolution</a> — successful new variants must be able to outcompete their siblings (<em>SN: 5/26/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, experts at the World Health Organization are keeping a close eye on XBB.1.5. But it’s <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/11jan2023_xbb15_rapid_risk_assessment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too early to say</a> whether it might take over the globe. Most cases currently come from the United States, the United Kingdom and Denmark.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke with infectious diseases specialist Peter Chin-Hong of the University of California, San Francisco about the latest coronavirus variant to make headlines. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What is the difference between XBB.1.5 and earlier versions of omicron?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: There are lots of variants that get produced all the time. It’s a normal thing for the virus as the virus makes more copies of itself. It’s not exactly precise or accurate, so it makes errors, [which are the variants]. It’s kind of like a bad photocopy machine in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>XBB, a sibling of XBB.1.5, was scary — and that was seen in the fall of 2022 — because it was one of the most immune-evasive variants around. But the reason why XBB never took off around the world — it was really in Singapore and India — was that it didn’t really infect cells quite as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>XBB.1.5 has the immune slipperiness of XBB, but it also has this new mutation that makes it easy to infect cells. So it’s kind of like a bulldog in not wanting to let go of the cell. Whereas XBB was kind of invisible, like it had the invisibility cloak from <em>Harry Potter</em>, it didn’t have the bite. But XBB.1.5 has the invisibility cloak, plus the bite.&nbsp;</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Is that why it’s spreading so effectively in some areas?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: We think so. Because to be very efficient at infecting cells is a really important superpower if you are a virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can be invisible [to the immune system] all you want, but if you’re not infecting cells efficiently, you probably won’t be as infectious. That could be [the reason] XBB.1.5 is spreading, because it has both of those things going for it. Seeing how it’s crowding out the other variants now makes us worried that it’s something to pay attention to. And it’s accompanied by increasing cases and hospitalizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Previous variants were linked to big surges of infections. Can we expect the same of XBB.1.5?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: It’s complicated. If it were March 2020, it would be a very simple answer: Yes. But in January of 2023, you have so much variation in the amount of experience people have toward COVID, even if it’s a different type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can have somebody who got infected two or three times plus they got vaccinated and boosted. That’s going to be somebody who’s going to be really, really well protected against getting seriously ill. Maybe they might get a cold. Maybe they wouldn’t even know they had an infection versus somebody who didn’t get vaccinated and never got exposed and they’re older. It might as well be March of 2020 for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That [second] kind of person is, for example, in China. In China, XBB.1.5 might cause a lot of problems. But XBB.1.5 going to, you know, the middle of Manhattan might not cause as many problems in a highly vaccinated and exposed group of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Timing also matters] because we saw a lot of BQ.1, BQ.1.1 recently, and a lot of people got infected after Thanksgiving. This rise of XBB.1.5 is coming after a lot of people already got infected recently. So it probably won’t do as much damage as if you had a long lull and all of a sudden you have this new thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Do vaccines and treatments still work against it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The new updated boosters generally work a little better than the old vaccines in terms of overall efficacy and preventing infection. But with these new slippery variants like XBB.1.5 … if you’re looking to prevent infections, even a mild infection, the vaccines are probably going to last maybe three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re talking about preventing me from dying or going to the hospital, those vaccines are going to give me a boost of protection for many, many months, probably until next winter for most people. For older people, older than 65, if they’re not boosted today, then it’s a problem.</p>



<p>[Drugs such as] Paxlovid and remdesivir work independent of the spike protein [the part of the virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">targeted by vaccines</a> but where many of the defense-evading mutations are (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>)]. So it doesn’t matter what invisibility cloak the variant has. They’re going to work because they work on shutting down the virus factory, which is one of the early steps, before the spike protein gets made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So they will work no matter what [spike] variant comes along, which is a good thing. Even if you didn’t get vaccinated or never got exposed, if you got diagnosed and you get early therapy, it will cut down your hospitalization rates substantially.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, all monoclonal antibodies don’t work. [The virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-variants-fall-surge">has changed too much</a> (<em>SN: 10/17/22</em>).]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Why is it that only omicron variants are popping up?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: I think omicron has hit on a magical formula. It’s going to be hard to kick it off the gold medal stand. It’s so good at transmission, and all these other aspects that are good for the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the [earlier] days, it was two or three months, and you had a new coronavirus variant somewhere in the world. Now it’s been omicron since two Thanksgivings ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>With each variant more transmissible than the last, is it inevitable that everyone will get COVID?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The people who didn’t get infected before are going to have a really, really hard time escaping this one. But it’s not impossible. It’s just going to be harder and harder, not only because XBB.1.5 is so transmissible, but also because we don’t have so many restrictions anymore. You’re going to the grocery store, nobody’s wearing a mask or you don’t feel like you have peer pressure to wear masks. So you’re going to get exposed just like you get exposed to colds….&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you can reduce the risk in the short term by getting a booster, if you haven’t already gotten one. And certainly [the booster] can reduce the risk of dying, particularly if you’re older or immune-compromised….&nbsp;</p>



<p>[People still wearing masks] have to wear really good quality masks [such as KN95s] because you can’t rely on everybody else wearing masks anymore.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How worried should people be about XBB.1.5?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chin-Hong</strong>: The world is divided into two groups of people. The people whose bodies are very, very experienced with COVID — it’s gotten vaccines or boosting or … a couple of infections. And then there are people whose body isn’t well-experienced with COVID. For that [latter] group, they should be worried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For someone, you’re looking around and your neighbor got it and nothing happened, or your cousin or a person at work, and it&#8217;s like it’s no big deal. But there are still 500 people dying every day in the United States [from COVID]. And to those people, it’s a huge deal….</p>



<p>It’s a weird situation because it’s not one-size-fits-all anymore, and different people have different levels of risk.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In preparation for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) negotiations, a group of experts came together in late 2021, convened by <a href="https://geobon.org/science-briefs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GEO BON</a> and <a href="https://futureearth.org/">Future </a><a href="https://futureearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earth</a>, to compile a series of scientific <a href="https://geobon.org/science-briefs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefs</a> showing assessments and recommendations for select GBF targets and goals. In order to distill key aspects of these briefs and make their overarching messages more accessible to the broader scientific community, these experts authored and published the first of a series of Policy Perspective companion pieces in <em>PLOS Climate </em>and <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>. Read on for a summary of these papers with links to the full articles below.</p>



<h3>Background&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The articles summarize key focus areas to help reverse the decline of biodiversity. These areas include increasing natural ecosystem area by 2030, focusing on specific restoration needs to meet this goal, and cautioning that specific efforts must respect biodiversity criteria and rights of local populations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The Articles</h3>



<p>In the <em>PLOS Climate</em> paper, the authors share opportunities to minimize<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateChange?src=hashtag_click"> </a>climate change impacts on<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/biodiversity?src=hashtag_click"> </a>biodiversity, how biodiversity can support<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/adaptation?src=hashtag_click"> </a>adaptation and<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mitigation?src=hashtag_click"> </a>mitigation, and how climate action can avoid negative impacts on biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em> paper describes actions to achieve ambitious net gains in natural<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ecosystem?src=hashtag_click"> </a>ecosystem areas, and the second<a href="https://twitter.com/PLOSSustain"> </a>paper addresses the complexities of setting ambitious international<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/restoration?src=hashtag_click"> </a>restoration objectives for terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Future Publications</h3>



<p>Two more papers are under review addressing sustainable agriculture, and sustainable use of biodiversity. Altogether, and with other outputs from the same group, the authors hope that scientific support for the development of the GBF will help align countries during negotiations and facilitate integrated implementation of the targets in coming years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-snow-saturn-cassini">Enceladus is blanketed in a thick layer of snow</a></h4>

              
                <p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus is shrouded in a thick layer of snow. In some places, the downy stuff is 700 meters deep, new research suggests.</p>



<p>“It’s like Buffalo, but worse,” says planetary scientist Emily Martin, referring to the famously snowy city in New York. The snow depth suggests that Enceladus’ dramatic plume <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103522004614?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have been more active in the past</a>, Martin and colleagues report in the Mar. 1 <em>Icarus</em>.</p>



<p>Planetary scientists have been fascinated by Enceladus’ geysers, made up of water vapor and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-phosphorus-life-building-block-saturn-moon">other ingredients</a>, since the Cassini spacecraft spotted them in 2005 (<em>SN: 12/16/22</em>). The spray probably comes from a salty ocean beneath an icy shell.</p>





<p>Some of that water goes to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">form one of Saturn’s rings</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/06</em>). But most of it falls back onto the moon’s surface as snow, Martin says. Understanding the properties of that snow — its thickness and how dense and compact it is — could help reveal Enceladus’ history, and lay groundwork for future missions to this moon.</p>



<p>“If you’re going to land a robot there, you need to understand what it’s going to be landing into,” says Martin, of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>To figure out how thick Enceladus’ snow is, Martin and colleagues looked to Earth — specifically, Iceland. The island country hosts geological features called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moon-dione-has-stripes-no-others-solar-system">pit chains</a>, which are lines of pockmarks in the ground formed when loose rubble such as rocks, ice or snow drains into a crack underneath (<em>SN: 10/23/18</em>). Similar features show up all over the solar system, including Enceladus.</p>

Martin took this image during a field excursion.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120901">E. Martin</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Previous work suggested a way to use geometry and the angle at which sunlight hits the surface to measure the depth of the pits. That measurement can then reveal the depth of the material the pits sit in. A <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JE006099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few weeks of fieldwork in Iceland</a> in 2017 and 2018 convinced Martin and her colleagues that the same technique would work on Enceladus.</p>



<p>Using images from Cassini, Martin and colleagues found that the snow’s thickness varies across Enceladus’ surface. It is hundreds of meters deep in most places and 700 meters deep at its thickest.</p>





<p>It’s hard to imagine how all that snow got there, though, Martin says. If the plume’s spray was always what it is today, it would take 4.5 billion years — the entire age of the solar system — to deposit that much snow on the surface. Even then, the snow would have to be especially fluffy.</p>



<p>It seems unlikely that the plume switched on the moment the moon formed and never changed, Martin says. And even if it did, later layers of snow would have compressed the earlier ones, compacting the whole layer and making it much less deep than it is today.</p>



<p>“It makes me think we don’t have 4.5 billion years to do this,” Martin says. Instead, the plume might have been much more active in the past. “We need to do it in a much shorter timeframe. You need to crank up the volume on the plume.”</p>



<p>The technique was clever, says planetary scientist Shannon MacKenzie of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. Without rovers or astronauts on the ground, there’s no way to scoop up the snow and see how far down it goes. “Instead, the authors are very cleverly using geology to be their rovers, to be their shovels.”</p>



<p>MacKenzie was not involved in the new work, but she led a mission concept study for an orbiter and lander that could one day visit Enceladus. One of the major questions in that study was where a lander could safely touch down. “Key to those discussions was, what do we expect the surface to be?” she says. The new paper could help “identify the places that are too fluffy to land in.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780316540537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Far the Light Reaches</a><br><em>Sabrina Imbler</em><br><em>Little, Brown &amp; Co., $27</em></p>



<p>In <em>How Far the Light Reaches</em>, Sabrina Imbler shows us that the ocean, in all its mystery and dazzling glory, is queer — that is, the life that takes shape there challenges how we landlubbers perceive ways of being. This collection of essays tells the stories of 10 sea creatures, with Imbler, a queer and mixed-race writer, weaving in stories of their own family, self-discovery, sexuality and healing. The profiled animals, often thought of as strange or alien, transform into recognizable emblems of identity, community and queer joy in this delectable amalgam of memoir and science journalism.</p>





<p>Imbler begins with a confession: “The truth is that I was asked to leave the Petco, but I told everyone I was banned.” Thirteen-year-old Imbler had staged a protest in the store, attempting to convince customers not to buy goldfish bowls. The bowls, Imbler writes, condemn the fish to a truncated life in a transparent coffin, in which they will die isolated, starved of oxygen and poisoned with ammonia from their own urine.</p>



<p>But unencumbered by the confines of a bowl, the fish thrive. When bored pet owners dump goldfish in lakes or rivers, the fish can balloon to the size of jugs of milk. They are “so good at living they have become an ecological menace,” breeding with abandon, uprooting bottom dwellers, and fomenting bacterial growth and algal blooms, Imbler writes.</p>



<p>Yet Imbler can’t help but admire the feral goldfish’s resilience: “I see something that no one expected to live not just alive but impossibly flourishing.”</p>



<p>Survival among unthinkable circumstances is a theme common to all the profiled animals. Take the yeti crab (<em>Kiwa puravida</em>), which, after reading this book, I now proclaim a queer icon (step aside, the Babadook). In the frigid dark, about 1,000 meters below the sea surface, the crab finds solace near hydrothermal vents.</p>



<p>Such hot spots foster life in a desolate wasteland. Heat and chemicals from inside the Earth sustain an ecosystem of crabs, clams, mussels, tube worms and more. There, in true queer fashion, <em>K. puravida</em> “dances to live,” Imbler writes. The yeti crab throws its claws in the air and waves ’em like it just don’t care. In doing so, it is “farming” the bacteria that it eats, which cling to the crab’s bristly claws. Waving the claws in a slow but steady rhythm ensures the bacteria get nutrients.</p>



<p>In telling the crab’s story, Imbler reminisces on their quest to find community after moving to Seattle in 2016. Feeling alone among the mostly white people they met, Imbler discovered a monthly party called Night Crush, thrown by and for queer people of color. Night Crush became Imbler’s own hydrothermal vent — an oasis warmed by people dancing in mesh, sequins, glitter and joy. “As queer people, we get to choose our families,” Imbler writes. “Vent bacteria, tube worms, and yeti crabs just take it one step further. They choose what nourishes them.”</p>





<p>Imbler looks to the sea to explore all aspects of family. The purple octopus (<em>Graneledone boreopacifica</em>), for instance, offers insights on motherhood. During a four-and-a-half-year brooding period, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octomom-sets-egg-brooding-record">longest known for any animal</a>, the octopus starves herself to death, foregoing hunting to protect her eggs (<em>SN: 7/30/14</em>).</p>



<p>Through the octopus’ saga, Imbler reflects on their own mother, who moved to the United States from Taiwan as a child. Imbler’s mother felt like she was on “a new planet.” To survive, she learned to want to be as white and “American” as possible, and as thin as possible — traumas inherited by Imbler, who developed an eating disorder.</p>



<p>In their recovery, Imbler has realized their mother’s wish for them to be thin, though damaging, was, in a way, an act of love: “She wanted me to be skinny so things would be easier. White, so things would be easier. Straight, so things would be easy, easy, easy. So that unlike her, no one would ever question my right to be here, in America.”</p>

<p>It is with that same grace, clarity and tenderness that Imbler crafts the book’s other essays, whether it’s meditating on their own gender expression through the cuttlefish’s mastery of metamorphosis or examining their experience of sexual assault through the sand striker, an ambush predator of the seafloor.</p>



<p>Like a goldfish confined by a bowl, I am confined by my word count and can’t say everything I want to about this must-read book. So I’ll end on one final insight. In one essay, Imbler introduces salps. These jelly-like blobs exist as a colony of hundreds of identical salps joined in a chain. The creatures do not move in one synchronized effort. “Salps allow each individual to jet at its own pace in the same general direction,” Imbler writes. “It is not as fast as coordinated strokes, but it’s more sustainable long-term, each individual sucking and spurting as it pleases.”</p>



<p>This idea of one collective, made up of individuals marching toward a common cause at their own pace, is one that queer people and other marginalized groups know well — whether creating community or protesting for civil rights. And it’s a notion that Imbler imparts upon their reader: “We may all move at different paces, but we will only reach the horizon together.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/singel-cell-2-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>When Barbara McClintock dubbed them “<a href="http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/21/197">controlling elements</a>”, the term she used was perhaps far more prescient and descriptive than the term more commonly used today, transposable elements (TEs). In many organisms, including in clades as diverse as plants, animals – mammalian and otherwise -, and bacteria, TEs are a major component of the genome, as well as its organization and regulation. In humans, roughly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35057062">45% of the genome comprises TEs</a>, with a large majority of that consisting of retrotransposons, while in mice, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01262">TEs make up 37% of the genome</a>. Far from mere evolutionary junk, TEs have a variety of modes of impact on the genome and the transcriptome. Even in mammalian genomes, where many TEs are dormant, multiple classes of TEs, such as LINEs and Alu elements, still show active transposition [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32722770/">1</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33725281/">2</a>]. This can be a part of the normal genetic variety of the species, but is more frequently linked with adverse outcomes, such as developmental disorders, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0165-8">genetic diseases</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc.2017.35">tumor formation</a> . To prevent such outcomes, TE activity and expression is tightly regulated in many genomes, often using TE proprietary regulatory mechanisms. For example, the suppression of TEs during development often remains intact, despite near-global demethylation and formation of pervasive euchromatin regions [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-019-0159-6">3</a>].</p>
<p>In more recent years, the initial spike in research pertaining to TEs has been followed by a steady decline in the number of publications since 2013 (based on number of publications listed on the PubMed archives). In comparison, even when we do not account for the large amount of research related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of total research articles, as well as research in other fields has seen a general steady increase. While TEs continue to be a source of novel and vital information in many types of biological activity, the research has simply failed to catch up with the growing understanding of their importance in the genome.One of the potential reasons for this decline is the same property of TEs that makes them so important to the genome: as repeat elements, which, unlike tandem repeats, are found scattered across the genome, in-depth study of TEs requires increasingly more specialized tools and methods to yield new insights [<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1577-z">4</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0050-x">5</a>]. For example, due to the potential impact of individual TE instances on the local genomic regions, such as through contributions of regulatory motifs (e.g. transcription factor binding sites), analyzing TE activity as a single meta-gene might lead to insufficient or misleading results. In addition, as mentioned previously, many TEs are actively transposed in both germline and somatic cells, often creating large scale structural variances that are difficult to capture properly without examination of the individual cells or organisms. Use of a reference genome for an organism without taking into account the possibility of such transposition might lead to missed opportunities for TE research. Overcoming such challenges might require extensive modifications to or adaptations of accepted methodologies, which is no trivial task.</p>
<blockquote><p>TEs are a major component of the genome, as well as its organization and regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the decrease in published TE research, recent years have also seen an increasing number of computational tools designed to create bespoke solutions for problems faced by TE researchers [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0050-x">5]</a>. In bulk RNA sequencing, the analysis of TEs has seen significant improvements, thanks to tools such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29218879/">SalmonTE,</a> by Hyun-Hwan Jeong <em>et al</em>., and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624635/">SQuIRE</a>, by Wan R Yang <em>et al</em>. . These tools allow improved locus specific quantification, allowing for more precise data. Due to the more complicated nature of the resulting data, TE research using single cell sequencing continues to see improvements. Previously, Jiangping He and colleagues have made available the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21808-x">scTE pipeline</a>, which allowed for the quantification of TEs on a metagene level in single cell RNA-seq data. More recently, Rocío Rodríguez-Quiroz and Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana have published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04020-5">soloTE</a> , which can quantify TE expression in single cell data on a locus-specific level, leading to further refinement of such analysis. For analysis of retrotransposons which code for peptides, and thus contain speficic domain sequences, Mikhail Biryukov and Kirill Ustyantsev have created <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35052350/">DARTS</a> , for domain associated retrotransposon search in genome assemblies. Meanwhile, even more improved usage of such developed tools is possible. In a benchmark analysis involving multiple algorithms and pipelines, including the previously mentioned SQuIRE and SalmonTE, Natalia Savytska <em>et al</em>. have integrated transcription start site profile data to more accurately identify and quantify instance specific TE expression [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9633680/">6]</a>. Thanks to such innovations, there is hope that our understanding of TEs will soon see an acceleration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, TE research remains a vital, yet underappreciated field of study. Lowering the barriers to conducting and understanding TE research is an important prospect, requiring the contributions of many researchers in multiple biological disciplines.

<p>A study in the journal <em>Smart Materials in Medicine</em> has earned a retraction, seemingly not because of scholarly malfeasance or an inadvertent oversight, but because of a “lack of agreement on affiliation format.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crucial fact seems to be that almost all of the article’s authors, including its two senior authors, list affiliations in Taiwan, raising the question if the retraction is based on the geopolitical dispute about whether Taiwan is an independent nation or part of China.</p>



<p>The article, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590183421000478">“Anti-microbial/oxidative/inflammatory nanogels accelerate chronic wound healing,”</a> was published online in late 2021. The journal is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science, although there are 10 citations of&nbsp; the article listed on the article’s web page as of January 12. There is no Twitter chatter indicating anything amiss with the article’s conclusions or methods, and no discussion about it on PubPeer.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when exactly the paper was retracted. Its cryptic retraction notice states:</p>



<span id="more-126390"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Due to the lack of agreement on affiliation format between authors and the owner of the journal, this article has been retracted at the request of all authors, the Editors-in-Chief and the owner of the journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Smart Materials in Medicine </em>is published by Elsevier on behalf of KeAi Communications, an open access publisher <a href="https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/about-us/contact/">based in Beijing</a>. According to KeAi’s <a href="https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/about-us/">website</a>, Elsevier cofounded the publisher with China Science Publishing &amp; Media Ltd, and the company “believe[s] in the global impact of research from China.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The Chinese government has attempted to <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/china-takes-big-publishers-world-class-journal-drive">influence scientific publishing</a> in other ways before, resulting in publishers “self-censoring content on ‘sensitive’ topics,” <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/depth/can-academic-publishers-resist-self-censorship-china">according to <em>Times Higher Education</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>Elsevier did not reply to our requests for comment. We also did not hear back from the journal’s editor, Donghui Zhu of Stony Brook University in New York. The study’s corresponding authors &#8211; Huan-Tsung Chang of the National Taiwan University in Taipei and Chih-Ching Huang of the National Taiwan Ocean University and ​​Kaohsiung Medical University &#8211; also did not reply to our requests for comment. So the exact nature of the “lack of agreement on affiliation format” remains unknown.</p>



<p>That said, Elsevier includes this familiar disclaimer on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/smart-materials-in-medicine/about/editorial-board">journal’s editorial board listing</a>, though it doesn’t appear on the retracted article page:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All members of the Editorial Board have identified their affiliated institutions or organizations, along with the corresponding country or geographic region. Elsevier remains neutral with regard to any jurisdictional claims.</p>

<p>Professor Guo, who was the chairman of the UC Davis Chemistry Department from 2016-2018, has been mentoring high school students for over a decade. Already in 2010, he was awarded the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/diversity-reigns" target="_blank">Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Award for Diversity and Community</a> by then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/10/uc-davis-chancellor-resigns-after-pepper-spray-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chancellor Linda Katehi</a>. In January of that year, he started mentoring a high school student, who had written to him asking whether she could shadow him at work for an assignment from her AP Chemistry teacher. She had written to several professors and he was the first to reply affirmatively.</p>

<p>In 2018, the high school student from 2010 who had shadowed Professor Guo for an AP Chemistry assignment, and was by then at UC Santa Barbara, contacted a USCB Police Department detective to report that she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by Professor Guo in 2010. This is detailed in a lawsuit (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trellis.law/case/cv2020-1704/jane-doe-vs-ting-guo-board-regents-university-california-davis" target="_blank">CV2020-1704</a>) filed by the student against Professor Guo and the Board of Regents of the University of California, Davis. The filing describes an alleged incident on August 7, 2010, where the high school student (now the plaintiff) presented Professor Guo with some gifts (per her cultural custom) and offered to help him carry them home. At his house he allegedly offered her beer (which she declined because she was underage), and they apparently talked about Star Wars and his complete collection of the movies.

<p>The plaintiff alleges that a few months later, by September 2010, she had been sexually assaulted three times:</p>

<p>The details are painful and poignant. After the second assault he allegedly offered her $60: &#8220;She refused and felt disrespected. But then he said to give it to her mom.&#8221; And as is often the case when massive power differentials are at play, the victim &#8220;carried on like normal- like nothing strange had happened because she did not want to face it or deal with it or process it. The plaintiff didn&#8217;t want to believe that Professor Guo was that kind of person.&#8221; </p>



<p>I was heartbroken reading the following passage describing the plaintiff&#8217;s frame of mind after the first sexual assault:</p>

<p>According to the filing, the report that was filed with police at UCSB followed therapy sessions and a meeting with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://care.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">CARE</a> counselor at UCSB. It included not only a statement by the victim, but text messages with friends about the events when they happened. The UCSB police forwarded the report to police at UC Davis, who spoke to Professor Guo. He denied anything had happened. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Turning a blind eye</strong></p>



<p>You might think, that UC Davis, which became aware of the allegations in 2018 when the UCSB police report was forwarded to the UC Davis police, and which certainly reviewed the allegations in the lawsuit filed in 2020, would <strong>at least protect</strong> <strong>high school students</strong> by not allowing Professor Guo to interact with them until the truth, or falsehood, of the allegations against him could be established. At universities, investigations of allegations against a professor can take a long time, and it is understandable that a university would afford professors a presumption of innocence until determination of guilt or innocence is complete (although to be clear, the timescale of investigations is frequently not reasonable at all). In any case, the possibility of guilt in a case where serious allegations of violence and sexual assault are alleged, demand protection of students in the interim. Protection, at a minimum, would entail not allowing Professor Guo to mentor high school students and refuse him the privilege of serving as a mentor in the Young Scholars Program. This would be a limitation, but not one that is very restrictive for a professor. Of course, one would hope that UC Davis would also protect undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs, but again, <strong>at least, one would hope, UC Davis would protect high school students</strong>. However, UC Davis allowed Professor Guo to continue mentoring high school students up until 2021, as the Facebook post shown at the top of this post demonstrates. In fact, <strong>Professor Guo mentored a high school student</strong> by the name of Jonathan Ma in 2019,<strong> after UC Davis knew about the allegations against Professor Guo</strong>. Below is an excerpt from an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stltoday.com/pr/lifestyles/local-student-spends-summer-conducting-research-at-uc-davis/article_b4459e84-acff-11e9-9d86-5cb9017bdf7c.html" target="_blank">article in the the St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> dated July 22, 2019 about the student and his summer experience in Professor Ting Guo&#8217;s lab:</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Tampering with evidence</strong></p>



<p><strong>In 2019 California changed the statute of limitations for adult survivors of sexual abuse from 3 years to 10 years</strong>. Assaults that occurred before January 1, 2019, can be held to the three-year limit. For this reason, the court sustained demurrers by Ting Guo and the Board of Regents of the University of California against the plaintiff in the CV2020-1704 lawsuit. There will be no trial to establish the truth or falsehood of the allegations.</p>



<p>Now suppose you were an administrator at UC Davis, and you believed that the allegations against Professor Ting Guo were <strong>FALSE</strong>. Suppose you believed that Professor Ting Guo was <strong>INNOCENT</strong>. Why would you tamper with websites simply showing that Professor Guo regularly mentored high school students via the UC Davis Youth Scholars Program? After all, you would believe him to be an <strong>INNOCENT</strong> man&#8230; so what would there be to hide? Well&#8230;it turns out that <strong>recently websites of the Youth Scholars Program were tampered with to remove all evidence of Professor Ting Guo&#8217;s involvement with the program</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br></p>



<p>For example, consider student Sean Wu who participated in the Youth Scholars Program in 2018, and was mentored by Professor Ting Guo:</p>

<p>On another <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://education.ucdavis.edu/ysp-research-projects" target="_blank">Youth Scholars Program website</a>, the project is still listed, but the mentor has been changed from Professor Guo to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-lien-47b89b45/" target="_blank">Jennifer Lien</a>, who is a postdoc in the Guo lab (she was formerly a graduate student in the lab and has been there 11 years):</p>

<p>Several other Youth Scholars Program high school students who worked in Professor Guo&#8217;s lab, and that had previously listed him as their mentor on the Youth Scholars Program websites, have just had their mentor retroactively changed to Jennifer Lien by edits to the website. These include Jonathan Ma (the student from 2019 who is mentioned above), and another student Susan Garcia (2017).  I wonder who chose Jennifer Lien to replace Ting Guo as the mentor of the students, in some cases more than 5 years after the fact.</p>



<p>Susan Garcia&#8217;s project was also deleted from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230112163316/https://ysprogram.ucdavis.edu/research-projects/2017?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this website</a>.

<p>In addition, the Facebook post shown at the top of this post, was also deleted. The cover up was sloppy (the need to scrub <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://nanofast.ucdavis.edu/alumni.html" target="_blank">Professor Guo&#8217;s website</a> was seemingly overlooked), but whoever did this clearly wanted to hide the fact that Professor Ting Guo mentored high school students via the Youth Scholars Program.</p>



<p>The digital tampering that was performed is reminiscent of one of the scandals that led to Chancellor Linda Katehi&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/embattled-university-of-california-davis-chancellor-resigns.html" target="_blank">resignation &#8220;under fire&#8221; in 2016</a>, when she was being investigated for using university money to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/disgraced-uc-davis-chancellor-katehi-obsessed-online-image-article-1.2746114" target="_blank">try to remove negative online search results about herself</a>. Seriously, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2019/11/06/an-outrage-at-uc-davis/" target="_blank">what is going on at UC Davis?</a> </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size" id="Summary"><strong>The end</strong></p>



<p>In summary, a high school student working in UC Davis Chemistry professor Ting Guo&#8217;s lab in 2010 alleged in a police report filed in 2018 that she was sexually assaulted by him multiple times. In 2020, she filed a lawsuit against Professor Guo and The Board of Regents of the University of California, Davis. UC Davis continued to allow Professor Guo access to high school students via the Youth Scholars Program even after finding out about the serious allegations against him. Recently, websites of the Youth Scholars Program have been altered or deleted to remove any evidence showing that Professor Guo was ever a mentor in the program. </p>



<p>How many more such cases are there that have not see the light of day because evidence was more effectively tampered with? How many universities are wiping their records to hide evidence of their negligence in protecting students? How many more women must suffer? Will we ever see the end?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/plos-announces-new-publishing-agreement-with-german-consortium/">PLOS Announces New Publishing Agreement with German Consortium</a></h4>

              
                <p>Note: PLOS issued the following press release on January 12, 2023</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash;The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is pleased to announce a consortium agreement with Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) that allows member institutions to participate in PLOS&rsquo; three innovative publishing models. This two-year agreement provides researchers affiliated with consortium members with unlimited publishing privileges in PLOS journals without them having to cover fees themselves. The TIB-led consortium has more than 40 members<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This is the first time that TIB has negotiated a consortial contract with a Gold OA publisher that is open to institutions across Germany. There was a clear need for an agreement that allows universities, universities of applied sciences and research institutions to centrally cover publication fees in PLOS journals for their researchers, and as consortial leader it is our mission to meet those needs. This partnership will play a key role in alleviating barriers for researchers when publishing their work Open Access, such as eliminating author-facing article processing charges (APCs) and including the entire PLOS portfolio under the deal,&rdquo; said Dr. Irina Sens,&nbsp;deputy director of TIB.</p>



<p>All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond APCs to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flat Fees </a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a><a href="#_ftn4"><u>[4]</u></a>.</p>



<p><a>&ldquo;This agreement represents a new model for institutions to collaborate and invest equitably in our common interests in advancing Open Science,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;TIB shares our commitment to building business models that will move researchers and journals toward a more equitable and barrier free form of publishing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The members of the TIB-led consortium join a growing list of institutions including the <a href="https://btaa.org/">Big Ten Academic Alliance</a>, the University of California system, <a href="https://www.crl.edu/">CRL</a> and <a href="https://nerl.org/">NERL</a>, <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the <a href="https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en">Canadian Research Knowledge Network</a> <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a> to support their researchers through publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> recently honored PLOS as the 2021 co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hdl-good-cholesterol-heart-health">HDL ‘good’ cholesterol isn’t always good for heart health</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Good” and “bad” cholesterol: These well-known characters have long starred in the saga of heart health. But in a major plot twist, “good” cholesterol, it turns out, is not always so good.</p>



<p>In the last dozen years or so, research on the particles that carry so-called good cholesterol — known as high-density lipoprotein, or HDL — has presented a much more nuanced and conflicted story about HDL’s effect on cardiovascular disease.</p>



<p>And a new, large study brings fresh doubt. High levels of <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.09.027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HDL cholesterol were not associated with protection against heart disease</a> in Black or white participants, researchers reported in the November <em>Journal of the American College of Cardiology. </em>For low levels of HDL cholesterol, there was a split, with a link to higher risk of heart disease in white participants but not in Black participants.</p>





<p>The study is the first to find a difference in the risk tied to low levels of HDL cholesterol between Black and white people. It also adds to accumulating evidence that a high level of HDL cholesterol isn’t necessarily helpful for one’s heart health.</p>



<p>There appear to be other attributes of HDL that can be good. But researchers have also found that HDL’s role in health is complicated and ever-changing, with plenty to figure out.</p>



<h4>The link between HDL and heart disease isn’t clear-cut</h4>



<p>Cholesterol has long been explained as the “good” versus the “bad.” A high level of the “good” kind has been tied to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, while having lots of the “bad” kind — carried by low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, particles — has been linked to a higher risk.</p>



<p>One of the big reports to bestow HDL cholesterol with the label of “good” came out of the Framingham Heart Study, a government-led effort launched in 1948 to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In 1977, Framingham researchers reported an <a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/0002-9343(77)90874-9/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol and coronary disease risk</a> in a group made up of white participants.</p>



<p>But later studies undercut the premise that high levels are automatically good for heart health. People with a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-cholesterol-may-not-be-what-keeps-heart-healthy">genetic mutation that boosts their HDL cholesterol level</a>, for example, do not have lower risk of heart attacks than people without the mutation (<em>SN: 5/18/12</em>). And a class of drugs developed to increase HDL cholesterol did a great job upping numbers, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6354546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t make a difference when it came to cardiovascular risk</a>.</p>





<p>A person’s HDL cholesterol level is just one part of the story, though. Commonly reported on blood tests, the level reflects the amount of cholesterol that HDL particles have on board. HDL carries cholesterol away from the arteries to the liver to be excreted. This helps keep cholesterol from building up in artery walls, which can eventually impede blood flow.</p>



<p>Recently, research on HDL has started looking beyond its cholesterol payload. “The big understanding over the last decade or so is that while you can measure the cholesterol, it doesn’t really reflect the actual functions that HDL is doing in the body,” says Anand Rohatgi, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</p>



<p>How well HDL removes cholesterol appears to matter. One measure of this job performance is HDL’s ability to receive cholesterol from a type of cell called a macrophage. In a U.S. study of close to 3,000 adults, 49 percent who were Black, the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher this capacity, the lower the incidence of heart</a> attacks or strokes, Rohatgi and colleagues reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in 2014.</p>



<p>Ridding the body of cholesterol is just one of HDL’s many jobs. HDL also has <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.312617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-inflammatory and other protective effects</a> that appear to guard against cardiovascular disease. But even these effects don’t always lead to a net good. In certain circumstances, HDL can become dysfunctional, such that its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrcardio.2015.124" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capacity to receive cholesterol is reduced</a>, and it contributes to inflammation. The fact that HDL’s roles can change, depending on the context, has made studying HDL particles challenging, Rohatgi says.</p>



<p>How well HDL performs is still far from something that can be tested as part of a regular physical exam. It’s not clear “how to do it yet for the general public,” says Nathalie Pamir, a researcher who studies cardiology at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland.</p>



<h4>The impact of HDL cholesterol on heart health may differ by race</h4>



<p>As researchers work toward a fuller understanding of HDL and how it might be better used as a clinical measure, the view of HDL cholesterol as uniformly “good” is still out there. And one’s HDL cholesterol level is still one entry in a widely used calculator that estimates cardiovascular risk. Pamir and her colleagues wanted to examine what high and low HDL cholesterol levels mean in a contemporary, diverse population.</p>



<p>In the new study, the team analyzed data from the REGARDS trial, designed to study potential regional and racial differences in death from stroke in the United States. The study included nearly 24,000 participants — of which 42 percent were Black — who did not start out with coronary heart disease. Over roughly 10 years, 664 out of 10,095 Black participants and 951 out of 13,806 white participants had a heart attack or died from one.</p>



<p>Increased levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol were tied to a higher risk of coronary heart disease, in line with past research, the team found. But for HDL cholesterol, high levels weren’t protective for anyone, and low levels were only predictive of higher risk in white people. That finding suggests it may be necessary to revisit how HDL cholesterol is used in the cardiovascular disease risk calculator, Pamir says.</p>



<p>Rather than just good, HDL cholesterol “is complicated,” she says. If a patient has high HDL cholesterol, a doctor “can say, ‘well, currently we don’t know what that means.’”</p>



<p>Although the study suggests that the impact of HDL cholesterol levels on disease risk may differ by race, it’s important to remember that race is a social construct, not a biological one, says Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p>



<p>Some of the risk factors for coronary heart disease, including high blood pressure and smoking, “are more prevalent in self-described Black Americans,” he says. And a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-you-live-can-affect-your-blood-pressure-study-suggests">community’s access to health care, nutritious food and opportunities for education</a> and employment can influence those risk factors (<em>SN: 5/15/17</em>). “There is something unique about place and the history of place which may predispose to the burden of hypertension, obesity, even diabetes,” Yancy says.</p>



<p>It will take more research to understand what’s behind the potential race-based difference that the study reports, Yancy says, and what it means in terms of HDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk. But it remains the case that high levels of LDL cholesterol — which can accumulate in artery walls — are associated with an increased risk, he says. “The LDL cholesterol seems to be our most relevant barometer.”</p>



<p>For all that is known about what impacts cardiovascular disease risk, researchers still don’t have the full picture. The number of times that cardiologists see heart attacks in patients with normal cholesterol levels and normal blood pressure, Yancy says, suggests that, with current methods, “we’re not able to capture the entirety of the risk.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-green-pea-galaxies-universe">The James Webb telescope found ‘Green Pea’ galaxies in the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Galaxies that helped transform the early universe may have been small, round and green.</p>



<p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have spotted <a href="https://aas.org/sites/default/files/2023-01/AAS241_Mon1_JamesRhoads.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Green Pea” galaxies dating to 13.1 billion years ago</a>. These viridescent runts, spotted just 700 million years after the Big Bang, might have helped trigger one of the greatest makeovers in cosmic history, astronomers said at a January 9 news conference in Seattle at the American Astronomical Society’s annual meeting.</p>



<p>Green Peas first showed up in 2009 in images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, an ambitious project to map much of the sky. Citizen science volunteers gave the objects their colorful name. Their greenish hue is because most of their light comes from glowing gas clouds, rather than directly from stars.</p>





<p>These galaxies are rare in the present-day universe. Astronomers think that the ones that do exist are analogs of galaxies that were more plentiful in the early universe.</p>



<p>“They’re a bit like living fossils,” said astrophysicist James Rhoads of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “Coelacanths, if you will,” referencing a fish thought to be extinct until it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/find-extinct-fish-alive-south-african-waters">showed up off the coast of South Africa in 1938</a> (<em>SN: 12/2/11</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>These galaxies leak much more ultraviolet light, which can rip electrons from atoms, than typical galaxies do. So Green Peas dating to the universe’s first billion years or so could be partly responsible for a dramatic and mysterious cosmic transition called reionization, when most of the hydrogen atoms in the early universe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reionization-hydrogen-galaxies-big-bang">had their electrons torn away</a> (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Three ancient Green Peas turned up in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-galaxy-stars-data">JWST’s first image</a>, released in July 2022 (<em>SN: 7/21/22</em>). The objects look red in JWST’s infrared vision, but the wavelengths of light they emit are like those of the previously discovered Green Peas. The findings <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acaaaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were also published</a> in the Jan. 1 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“This helps us explain how the universe reionized,” Rhoads said. “I think this is an important piece of the puzzle.”</p>

<p>In the wake of a new law that bans “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and (or) preferences” in Russia, some journals have retracted articles they fear could attract state attention, a move a publishing watchdog in the country has called “self-censorship.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/28/russian-philosophy-journal-cites-law-banning-lgbt-propaganda-in-retraction/">we reported</a> in December, the Russian philosophy journal <em>Logos</em> retracted an article about lesbian fashion magazines for being “in violation of standards,” citing the new ban.</p>



<p>More journals have followed suit, according to the Russian Council on Publication Ethics, which <a href="https://publication-ethics.ru/2022/12/declaration-on-retraction-misuse-eng/">issued a statement</a> decrying “retraction misuse” by journals in response to the law, though it also expressed concern for the safety of journal staff and authors if they ignored it. The statement began: </p>



<span id="more-126381"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After 24 February 2022, a situation has arisen in Russia in which legal requirements and legal enforcement practices may directly conflict with the norms of academic freedom and scientific integrity.</p>



<p>In these circumstances, some Russian journals take the path of self-censorship by retracting articles whose publication (in the view of the editors) could lead to sanctions from the state. A new wave of such retractions is associated with the effect of Federal Law of Russia No. 217471-8 «On Amendments to the Federal Law ‘On Information, Information Technologies and the Protection of Information’ and Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation (as regards the prohibition of propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships and/or preferences)». The Council points out to the fact that scientific research may not be equated with propaganda and is bound to state that in these cases the retraction mechanism is used without convincing grounds. The purpose of retraction of scientific articles is to correct errors and reduce scientometric biases.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Part of the statement appeared to directly reference the reason <em>Logos</em> offered for the retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is important to understand that what the editorial boards occasionally call retraction is not retraction. Self-invented wording («Publication of research in violation of the standards», etc.) in fact turns out to be self-censorship. Such and similar actions (deletion, concealment, withdrawal of publications) are irrelevant to maintaining the ethics of scientific publications, the integrity of scientific knowledge, and good scientific practice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The retracted paper, “<a href="https://logosjournal.ru/upload/iblock/6bd/Logos%201-2022_Press-173-196.pdf">Looking good: The lesbian gaze and fashion imagery</a>,” appeared&nbsp; in a 2022 special issue of <em>Logos</em> on feminism and visuality. The article, by <a href="https://researchers.arts.ac.uk/579-reina-lewis/about">Reina Lewis</a> of the London College of Fashion, was a Russian translation of an article Lewis published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1057/fr.1997.6">the <em>Feminist Review</em></a> in 1997. Lewis told us she didn’t know the paper had been retracted until we emailed her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The translation still appears online, but the issue in which the paper appeared is no longer available on the journal’s website. An <a href="https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=48052624">entry</a> on the Russian database eLIBRARY indicates the article was retracted “due to the presence of signs that fall under the scope” of the new law, which carries significant fines for violations, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-parliament-passes-law-banning-lgbt-propaganda-among-adults-2022-11-24/">according to Reuters</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement from the Russian Council on Publication Ethics continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We believe that the safety of journal staff and authors and the continuation of scientific publications in the current circumstances are important, so we understand their compelled action, to the very desire to avoid reprisals, but not to the distortion of ethical principles and publication procedures.</p>



<p>In terms of international practice, in similar circumstances, publishers may be advised to refer to the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radbruch_formula">legal formula of Gustav Radbruch</a>.</p>



<p>The Council on Publications Ethics, together with foreign partners, is currently looking for options allowing Russian journals to resolve this difficult situation with dignity, and asks that no precipitate decisions be taken.</p>



<p>We ask everyone to consider that Article 54 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation states that the law establishing or aggravating liability has no retroactive force. No one can be held liable for an act which was not an offence at the time it was committed.</p>



<p>The Council deeply regrets this situation and is always ready to provide the necessary support.</p>

<p>An oral surgeon in Japan falsified images in several papers, granted authorship to whomever he saw fit and stored experimental data sloppily, according to an investigation by Showa University in Tokyo, where the physician was a lecturer at the time of the misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of the findings, the university has recommended retracting eight papers by the surgeon, Masayasu Iwase, according to a translation commissioned by Retraction Watch of a December <a href="https://www.showa-u.ac.jp/news/albums/abm.php?d=4820&amp;f=abm00039533.pdf&amp;n=%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%BB%E7%B5%90%E6%9E%9C%E6%A6%82%E8%A6%81.pdf">report</a> from the committee that investigated the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university also is discussing revoking the graduate degrees of two of Iwase’s former students whose dissertations were based on the &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; papers, the report explains.</p>



<p>Tadashi Hisamitsu, Showa’s president, <a href="https://www-showa--u-ac-jp.translate.goog/news/nid00004820.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">wrote</a> on the university&#8217;s website:</p>



<span id="more-126377"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I deeply regret that research misconduct was committed, and I deeply apologize for the loss of trust in research at the university. In the future, we will implement measures to prevent recurrence, such as thorough research ethics education, and the entire university will work to prevent recurrence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Iwase left academia in 2010. He served as chief of the Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery at Hakujikai Memorial General Hospital, also in Tokyo, and <a href="https://www-grace--dc-com.translate.goog/clinic/dental-hokuso/?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">still appears to be practicing</a> medicine at Grace Dental Medical Clinic Hokuso Branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The eight articles, about oral-cancer cell biology, were published between 2003 and 2011. The university did not reveal the identity of the papers when contacted by Retraction Watch, but <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Masayasu+Iwase">concerns have been raised</a> on PubPeer and <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/03/08/oral-oncology-at-showa-university/">elsewhere</a> about several of Iwase&#8217;s publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2021, the <em>International Journal of Cancer</em> issued <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.33825">an expression of concern</a> about one of them, noting that it had also contacted the university &#8220;but no investigation was initiated.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Showa report states that a preliminary committee was established on July 16, 2021, to investigate concerns raised by &#8220;a journal editor-in-chief&#8221; who had contacted the university the previous day.</p>



<p>The committee&#8217;s investigation focuses on papers based on research by four of Iwase&#8217;s then-graduate students. The students&#8217; experimental data were stored on a shared computer, the report notes, but Iwase:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>did not have a clear rule on how to save data. Therefore, when he used the data, he was unsure which data was from which experiment. He said the data management was sloppy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The studies used β-actin as a control for Western blotting:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>but Iwase did not consider it as important. So even though he was unsure about the link between the experiment and the β-actin image, he used it for the papers. As a result, the same image has been published in multiple papers as images of different experiments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report states that, at that time, another university instructor strictly emphasized the importance of the β-actin control to students, leading the committee to conclude that Iwase lacked &#8220;awareness of research integrity.&#8221;</p>



<p>The committee also asked a company specializing in image matching to check the images in the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company found that “what was described as different image data in the papers showed an extremely high matching rate,&#8221; leading to the conclusion that Iwase was guilty of &#8220;data falsification.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iwase, who, according to the report, &#8220;did not understand the authorship criteria at the time,&#8221; also appears to have wielded autocratic powers over which research was submitted for publication and who was listed as authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, when someone gave advice on experimental techniques or the contents of a paper, he made them an author; a person responsible for the graduate program was also made an author. &#8220;However, Iwase does not recall why he chose someone in another research group as an author,&#8221; the report states.</p>



<p>When one student proved unable to write his dissertation in English, as required by his supervisor, Iwase himself wrote and submitted papers based on the student&#8217;s work, without offering further guidance to the student. As a result, the student &#8220;could not complete&#8221; his dissertation, according to the investigators, who add:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Masayasu Iwase sometimes showed the manuscript draft to some of the authors, but he did not give authors opportunities to check the contents and he submitted [the papers] without their approval.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Iwase has been notified about the findings and has not contested them, according to the report, which does not identify any of the former students by name.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The committee doesn&#8217;t just point fingers at individuals, but also blames systemic issues at Showa University. During the period when the misconduct occurred, the institution &#8220;did not work hard&#8221; to promote research ethics and appropriate data management and authorship practices, the report states.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another Showa researcher, anesthesiologist Hironobu Ueshima, previously was found to have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/28/anesthesiology-researcher-guilty-of-misconduct-in-more-than-140-papers-investigation/">fabricated data and tinkered with authorship</a> in 142 papers.</p>



<p>Today, extensive ethics education is mandatory for both graduate students and faculty at the university, according to the report, and the school has established an explicit authorship policy. In 2016, Showa University also introduced a set of regulations to prevent research misconduct, and random checks are being done to ensure compliance.</p>



<p>We will update this post if we hear more from Showa University about which papers it recommends for retraction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-earth-mining-renewable-energy-future">Rare earth mining may be key to our renewable energy future. But at what cost?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In spring 1949, three prospectors armed with Geiger counters set out to hunt for treasure in the arid mountains of southern Nevada and southeastern California.</p>



<p>In the previous century, those mountains yielded gold, silver, copper and cobalt. But the men were looking for a different kind of treasure: uranium. The world was emerging from World War II and careening into the Cold War. The United States needed uranium to build its nuclear weapons arsenal. Mining homegrown sources became a matter of national security.</p>





<p>After weeks of searching, the trio hit what they thought was pay dirt. Their instruments detected intense radioactivity in brownish-red veins of ore exposed in a rocky outcrop within California’s Clark Mountain Range. But instead of uranium, the brownish-red stuff turned out to be bastnaesite, a mineral bearing fluorine, carbon and 17 curious elements known collectively as rare earths. Traces of radioactive thorium, also in the ore, had set the Geiger counters pinging.</p>



<p>As disappointing as that must have been, the bastnaesite still held value, and the prospectors sold their claim to the Molybdenum Corporation of America, later called Molycorp. The company was interested in mining the rare earths. During the mid-20th century, rare earth elements were becoming useful in a variety of ways: <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/58/cerium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cerium</a>, for example, was the basis for a glass-polishing powder and <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/63/europium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">europium</a> lent luminescence to recently invented color television screens and fluorescent lamps.</p>



<p>For the next few decades, the site, later dubbed Mountain Pass mine, was the world’s top source for rare earth elements, until two pressures became too much. By the late 1980s, China was intensively mining its own rare earths — and selling them at lower prices. And a series of toxic waste spills at Mountain Pass brought production at the struggling mine to a halt in 2002.</p>



<p>But that wasn’t the end of the story. The green-tech revolution of the 21st century brought new attention to Mountain Pass, which later reopened and remains the only U.S. mine for rare earths.</p>



<p>Rare earths are now integral to the manufacture of many carbon-neutral technologies — plus a whole host of tools that move the modern world. These elements are the building blocks of small, super­efficient permanent magnets that keep smartphones buzzing, wind turbines spinning, electric vehicles zooming and more.</p>

<h3>Rare earths’ journey from mine to magnet</h3>



<p>Here are the steps that get rare earth elements out of the ground and into our hi-tech products. While the United States mines and concentrates rare earths, later steps needed to make magnets currently happen overseas.</p>

<p>Mining U.S. sources of rare earth elements, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Joe Biden’s administration stated in February 2021</a>, is a matter of national security.</p>



<p>Rare earths are not actually rare on Earth, but they tend to be scattered throughout the crust at low concentrations. And the ore alone is worth relatively little without the complex, often environmentally hazardous processing involved in converting the ore into a usable form, says Julie Klinger, a geographer at the University of Delaware in Newark. As a result, the rare earth mining industry is wrestling with a legacy of environmental problems.</p>



<p>Rare earths are mined by digging vast open pits in the ground, which can contaminate the environment and disrupt ecosystems. When poorly regulated, mining can produce wastewater ponds filled with acids, heavy metals and radioactive material that might leak into groundwater. Processing the raw ore into a form useful to make magnets and other tech is a lengthy effort that takes large amounts of water and potentially toxic chemicals, and produces voluminous waste.</p>



<p>“We need rare earth elements … to help us with the transition to a climate-safe future,” says Michele Bustamante, a sustainability researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, D.C. Yet “everything that we do when we’re mining is impactful environmentally,” Bustamante says.</p>



<p>But there are ways to reduce mining’s footprint, says Thomas Lograsso, a metallurgist at the Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the director of the <a href="https://www.ameslab.gov/cmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Materials Institute</a>, a Department of Energy research center. Researchers are investigating everything from reducing the amount of waste produced during the ore processing to improving the efficiency of rare earth element separation, which can also cut down on the amount of toxic waste. Scientists are also testing alternatives to mining, such as recycling rare earths from old electronics or recovering them from coal waste.</p>



<p>Much of this research is in partnership with the mining industry, whose buy-in is key, Lograsso says. Mining companies have to be willing to invest in making changes. “We want to make sure that the science and innovations that we do are driven by industry needs, so that we’re not here developing solutions that nobody really wants,” he says.</p>



<p>Klinger says she’s cautiously optimistic that the rare earth mining industry can become less polluting and more sustainable, if such solutions are widely adopted. “A lot of gains come from the low-hanging fruit,” she says. Even basic hardware upgrades to improve insulation can reduce the fuel required to reach the high temperatures needed for some processing. “You do what you [can].”</p>



<h4>The environmental impact of rare earth mining</h4>



<p>Between the jagged peaks of California’s Clark range and the Nevada border sits a broad, flat, shimmering valley known as the Ivanpah Dry Lake. Some 8,000 years ago, the valley held water year-round. Today, like many such playas in the Mojave Desert, the lake is ephemeral, winking into appearance only after an intense rain and flash flooding. It’s a beautiful, stark place, home to endangered desert tortoises and rare desert plants like Mojave milkweed.</p>



<p>From about 1984 to 1998, the Ivanpah Dry Lake was also a holding pen for wastewater piped in from Mountain Pass. The wastewater was a by-product of chemical processing to concentrate the rare earth elements in the mined rock, making it more marketable to companies that could then extract those elements to make specific products. Via a buried pipeline, the mine sent wastewater to evaporation ponds about 23 kilometers away, in and around the dry lake bed.</p>

<p>The pipeline repeatedly ruptured over the years. At least 60 separate spills dumped an estimated 2,000 metric tons of wastewater containing radioactive thorium into the valley. Federal officials feared that local residents and visitors to the nearby Mojave National Preserve might be at risk of exposure to that thorium, which could lead to increased risk of lung, pancreatic and other cancers. </p>



<p>Unocal Corporation, which had acquired Molycorp in 1977, was ordered to clean up the spill in 1997, and the company paid over $1.4 million in fines and settlements. Chemical processing of the raw ore ground to a halt. Mining operations stopped shortly afterward.</p>



<p>Half a world away, another environmental disaster was unfolding. The vast majority — between 80 and 90 percent — of rare earth elements on the market since the 1990s have come from China. One site alone, the massive Bayan Obo mine in Inner Mongolia, accounted for 45 percent of rare earth production in 2019.</p>



<p>Bayan Obo spans some 4,800 hectares, about half the size of Florida’s Walt Disney World resort. It is also one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth. Clearing the land to dig for ore meant removing vegetation in an area already prone to desertification, allowing the Gobi Desert to creep southward.</p>



<p>In 2010, officials in the nearby city of Baotou noted that radioactive, arsenic- and fluorine-containing mine waste, or tailings, was being dumped on farmland and into local water supplies, as well as into the nearby Yellow River. The air was polluted by fumes and toxic dust that reduced visibility. Residents complained of nausea, dizziness, migraines and arthritis. Some had skin lesions and discolored teeth, signs of prolonged exposure to arsenic; others exhibited signs of brittle bones, indications of skeletal fluorosis, Klinger says.</p>



<p>The country’s rare earth industry was causing “severe damage to the ecological environment,” China’s State Council wrote in 2010. The release of heavy metals and other pollutants during mining led to “the destruction of vegetation and pollution of surface water, groundwater and farmland.” The “excessive rare earth mining,” the council wrote, led to landslides and clogged rivers.</p>



<p>Faced with these mounting environmental disasters, as well as fears that it was depleting its rare earth resources too rapidly, China slashed its export of the elements in 2010 by 40 percent. The new limits sent prices soaring and kicked off concern around the globe that China had too tight of a stranglehold on these must-have elements. That, in turn, sparked investment in rare earth mining elsewhere.</p>



<p>In 2010, there were few other places mining rare earths, with only minimal production from India, Brazil and Malaysia. <a href="https://lynasrareearths.com/about-us/locations/mt-weld-western-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new mine in remote Western Australia came online</a> in 2011, owned by mining company Lynas. The company dug into fossilized lava preserved within an ancient volcano called Mount Weld.</p>



<p>Mount Weld didn’t have anywhere near the same sort of environmental impact seen in China: Its location was too remote and the mine was just a fraction of the size of Bayan Obo, according to Saleem Ali, an environmental planner at the University of Delaware. The United States, meanwhile, was eager to once again have its own source of rare earths — and Mountain Pass was still the best prospect.</p>

<h4>Mountain Pass mine gets revived</h4>



<p>After the Ivanpah Dry Lake mess, the Mountain Pass mine changed hands again. Chevron purchased it in 2005, but did not resume operations. Then, in 2008, a newly formed company called Molycorp Minerals purchased the mine with ambitious plans to create a complete rare earth supply chain in the United States.</p>



<p>The goal was not just mining and processing ore, but also separating out the desirable elements and even manufacturing them into magnets. Currently, the separations and magnet manufacturing are done overseas, mostly in China. The company also proposed a plan to avoid spilling wastewater into nearby fragile habitats. Molycorp resumed mining, and introduced a “dry tailings” process — a method to squeeze 85 percent of the water out of its mine waste, forming a thick paste. The company would then store the immobilized, pasty residue in lined pits on its own land and recycle the water back into the facility.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Molycorp “was an epic debacle” from a business perspective, says Matt Sloustcher, senior vice president of communications and policy at <a href="https://mpmaterials.com/what-we-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP Materials</a>, current owner of Mountain Pass mine. Mismanagement ultimately led Molycorp to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015. MP Materials bought the mine in 2017 and resumed mining later that year. By 2022, Mountain Pass mine was producing 15 percent of the world’s rare earths.</p>



<p>MP Materials, too, has an ambitious agenda with plans to create a complete supply chain. And the company is determined not to repeat the mistakes of its predecessors. “We have a world-class … unbelievable deposit, an untapped potential,” says Michael Rosenthal, MP Materials’ chief operating officer. “We want to support a robust and diverse U.S. supply chain, be the magnetics champion in the U.S.”</p>



<h4>The challenges of separating rare earths</h4>



<p>On a hot morning in August, Sloustcher stands at the edge of the Mountain Pass mine, a giant hole in the ground, 800 meters across and up to 183 meters deep, big enough to be visible from space. It’s an impressive sight, and a good vantage point from which to describe a vision for the future. He points out the various buildings: where the ore is crushed and ground, where the ground rocks are chemically treated to slough off as much non–rare earth material as possible, and where the water is squeezed from that waste and the waste is placed into lined ponds.</p>



<p>The end result is a highly concentrated rare earth oxide ore — still nowhere near the magnet-making stage. But the company has a three-stage plan “to restore the full rare earth supply to the United States,” from “mine to magnet,” Rosenthal says. Stage 1, begun in 2017, was to restart mining, crushing and concentrating the ore. Stage 2 will culminate in the chemical separation of the rare earth elements. And stage 3 will be magnet production, he says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Sources of rare earth elements over time</h3>



<p>In the mid-20th century, the U.S. Mountain Pass mine was the world’s top source for rare earth oxides. China began to dominate global production in the 1990s. In the last decade, the return of Mountain Pass along with the opening of Australia’s Mount Weld and production in Myanmar, Brazil and other locations have begun to shift that balance.</p>

<p>Since coming online in 2017, MP Materials has shipped its concentrated ore to China for the next steps, including the arduous, hazardous process of separating the elements from one another. But in November, the company announced to investors that it had <a href="https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-third-quarter-2022-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begun the preliminary steps for stage 2, a “major milestone”</a> on the way to realizing its mine-to-magnet ambitions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With investments from the U.S. Department of Defense</a>, the company is building two separations facilities. One plant will pull out lighter rare earth elements — those with smaller atomic numbers, including neodymium and praseodymium, both of which are key ingredients in the permanent magnets that power electric vehicles and many consumer electronics. MP Materials has additional grant money from the DOD to design and build a second processing plant to split apart the heavier rare earth elements such as dysprosium, also an ingredient in magnets, and yttrium, used to make superconductors and lasers.</p>



<p>Like stage 2, stage 3 is already under way. In 2022, the company broke ground in Fort Worth, Texas, for a facility to produce neodymium magnets. And it inked a deal with General Motors to supply those magnets for electric vehicle motors.</p>



<p>But separating the elements comes with its own set of environmental concerns.</p>



<p>The process is difficult and leads to lots of waste. Rare earth elements are extremely similar chemically, which means they tend to stick together. Forcing them apart requires multiple sequential steps and a variety of powerful solvents to separate them one by one. Caustic sodium hydroxide causes cerium to drop out of the mix, for example. Other steps involve solutions containing organic molecules called ligands, which have a powerful thirst for metal atoms. The ligands can selectively bind to particular rare earth elements and pull them out of the mix.</p>



<p>But one of the biggest issues plaguing this extraction process is its inefficiency, says Santa Jansone-Popova, an organic chemist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The scavenging of these metals is slow and imperfect, and companies have to go through a lot of extraction steps to get a sufficiently marketable amount of the elements. With the current chemical methods, “you need many, many, many stages in order to achieve the desired separation,” Jansone-Popova says. That makes the whole process “more complex, more expensive, and [it] produces more waste.”</p>



<p>Under the aegis of the DOE’s Critical Materials Institute, Jansone-Popova and her colleagues have been hunting for a way to make the process more efficient, eliminating many of those steps. In 2022, the researchers identified a ligand that they say is much more efficient at snagging certain rare earths than the ligands now used in the industry. Industry partners are on board to try out the new process this year, she says.</p>



<p>In addition to concerns about heavy metals and other toxic materials in the waste, there are lingering worries about the potential impacts of radioactivity on human health. The trouble is that there is still only limited epidemiological evidence of the impact of rare earth mining on human and environmental health, according to Ali, and much of that evidence is related to the toxicity of heavy metals such as arsenic. It’s also not clear, he says, how much of the concerns over radioactive waste are scientifically supported, due to the low concentration of radioactive elements in mined rare earths.</p>



<p>Such concerns get international attention, however. In 2019, protests erupted in Malaysia over what activists called “a mountain of toxic waste,” about 1.5 million metric tons, produced by a rare earth separation facility near the Malaysian city of Kuantan. The facility is owned by Lynas, which ships its rare earth ore from Australia’s Mount Weld to the site. To dissolve the rare earths, the ore is cooked with sulfuric acid and then diluted with water. The residue that’s left behind can contain traces of radioactive thorium.</p>

<p>Lynas had no permanent storage for the waste, piling it up in hills near Kuantan instead. But the alarm over the potential radioactivity in those hills may be exaggerated, experts say. Lynas reports that workers at the site are exposed to less than 1.05 millisieverts per year, far below the radiation exposure threshold for workers of 20 millisieverts set by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of misinformation about by­products such as thorium.… The thorium from rare earth processing is actually very low-level radiation,” Ali says. “As someone who has been a committed environmentalist, I feel right now that there’s not much science-based decision making on these things.”</p>



<p>Given the concerns over new mining, environmental think tanks like the World Resources Institute have been calling for more recycling of existing rare earth materials to reduce the need for new mining and processing.</p>



<p>“The path to the future has to do with getting the most out of what we take out of the ground,” says Bustamante, of the NRDC. “Ultimately the biggest lever for change is not in the mining itself, but in the manufacturing, and what we do with those materials at the end of life.”</p>



<p>That means using mined resources as efficiently as possible, but also recycling rare earths out of already existing materials. Getting more out of these materials can reduce the overall environmental impacts of the mining itself, she adds. </p>



<p>That is a worthwhile goal, but recycling isn’t a silver bullet, Ali says. For one thing, there aren’t enough spent rare earth–laden batteries and other materials available at the moment for recycling. “Some mining will be necessary, [because] right now we don’t have the stock.” And that supply problem, he adds, will only grow as demand increases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-easier-catch-cold-flu-covid-winter">Why it’s easier to catch a cold, the flu or COVID in the winter</a></h4>

              
                <p>When bitter winds blew and temperatures dropped, my grandmother would urge me to come inside. “You’ll catch your death of cold out there,” she’d say.</p>



<p>Sure, freezing to death is possible in frigid temperatures. But doctors and other health experts have long stressed that <em>being</em> cold won’t give you a cold. Still, winter is undisputedly cold-and-flu season. It’s also a period when COVID-19 spreads more.</p>



<p>But if the chill doesn’t matter, why does the spread of so many respiratory viruses peak during the season?</p>





<p>“I’ve spent the past 13 years looking into this question,” says Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who studies viruses in the air. “The deeper we go, the more I realize we don’t know [and] the more there is to figure out.”</p>



<p>She and I are not alone. “That wintertime seasonality has puzzled people for a very long time; thousands of years, to be honest,” says Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious diseases researcher who directs the Climate and Health Program at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.</p>



<p>There is some evidence that winter’s shorter days may make people more susceptible to infection, he says. Less sunlight means people make less vitamin D, which is required for some immune responses. But that’s just one piece of the puzzle.</p>



<p>Scientists are also looking at what other factors may play a role in making winter a sickening season.</p>



<h4>Illness may spread more inside.</h4>



<p>My grandma’s well-intentioned urging to come in from the cold may have instead increased the risk that I’d get sick.</p>





<p>Colds, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, are all illnesses that are more prevalent at certain times of year when people spend more time inside. That includes winter in temperate climates, where there are distinct seasons, and rainy seasons in tropical zones. COVID-19 also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">spreads more indoors</a> than outside (<em>SN: 6/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>Those diseases are caused by viruses that are transmitted primarily through <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breathing in small droplets known as aerosols</a>. That’s a change in thinking. Many scientists thought until very recently that such viruses were spread mainly by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronvirus-covid-airborne-public-health-agencies">touching contaminated surfaces</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/21</em>).</p>



<p>“When you’re outdoors, you’re in the ultimate well-ventilated space,” says David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Viruses exhaled outside are diluted quickly with clean air.</p>



<p>But inside, aerosols and the viruses they contain can build up. “When you’re in a poorly ventilated space, the air you breathe in is often air that other people have breathed out,” he says.</p>



<p>Since viruses come along with that exhaled breath, “it makes a lot of sense that proximity to individuals who might be contagious would facilitate transmission,” Shaman says.</p>



<p>But there is more to the story, says Benjamin Bleier, a specialist for sinus and nasal disorders at Harvard Medical School.</p>



<p>“In modern society, we’re indoors all year round,” he says.</p>



<p>To drive the seasonal pattern we see year after year, something else must be going on too to make people more susceptible to infection and increase the amount of virus circulating, he says.</p>



<h4>Drier air can give some viruses a boost.</h4>



<p>Some viruses thrive in winter. But the reason why may not be so much about temperature, but humidity.</p>



<p>“There are some viruses that like it warm and wet, and some viruses like it dry and cold,” says Donald Milton, an aerobiologist at the University of Maryland School of Public Health in College Park. For instance, rhinoviruses — one of the many types of viruses that cause colds — survive better when it is humid. Cases of rhinovirus infection typically peak in early fall, he says.</p>



<p>Marr and other researchers have found that viruses that surge in the winter, including influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 — the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — survive best when the relative humidity in the air falls below about 40 percent.</p>



<p>Viruses aren’t usually floating around naked, Marr says. They are encased in droplets of fluid, such as saliva. Those droplets also have bits of mucus, proteins, salt and other substances in them. Those other components may determine if the virus survives drying.</p>



<p>When the humidity is higher, droplets dry slowly. Such <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501658v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow drying kills viruses</a> such as influenza A and SARS-CoV-2, Marr and colleagues reported July 27 in a preprint at&nbsp;bioRxiv.org. During slow drying, salt and other things that may harm the virus become more concentrated, although researchers still don’t fully understand what’s happening at the molecular scale to inactivate the virus.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;flash drying in parched air preserves&nbsp;those viruses. “If the air is very dry, the water quickly evaporates. Everything is dried down, and it’s almost like things are frozen in place,” Marr says.</p>

<h3>How humidity affects airborne droplets</h3>



<p>At low humidity levels, airborne droplets, or aerosols, dry quickly (left), preserving viruses under a feathery crystalline lattice, as this microscope image shows. At intermediate humidity levels, crystals form inside liquid droplets (middle), but those crystals may inactivate viruses, not preserve them. At high humidity levels (right), aerosols remain liquid, allowing viruses to survive better than at midlevel humidity. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dryer, smaller aerosols are also more buoyant and may hang in the air longer, increasing the chance that someone will breathe them in, Fisman says.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, dry air can tear down some of people’s defenses against viruses. Studies in animals suggest that <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dry air can trigger death of some cells</a> lining the airways. That could leave cracks where viruses can invade.</p>



<p>Mucus in the airways can trap viruses and help protect against infection. But breathing cold, dry air can also slow the system that usually moves mucus out of the body. That may give viruses time to break out of the mucus trap and invade cells, Fisman says.</p>



<h4>Cold may harm our ability to fight off viruses.</h4>



<p>Being cold may not give you a cold, but it could make you more susceptible to catching one.</p>



<p>Normally, the immune system has a trick for warding off viruses, Bleier and colleagues recently discovered. Cells in the nose and elsewhere in the body are studded with surface proteins that can detect viruses. When one of these sensor proteins sees a virus coming, it signals the cell to release tiny bubbles called extracellular vesicles.</p>



<p>The bubbles work as a diversionary tactic, a bit like chaff being released from a military jet trying to avoid a heat-seeking missile, Bleier says. Viruses may go after the vesicles instead of infecting cells.</p>



<p>If a virus docks with one of the bubbles, it’s in for a surprise: Inside the vesicles are virus-killing bits of RNA called microRNAs. One of those microRNAs known as <em>miR-17</em> could kill two types of rhinoviruses and a cold-causing coronavirus, the team reported December 6 in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</em>.</p>

<h3>How cold weather affects the immune system</h3>



<p>The immune system has a diversionary tactic to keep viruses from infecting cells in the nose:&nbsp;When viruses (black and gray spheres) are detected, nasal cells&nbsp;release bubbles called extracellular vesicles (blue circles). These bubbles are studded with proteins (red, blue and black shapes on blue circles) that are normally found on the surface of nasal cells. Viruses may go after the bubbles instead of infecting cells. When temperatures in the nose drop below body temperature (right), cells release fewer bubbles, making it easier for viruses to find and infect nasal cells.</p>

<p>Researchers measured bubbles released from human nasal cells grown in lab dishes at 37° Celsius, our typical body temperature. Then the scientists lowered the thermostat to 32° C. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cells released about 42 percent fewer vesicles</a> at the cooler temperature, the team found. What’s more, those vesicles carried fewer weapons. Vesicles can pack in about 24 percent more microRNA at body temperature than when it is cooler.</p>



<h4>Three tips to bolster our immune system.</h4>



<p>I asked the experts what people can do to protect themselves from viruses in the winter. Some said using a humidifier might help raise moisture levels enough to slow the drying of virus-laden droplets, killing the viruses.</p>



<p>“Any increase in humidity should be beneficial,” says Shaman. “You get a lot of bang for your buck if you go from very dry to dry.”</p>



<p>But Milton doesn’t think it’s a good idea to pump a lot of moisture into a house when it is cold outside. “That humidity is going to find all of the cold spaces in your house and condense there,” creating a breeding ground for mold and rot, he says.</p>



<p>Instead, he advocates turning on kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans to increase ventilation and to use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-home-coronavirus-isolation-filter-transmission">HEPA filters or Corsi-Rosenthal boxes</a> to filter unwanted viruses out of the air (<em>SN: 7/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Bleier suggests wearing a mask. Not only can masks filter out viruses, but “our work suggests these masks have a second mechanism of action,” he says. “They keep a cushion of warm [moist] air in front of our noses, which could help bolster the immune system.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/methylated-gases-indicator-alien-life">Methylated gases could be an unambiguous indicator of alien life</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SEATTLE</strong> — Attention alien hunters: If you want to find life on distant planets, try looking for signs of toxic chemical cleanup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gases that organisms produce as they tidy up their environments <a href="https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAS241/Itinerary/PresentationDetail.aspx?evdid=1687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could provide clear signs of life on planets orbiting other stars</a>, researchers announced January 9 at the American Astronomical Society meeting. All we need to do to find hints of alien life is to look for those gases in the atmospheres of those exoplanets, in images coming from the James Webb Space Telescope or other observatories that could come online soon.</p>





<p>Barring an interstellar radio broadcast, the chemistry of a remote planet is one of the more promising ways that researchers could detect extraterrestrial life. On Earth, life produces lots of chemicals that alter the atmosphere: Plants churn out oxygen, for example, and a host of animals and plants release methane. Life elsewhere in the galaxy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-habitable-new-type-hycean-search-extraterrestrial-life-aliens">might do the same thing</a>, leaving a chemical signature humans could detect from afar (<em>SN: 9/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>But many of life’s gases are also released in processes that have nothing to do with life at all. Their detection could lead to the false impression of a living planet in a faraway solar system, when it’s really just a sterile rock.</p>



<p>At least one type of compound that some organisms produce to protect themselves from toxic elements, however, might provide unambiguous indications of life.</p>



<p>The life-affirming compounds are called methylated gases. Microbes, fungi, algae and plants are among the terrestrial organisms that create the chemicals by linking carbon and hydrogen atoms to toxic materials such as chlorine or bromine. The resulting compounds evaporate, sweeping the deadly elements away.</p>



<p>The fact that living creatures almost always have a hand in making methylated gases means the presence of the compounds in a planet’s atmosphere would be a strong sign of life of some kind, planetary astrobiologist Michaela Leung of the University of California, Riverside said at the meeting.</p>



<p>The same isn’t true of oxygen and methane. Oxygen, in particular, can accumulate when a hot star warms a planet’s oceans. “You have a steam atmosphere, and the [ultraviolet] radiation from the star splits up the water” into its constituent parts, oxygen and hydrogen, Leung says. Hydrogen is light, so much of it is lost to space on small planets. “What you have left is all of this oxygen,” which, she says, leads to “really convincing oxygen signals in this process that at no point involved life.” </p>



<p>Similarly, while living organisms produce methane in abundance, lifeless geological phenomena like volcanoes do too.</p>





<p>At the concentrations of methylated gases typical of Earth, these gases will be hard to see in the atmospheres of distant planets, even with an instrument <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-small-far-planets-space">as powerful as the Webb telescope</a> (<em>SN: 12/20/22</em>). But Leung has reason to believe there may be planets where the gas abundance is thousands of times that of Earth.</p>



<p>“The most productive environments [for releasing methylated gases] that we see here on Earth,” she says, “are things like estuaries and wetlands.” A watery planet with lots of small continents and correspondingly more coastline, for example, could be packed with organisms cleaning away toxic chemicals with methylated gases.</p>



<p>One of the benefits of looking for the compounds as a sign of life is that it doesn’t require that the life resembles anything like what we have on our planet. “Maybe it’s not DNA-based, maybe it has other weird chemistry going on,” Leung says. But by assuming chlorine and bromine are likely to be toxic generally, methylated gases offer what Leung calls an agnostic biosignature, which can tell us that something is alive on a planet even if it’s utterly alien to us.</p>



<p>“The more signs of life we know to look for, then the better our chances of recognizing life when we do encounter it,” says Vikki Meadows, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved with the study. “It also helps us understand what kind of telescopes we should build, what we should look for and what the instrument requirements should be. Michaela’s work is really important for that reason.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-lung-infections-questions-symptoms-treatment">4 key things to know about lung infections caused by fungi</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some fungi that can cause serious lung infections have spread to many parts of the United States. A <em>Science News</em> story on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">expanded range of <em>Histoplasma</em>, <em>Coccidioides</em> and <em>Blastomyces</em> fungi</a> hit a nerve with a lot of readers (<em>SN: 1/4/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>They asked about the symptoms, treatments and testing for these fungal diseases. Some, like Judy Knudsen, whose husband Jack died from a <em>Histoplasma </em>infection in 2020, also wrote to share their own experiences with fungal infections. Others wanted to learn more about the fungi themselves.</p>





<p>I went back to Andrej Spec, a mycologist and infectious diseases doctor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis whose team published the new range maps, for answers.</p>



<p>Spec and his colleagues are studying what has caused the fungi to spread and factors that may contribute to people getting sick. Those include changes to climate, weather patterns, extreme weather events like wildfires and floods, and even migration patterns of animals.</p>



<h4>How do you catch these fungal infections?</h4>



<p>People generally get infected by inhaling fungal spores released during the fungi’s normal life cycle. Human activities that disturb the soil where these fungi typically live — such as farming, gardening, construction, road work or archaeology — can also stir up dust and spores.</p>



<p>Besides soil, bird droppings and bat guano can be sources for <em>Histoplasma.</em> The fungi can infect bats and grow in the animals’ intestines. Birds don’t usually carry the fungus because birds’ body temperatures are typically around 39° Celsius to 42° C (102° Fahrenheit to 107° F). “They’re too hot for <em>Histo</em>, but their droppings are perfectly suited to grow” the fungus, Spec says.</p>



<p>The highest risk to people comes when bird and bat droppings have dried out. “People will try and sweep [the droppings], and then you kick up all that dust and inhale it.” Instead of sweeping, Spec advises, “hose it down and shovel it off.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Wearing a mask can also help limit exposure. “Especially if you’re immunosuppressed, wear a mask.”</p>





<p>It is possible for the fungi to get into a cut or scrape and start an infection in the skin, but those cases are very rare, Spec says. And people generally can’t pass the infection on to others, except in very rare cases in which an infected person has donated an organ or other body tissue, he says.</p>



<h4>What happens in the body?</h4>



<p>These three types of fungi are known as dimorphic fungi because they have two forms. In the soil, where they normally grow, they are molds. But at 37° C — human body temperature — they shape-shift into yeast, which can grow rapidly and spread more easily in the body.</p>



<p>When a person inhales the fungal spores, the fungi can infect the lungs where conditions are right for it to transform. People with healthy immune systems may have no symptoms or may develop mild flulike symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, chills and body aches. People with <a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/coccidioidomycosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coccidiomycosis</a> — the disease caused by <em>Coccidioides —</em> may also get a rash on their legs or upper body.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How some fungi can make you sick</h3>



<p><em>Histoplasma, Blastomyces</em> and <em>Coccidioides</em> fungi live in the soil as molds. Sometimes people breathe in spores the fungi give off as part of their natural life cycle. In the lungs, the fungi can transform into a quick-growing yeast form and cause a flulike illness, pneumonia or chronic disease. In a small number of cases, the fungi can spread to other parts of the body and cause more serious disease.</p>

<p>The symptoms can take time to appear. People with <a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/histoplasmosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">histoplasmosis</a> — the disease caused by <em>Histoplasma</em> — can develop symptoms between three and 17 days after exposure. Symptoms of coccidiomycosis — also known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley Fever</a> — appear between one and three weeks after breathing in the spores. But it can take three weeks to three months for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/blastomycosis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blastomycosis</a> — caused by <em>Blastomyces</em> — symptoms to start.</p>



<p>Mild cases usually clear up on their own in a few weeks to a few months. But some people may have lingering symptoms, especially if the infection becomes severe.</p>



<p>In 2019, more than 20,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with coccidiomycosis, 1,124 people had confirmed or probable cases of histoplasmosis and there were 240 cases of confirmed or probable blastomycosis, according to cases reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s probably an undercount, given that mild cases likely aren’t reported and the infections can easily be misdiagnosed as more common lung diseases, the researchers say. But of the reported cases, more than half of people diagnosed with histoplasmosis and blastomycosis were hospitalized. About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/ss/ss7107a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 percent of histoplasmosis patients died</a>. So did 9 percent of those with blastomycosis.</p>



<p>Some people may develop severe or chronic pneumonia. And in a small number of people, the infections may spread to other parts of the body. <em>Histoplasma</em> “likes to go after our liver and spleen, our bone marrow &#8230; adrenal glands &#8230; and our intestines,” Spec says.</p>



<p><em>Blastomyces</em> tends to spread to bones and joints. It may also spread to the brain where it can cause an abscess.</p>



<p><em>Coccidioides</em> spreads in a pattern similar to <em>Blastomyces</em>, targeting bones, joints, skin and the brain. But instead of creating a brain abscess, the fungi cause meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</p>



<p>“That’s with you forever if it spreads to your brain,” Spec says. “You can’t get rid of <em>Cocci</em>.” Doctors can manage the brain infection with antifungal drugs and give other medications to help with symptoms.</p>



<p>Antifungal drugs can clear most other infections. “If caught early, most people do exceedingly well,” he says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Warning signs</h3>



<p>Symptoms of all three fungal diseases caused by <em>Histoplasma, Coccidioides</em> and <em>Blastomyces</em> fungi are similar and can resemble the flu or other lung infections. Signs of a fungal lung infection may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fever</li>



<li>Cough</li>



<li>Fatigue</li>



<li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>



<li>Weight loss</li>



<li>Headache</li>



<li>Chills</li>



<li>Muscle or joint pain or body aches</li>



<li>Shortness of breath</li>



<li>Night sweats for people with <em>Blastomyces</em> or <em>Coccidioides </em>infections</li>
</ul>
</div>



<h4>Who is most affected by these fungal infections?</h4>



<p>People who have weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms and severe disease.</p>



<p>And fungal infections and severe disease occur more often in men than women. About 70 percent of <em>Blastomyces</em> infections, 52 percent of <em>Coccidioides</em> cases and 56 percent of <em>Histoplasma</em> infections were in males, the 2019 CDC survey found.</p>



<p>Why males are more affected isn’t entirely clear. Some people have speculated that men tend to have more outdoor jobs and hobbies that would expose them to dirt and thus more fungi.</p>



<p>It’s not clear how Jack Knudsen became infected. “We have no earthly idea why this came up,” says Judy, 82, of Oklahoma City. Already battling chronic lymphocytic leukemia, heart problems and diabetes, Jack’s immune system wasn’t up to tackling the fungus. “He struggled,” she says.</p>



<p>He spent two weeks in the hospital getting antifungal drugs intravenously. He also took four doses a day of a liquid antifungal medication called itraconazole for the rest of his life. He died on January 23, 2020, at age 79. “We had 61 good years together,” Judy says.</p>



<p>There may be biological reasons for the male-female skew. A recent study of coccidiomycosis found that the sex difference was also present in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/9/3/ofab543/6529267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonhuman primates and in dogs</a>. “There’s very little difference between occupational exposures and hobbies between male and female” animals, says Spec, who was not involved in that study. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers found no difference in infection rates in humans up to age 19. After that, the infection rate for males held steady. But female’s infection rate dropped, Ian McHardy, a microbiologist and immunologist at Scripps Health in San Diego, and colleagues reported in the March 2022 <em>Open Forum Infectious Diseases.</em> That might mean that estrogen and other hormones that are usually at higher levels in females may protect against fungal infections. But that link is still speculation.</p>

<p>See how the ranges of <em>Histoplasma, Blastomyces</em> and <em>Coccidioides</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">have changed</a> in the United States from 1950 to today. </p>
</div>



<p>Curiously, people of Filipino or African heritage may be at increased risk of developing more severe forms of Valley Fever. The reason is unknown. Other people, including those who are pregnant, living with HIV/AIDS or who have weakened immune systems from other causes are also at higher risk of more severe disease from all three fungi. So are people with diabetes and those who are older.</p>



<h4>How can I find out if my infection is caused by a fungus?</h4>



<p>Because symptoms of the fungal infections so closely resemble other illnesses, it can be hard to diagnose fungal disease, Spec says.</p>



<p>Jack Knudsen started having seizures in 2018, Judy says. At first, doctors thought he had epilepsy, but medications to treat the disorder had no effect. When one side of his face began to droop, an MRI and other tests revealed that Jack had <em>Histoplasma</em> in his brain. “I had never heard of it in my life,” says Judy, who said she wanted to share her husband’s story to make people more aware of the disease.</p>



<p>Blood or urine tests can be used to diagnose a fungal infection. Chest X-rays or CT scans may also be used. In some cases, doctors may need take a small amount of body tissue or fluids to test for the fungi.</p>



<p>“A lot of people who think they have [a fungal infection] are probably going not to have it.” Spec says. “It’s a disease that is certainly more common than people think but is still relatively rare.”&nbsp; The new maps Spec and colleagues compiled may make doctors and other people more aware that the fungal diseases may be present where they live.</p>



<p>People who are concerned that they may have a fungal infection can visit <a href="https://mycoses.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mycoses.org</a> where Spec and colleagues have assembled interactive maps showing where the fungi are found. “You’ll be able to see [based on] where you live which one you’re at risk for. When you have that data, your best goal is to talk to a doctor for testing.”</p>



<p>Any doctor can order a test, but infectious diseases specialists may have more expertise with the fungal diseases, he says.</p>

                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> — More than electricity can illuminate a thundercloud.</p>



<p>Brilliant bursts of gamma radiation, known as dark lightning or terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, also explode in lightning storms. And on rare occasions, those powerful blasts — the most energetic radiation to naturally arise on Earth — might even <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1071231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike a passing airplane</a>, researchers reported December 13 at the American Geophysical Union meeting. The zap could briefly expose passengers to unsafe levels of radiation.</p>



<p>First <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.264.5163.1313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in 1994</a>, dark lightning is estimated to flash <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgra.50205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around the world about a thousand times each day</a>. But scientists have only a hazy understanding of how it initiates. They generally agree dark lightning is sparked by the electric fields generated by thunderstorms and lightning bolts. These fields can spur electrons to velocities approaching the speed of light, amassing breakneck electron avalanches. When the streaming particles smash into airborne atoms, gamma radiation is unleashed.</p>





<p>Dark lightning often occurs around 10 to 15 kilometers high in the sky, altitudes frequented by airlines. The new analysis combines dark lightning observations and airline routes to suggest that dark lightning might strike near a plane around once every 1 to 4 years, atmospheric scientist Mélody Pallu said at the meeting. However, that’s probably “an upper limit of the real probability,” or even 10 times the actual rate, she said, largely because the calculations didn’t factor in pilots’ avoidance of thunderstorms.</p>



<p>Previous computer simulations have revealed that passengers flying within 200 meters of a strong terrestrial gamma-ray flash’s initiation point may become exposed to radiation doses <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exceeding 0.3 sieverts</a>, said Pallu, now at the Astroparticle and Cosmology Laboratory in Paris. Such levels would surpass the occupational safety level of <a href="https://remm.hhs.gov/ICRP_guidelines.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.02 sieverts</a> per year put forth by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.</p>



<p>Though somewhat nebulous, the findings make one thing clear: Further investigations are needed to figure out how dark lightning impacts passengers flying through the sky.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-languishing-psychology-covid">Pandemic languishing is a thing. But is it a privilege?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Languishing. The term captured the zeitgeist in April 2021 when organizational psychologist Adam Grant penned an article in the <em>New York Times </em>titled, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s a name for the blah you’re feeling: It’s called languishing.</a>”</p>



<p>“Languishing is the neglected middle child of mental health. It’s the void between depression and flourishing — the absence of well-being,” wrote Grant, of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>The idea struck a chord with readers, and Grant’s ode to languishing went on to become the newspaper’s most read article of the year. Even I, generally suspicious of fads, felt the idea’s lure. Yes, I thought to myself, that explains a lot.</p>





<p>But I began to question my gut reaction to Grant’s piece after stumbling across <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/ssm-mental-health/special-issue/10NZQCCD255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several articles on flourishing</a> in the December <em>SSM-Mental Health </em>— all part of a series spearheaded by medical anthropologist Sarah Willen.</p>



<p>The study of how and why people flourish anchors a subfield of psychology known as positive psychology and includes related areas of research into happiness, well-being and resilience. In this research, flourishing refers to an optimal state of mental well-being, where one is happy, satisfied with life and has a sense of purpose.</p>



<p>Positive psychologists tend to believe that anyone can flourish if they just try hard enough, says Willen, of the University of Connecticut in Storrs. Consequently, she says, these researchers tend to downplay systemic barriers to flourishing, such as those related to race or class.</p>



<p>Positive psychologists “presume that people have a good measure of control over what they are able to do in life,” Willen says. But her own research, and that of others, shows that societal forces limit that control for many people.</p>



<p>In one article in the<em> SSM-Mental Health</em> series, Willen zooms in on Grant’s column to argue that its languishing framing speaks to the privileged few, and illustrates how the elite and powerful often capture the narrative during historic moments while <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560322000688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliding the lived experience</a> of people lower on the social totem pole.</p>



<h4>The rise of positive psychology</h4>





<p>Positive psychology is a relatively young field. In the late 1990s, when psychologist Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania took over as president of the American Psychological Association, he sought to reverse the field’s traditional focus on mental illness and focus instead on mental well-being. Since that time, positive psychology has emerged as a leading paradigm for research into mental health, writes Willen in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560321000451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her introduction</a> to the mental health series.</p>



<p>The field has garnered enormous public and private investments: The Templeton Foundation, for example, currently funds the Global Flourishing Study, a $43.4 million initiative at Harvard University that will look at flourishing across time among 240,000 participants from 22 countries.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the study of human flourishing and its effects has permeated well beyond psychology research. The concept now shows up frequently in research on <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0749379721002762?token=1F2AC1EB34681716B155EB2AD905D2D6B08E55E0837AE4FA9BBF18F57B8BF5844CC8C66AA567D00A690CCACA93007B95&amp;originRegion=us-east-1&amp;originCreation=20221220211812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preventive medicine and physical health</a>, and in K-12 schools through what’s known as <a href="https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/posedseligmanadler.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive education</a>, where, the idea goes, positive schools and positive teachers who “transmit optimism, trust and a hopeful sense of the future … are the fulcrum for producing more well-being in a culture.”</p>



<p>But some researchers remain skeptical of positive psychology. For one, the field largely emphasizes individual-level — not societal — changes to help people flourish, such as practicing gratitude and volunteering. That risks reducing the study of flourishing to simple self-help tricks, Willen says. What’s more, this individualized view of flourishing helps fuel the incredibly powerful and profitable self-help industry, say Willen and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Positive psychology is a billion-dollar industry, and selling positivity as they do is incredibly lucrative and culturally seductive,” says Oksana Yakushko, a practicing psychologist in Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>



<p>But, she says, the field ignores many people’s realities. “I am troubled by the socio-political implications of selling this positive psychology ideology in a world where human beings are consistently abused, traumatized, and stressed because they are not white, wealthy, able-bodied, Western, heterosexual, etc.”</p>



<h4>What does it mean to flourish?</h4>



<p>With positive psychology capturing money and attention, Willen began thinking a few years ago about how to push back against the movement. Decades of research into public health have made clear that thriving in life depends at least as much on a person’s environment and circumstances as their individual attributes, she says. “There are times in life when you feel like you just have to say something. It feels really important [to] bring a perspective from another discipline.”</p>



<p>So from 2018 to 2019, Willen and her team conducted a qualitative study of flourishing in Cleveland. Their 167-person pool of participants reflected the city’s economic and racial diversity. The team sought to understand how people conceived of flourishing through a series of open-ended questions beginning with: “Would you describe yourself as someone who’s flourishing at this point in your life? Why or why not?”</p>



<p>Roughly half of the participants said they were flourishing, the team reported in the December <em>SSM-Mental Health.</em> But the researchers also identified <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560321000578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stark racial and socioeconomic disparities</a> in those responses.</p>



<p>Sixty-seven percent of white respondents felt they were flourishing compared with 48 percent of Black respondents. Similarly, 88 percent of respondents with incomes over $100,000 reported flourishing compared with 46 percent of respondents with incomes below $30,000.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A recipe for thriving</h3>



<p>U.S. researchers asked 167 Midwesterners to identify factors key to flourishing. Of the top six, four (blue) are generally included in existing indices of flourishing used by positive psychologists. But over two-thirds of people identified two factors, a stable income and one’s environment (gray), that aren’t generally included. Environment, which the researchers called “social determinants of health,” includes access to food, education and safe neighborhoods. As a result, positive psychologists miss crucial material or structural circumstances that contribute to people’s well-being, the researchers say.</p>

<p>The team’s findings in response to another question — “What do people need, in general, to flourish?”— illuminated how participants’ understanding of flourishing often veered away from that of positive psychologists.</p>



<p>Positive psychologists tend to define someone as flourishing if they report having generally positive relationships and emotions, meaning and purpose in their life, self-acceptance or high self-esteem and deep engagement in their life’s activities. Among participants in Willen’s study, such relationships and feeling good about oneself were important to flourishing, but meaning and purpose showed up less frequently.</p>



<p>Most crucially, the participants in the study mentioned two aspects of flourishing that rarely figure into positive psychologists’ definitions of the term: Stable income and strong social determinants of health. The latter includes access to food, housing, education and safe neighborhoods while also experiencing low levels of discrimination.</p>



<p>If policy makers’ goal is to help as many people flourish as possible, then initiatives should focus on reducing inequality and mitigating those systemic barriers to well-being rather than more individualized measures, Willen says.</p>



<h4>Is flourishing, or languishing, a privilege?</h4>



<p>The disagreement between anthropologists and positive psychologists is largely one of world view, says Harvard University epidemiologist Tyler VanderWeele, who leads the Templeton-funded Global Flourishing Study. While Willen and her team argue that one’s environment may put happiness, or flourishing, out of reach, VanderWeele sees that world view as self-defeating.</p>



<p>Financial stability does comprise one of the six facets of flourishing that VanderWeele and colleagues are measuring in their global study of the concept. But for him, that facet is no more important than the other facets, which include happiness, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and close social relationships.</p>



<p>“We do need to worry about structural conditions, financial means and trying to ensure opportunities for everyone to flourish and the means necessary for that.… [but] I don’t think those trump the other aspects of well-being,” says VanderWeele, who coauthored <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560322001128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rebuttal to the series</a> in the same issue of <em>SSM-Mental Health</em>.</p>



<p>Focusing too much on factors outside any one individual’s control, such as racism or poverty, VanderWeele says, can be disempowering. Focusing on smaller factors, such as crafting one’s job to their liking or getting more involved in one’s community by joining a religious group or volunteering, meanwhile, hands that power back to the people.</p>



<p>This is not a debate between equals, Willen counters. With so much momentum behind their movement, positive psychologists have captured the narrative. And their self-help view of how to flourish is becoming The View, she says.</p>



<p>After Adam Grant’s article appeared in the <em>Times, </em>Willen witnessed how concepts drawn from positive psychology — in this case languishing — take on a life of their own as they enter the public domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That bird’s-eye view arose thanks to the Pandemic Journaling Project — an initiative Willen and other researchers launched in May 2020 to enable people from all walks of life to document how they were coping with this historic moment. Through those journal entries, the scientists observed which people glommed onto the idea that they were languishing — and who did not. Tellingly, entrants who mentioned the term skewed overwhelmingly white, wealthy and educated — a limited cohort that also reflects the readership of the <em>Times</em>, Willen says.</p>



<p>Grant uses his own arguably privileged experience of the moment to make sweeping claims about how people were experiencing the crisis, Willen says. He then uses those claims to write about how all people can overcome the blahs.</p>



<p>Specifically, Grant recommends people find flow. “Flow is that elusive state of absorption in a meaningful challenge or a momentary bond, where your sense of time, place and self melts away,” he writes. Such flow can arise by binge-watching shows and movies on Netflix, playing word games and, more broadly, pursuing uninterrupted time for oneself. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But just who has had the luxury to pursue such remedies for languishing, Willen asks. And who, struggling with precarity in work, health and other domains, has instead experienced something darker, something more akin to suffering?</p>



<p>Grant maintains that Willen is creating a “false dichotomy” between personal and systemic solutions to flourishing. Simpler behavioral interventions serve as crucial stopgap measures in challenging times, Grant adds. “It would be awfully cruel to tell readers suffering through a pandemic that they should just wait for social policies to change.”</p>



<p>But most people aren’t even aware of how individualized solutions to flourishing are overshadowing more systemic solutions, Willen says. Bringing that oversight to public attention is vital. “Unless we step back and ask ourselves whose voice is missing,” Willen says, “we risk internalizing a distorted account of history.”</p>



<p>Her words remind me of the adage: History is written by the victors. It’s a thought echoed on the Pandemic Journaling Project’s website. “Usually, history is written only by the powerful,” read the <a href="https://pandemic-journaling-project.chip.uconn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introductory words</a>.&nbsp;“When the history of COVID-19 is written,&nbsp;let&#8217;s make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen.” That’s certainly an admonition I’ll be keeping in mind this year as I strive for balance in my reporting on positive psychology, the pandemic and other societal issues.</p>

However, in recent years, initiatives including progress at national levels have been established to promote the integration of this dimension of palliative care in research and clinical care. Growing evidence supports the importance of spiritual care at the end of life and its positive effects on patients’ quality of life have been reported across age groups and patient groups/medical conditions.</p>

<p>Lawyers who represented Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University in Columbus, in failed libel and defamation suits – and who later sued him for not paying his tab – have won a judgment for $1 million against the scientist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/croce-judgment.pdf">judgment</a>, dated Dec. 8, 2022, orders Croce to pay just shy of $1.1 million plus interest to <a href="https://www.keglerbrown.com/">Kegler Brown Hill + Ritter</a>, of Columbus, one of the firms that represented him in his <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/19/osu-cancer-researcher-carlo-croce-loses-appeal-of-new-york-times-libel-suit/">libel lawsuit</a> against the <em>New York Times</em> and his <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/04/litigious-osu-professor-loses-appeal-in-federal-defamation-case/">defamation case</a> against David Sanders, a researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., both of which he lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The firm <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/26/law-firm-sues-osu-cancer-researcher-for-900000-in-unpaid-fees-following-failed-libel-suit/">sued Croce in 2020</a>, seeking more than $920,000 in unpaid fees. After the case went to trial, a jury awarded the full amount to the firm in damages, and the judge ruled that the lawyers were entitled to prejudgment interest at a rate of 4%, totaling an additional $175,000. The judgment amount can continue accruing interest, and Croce is responsible for the court costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his post-trial <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decision.pdf">decision</a>, judge Richard A. Frye wrote:</p>



<span id="more-126371"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The most troublesome part of this story is Dr. Croce’s response when his legal fees began to fall into arrears. He testified at trial that he “always intended to pay” but concluded–and communicated to KBHR as the overdue account grew–that he was “illiquid.” The firm was told he would promptly sell some of his artwork [Editor’s note: He has <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/high-hopes-for-a-new-kind-of-gene-30445792/?page=4">quite a collection</a>.]. They allowed months to pass while they continued to work, recognizing that it can take some time in dealing with New York City (or perhaps worldwide) art dealers. Only after months passed did the firm give up the ghost and withdraw. During this period Dr. Croce and two others jointly won the 2018 scientific prize awarded in Israel noted above. With it came $1 million split three ways. [Editor’s note: <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/27/cancer-researcher-under-cloud-of-suspicion-wins-300000-science-prize/">Here’s the prize</a>.] After receiving his share Dr. Croce bought more art rather than paying down his fees account owed KBHR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This seriously undermines Dr. Croce’s credibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After the judgment, the law firm tried to begin collecting the money by garnishing Croce’s bank accounts. (Croce earns more than <a href="https://apps.hr.osu.edu/salaries/Home/Salaries?Firstname=carlo&amp;Lastname=croce&amp;Funding=University&amp;WhichSource=Salaries&amp;Year=0&amp;IsValid=True">$800,000 a year from OSU</a>.) On January 5, Croce filed an appeal of the judgment, as well as a motion to stay the execution of the judgment and dissolve the garnishment orders, which the judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/another-denial.pdf">denied</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another law firm – with whom Croce had used his house as collateral – has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/arnold-v-croce.pdf">previously sued him </a>&nbsp;for not paying his bills, and that case appears to be ongoing. In addition to legal fees, Croce has also <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCroce%252c%2bCarlo%2bM">racked up 14 retractions</a>, as well as many corrections and expressions of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr. Croce is exercising his right to appeal,” Croce’s current lawyer, Andrew Mills Holford of Johrendt &amp; Holford, told Retraction Watch in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maria M. Guthrie of Kegler Brown, who was representing the firm in its case against Croce, did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sanders, who despite winning the suit Croce brought against him <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">was still damaged</a> by the legal battle, told us:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope that the lawyers receive that to which the law has deemed them entitled.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/advacncements-of-microbiology.webp?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/advacncements-of-microbiology.webp?resize=267%2C375&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-126363" width="267" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Polish police are investigating alleged plagiarism in a series of articles by a group of researchers at the University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>A university commission also is looking into the allegations, which one of the authors told Retraction Watch had &#8220;greatly damaged&#8221; his career. While plagiarism is not usually considered a crime, it can be prosecuted under national copyright laws <a href="https://www.plagiarism.org/blog/2017/10/27/is-plagiarism-illegal">in Poland and elsewhere</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The alleged plagiarism was first discovered by a reviewer for <em>Postępy Mikrobiologii &#8211; Advancements of Microbiology</em>, a quarterly of the Polish Society of Microbiologists, said Radosław Stachowiak, who worked as the journal&#8217;s deputy editor-in-chief until the end of last year. </p>



<span id="more-126359"></span>



<p>The journal investigated, then announced in October that it was <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dGnat%252c%2bSebastian">retracting five papers</a> that were largely identical or similar to articles published by other researchers. Ahead of the announcement it also notified Krzysztof Kowalczyk, president of the University of Life Sciences in Lublin, who told Retraction Watch he shared the information with the police as well as a &#8220;special commission&#8221; that is now investigating the case.</p>



<p>Stachowiak said the journal is a &#8220;witness&#8221; in the case and added that he is &#8220;preparing some materials for the police department.&#8221; Whether criminal charges have been brought against the authors is unclear.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Dominik Łagowski, a research assistant at the University of Life Sciences in Lublin and a coauthor of four of the five papers, cited &#8220;false accusations, invented evidence and lack of any cooperation on the part of the journal.&#8221;&nbsp; Łagowski said the editors had retracted the articles &#8220;while accusing the authors of the crime of plagiarism.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately &#8211; information about these retractions is already in the Retraction Watch database,&#8221; added Lagowski, who recently completed his PhD at the University of Life Sciences in Lublin. &#8220;And at that point, it greatly damaged my career as a scientist.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also referred to &#8220;the intentional denigration of the authors by the above-mentioned journal&#8221; and said he was &#8220;in a legal dispute with Advancements of Microbiology to clear my name.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;All I can say is that there was no such intention,&#8221; Stachowiak, the former editor, told Retraction Watch, adding that &#8220;nobody is going to profit from such a situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Four of the five articles list Sebastian Gnat, a professor at the university, as first author; he is second author of the fifth. Gnat could not be reached by phone for comment. According to Kowalczyk, the university commission investigating the case also has had problems reaching Gnat.</p>

<p><strong>Molecular biology’s flower child </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/molecular-biologys-flower-child"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 6, 1973&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>During the past several years, some artificial genes have been synthesized…. But no one had unraveled a real gene that dictates the production of a protein. Now researchers … have done just that…. There is little doubt that sequencing of genes holds powerful ramifications for the advance of medical science.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>A new era of genetics research dawned when scientists reported that they had deciphered the building blocks of a gene belonging to a virus. (The gene itself looks flowerlike when folded up.) In the decades since, scientists have rendered genetic blueprints, or genomes, for entire organisms across the tree of life. </p>



<p>In 2001, the Human Genome Project released a rough draft of our collective genome. The master <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">blueprint was finally completed last year</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 6</em>). Access to the human genome has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">led to powerful medical advances</a>, including the development of targeted gene therapies and screenings for rare disorders (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 10</em>). In the future, people may routinely have their genomes sequenced to monitor health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supply-chains-3000-years-bronze-age-shipwreck">Complex supply chains may have appeared more than 3,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-distance supply chains, vulnerable to disruptions from wars and disease outbreaks, may have formed millennia before anyone today gasped at gas prices or gawked at empty store shelves.</p>



<p>Roughly 3,650 to 3,200 years ago, herders and villagers who mined tin ore fueled long-distance supply chains that transported the metal from Central Asia and southern Turkey to merchant ships serving societies clustered around the Mediterranean, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Remote communities located near rare tin deposits <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq3766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tapped into an intense demand</a> among ancient urban civilizations for a metal that, along with copper, was needed to produce bronze, researchers report in the Dec. 2 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Tin access transformed herders and part-time cultivators into powerful partners of Late Bronze Age states and rulers, say archaeometallurgist Wayne Powell of Brooklyn College in New York City and colleagues. Until now, it has been difficult to demonstrate the existence of such an ancient, long-distance tin supply chain or its geographic origins.</p>



<p>Powell’s group builds their argument on previous archaeological evidence that mobile groups in Central Asia <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bronze-age-herders-spread-farming-around-asia">spread crop cultivation across much of Asia</a> more than 4,000 years ago (<em>SN: 4/2/14</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pants-oldest-ancient-horseman-asia-culture-origin">pioneered popular clothes-making innovations</a> by 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 2/18/22</em>). Land routes used by those groups would have connected Central Asian tin ore sources to the Mediterranean, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Evidence of an ancient tin pipeline stretching more than 3,000 kilometers from mining sites in present-day Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to merchant ships carrying processed tin in the eastern Mediterranean is particularly striking, says anthropologist Michael Frachetti of Washington University in St. Louis.</p>



<p>“That complex tin network was an early version of modern-day supply chains for commodities such as gas and oil,” Frachetti says.</p>



<p>Writing on clay tablets from Bronze Age sites in what’s now Turkey and Iraq refers to tin arriving from far to the east as early as around 3,900 years ago. But precise sources for eastern tin have proved elusive.</p>



<p>An ancient shipwreck discovered in 1982 off Turkey’s coast enabled the new study. Known as the Uluburun shipwreck, the vessel dates to around 3,300 years ago and is one of the oldest known shipwrecks. Its cargo included one metric ton of tin. The metal had been cast into portable, distinctively shaped pieces called ingots.</p>



<p>Powell’s group documented chemical fingerprints of 105 tin ingots, nearly all of those found in the Uluburun shipwreck. Ingot IDs were based on distinct combinations of different forms, or isotopes, of tin, lead and trace elements in the ingots. Data on the isotopic profiles of tin ore deposits in different parts of Eurasia have become available over the last few years, allowing the researchers to match the ingots’ tin to deposits, Powell says.</p>

<p>Powell, Frachetti and colleagues traced the origins of about one-third of the Uluburun tin ingots to an ore deposit in Tajikistan and several others nearby in Uzbekistan. Previous excavations indicate that herding groups used stone hammers to mine tin from outcrops at those sites.</p>



<p>Most of the remaining shipwreck ingots were linked to small tin deposits in southeastern Turkey’s Taurus Mountains. Mountain communities controlled by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-backyard-pendulum-saw-sliced-bronze-age-mystery">ancient Hittite kingdom</a> probably collected tin from those deposits, Frachetti says (<em>SN: 5/1/18</em>). Until now, many researchers have assumed that Turkish tin sources were depleted by the Late Bronze Age.</p>





<p>Despite the new evidence, geographic origins of the Uluburun tin ingots remain unclear, says archaeometallurgist Daniel Berger of Curt-Engelhorn-Centre of Archaeometry in Mannheim, Germany. Berger, who studies Bronze Age tin sources with another research group, did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Tin ores typically contain low lead levels, but the shipwreck ingots display high levels. Lead was probably added, deliberately or via accidental contamination, to tin somewhere on its way to the Mediterranean, he suggests. If so, that potentially complicates the attempt by Powell’s group to combine tin and lead isotopes to identify tin sources.</p>



<p>Isotopic signatures of tin within the same ore deposits vary greatly, and overlap exists between different deposits, Berger says. So tin isotopes by themselves cannot definitively identify tin sources of the Uluburun ingots.</p>



<p>“Tracing the tin sources of the Bronze Age is and remains one of the most challenging problems in archaeology,” Berger says. Efforts to identify chemical and molecular properties of different Eurasian tin deposits are still in the early stages, he adds.</p>



<p>In February, Berger and colleagues reported that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440322000012?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tin ingots from a Late Bronze Age shipwreck found off Israel’s coast</a> displayed an isotopic connection to tin deposits in southwestern England. Further research is also needed to confirm that finding, he says.</p>
