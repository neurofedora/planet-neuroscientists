<p>The mega-journal <em>Cureus</em> is eliminating author suggestions for peer reviewers, a prompt that is <a href="https://crosstalk.cell.com/blog/suggesting-peer-reviewers">standard practice</a> at some journals when submitting a manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Cureus-Email-peer-review.pdf">an email</a> sent August 25 to current and past peer reviewers, the move is “due to the potential conflict of interest” that comes from authors suggesting reviewers who may be mentors and colleagues. </p>



<p>Reviewers recommended by authors are <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/dont-let-researchers-choose-who-peer-reviews-their-work">more likely</a> to give positive feedback on papers. And such recommendations gave way to such practices as peer review rings and self-peer review, vulnerabilities that started to thrive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/515480a">more than a decade ago</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132689"></span>



<p>Some authors at <em>Cureus</em> have taken advantage of this system. In 2021, a medical resident in New Jersey <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/03/19/meet-the-medical-resident-who-had-his-wife-peer-review-five-of-his-papers/">invited his wife</a> to review his papers without disclosing their relationship, resulting in five retractions. In 2019, another author <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/04/11/an-author-was-accused-of-faking-peer-reviews-turns-out-he-also-falsified-two-images/">faked reviewer accounts</a> for two well-known neurosurgeons and was discovered only after a routine editorial audit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, instead of reviewers, authors will suggest five “colleagues or mentors to serve as Advisers,” who will provide “advisory feedback” via inline comments rather than peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reviewers recommended by authors had until August 28 to submit their peer review feedback, according to the email. Anything submitted after that “will be converted to advisory feedback.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/about-hilda-bastian/">Hilda Bastian</a>, a meta-scientist, writer and cartoonist in Australia, called the move a “backward step — it’s increasing the risk of bias in the editorial process,” she said.</p>



<p>“Presenting this as a step to ‘empower’ authors to get feedback from mentors and colleagues is an odd argument. You don&#8217;t need a journal to get advice from your mentors and colleagues,” Bastian continued.</p>



<p><a href="https://medianwatch.netlify.app/">Adrian Barnett</a>, a researcher at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said he “can’t see how these Adviser comments will work.” He raised questions regarding whether the comments would be made public, if the peer reviewers have access to adviser comments, and whether the sudden deadline would cause some existing reviewers to rush their comments or simply pull out. (Barnett’s <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/wdvr9_v1">recent work</a> found researchers who were cited in a study they reviewed were more likely to recommend that paper.)&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Cureus</em> did not respond to our request for comment regarding the role of the “Adviser” and whether those comments would be required for all submissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Springer Nature, which purchased the journal in December 2022, acknowledged our request for comment but did not answer our questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Cureus </em>has retracted <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">125 papers</a> since Springer Nature <a href="https://www.cureus.com/newsroom/news/159">acquired the title</a>, 77 of which were for author issues, like fake, unverified or changed authorship, according to our database. Last year, Clarivate’s Web of Science put the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">on hold</a> for concerns about article quality, which the journal has been <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/24/cureus-its-reviewing-and-its-scholarly-impact-quotient/">criticized for</a> in the past.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first attempt the journal has made to improve its publishing practices. In November of last year, <em>Cureus</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/21/mega-journal-cureus-kicks-out-organizations-critics-called-paper-mills/">closed</a> six of its “channels” after we reported that they were <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">allowing questionable organizations</a> to hand-pick their own editors.&nbsp;</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sonia_melo_portugal.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="256" height="195" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sonia_melo_portugal.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132676"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sonia Melo</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A biochemist who worked as a postdoc at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston has sued the institution to dispute findings of research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.i3s.up.pt/personal-info.php?id=539&amp;idg=22">Sonia Melo</a>, now at the University of Porto in Portugal, alleges MD Anderson did not follow its own policies while conducting its investigation. Melo <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/02/embo-awardee-under-investigation-loses-grant/">lost a prestigious grant</a> in 2016 after one of her papers was retracted for containing duplicated images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MD Anderson&#8217;s investigation concerned <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610814003687">a paper</a> published in <em>Cancer Cell</em> in 2014. On August 7 the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610825003289">marked it with</a> a “temporary Expression of Concern” detailing duplicated and relabeled data found in the probe, which was completed in May 2024. The article has been cited 1,462 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132677"></span>



<p>The investigation “concluded that there are no authentic, original, and uncontested data to verify the results presented in the publication and recommended retraction of the article,” the notice states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Melo “expressly denies the findings of research misconduct made by MD Anderson,” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/amended-petition-melo-mdacc.pdf">according to her lawsuit</a>, filed in Harris County, Texas. She asked the court to declare MD Anderson had infringed her due process rights, and void the institution’s final decision of research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can only reaffirm that I stand firmly behind the claims outlined in the Petition,” Melo told Retraction Watch. “As the matter is subject to ongoing litigation, I am not in a position to provide additional comments at this time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/kalluri-laboratory/lab-members.html">Raghu Kalluri</a>, the corresponding author of the paper and a professor of cancer biology at MD Anderson, told us he had suggested the journal place the temporary expression of concern on the paper until the dispute is resolved.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raghu-kalluri-crop.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="545" height="677" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raghu-kalluri-crop.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132675" style="width:250px;height:auto" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raghu-kalluri-crop.jpg 545w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raghu-kalluri-crop-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Raghu Kalluri</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“The data was found to substantiate every figure in the paper that was in question,” Kalluri said. “The committee just did not like the exact sequence in which the data was recorded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has requested a correction for some “genuine errors” that “don’t impact the data at all,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The expression of concern states some of the paper’s 14 authors disagree with the investigation’s findings, but does not specify which ones. The authors maintain MD Anderson investigated the article in 2016 and did not recommend retracting it, and “all original data supporting the paper’s conclusions” were provided to the investigation committee, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors of <em>Cancer Cell</em> are reviewing the concerns and will update the scientific community with their conclusion, the notice states. A spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of <em>Cancer Cell</em>, said the company could not comment while the investigation was ongoing.</p>



<p>Kalluri declined to share the investigation report and other documents with us. We filed a request for the report under Texas’ public records law, but have not received the document.</p>



<p>Kalluri served as chair of the Department of Cancer Biology from 2012 until June 1, according to a spokesperson for MD Anderson. He told us the change was “due to family reasons and personal reasons,” and because he decided to devote more time to research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Kalluri’s <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/24813">papers</a>, in the <em>Journal of Clinical Investigation</em>, was <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/135305">retracted</a> in January 2020 after the U.S. Office of Research Integrity found the first author, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/07/reused-over-and-over-again-image-recycling-leads-to-5-year-funding-ban-for-cancer-researcher/">Sudhakar Yakkanti</a>, fabricated data. ORI also recommended the retraction or correction of a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0730882100">paper</a> in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> on which Kalluri and Yakkanti collaborated which has yet to be marked.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Within a year of the publication of the <em>Cancer Cell</em> paper, anonymous users of PubPeer began <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EB26CFF7EAE4F3E766EF305622527B#1">posting illustrations</a> of figures in the paper that appeared identical to other figures depicting different experiments. The findings in the temporary expression of concern match those identified on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MD Anderson conducted an internal inquiry into the allegations on PubPeer in 2016 and “concluded that no further action was warranted,” Melo alleges in her lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in 2016, the European Molecular Biology Organization <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/02/embo-awardee-under-investigation-loses-grant/">revoked</a> an early career grant to Melo of up to 250,000 euros, following the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/02/embo-awardee-under-investigation-there-was-no-effort-to-commit-fraud/">retraction of a paper</a> in <em>Nature Genetics</em> on which she was the first author. At least four of <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMelo%252c%2bSonia%2bA">Melo’s other papers</a> have received corrections — one of them twice. The <a href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(25)00323-X">most recent</a> correction, of a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(10)00344-2">2010 paper</a> also published in <em>Cancer Cell</em>, appeared August 11 and replaced a supplementary figure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Melo’s lawsuit, in January 2019 MD Anderson began looking into allegations regarding the <em>Cancer Cell</em> paper and three patents she co-owns, <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO2015085096">one of which</a> is mentioned in the expression of concern. She alleges the institution did not notify her of the inquiry or subsequent investigation until February 2023, in violation of its policies. She also alleges the investigation took longer than allowed for in the institution&#8217;s policy. She received a draft of the investigation report on April 23, 2024, and submitted a 30-page response disputing the findings, she alleges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark Barnes, an attorney at the Boston firm Ropes &amp; Gray who was serving as MD Anderson’s acting Research Integrity Officer, sent the institution’s final report to Melo <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/barnes-email-melo-mdacc.pdf">in an email</a> dated May 10, 2024. Melo attached the email, but not the report, to her lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peter Pisters, president of MD Anderson, accepted the committee’s findings and recommendations, Barnes wrote to Melo. The institution asked Melo to pursue retraction of the <em>Cancer Cell </em>paper within two weeks, and said it would do so if she did not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MD Anderson also “indefinitely” prohibited Melo from any appointment or employment at the institution, from performing any research there or collaborating with any MD Anderson researchers, and from receiving research-related funding from the institution, Barnes’ email stated. Barnes declined to comment for this story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is committed to the highest standards of scientific integrity and works to uphold these standards through established processes,” a spokesperson told us. “The institution does not comment on pending litigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Melo’s lawyers filed a motion for default judgment against MD Anderson on August 18, as the institution had not submitted a response to her lawsuit in court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The day we asked MD Anderson for comment on the lawsuit, August 21, the institution filed two responses. “Defendant recently learned of the Motion for Default Judgment and immediately filed an answer,” the Texas attorney general’s office <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MDACC-response-to-motion-for-default-judgment.pdf">wrote in the response</a> asking the court to deny the motion. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MDACC-answer.pdf">its answer to Melo’s petition</a>, the attorney general’s office wrote MD Anderson denied “all the allegations and claims” and asserted it was immune from the suit and liability as a sovereign entity.&nbsp;</p>

                Abstract:  The Illinois Newspaper Project has existed in some form for nearly four decades and has evolved through project locations, staffing, and areas of focus. Collaborative efforts of the project have depended on the phase of work, staff levels, and institutional resources, and were strong in the project’s early years but slowed down between 2011-2023. Most recently, as an homage to the project’s early collaborative roots and supported by the institutional resources of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U. of I.), the INP has been well-equipped to serve as a state resource for newspaper preservation and digitization in alliance with the University’s land grant mission. The INP has built partnerships with cultural heritage institutions across the state to preserve and provide freely available access to Illinois historical newspapers through its digital newspaper platform, the Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections (IDNC).

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naohiro-kameta.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="198" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naohiro-kameta.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132666"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Naohiro Kameta</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A chemistry journal has retracted a 2020 review article by a nanotube researcher who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/10/retractions-begin-for-chemist-found-to-have-faked-data-in-42-papers/">fabricated and falsified data</a> in dozens of studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest retraction for Naohiro Kameta brings his total to 40, earning him a place on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">Retraction Watch Leaderboard</a>. </p>



<p>In a 2020 review article in <em>Chemical Reviews</em>, 24 of the 610 works Kameta and his coauthors cited had themselves been retracted following the publication of the paper, according to <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5c00539">the retraction notice</a>. Because these references were “important components” of the review article, “the narrative and claims presented can no longer be upheld,” the notice reads. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00509">The review</a> has been cited 164 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<span id="more-132663"></span>



<p>All 24 of the works mentioned in the retraction notice were <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">among 42 papers identified as fraudulent</a> in a 2024 investigation by Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), where Kameta worked in the Nanomaterials Research Institute <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/au20240731_1.html">until his dismissal</a> last year. The retraction notice does not mention the inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A coauthor on the review was Kameta’s AIST colleague Toshimi Shimizu, who the institution’s investigation stated was responsible for the content of the papers but was not involved in any misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around the same time as the retraction, French computer scientist Guillaume Cabanac posted on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D40E77CF94EA5EEA609FBEDA593EFD#1">PubPeer </a>warning readers to “reassess the reliability of the document” since it contained 23 references flagged by the Problematic Paper Screener, a tool that identifies suspicious papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1557F198FA7DC1569A44B36C1E1942#0">also flagged</a> another article containing references to 18 of Kameta’s retracted works. Shimizu is the sole author of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bcsj/article/91/4/623/7333093">that paper</a>, published in <em>Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan</em>. Shimizu could not be reached for comment via his institutional email. Editors at the journal have not responded to a request for comment. </p>



<p>As AIST <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/Portals/0/resource_images/aist_j/information/240329_anken1.pdf">wrote in its report</a> about the investigation, Kameta repeatedly altered electron micrographs and misrepresented scale bars in the 42 papers they found linked to misconduct so he could publish as many papers as possible. The investigation also found his research records were incomplete and that his samples had been discarded.The misconduct was evident across nearly two decades of Kameta’s work, according to AIST.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">announcement of their findings</a>, AIST warned researchers to “please be careful when citing [the flagged papers], as the content is factually incorrect.” In an email this week, the institution’s media office wrote that individual researchers would not be responding to our questions about other papers citing Kameta, nor would the institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since our earlier reporting on this case, all of Kameta’s articles in journals owned by the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry mentioned in the investigation have now been retracted. The six remaining unretracted papers appear to be published in Japanese language journals or are conference proceedings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the recently retracted papers contained problems with scale bars, with one reported as being <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/cc/d4cc90364a">46 times longer</a> than it should have been. Many also included manually manipulated images and some where the original images <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c03020">couldn’t be found</a>. The retraction notices cite these errors as examples of the scientific misconduct identified by AIST, which recommended the retractions. They also make clear Kameta was responsible for the misconduct, while his coauthors were not implicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kameta, who does not appear to have published any new articles since 2024, could not be reached for comment via his institutional email.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal allowed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950307825000633#sec0015a">a paper</a> containing extensive plagiarism to remain online, while letting its authors make undisclosed revisions that masked the offense, Retraction Watch has learned. But the journal’s editor-in-chief told us he has subsequently decided to retract the paper.</p>



<p>The article, on cognitive impairment among older adults in India, appeared online on June 15 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sharma-et-al-preproof-archives-of-gerontology.pdf">as a pre-proof</a> in <em>Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Plus</em>. At that point, its background section included several long paragraphs that were identical, or near-identical, to text in<a href="https://epc2024.eaps.nl/uploads/240969"> an extended conference abstract</a> from 2024. The study’s objectives and methods also bore strong similarity to the earlier work, which had been conducted by another group of researchers.</p>



<p>Poulami Barman, first author of the conference abstract and a dual-program Ph.D. student in India and Germany, became aware her work had been stolen after one of her supervisors alerted her to the new paper. It turned out she knew the article’s corresponding author well. Like Barman, Madhurima Sharma was a Ph.D. student at the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) in Mumbai, and she had previously asked Barman to share her code. Barman had refused to do so until her work was published.</p>



<span id="more-132658"></span>



<p>Shocked at what she had discovered, Barman messaged Sharma.</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?” Sharma wrote back in correspondence we obtained. “I did not even see your paper,” she added, referring to the abstract. “So how can I copy?”</p>



<p>She had written her paper “with the help of ai and as well as existing literatures [sic],” Sharma claimed.</p>



<p>But the plagiarism was impossible to miss, with clear overlap in both text and study design. On June 23, Barman, who is also&nbsp; at the University of Rostock, in Germany, contacted the journal, providing a side-by-side comparison of the two works. A journal manager replied that the publisher would look into her complaint.</p>



<p>A few days later, Barman noticed that the plagiarized paragraphs had been revised in the paper’s version of record, dated June 30, without any explanation. She again contacted the journal to find out what was going on, but didn’t hear back.</p>



<p>Then on July 22, Sharma sent Barman an email stating she had revised her paper “in full coordination with the journal editor” after “being made aware of the overlap” between their texts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They let her modify the article, and that was, like, completely unethical,” Barman told us. “It should be retracted because it was completely plagiarized.”</p>



<p>When Barman wrote to the journal yet again, she was told by the journal manager on July 24 that “the investigation is on-going and our Editor in Chief &amp; Publisher are already discussing on this matter to find a better solution.”</p>



<p>Sharma told us that after being contacted by the journal, “I recognized my mistake and immediately took action and revised the document. The Journal subsequently informed me that the revised paper was acceptable and published it.”</p>



<p>She also said some of the data her study was based on differed from those Barman had used, adding, “Objectives and results are different.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharma did not respond to follow-up questions asking what exactly her “mistake” had been.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liang-Kung Chen, editor-in-chief of <em>Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Plus</em>, told us he had “decided to retract this paper on July 26, so we did have certain actions on this paper. The retraction process is going on at the publisher’s (Elsevier’s) end.”</p>



<p>After learning the journal had allowed Sharma to change the plagiarized text, Barman took to LinkedIn to vent her frustration in<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7354506033366458368-57Gc/"> a post</a> that garnered dozens of comments, several of them from scholars describing similar experiences. One implicated Sharma.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, something very similar happened to me with the same author you mentioned,” wrote Sayani Das, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Social Work at Bar-Ilan University, in Israel. “She asked me for all the details and then published her paper based on my preprint. Since then, I’ve stopped sharing papers as preprints, as I’m afraid of such so-called researchers.”</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/linkedin-screenshot-barman-sharma.jpg">a rejoinder on LinkedIn</a> that disappeared when Barman blocked her, Sharma wrote, in part, “I want to state clearly and unequivocally: I did not copy either of your work [sic] not your title, not your tables, and not your results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Srinivas Goli, an associate professor at IIPS, said in a comment on the post he had “consistently emphasized in my classes that you don’t need dozens or hundreds of papers to advance in your academic and professional career.” But, he added, “Unfortunately, a deeply flawed mindset has taken root among some students, pushing them toward shortcuts and unethical practices. We must remind them that a successful career is not built on the number of papers but on skills, knowledge and ethics.”</p>



<p>Asked for comment, IIPS told us it would try to sort out what had happened in a physical meeting with “the student” and requested us “not to proceed in this matter.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the second author of the offending paper, Abdul Fathah, also a doctoral student at IIPS, wrote on LinkedIn that his “sole contribution to the paper was in conducting the data analysis.”</p>



<p>“I was not informed or made aware that substantial portions of the manuscript were copied from another researcher’s work,” Fathah wrote. “I deeply regret this serious breach of academic ethics, and I unreservedly condemn plagiarism of any kind.”</p>

<p>A 23-year-old paper has received an addendum for “possible inadvertent errors” in the figures. But a sleuth says the update doesn’t address issues with the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ni852">2002 paper</a>, which describes the behavior of Langerhans cells in normal and inflamed skin, was published in <em>Nature Immunology</em> and has been cited 774 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article received <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ni0103-92">a correction</a> in 2003 to replace two “incorrect” figures. Over 20 years later, PubPeer commenter “Archasia belfragei” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/524A810F7E210DBB96D41D17320461">flagged issues</a> with different figures, noting in December that some PCR bands were “more similar than expected.”</p>



<span id="more-132648"></span>



<p>An addendum this April addressed the data errors, which, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-025-02131-9">according to the notice</a>, “may have occurred during the assembly of PCR measurements.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/miriam-merad">Miriam Merad</a>, lead author of the paper and now Chair of the Department of Immunology and Immunotherapy at Mount Sinai in New York, called the similarity between bands an “unfortunate mistake in assembling the PCR.” She told us “the PCR that was misassembled was measuring housekeeping genes, which are expressed by all cells” and were not the focus of the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research was conducted at Irving Weissman’s lab at Stanford University in California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But image expert <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">David Sanders</a>, a biologist at Purdue University in Lafayette, Ind., told us the addendum is “inadequate in multiple senses.” While the correction applied to two proteins, the “problematic” data involve the expression of a third, he said. </p>



<p>“The argument that an image concerning protein expression … somehow justifies thoroughly flawed images of RNA levels is absurd,” Sanders said. The “extent and nature of the problems with the figures would, in my opinion, dictate that the article should have been retracted,” he added.</p>



<p>Merad <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Sanders_Merad-emails-nature-immunology-2002-paper.pdf">responded</a> to Sanders’ concerns by emphasizing “there was no misconduct here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the paper’s authors, Harvard professor <a href="https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/people/amy-wagers-phd">Amy Wagers</a>, had another correction earlier this year to a 2023 paper in <em>Nature Aging</em>. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00804-6">author correction</a> addressed “potential duplication in two of the micrographs shown in the paper,” the January notice reads. Two of the probes were “unintentionally swapped” while the authors prepared images for the final submission of the paper. Wagers was one of 20 coauthors on this paper, which has been cited 37 times. She did not respond to email requests for comment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/people/amy-wagers-phd">Wagers</a> is the cochair of Harvard’s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. In 2010, Wagers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/10/14/highly-cited-harvard-stem-cell-scientist-retracts-nature-paper/">retracted a paper</a> from <em>Nature </em>for data concerns. A postdoc in Wagers’ lab was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/03/17/in-a-retractions-wake-postdoc-shane-mayack-dismissed-from-amy-wagers-stem-cell-lab-speaks-out/">dismissed</a> after accepting responsibility for the “duplicated data and other inappropriate manipulations” cited in a retraction in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/12/27/blood-retracts-stem-cell-paper-from-amy-wagers-harvard-lab-after-14-months-of-concern/">2011 from <em>Blood</em></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/people/lee-l-rubin">Lee Rubin</a>, co-corresponding author and professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard, told us a coauthor of the paper discovered the mistake with the figures. “We are upset that we made the mistake but feel like we rectified it quickly and openly,” he said.</p>
