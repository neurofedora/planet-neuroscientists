As we grapple with pressing challenges such as climate change, food security, and biodiversity loss, the importance of innovative agricultural practices has never been more critical.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the journal&#8217;s heart is sustainability; sustainable agricultural practices can protect habitats and watersheds, improve soil health and water quality as well as enhance animal welfare and husbandry practices.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Agriculture is at the heart of human survival and prosperity, but it also faces immense pressures from environmental changes and the growing needs of a global population. <em>BMC Agriculture</em> aims to address these issues by advancing research in areas such as  crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry.  It joins our expanding portfolio of journals covering these topics, including <a href="https://bmcenvsci.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Environmental Science</em></a>, launched only last year and <a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Veterinary Research</em></a>, one of our earliest <em>BMC series</em> journals. At the journal&#8217;s heart is sustainability; sustainable agricultural practices can protect habitats and watersheds, improve soil health and water quality as well as enhance animal welfare and husbandry practices.</span></p>
<p>Aligned with the objectives of the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>, <em>BMC Agriculture</em> particularly encourages papers focused on zero hunger (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2">SDG2</a>), good health and well-being (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">SDG3</a>), clean water and sanitation (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">SDG6</a>), responsible consumption and production (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">SDG12</a>), climate action (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13">SDG13</a>), life below water (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14">SDG14</a>) and life on land (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15">SDG15</a>). These focus areas highlight the journal&#8217;s commitment to not only advancing scientific understanding but also contributing practical solutions that enhance global welfare.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following the ethos of the <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals"><em>BMC series</em>,</a> our journal stands for open, robust and reproducible science with <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/open-data">freely available data</a> to speed up the pace of discovery. We support <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2020/05/04/transparency-openness-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review</a> and make editorial decisions based on the validity and rigor of a study rather than its perceived impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>BMC Agriculture</em> will be launching this summer and we are now looking for researchers to join the editorial board. If you are interested in helping to shape and support this exciting new journal, please get in touch – I’d love to hear from you! My email is  alison.cuff@biomedcentral.com</span></p>

<br /><p>Much development has been directed toward improving the performance and automation of spike sorting. This continuous development, while essential, has contributed to an over-saturation of new, incompatible tools that hinders rigorous benchmarking and complicates reproducible analysis. To address these limitations, we developed SpikeInterface, a Python framework designed to unify preexisting spike sorting technologies into a single codebase and to facilitate straightforward comparison and adoption of different approaches. With a few lines of code, researchers can reproducibly run, compare, and benchmark most modern spike sorting algorithms; pre-process, post-process, and visualize extracellular datasets; validate, curate, and export sorting outputs; and more. In this paper, we provide an overview of SpikeInterface and, with applications to real and simulated datasets, demonstrate how it can be utilized to reduce the burden of manual curation and to more comprehensively benchmark automated spike&nbsp;sorters.</p>

<p>On March 1, 2022, Eric Ross, then a psychiatrist-in-training in Boston, alerted two major publishers to a pair of disturbingly similar papers he suspected had been “fabricated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The articles are written by the same corresponding author and contain much of the same unrealistic data,” Ross, now an assistant professor at the University of Vermont, in Burlington, wrote in an email whose recipients included the editors-in-chief of Wiley’s <em>CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics</em> and Springer Nature’s <em>Neurotherapeutics.</em></p>



<p>Ross listed several “red flags” he felt clearly pointed to “research misconduct” in the two papers, which reported on two separate clinical trials of new antidepressant add-on medications (metformin and cilostazol). He also emphasized that fake medical research could have real consequences:</p>



<span id="more-129183"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Research misconduct is damaging in any field, but I am particularly disturbed by these articles. Besides its harms to the research community, a fabricated clinical trial with clinically actionable conclusions has the potential to do real and immediate harm to patients. I have already seen one of these articles picked up for discussion on a popular psychiatry podcast; I would hate to see clinicians begin acting on this information in their practice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then he waited.</p>



<p>After six months, <em>Neurotherapeutics</em> pulled one of the studies, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-022-01291-y">stating</a> in a Sept. 7, 2022, notice, “there are serious issues with the ethical oversight, the reporting and the availability of audited data for this clinical trial.” Yet nearly a year after Ross’s email, the paper in <em>CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics </em>remained in place, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/08/i-was-fired-up-psychiatrist-effort-prompts-retraction-of-antidepressant-treatment-paper/">we reported</a> in February 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think this was [a case] where it took a lot of, you know, complex sleuthing, like doing statistical analysis or anything like that, to be very suspicious about these papers,” Ross told us at the time.</p>



<p>Now, after two years, the Wiley journal has finally issued a retraction. In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.14667">a March 11 notice</a>, the publisher stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, multiple concerns were raised by a third party about the integrity of the clinical trial. An investigation revealed significant issues regarding the reliability of the reported data. As a result, the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the validity of the results presented in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 11 times since Ross first contacted the journal, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science &#8212; including by a Hindawi/Wiley journal paper that was since <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2024/9860462/">retracted for likely paper mill activity</a>.</p>



<p>We contacted Wiley on Friday to learn what caused the long delay, particularly given Springer Nature’s previous retraction, but have yet to hear back from the publisher, which recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">trumpeted its efforts</a> to retract thousands of paper mill articles from its Hindawi subsidiary. An email seeking comment from the corresponding author of the two papers, Mahmoud S. Abdallah of the University of Sadat City, in Egypt, also went unanswered.</p>

<p>A study purportedly of scars left by caesarean sections included women yet to undergo the surgery, say sleuths. But an investigation into the research by the author’s employer and the journal that published it found no evidence of research misconduct.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/uog.22053">paper</a>, published in Wiley journal <em>Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>, was flagged on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C4B219054CCC81FAEA0509E6E4A93A">PubPeer in February</a> by Ben Mol, an ob-gyn researcher at Monash University in Australia <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">whose efforts have led to scores of retractions and corrections</a>, and Jim Thornton, emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Nottingham, in the UK. The study looks at how the scar left behind on a woman’s uterus after a c-section is affected by the dilation of her cervix at the time of the procedure.</p>



<span id="more-129178"></span>



<p>One of the senior authors of the article, Baskaran Thilaganathan, director of fetal medicine at St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundations Trust, in London, is currently editor emeritus at the journal. He did not respond to Retraction Watch’s requests for comment.</p>



<p>The other senior author on the paper, Sherif Negm, and the corresponding author Rasha Kamel, who both work the maternal-fetal medicine unit at Cairo University in Egypt, did not reply to requests for comment either.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mol and Thornton began looking at the study in detail when they noticed its <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tqX3Evcg3V8UsSyoemk1BsY6IjkKVsNV0Of12WPhHvU/edit">peer-reviewed advance online version</a> reported more than half the 400 study participants had a c-section after previously giving birth vaginally, which is relatively uncommon. So they asked authors to share their data.</p>



<p>Upon inspection of the data, Mol and Thornton found 84 of the more than 400 women involved in the study had ultrasounds to look at their scars before the operation took place, according to the researchers’ post on PubPeer. “Some [of these cases] could be date formatting issues, but this does not explain all,” they wrote.</p>



<p>The pair point out other potential irregularities in the data, including the fact that the information reported in the method section of the paper about the time between c-section and ultrasound scan often did not agree with what was reported in the data. More than half the women also fell into groups who not only had c-sections on the same day but also their subsequent ultrasound scan on the same day as each other, which Mol and Thornton call a coincidence.</p>



<p>Mol and Thornton said they shared their concerns with the authors, who explained some women were mistakenly classified as having given birth before when they had not, but they did not correct this error in the published paper.</p>



<p>The authors also addressed some of their other concerns by making changes to the description of the study design in the final version of the published paper. Mol and Thornton said on PubPeer these changes made the coincidental surgery and scan dates “even less plausible.” The data set in the paper omitted “the most obvious markers of a problem” &#8211; the procedure and scan dates, they added.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Anthony Odibo, the editor of the journal, said the publication takes research integrity seriously. “These concerns have already been raised to the journal, which investigated accordingly,” he&nbsp; told us.</p>



<p>The dataset and research have also been investigated by St George’s NHS Trust, Odibo added. “The institutional investigation found no evidence of fabrication or other research misconduct. COPE reviewed the journal’s investigation process and determined that it was appropriate. As is standard, COPE has advised the journal to abide by the outcome of institutional investigation,” he said.</p>



<p>St George&#8217;s University Hospital NHS Foundations Trust said in an emailed statement to Retraction Watch:&nbsp; “We have formally investigated these claims, as has the journal, and no misconduct was found in either investigation. Research plays an integral part in what we do and we are committed to upholding high standards to the quality of our research.”</p>



<p>We contacted the University of Cairo through a comment form on its website but did not get a response.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2024/05/mental-disorder-or-something-magical/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Fisher-featured-image-480x185.jpg" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2024/05/mental-disorder-or-something-magical/">Mental disorder or something magical?</a></p><p>Each generation finds their own way of understanding mental distress. The ‘shell-shocked’ soldiers of World War I were understood at the time to be of weak character, although now we might diagnose them with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Victorian women were subject to ‘hysteria’ and fainting fits, something we might now understand as non-epileptic seizures. The way that we understand distress is deeply rooted in our culture and time, but it doesn’t feel like that to us. We tend to think that the way we understand things now is the right way, superior to previous generations and other cultures.</p><p>Which makes our current time a particularly interesting one to be working in mental health. The dominant way to understand mental distress in the West in the last 70 years has been the medical model. This sees distress and unusual behaviour as symptoms of an underlying mental disorder. Diagnosing clinicians compare a person’s experiences to lists of criteria and give them (or not give them) a diagnosis. That diagnosis should lead to treatment, which should then (hopefully) lead to an improvement in symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p>This system is one of categorisation. It matters which diagnosis a person gets because that will affect the services they receive. Get a diagnosis of PTSD and you’ll find yourself offered very different treatment than if you are given a diagnosis of ADHD, even if your symptoms have similarities. The system is pragmatic and structures many mental health services. A psychiatric diagnosis is a description, rather than an explanation. It gives a name to a cluster of symptoms.</p><p>However, in recent decades, the fundamental principles of the diagnostic system have been undermined by neuroscientific and behavioural genetic research. Research has failed to find biological correlates for the diagnostic groupings defined by the manuals (called DSM and ICD). According to behavioural geneticist Robert Plomin, instead of finding ‘genes for schizophrenia’ as expected, large scale studies have shown that many genes combine in tiny, cumulative, and generalised effects. Studies of mental health have consistently found dimensionality. Symptoms such as anxiety, or hearing voices, or low mood vary across the whole population, and a diagnosis draws a line where none exists in nature.</p><p>The implications of this for how we conceptualise mental health are profound. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28333488/">Researchers</a> are working on dimensional frameworks and influential neuroscientists <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730353-000-psychiatry-is-reinventing-itself-thanks-to-advances-in-biology/">argue</a> that a reliance on diagnostic categories is holding back advances in research. It has become increasingly clear that diagnostic groups may be practical, but they don’t reliably reflect distinctions between people.</p><p>However, alongside this revolution in how scientists understand mental health has come the advent of social media and a huge cultural shift. Here the way in which psychiatric diagnoses are understood have also changed dramatically in the last few decades, but in a very different way.</p><p>On social media, psychiatric diagnoses have become identities and online communities have formed around them. ‘Mental health influencers’ post about their symptoms and put their diagnoses in their bios. Some of their followers start to define themselves in the same way, or even to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/145/2/476/6356504">develop new symptoms</a>. We are only just starting to understand how influential social media can be.</p><p>For many, these diagnoses signify far more than a list of symptoms. They provide an explanation as to why they are the way that they are and validation that their life struggles are not their fault. The mainstream media have also adopted this narrative, with articles published with titles like ‘<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/a-new-life-being-diagnosed-with-adhd-in-my-40s-has-given-me-something-quite-magical">My New Life: Being Diagnosed with ADHD in My 40’s has Given Me Something Quite Magical.’</a></p><p>This has led us to the strange situation where just as scientists are moving away from grouping people by diagnosis, more people than ever before are thinking of themselves as belonging to a diagnostic category. Many are self-diagnosing, and several clinicians have informed me of official complaints after they told service users that they didn’t fit the criteria. If a person sees a diagnosis as the key to something magical, it’s understandable that they are furious if it is withheld.</p><p>There has always been a gulf between how the general public understands mental health and how scientists and clinicians conceptualise it. What perhaps is new is that many now see a diagnosis as their route to compassion and community, as an affirmation of who they are. This was not what the medical model was designed for, and it is not well-suited to the task. Psychiatric diagnoses were intended to identify pathology in order to provide treatment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Waiting lists soar as a result, and when a person finally does see a clinician, expectations can be very different to the reality. Anger grows when people are not able to get the diagnosis they feel they need or when their diagnostic assessment doesn’t provide the validation they were hoping for.</p><p>We’re in the middle of a cultural clash in the way that we understand mental health. As science is pushing us towards reconsidering diagnostic categories, those same categories are becoming ever more important in popular culture. This inevitably leads to tension. ‘Mental disorder’ or ‘something magical’—can a diagnosis be both at the same time? Or are there other ways to understand mental distress entirely?</p><p><em><sub>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@brookecagle?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Brooke Cagle</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/shallow-focus-photo-of-person-in-white-scoop-neck-t-shirt-TWiphGp4Fao?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/891143333/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/891143333/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f04%2fFisher-featured-image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/the-hidden-toll-of-war/">The hidden toll of war</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/unlocking-the-moons-secrets-from-galileo-to-giant-impact/">Unlocking the Moon&#8217;s secrets: from Galileo to giant impact</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/02/of-language-brain-health-and-global-inequities/">Of language, brain health, and global inequities</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>The journal <em>Cureus </em>has retracted a 2022 paper on cancer and the environment just weeks after Retraction Watch raised questions about apparent plagiarism in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/05/cureus-reviewing-paper-alleged-to-plagiarize-lancet-article/">we reported</a> in early April, the paper, “Causes of Cancer in the World: Comparative Risk Assessment of Nine Behavioral and Environmental Risk Factors”, had a bit of a twinsies thing going with a 2005 article in The Lancet – sharing a title, figures, and wording that “follows the Lancet one on a sentence-by-sentence level while using tortured phrases,” according to the anonymous tipster who informed us of the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The April 19 <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/109423-causes-of-cancer-in-the-world-comparative-risk-assessment-of-nine-behavioral-and-environmental-risk-factors/retraction#!/">retraction notice states</a>:</p>



<span id="more-129174"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted by the Editor-in-Chief. The title and figures have been taken directly from a 2005 article published in Lancet: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2</a>. Additionally, the article appears to follow the Lancet article on a sentence-by-sentence basis with evidence of tortured phrases. The journal regrets that these issues were not identified during the plagiarism check at the time of submission. The authors agree with this decision to retract.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we’ve noted elsewhere in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">report on the team that developed the phrase</a>, “Tortured phrases are what happens to words that get translated from English into a foreign language, then back to English — perhaps by a computer trying to generate a scholarly publication for a group of unscrupulous authors.”</p>

<p>The <em>Scottish Medical Journal</em> has retracted more than a dozen papers dating back to 2020 after concluding the articles were likely produced by one or more paper mills.</p>



<p>The articles, all by researchers in China, covered a range of topics including back pain, pancreatic cancer, hand hygiene and sepsis. Most were meta-analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00369330241240826">blanket notice</a> for the 13 papers, which the publisher, Sage, lists by url but not title:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129158"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>After an internal investigation Sage has become aware that the submissions contain indicators of third-party involvement.</p>



<p>Due to concerns around author contributions to these articles, as well as concerns around the integrity of the research process, Sage and the Journal Editor retract these articles.</p>



<p>The authors have been informed of this decision using the email addresses provided at submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Sage told us: &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We became aware of issues with these papers because multiple submissions to this journal showed indicators of paper mill activity. As a result, we rejected these submissions and investigated further published articles.  </p>



<p>The 13 papers show indicators of paper mill activity and together with the editor, we have decided to retract them following COPE guidelines. We have been in contact with the authors of these articles.  </p>



<p>Correcting the scientific record is incredibly important to us. Once we become aware of any misconduct, we are dedicated to carrying out a full and fair investigation. We are supporting the journal’s Editorial team to make sure they have the proper tools and training to identify and reject suspicious submissions before publication.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the retractions were originally posted, readers who clicked through those links to the articles themselves (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00369330231187655">such as this one</a>) – or who landed on the article pages by other means – could be forgiven for not knowing the papers have been retracted. “View retraction” appeared in regular type after various metadata, without any other flag.</p>



<p>Asked by Retraction Watch last week about the formatting, the spokesperson added that “there were errors which we are working urgently to correct.” Indeed, the article titles now include “RETRACTED.”</p>

<p>A psychology researcher already under fire for several questionable studies has had her PhD revoked by a university tribunal that found it likely she fabricated data in her thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ping Dong, who was a doctoral student at the University of Toronto from 2012 to 2017, had already earned retractions for two papers based on her thesis before the tribunal’s decision to cancel her degree and give the thesis a failing grade. A <a href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201490.pdf">summary of the case</a> the school has made available online reveals those retractions, which we’ve previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/11/28/psychology-journal-to-retract-study-claiming-that-people-fear-contagion-less-in-the-dark/">reported on</a>, arose from more serious misconduct than previously publicized and were also subject to an institutional investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dong’s research concerned how moral violations and unethical behavior, such as tax evasion or adultery, influence consumer choices.. According to the university’s report, her thesis had an “improbable level of duplication” in the answers research participants gave to open-ended questions. Dong also allegedly confessed to a former supervisor that her husband impersonated participants in her studies and that she had failed to properly randomize the results – although the supervisor contests that Dong ever admitted this to her. </p>



<span id="more-129150"></span>



<p><a href="https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/78965">Dong’s thesis</a> resulted in three published papers, cited 29 times in total, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science Two of the papers had already been retracted before the tribunal’s decision because of data anomalies found by readers:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p>According to the tribunal documents, the problems with the thesis began to surface in May 2018 when the then-editor of <em>Psychological Science</em>, Steve Lindsay, contacted Dong and Chen-Bo Zhong, Dong’s coauthor and faculty advisor, after receiving reports from a reader of anomalous patterns in the data in Dong’s article on darkness and fear of infection. Lindsay at the time had asked a statistical advisor to assess the report, and the advisor confirmed that there were problems in the data, he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Dong has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613482946">another paper from 2013</a> also published in <em>Psychological Science </em>that was not investigated. Lindsay said he probably assumed Dong was an early-career researcher and failed to look for any other papers that she had published in the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Zhong confronted Dong about the concerns in the <em>Psychological Science</em> paper, she blamed the issues on “improper, but innocent, randomization” in the data collection process – an explanation the tribunal concluded was “fake”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in early 2019, Zhong received an email in which Dong admitted to falsifying data, according to his testimony for the tribunal. He said Aparna Labroo, who had supervised Dong’s first year paper before leaving the university in 2013, had forwarded an email in which Dong admitted she did not properly randomize data in the <em>Psychological Science </em>paper and that her husband had impersonated participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Labroo disputed these claims in an email to Retraction Watch: “Ping Dong admitted no such thing to me and I never had or ever have had any such email. I had no idea she did not randomize conditions in her 2019 paper with Chenbo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked whether Dong had admitted that her husband had impersonated participants, Labroo wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>My understanding is that Ping and her husband are separate entities, and the Psych Science is different research from Pings [sic] dissertation. What Ping may or may not say about her husband also would be heresay [sic]. So I am not sure about the extent of relevance of this question to an investigation about Pings actions with respect to her dissertation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>At no stage did the University of Toronto reach out to me or ask me anything about this investigation, so any reference to me in their report is pure heresay [sic]. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zhong has not responded to requests for comment, instead deferring to the University’s media relations office. A spokesperson for the university confirmed the existence of such an email, though declined to release any of the documents tendered at the tribunal’s hearing. </p>



<p>“The Tribunal’s reasons for the decision speak for themselves. The University is not in a position to provide further information,” the spokesperson added. </p>



<p>We were also unable to reach Dong, who was not present for the tribunal hearing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the report, Zhong told the tribunal that in August 2019, he noticed Dong had restricted access to the data for the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> paper after editors of the journal had requested a copy for data maintenance purposes. That same month, Zhong consulted a data scientist, Marcel van Assen, to help investigate the paper. Van Assen “concluded that the issues went beyond mere ‘questionable research practices’ and indicated possible misconduct,” the report stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month later, the editors at the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> told Zhong and the university’s research integrity office that there were “credible concerns” about the paper published in the journal. The university began investigating the paper in 2020 and found Dong had fabricated or manipulated data to support her hypothesis and had destroyed data to avoid detection. Zhong requested a retraction after the findings of the university’s investigation. Dong <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/47/4/632/5919265">never responded</a> to the concerns, according to the retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tribunal’s case summary also <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550614542344">cites a third paper connected</a> to Dong’s thesis, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science,</em> although it gives no indication whether the paper was ever investigated by the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christian Unkelbach, the editor of <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> and Margo Monteith, the former editor, said they had not been contacted by the university — nor by Zhong or a concerned reader, as the other editors had — about the paper. Unkelbach said in an email to Retraction Watch that he considers this “an omission by the University of Toronto if they have reason to suspect fraudulent behavior that led to the results in Dong et al. (2015).”</p>



<p>He added if Zhong, or others mentioned in the tribunal’s findings, were able to provide evidence of data fabrication or manipulation in the paper, the journal would take action to protect the integrity of the scientific record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the case summary, Dong also used her “improperly” obtained degree to secure a tenure-track position at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management — a position she <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/09/19/northwestern-psychology-researcher-out-following-retraction/">abruptly left</a> less than a year after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/11/28/psychology-journal-to-retract-study-claiming-that-people-fear-contagion-less-in-the-dark/">earning the retraction in <em>Psychological Science</em></a>. Apart from the two retractions related to her thesis work, Dong has an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/41/3/697/2907534">additional two</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/46/1/53/5035292?redirectedFrom=fulltext">retractions</a> and <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1070#">a correction</a>.</p>
