              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/one-photon-photosynthesis-light">One photon is all it takes to kick off photosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>For photosynthesis, one photon is all it takes.</p>



<p>Only a single particle of light is required to<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06121-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spark the first steps</a> of the biological process that converts light into chemical energy, scientists report June 14 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>While scientists have long assumed that the reactions of photosynthesis begin upon the absorption of just one photon, that hadn’t yet been demonstrated, says physical chemist Graham Fleming, of the University of California, Berkeley. He and colleagues decided “we would just look to see was it really true that one photon was enough to start the whole thing off.”</p>





<p>The sunlight that falls on Earth’s surface seems brilliant to human eyes. But on small scales, that translates to a dribble of photons. Only a few tens of photons of the appropriate wavelengths of sunlight fall on a square nanometer per second, the scale of the tiny chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll molecules that are central to photosynthesis in plants and bacteria.</p>



<p>Many laboratory experiments on photosynthesis use lasers, much more powerful light sources, to kick off the reactions. Instead, Graham and colleagues used a source of light that produces just two photons at a time. One photon served as a herald, going off to a detector to let researchers know when two photons were released. The other photon went into a solution containing photon-absorbing structures from the photosynthetic bacterium <em>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</em>. These structures, called light-harvesting 2 complexes, or LH2, are made up of two rings of bacteriochlorophyll and other molecules.</p>



<p>In a normal photosynthesis reaction, LH2 absorbs a photon and passes its energy to another LH2 complex, and then another, like a game of hot potato. Eventually the energy reaches another type of ring, called the light-harvesting 1 complex, or LH1, which then passes it to the reaction center where the energy is finally converted into a form that the bacterium can use.</p>



<p>In the experiment, there was no LH1, so the LH2 instead emitted a photon of a different wavelength than the first, a sign that energy had been transferred from the first ring of LH2 to the second, a first step of photosynthesis. The researchers detected that second photon, and by comparing the detection times to those of the initial herald photons, confirmed that the LH2 needed to absorb only one photon to kick things off.</p>



<p>Plants and bacteria use different processes for photosynthesis, but the initial steps are similar enough that in plants, too, a single photon would set off the initial steps, Fleming says. However, in plants, multiple independently absorbed photons are needed in order to complete the reaction.</p>



<p>The role of single photons isn’t surprising, says biochemist Richard Cogdell of the University of Glasgow in Scotland. The important thing the researchers have done, he says, is to demonstrate the new technique. “By doing this you’re able to essentially interrogate what will be happening in nature,” he says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Some scientists suspect that photosynthesis <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/algae-use-quantum-trick-harvest-light">relies on quantum physics</a> (<em>SN: 2/3/10</em>). While it’s not clear whether the new technique could resolve the role of quantum effects, it could help scientists disentangle natural effects from artifacts of using intense sources of light in studies of photosynthesis.</p>



<p>“You can really work out what’s happening in the early reactions in photosynthesis as it were outside,” says Cogdell, “[as if] you could shrink yourself down and watch these photons moving around.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polyester-bees-brew-beer-scented-baby-food">‘Polyester bees’ brew beer-scented baby food in plastic cribs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Female <em>Ptiloglossa</em> bees are single moms with a lot to do and little time. Fortunately, they can use a feathery tongue to make infant-care plastics and then brew up batches of baby food.</p>



<p>“We jokingly call them polyester bees,” says pollination ecologist Stephen Buchmann of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>Chemically, the bee-made plastic is a cousin of human-made polyesters. A big gland on a female’s abdomen secretes Tinkertoy-like molecules of repeating lactone compounds, each with its “ester” structural bit that gives polyester its name.</p>

Inside each she starts a batch of fermenting pollen from <em>Solanum</em> nightshade flowers (middle), watery nectar from <em>Agave</em> (far left) and bacteria. The microbes add nutrition and a boozy fragrance.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125277">Bill Singleton</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The stuff makes the finishing touch for little urn-shaped nursery chambers that mother bees dig underground. They use their paintbrush tongues to lick up the gland secretion and slather it on nursery walls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plastic layer is transparent, tough and “can be kind of crunchy,” Buchmann says. It’s “thought to keep the brood chamber area nice and cozy, high-humidity and also to keep out the bad guys.”</p>





<p>These moms are doomsday preppers. In the <em>P. arizonensis</em> Buchmann studies in Arizona, females have only a few weeks to fill plastic retreats with all the food each youngster needs for much of a year underground before its own, brief reproductive frenzy in sunlight. Each generation of big, fast-flying bees grows up floating in, and feeding on, nothing but mom’s limited-edition brew of nectar and pollen — which smells like beer.</p>



<p>Many other bee species mix their baby food of pollen and nectar to “a kind of Play-Doh consistency,” Buchmann says. “Poke it and it dents.” Food stored in a cellophane bee nest, however, is different.</p>



<p>Open and tilt a nursery of baby <em>Ptiloglossa</em> bees “and all this stuff would run out it’s so watery,” Buchmann says. That’s probably because of the unusually watery nectar these polyester bees collect. Much of it comes from the candelabra-shaped bloom spikes of agave plants, runny enough for easy slurping by bats in southeastern Arizona and Sonora, Mexico.</p>



<p>To see what’s in the beer-scented brew, bee microbiome researcher Tobin Hammer of the University of California, Irvine, recruited Buchmann to collect several plastic-making <em>P. arizonensis</em> bees as well as relatives in the larger group called cellophane bees. Collecting the bees, their brood cells, food gatherings and source flowers took several years, mostly of waiting. Bees fly aboveground only a few weeks a year, and then for only about two hours around dawn.</p>



<p>“Quite shocking,” is Buchmann’s summary of what he found. Despite the beery smell of the food that <em>P. arizonensis </em>puts in the plastic vats, he says, “lo and behold, no yeast!”</p>



<p>These bees’ microbial fermenters didn’t evolve anywhere in the vast fungal kingdom. Instead, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10113673/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fermenters are mostly lactic acid bacteria</a>, Hammer, Buchmann and colleagues reported April 5 in <em>Frontiers in Microbiology.</em> The bees’ baby food glop is not yeasty beer but, Hammer says, closer to yogurt or sauerkraut.</p>

<p>Buchmann doubts that young bees take moms’ bacterial culture along when they leave home. Youngsters go through much of their early growth without pooping as far as bee science knows. Then they defecate “all at once,” Buchmann says. This clears the gut of the microbes, and the ejected wastes get separated from the youngster as it wraps itself in silk for its next stage of life. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The aboveground world that youngsters eventually join offers plenty of replacement bacteria. It flourishes in flowers — or “plant genitals,” as Buchmann calls them in his new book <em>What a Bee Knows</em>. Somehow the variety of microbes bees encounter gets winnowed down for baby food, lab analyses suggest. Just how is still an open question.<strong></strong></p>



<p>What the great coming-of-age poop does resolve for human sensibilities is the thought of how bee larvae without diapers can feed month after month on food they’re floating in.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781538709863" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the Blood</a><br><em>Charles Barber</em><br><em>Grand Central Publishing, $29</em></p>



<p>The average human body holds about 5 liters of blood. Lose a liter, and you may go into shock. Lose two more, and you’ll probably die.</p>



<p>For doctors treating traumatic injuries, keeping a patient’s blood in their body is “one of the most fundamental problems of survival,” <a href="https://charlesbarberwriting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Barber</a> writes in his fast-paced new book, <em>In the Blood</em>.</p>



<p>Solutions to that problem haven’t changed all that much in centuries. Doctors can pack a wound with gauze or put pressure on blood vessels to slow bleeding. While other areas of medicine have leaped ahead over time, Barber notes, emergency medicine has largely stood still, an inertia that’s had deadly consequences. Some 50,000 people in the United States bleed to death every year.</p>





<p>You’d think, then, that a product that can stanch bleeding would be celebrated in the streets, snapped up immediately by military doctors and emergency rooms alike. You’d be wrong. <em>In the Blood </em>chronicles the invention and bafflingly slow adoption of QuikClot and its successors, inexpensive clotting agents that can stop big bleeds in minutes. Barber, who’s also written about criminal justice and mental health, leads readers on the path from product invention to implementation — and it’s a treacherous journey.</p>



<p>Barber starts his story, which races like a thriller, in Mogadishu, Somalia, at the scene of the 1993 battle that inspired the movie <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. After two American helicopters were shot down, John Holcomb, then a U.S. Army major, and other doctors treated dozens of injured soldiers, many of whom died from loss of blood.</p>



<p>That horrific experience electrified Holcomb. Better hemorrhage control was urgently needed, and he was the man to lead the charge. In 2002, Holcomb became head of the Army Institute of Surgical Research, a research laboratory focused on improving combat casualty care. Holcomb championed the development of different clotting candidates, including HemCon, a bandage containing a shrimp-shell chemical, and Factor Seven, an injected drug that boosts the body’s clotting capability, sometimes lethally, it turned out.</p>



<p>In Barber’s telling of the story, Holcomb’s character is complex, shifting between savior and villain. Under his watch, the Army poured millions of dollars into his favorite products. It’s hard to grasp what motivated Holcomb, but Barber argues that he was long unwilling to consider other options — like QuikClot — data be damned. QuikClot seemed to be more effective than the rest. But it didn’t come with a big Army budget or a biotech company’s backing. It was born in an inventor’s basement.</p>



<p>The inventor was Frank Hursey, a mild-mannered engineer from Connecticut who discovered in 1983 that the ground-up mineral zeolite could mop up the water in blood. By concentrating the molecules involved in clotting, Hursey’s invention sped up the process. In 1999, he partnered with “swashbuckling salesman” Bart Gullong, who helped develop and promote the product. Barber pulls readers into their adventure, though he occasionally meanders too far into their backstories.</p>



<p>The action picks up when Barber digs into the evidence behind different clotting agents. He describes clear-cut animal tests, moving accounts from soldiers in the field and reports linking Factor Seven to stroke, heart attack and death. A central question of the book, then, is not so much “How do you stop a hemorrhage?” as “How do you get a hemorrhage-stopping product to the people who need it?”</p>



<p>Hursey and Gullong were up against entrenched military and pharmaceutical interests from the get-go. The company that produced Factor Seven aggressively marketed the drug, Barber reveals, even in the face of its flaws. It’s clear that he is rooting for the underdogs. He lays out facts for readers like a mason placing bricks, building a solid case against a system where money sways whether a medical product gets used. Even when the data suggest it shouldn’t.</p>



<p>In 2008, Holcomb finally recommended an improved version of Hursey’s invention, called QuikClot Combat Gauze, for use in the military, “an almost unimaginable victory,” Barber writes. In recent years, QuikClot gauze has made its way into hospitals, and consumers can now buy it on Amazon for $18.99. </p>



<p>Though Hursey remains largely unknown, Barber calls his discovery “paradigm-shifting.” Hursey “took bleeding control largely out of the hands of doctors,” Barber writes, “and put it into the hands of police officers, EMTs, adventurers, soldiers, hikers, and moms and dads.”</p>

<p>One of the first studies of long COVID has been retracted and replaced seven months after editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/01/buzzy-lancet-long-covid-paper-under-investigation-for-data-errors/">marked it with an expression of concern</a> citing “data errors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original paper, “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32656-8/fulltext#section-3d6acba1-acea-4be2-8dc9-b7e14e5b6583">6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study</a>,” was published in <em>The Lancet</em> in January 2021. It was “the first large cohort study with 6-months’ follow-up” of people hospitalized with COVID-19, according to an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673621004463#bib1">editorial</a> published simultaneously, and has been cited more than 2,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The World Health Organization, for example, <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/97337498/policy-documents">cited it</a> in several documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last November, the article <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02370-4/fulltext">received an expression of concern</a> stating that a researcher had contacted the journal about inconsistencies between that study and a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01755-4/fulltext">paper</a> published in August 2021, also in <em>The Lancet</em>, describing the same cohort of patients after one year of follow up.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127303"></span>



<p>“In view of the extent of these data errors,” the notice stated, the journal editors issued the expression of concern while they conducted a review of corrected data the paper’s authors had submitted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the expression of concern, the work was cited by some 400 other papers.</p>



<p>After their investigation, the editors decided to retract the article and replace it with a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00810-3/fulltext#%20">corrected version</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01175-3/fulltext">notice</a> about the action published June 9.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction and replacement notice describes the steps the journal editors took in their investigation, which involved statistical review of the data changes the authors requested, a clinician’s review of the differences between the 6-month and 1-year follow-up questionnaires, review of the Chinese versions of the questionnaires by <em>The Lancet</em>’s China editors, and asking the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, with which corresponding author Bin Cao is affiliated, to verify the corrected data. All aspects of the investigation turned out in favor of the authors. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given these results, we invited a resubmission with the corrected data, and organised formal peer review of the fully revised paper with the corrected data by all the previous clinical reviewers and the statistical reviewer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cao, who <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990488/">has been described</a> as “a leading researcher in pneumonia and influenza” who “has been instrumental in increasing knowledge about COVID-19,” did not immediately respond to our request for comment. [See update at end of post.]</p>



<p>Last year, <em>The Lancet</em>’s impact factor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/28/the-lancet-more-than-doubles-its-impact-factor-eclipsing-nejm-for-the-first-time-ever/">surpassed</a> that of the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, long the top-ranked medical journal, in large part due to the papers it published about COVID-19, five of which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">have been retracted</a>. One of those articles <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-controversial-hydroxychloroquine-study/">was retracted</a> after sleuths questioned whether its data were real, and the company that sourced the data, Surgisphere, would not produce it for review.</p>



<p>Update, 6/14/23, 0000 UTC: Cao tells us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I really appreciate the comments from a reader about data and symptom questionnaire inconsistencies between 6-month and 1-year outcomes in hospital survivors with COVID-19. The comments help us reanalysis of both database and find the errors at last. Though the changes did not make difference of the conclusions, I replied the reader with great appreciation and emailed editor of the Lancet. When The Lancet published an Expression of Concern on Nov 24, 2022, I got much pressure from media, because the media guess the Concern means retraction. But as a physician scientist, I understand thevalidity of data is more important. We followed the gudieline of the Lancet to re-peer review all the data and questionnaire, even though we did not know whether we could republish the paper or not. The re-peer review is a long journey for me.</p>



<p>Now the readers who are interested in Long COVID can read the&nbsp;confirmed and corrected data from 6-month consequeces of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital. This cohort is unique because these patiens are those infected with original SARS-CoV-2 stran at the beginning of the pandemic. My colleagues and I are following these patients now and try to answer the question of long covid.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-planets-rare-red-dwarf-stars">Jupiter-sized planets are very rare around the least massive stars</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’re looking to visit a gas giant planet in another solar system — or if you’re simply a science fiction writer who needs such a world for your story — you’d better steer clear of little red stars.</p>



<p>A search for planets <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd349" data-type="URL" data-id="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Jupiter around low-mass red dwarf stars</a> came up empty, researchers report in the July <em>Astronomical Journal</em>. “Around 200 stars, we did not detect a single one of these planets,” says Emily Pass, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>





<p>The find — or lack thereof — lends support to a theory of giant-planet building called core accretion. In this theory, gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn form by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-planet-newly-discovered-gas-dust-formation">gradually piecing together a solid core</a> out of debris orbiting a young star (<em>SN: 4/14/22</em>). That core eventually gets massive enough to attract lots of gas. But low-mass red dwarf stars shouldn’t host much solid material to begin with, so a paucity of gas giants is in line with that theory.</p>



<p>About three out of every four stars in the galaxy are red dwarfs, a type of star <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-cool-surface-temperature-failure-lasting-success">much fainter, cooler and smaller than the sun</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/21</em>). They glow dimly because they were born with little mass, about eight to 60 percent that of the sun. Previous planet searches have found that few red dwarfs have gas giant planets. But the new search targeted red dwarfs with only 10 to 30 percent of the sun’s mass, which are the most common such stars.</p>



<p>Pass and colleagues spent about six years searching for the Doppler shift an orbiting planet would cause in starlight as the world pulled its sun toward and away from us. All the observed stars are nearby, within 50 light-years of Earth. The closest is the well-studied Barnard’s Star, just six light-years away, which was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/other-worlds-other-planets">once thought to possess two Jupiter-sized planets</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>4/26/69</em>).</p>



<p>But no gas giants turned up around that star or any of the others. Extrapolating to the rest of the galaxy, the researchers conclude that fewer than two out of every 100 low-mass red dwarfs have planets as massive as Jupiter.</p>



<p>“To actually form a Jupiter [around the lowest-mass stars] is very hard,” says Edward Bryant, an astronomer at University College London, who was not one of the researchers conducting the search. “Their lack of a detection of a Jupiter analog I think is very consistent with the expectations from core accretion.” Because the disks of gas and dust around infant low-mass red dwarfs are small, there’s less material to create gas giants the size of Jupiter.</p>



<p>But smaller, rocky worlds stand a much better chance.</p>



<p>In fact, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many red dwarfs do have Earth-sized planets</a>, some at the right distances from their suns to sport pleasant temperatures. “We are talking about strange new worlds, not an Earth 2.0,” Pass says.</p>



<p>In our solar system, she says, Jupiter’s gravity may have prevented lots of ice from reaching Earth. As a result, our world didn’t end up completely underwater. In a planetary system lacking such a massive gas giant, an Earth-sized planet could turn into a water world that might still give rise to a highly intelligent species, but one that would live underwater — think dolphins — and not do any astronomy at all.</p>



<p>“It’s not saying that you can’t have life on these planets,” Pass says. “But those planets are just going to be so different than our own experiences.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/camouflaging-wheat-smell-pest-control">Camouflaging wheat with a wheat smell could be a new approach to pest control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Now you smell it, now you don’t. Or do you? Used correctly, a little misdirection could help keep mice away from freshly planted wheat seeds. </p>



<p>Camouflaging wheat seeds can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01127-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce seed loss</a> by more than 60 percent, scientists report May 22 in <em>Nature Sustainability. </em>All it takes is to make the whole field smell like wheat.</p>



<p>Rodents, including mice, are responsible for nibbling away at 70 million metric tons of cereals every year. Some of that munching takes place in Australia, where, when the weather is right, house mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) can reach plague proportions — skittering hordes of more than 1,000 mice per hectare, says Peter Banks, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sydney. There are so many mice on the road, he says, no one can avoid them. “It&#8217;s like driving on bubble wrap.”</p>





<p>When farmers plant wheat, mice go down the rows, sniffing out the seeds under the soil and digging them up. Usually, farmers overrun with mice turn to poisons such as zinc phosphide, which changes to phosphine gas in a mouse’s stomach. Unfortunately, it’s hard to make any poison appealing enough to make mice ignore the wheat buffet, and farmers are having to use more and more of it, says Steve Henry, a rodent ecologist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Canberra, Australia, who was not involved in the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What if the mice couldn’t sniff out the grains at all? Banks and his colleague Finn Parker, also a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sydney, have been working on olfactory camouflage — covering scents with, well, more scents. The technique started with invasive predators who hunt for threatened bird nests by smelling them out. “We thought, well, if we put those odors everywhere, how on Earth can they then find out where the nests actually are,” Banks says.</p>



<p>Banks, Parker and their colleagues had been using mice to study olfactory camouflage in the lab. When Banks saw a photo of the holes mice were digging into grain fields, “I thought, they&#8217;re finding those seeds by smell. And so can we use the same idea in that system?”</p>



<p>Before or during sowing, the scientists sprayed mouse-riddled test plots with wheat germ oil, a byproduct of wheat processing that is usually used in cosmetics and animal feed. The oils are the most nutritious parts, Banks says, and the smell of the oils is “what [the mice] are using to find the seeds beneath the ground.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="506" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline.jpg" alt="An overhead photo of a series of holes dug into the ground in three rows with vegetation in between the rows." class="wp-image-3125097" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline-515x383.jpg 515w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline-605x450.jpg 605w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline-250x186.jpg 250w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline-263x197.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3125097">These tiny holes are big problem. Each hole here is a stolen wheat seed that a mouse sniffed and dug out of the soil.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125097">Peter Banks</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Two weeks after the seeds had been sown, plots that had been hosed down with oil before sowing had 74 percent fewer mouse holes—from an average of around 125 holes per plot to fewer than 30. Plots that got the oil during sowing had 63 percent fewer holes — from around 125 to fewer than 40 stolen seeds. When the plots got oil before sowing, Parker says, the mice “were coming, they&#8217;re seeking food, and they were just finding nothing.” In that case when the seeds went into the ground, the mice may have already learned not to bother with that plot. When the oil was delivered during sowing, it became harder for the animals to find the wheat seeds they were seeking.</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s one of the most elegant parts of it,” Henry says. “Saturating the area with the smell of wheat.” The challenge, he notes, will be getting farmers to adopt it. The test was done on a 27-hectare wheat crop, but farmers in Australia are often planting 6,000 hectares or more. They’d need a way to apply the wheat germ oil at the time of planting, when they already have a lot to manage.</p>



<p>And the camouflage probably won’t be enough on its own, Henry says. “I don&#8217;t see it as replacing bait, but I see this another tool in the shed that will really help.”</p>

<p>The sheriff of Franklin County, Ohio, has received an order to seize and sell property of Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University in Columbus, to pay his nearly $1.1 million debt to lawyers who represented him in failed libel and defamation suits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last December, a judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/09/judge-orders-osu-cancer-researcher-to-pay-1-million-to-lawyers-from-failed-libel-suit/">ordered Croce to pay $1,098,642.80</a>, plus interest, to <a href="https://www.keglerbrown.com/">Kegler Brown Hill &amp; Ritter</a>, which was one of the firms that represented him in his <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/19/osu-cancer-researcher-carlo-croce-loses-appeal-of-new-york-times-libel-suit/">libel lawsuit</a> against the <em>New York Times</em> and his <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/13/cancer-researcher-loses-defamation-suit-against-critic/">defamation case</a> against David Sanders, a researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He lost both cases, and the firm <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/26/law-firm-sues-osu-cancer-researcher-for-900000-in-unpaid-fees-following-failed-libel-suit/">sued him</a> for $900,000 in unpaid fees. Croce also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/18/embattled-cancer-researcher-loses-legal-bid-to-be-reinstated-as-department-chair-at-osu/">lost a suit</a> against Ohio State in which he sought to regain his post as chair of his department after the university removed him. </p>



<span id="more-127297"></span>



<p>Croce’s <a href="https://fcdcfcjs.co.franklin.oh.us/CaseInformationOnline/caseSearch?ReOlVBGXxHM46lu2Uk2X">appeal of the December judgment</a> is still in process, but in January the court <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/another-denial.pdf">denied</a> his request for a temporary stay of execution, meaning garnishment and other enforcement of the judgment can continue unless Croce can provide a surety bond or letter of credit for the full amount of the judgment, plus 18 months worth of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Croce and his current lawyer, Andrew Mills Holford of Johrendt &amp; Holford, and Maria M. Guthrie of Kegler Brown, who was representing the firm in its case against the researcher, did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the judgment was issued, the court garnished Croce’s bank accounts, and Ohio State has been garnishing his wages since March by about <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230606-garnishment.pdf">$15,600 each month</a>, or about 25% of his paycheck. As we have previously reported, Croce earns <a href="https://apps.hr.osu.edu/salaries/Home/Salaries?Firstname=carlo&amp;Lastname=croce&amp;Funding=University&amp;WhichSource=Salaries&amp;Year=0&amp;IsValid=True">more than $800,000</a> per year at OSU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 12, the state of Ohio issued a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230512-writ-of-execution.pdf">writ of execution</a> to the sheriff of Franklin County, in which Columbus is located, ordering that Croce’s “goods and chattels” be sold to pay his debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The court’s records include an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230508-artwork-exhibit.pdf">itemized list</a> of Croce’s extensive artwork collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On June 2, Croce filed a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230602-request-for-hearing.pdf">request for a hearing</a> that stated “I believe that some or all of my property may be exempt from execution in the above case.”</p>



<p>We count <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCroce%252c%2bCarlo%2bM">14 retractions</a> for Croce, as well as many corrections and expressions of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another firm that represented Croce is also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/arnold-v-croce.pdf">suing him for unpaid legal fees</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference </a> (fast forward to minute 31) and have been lightly edited for length and format. This is the second of four blogs on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change.<br><br>One of the main reasons why I joined PLOS more than five years ago was its founding principle:&nbsp; An organization established by practicing scientists and dedicated to transforming science communication. We believe it&rsquo;s necessary to fundamentally rethink how we share and consume research based on two key principles:</p>



<ul><li>First, we must continue to move beyond the constraints of the physical format and take advantage of the opportunities provided by the digital world.</li><li>Beyond technology, we must upend archaic systems of funding, reward, and recognition, to honor values like collaboration,<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> inclusion</a>, and transparency.</li></ul>



<p>I&rsquo;m proud to say that PLOS is one of the earliest pioneers in the Open Science publishing space. When we started 23 years ago, as a non-profit, with the mission of accelerating progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication, many in our industry thought we wouldn&rsquo;t survive. As you can tell, we are alive and well, and thriving.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://plos.org/about/">Over the 20 years since our first journal launch</a> we&rsquo;ve helped prove the viability of Open Access. Despite the evolving conversation about how best to achieve it, it&rsquo;s now mainstream.</li><li>We changed the publishing landscape with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information"><em>PLOS ONE,</em></a> enabling all rigorous, peer-reviewed research to be published and discoverable.</li><li>We helped focus the conversation about peer review on <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">rigor and transparency</a>. More people now understand how impact-seeking should never be at the expense of these notions.</li><li>Via a wide range of solutions, we&rsquo;ve worked towards <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">Open Science</a> at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the entire research communication process.</li></ul>



<p>More recently, we&rsquo;ve expanded our portfolio with titles focused on critical challenges outlined in the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>, and signed the UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact. Our intention is to create new and diverse communities of practice, who will, in turn, shape how we address the most pressing health and environmental issues facing our society. </p>



<p>My optimism is also fueled by the range of more radical start-ups entering this space, like <a href="https://www.arcadiascience.com/">Arcadia Science</a>, a new research organization building open science principles into their foundations<strong>,</strong> including reimagining the publishing process from the ground up.</p>



<p><strong>What PLOS Is Doing</strong></p>



<p>Like Arcadia, we have never been driven by tradition<strong>, </strong>but by a willingness to question the status quo and an eagerness to explore how we can improve the system. First, we&rsquo;ve delivered change by embracing progressive improvements to science communication while maintaining its core principles such as transparency, inclusion, and collaboration.</p>



<p>Some of this is about technology. Sadly, the publishing industry has largely digitized existing processes without attempting to imagine alternative solutions. Put simply, most of the industry is still print-first even when there is no print output.</p>



<p>Capturing the potential of digital technologies was fundamental to the vision of PLOS&rsquo; founders. And we&rsquo;ve done that. Fast forward 20 years into the era of big data. Science can now address complex research questions in unprecedented ways. But this requires access to and publication of all supporting data as a norm.</p>



<p>We were the first publisher to introduce a <a href="https://everyone.plos.org/2014/02/24/plos-new-data-policy-public-access-data-2/">data sharing requirement</a> back in 2014 &ndash; and yes, it had its detractorsin the early days. But the policy has been tremendously successful and hasn&rsquo;t encountered the negative consequences that many predicted. It also demonstrated the value of sharing data and gave researchers another way of demonstrating their impact. The sheer scale of introducing a change like this in a journal the size of <em>PLOS ONE</em> has also helped to normalize the sharing of data. We&rsquo;ve built on this with other progressive, values-driven solutions.</p>



<p>PLOS journals have always welcomed submissions with associated preprints, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 2016 that we formalized our support in journal policy and began <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/">accepting incoming direct transfers from bioRxiv</a>. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/02/plos-cold-spring-harbor-preprint-agreement-biorxiv/">In 2018, we expanded that partnership and made it a 2-way street</a>. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">Authors</a> could now have their manuscripts forwarded to bioRxiv as part of the PLOS submission process, instead of two separate submissions. Since then, we&rsquo;ve launched similar partnerships with other preprint servers, like <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/expanding-medrxiv-at-plos/">medRxiv</a> and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">earthRxiv</a>. By simplifying the process, we&rsquo;ve seen consistent growth in preprint posting over time.</p>



<p><strong>Code and Methods Sharing</strong></p>



<p>A second example sought to address one of the key barriers to reproducibility: the poor reporting and sharing of methods. PLOS partnered with <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> in 2017 to <em>encourage</em> sharing of reusable step-by-step protocols on the platform. But fewer than 1% of authors used this option. So, we sought to better understand why through interviews with researchers about their needs. Most importantly, we learned that expert feedback on protocols is important, as is wide accessibility. But it was also important to be able to receive credit for methods development, and to be able to version and modify protocols.</p>



<p>And so we went back to the drawing board to develop a new product, <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/">peer reviewed Lab Protocols.</a><strong> </strong>These combine a dynamic protocol in an easy-to-follow format with a peer-reviewed and published article.</p>



<p>One of the key overarching lessons from our work to date is that we&rsquo;re often dealing with challenges that are not, at heart, technological in nature.</p>



<p>One concrete example. Our internal research shows that scientists are happy with the options available to them to share their data. Yet most of them don&rsquo;t share data&ndash; the solution here is clearly not simply to build another system. The process of sharing is messy and takes time. Sometimes scientists don&rsquo;t know how. And we&rsquo;ve already learned that if there&rsquo;s no reward, busy scientists aren&rsquo;t going to invest the time.</p>



<p>Over the past 5 years we&rsquo;ve focused heavily on how to invite behavioral changes through our publishing process. Our thinking at PLOS has been informed by the classic diffusion theory of innovation, developed by E.M. Rogers in 1962. Essentially, this theory states that adoption of new ideas, behaviors and products doesn&rsquo;t happen simultaneously<strong>.</strong> Some individuals are more open to adaptation than others.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re using this to inform a portfolio approach, focusing on innovators and early adopters for newer ideas and opportunities. But if change is truly to happen, we also need to be thinking about how to bring along those who are more skeptical of change<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>For these groups, offering new features in our journals<strong> &ndash;</strong> a format they&rsquo;re comfortable with &ndash; is likely to be more successful. One fairly recent example here is our experiment with code sharing in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/"><em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></a>. As Jason Papin, co-editor in chief, put it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Code is the life-blood of research in our field. In order to truly build on the discoveries and advances in computational biology, we must be able to build on the work of others</p></blockquote>



<p>When we spoke to researchers in the field, we heard that sharing code <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800">signals confidence and integrity</a> on the part of the authors, which in turn supports trust in the community<strong>.</strong> And that they are ready and willing to open doors for fellow researchersby enabling them to more easily reuse or adapt scripts for their own studies, helping the whole field to advance more quickly.</p>



<p>Our team saw an opportunity to shift behavior by piloting a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">new journal policy<strong>.</strong></a> It would require authors to make public any code directly related to the results of their article upon publication. The proof of the experiment&rsquo;s success? In 2019 &ndash; before the policy was introduced &ndash; the rate of code sharing for articles in the journal was 53%. Not too bad, you might think &ndash; but looking at articles published after the policy was introduced, that number jumped to 87%. That was enough for us to make it a permanent policy. We&rsquo;re now focusing on code quality and reproducibility<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Behavioral Change</strong></p>



<p>Another model we&rsquo;re using at PLOS that influences how we approach behavioral change is one you may be familiar with. It&rsquo;s a comprehensive strategy developed <a href="https://www.cos.io/about/board#:~:text=Brian%20Nosek%20is%20Co%2Dfounder,at%20the%20University%20of%20Virginia.">by Brian Nosek, Executive Director of the Center for Open Science</a>, to help us understand the process of culture change and how we can accelerate it. The model helps us think about what&rsquo;s necessary at each level. For example, the Center for Open Science has done a lot to tackle the level of infrastructure through development of their <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> &ndash; a free, open-source application to support research workflows.</p>



<p>A wide variety of Open Access and data-sharing mandates from funders are driving a great deal of top-down change at the policy level. We&rsquo;re making notable headway at PLOS with the next level, &ldquo;making it easy&rdquo;, with much of the work I&rsquo;ve just described.</p>



<p>Other like-minded publishers are pushing on different parts of the problem. eLife recently announced that it will become &ldquo;a service that reviews preprints&rdquo;, getting rid of the standard &ldquo;accept or reject&rdquo; decision after review. This not only has the potential to begin decoupling peer review and publication, but also to speed up sharing of critical research. And it puts authors in charge of their journey.</p>



<p>Focusing on key decision points in the existing reward system such as this can have meaningful impacts. Over time, by nudging different elements of the publications system, we&rsquo;re moving closer to a system based on transparency and reproducibility.</p>



<p>Creating easier paths to Open Science practices in only one part of the equation. Next week, I&rsquo;ll talk about how institutional business models can also affect change at scale.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bowhead-whales-cancer-dna-repair">Bowhead whales may have a cancer-defying superpower: DNA repair</a></h4>

              
                <p>Near the northern tip of Alaska, on the outskirts of the Arctic Ocean, bowhead whales have given scientists a glimpse into longevity.</p>



<p>The gigantic marine mammals can live more than 200 years — and tissue samples collected from the animals reveal a fix-it superpower that might explain how. Bowhead whales’ cells are whizzes at <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.07.539748v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repairing damaged DNA</a>, scientists report May 8 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>That ability means the animals might mend damage that could otherwise lead to cancer-causing genetic glitches, says Orsolya Vincze, an evolutionary ecologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, who was not involved with the research. Scientists have previously reported other animals’ biological strategies for avoiding cancer. But the new work, Vincze says, “shows that the whales approach cancer resistance from a very new perspective.”</p>





<p>The bowhead whale,<em> </em><em>Balaena mysticetus</em>, can grow to roughly 18 meters long and is among the heaviest mammals on Earth. At more than 80,000 kilograms, it’s about the weight of six fully loaded school buses. All that body mass adds up to a vast number of cells. And every time a cell divides, there’s a chance that a dangerous mutation can arise.</p>



<p>But somehow, large-bodied animals are especially cancer resistant — a puzzle known as Peto’s paradox. That suggests the animals must “have much stronger cancer defenses,” says Lisa Abegglen, a cell biologist at the University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City who was not part of the new work.</p>



<p>Her team discovered that elephants, which can live nearly as long as humans and rarely die from cancer, have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephants-cancer-protection-secret-may-be-genes">extra copies of a tumor-blocking gene called <em>TP53</em></a> (<em>SN: 10/13/15</em>). This gene and another may help elephants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/resurrected-gene-may-protect-elephants-cancer">deal with DNA damage by clearing out afflicted cells</a>, other scientists have reported (<em>SN: 8/14/18</em>).</p>



<p>That’s one way to ward off trouble from damaged DNA, says Marc Tollis, an evolutionary biologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff who did not participate in the new study. Another strategy is to “take the hit,” he says, “and then try to fix it.”</p>



<p>Hints from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bowhead-whales-may-unlock-secrets-long-healthy-life">bowhead whale genome</a> published nearly a decade ago predicted that the mammals may use this alternate strategy (<em>SN: 1/6/15</em>). “But you need actual experiments to actually validate those predictions,” Tollis says.</p>



<p>In the lab, study coauthor Vera Gorbunova at the University of Rochester in New York and her colleagues ran an assortment of experiments on cells harvested from bowhead whale tissue, as well as on cells from humans, cows and mice.</p>



<p>The whale cells were both efficient and accurate at repairing double-strand breaks in DNA, damage that severs both strands of the DNA double helix. Whale repair restored broken DNA to like-new condition more often than cells from other mammals, the team found. In those animals, mends to the genome tended to be sloppier, like a poorly patched pair of jeans. The team also identified two proteins in bowhead whale cells, CIRBP and RPA2, that are part of the DNA repair crew.</p>



<p>Discovering how animals fend off cancer is “incredibly exciting,” Abegglen says, “because all of these strategies have potential to be translated into effective treatments for people with cancer.” Though that day may be far off, the new findings underscore the importance of studying animals with low cancer rates, she says. Abegglen wants to test whether the team’s results hold up in humpback whale and dolphin cells — or if those animals have different defenses.</p>



<p>There’s so much to learn from these and other animals with large bodies and long life spans, Vincze says.&nbsp; “We probably have the solution to cancer medicine out there in nature already,” she says. “We just have to find it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cyclone-swirling-uranus-north-pole-first">A cyclone has been spotted swirling over Uranus’ north pole for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Though it looks like a smooth, solid, pale blue orb, there’s more going on beneath the clouds of Uranus than meets the eye.</p>



<p>A polar <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL102872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyclone has been spotted at the planet&#8217;s north pole</a>, researchers report in the May 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. Observed with radio telescopes, the find is the first direct evidence of a cyclone on Uranus. A previous spacecraft flyby hinted at a similar storm at the planet’s south pole.</p>



<p>“It’s really exciting to see this polar structure come into view,” says Michael Roman, a planetary scientist at the University of Leicester in England who was not involved with the research. The observations “show a rather unique structure that we simply have never been able to study before.”</p>





<p>In 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft revealed winds at the center of Uranus’ south pole were moving faster than those in neighboring areas and were rotating. This evidence pointed to something dynamic like a cyclone occurring at the pole. But the spacecraft’s instruments weren’t sensitive enough to confirm the storm.</p>



<p>In recent years, as the north pole of Uranus turned more toward Earth, scientists were able to probe the other side of the ice giant, where they spotted similar hints of a swirling storm. Using the Very Large Array radio observatory in New Mexico, planetary scientist Alex Akins and colleagues probed the temperature under the clouds for more atmospheric clues. “What we saw with the VLA was kind of the last piece of [evidence],” says Akins, of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New thermal emission observations from 2021 and 2022 show a spot on the north pole where the gas beneath the clouds is warmer and drier than its surroundings, suggesting the presence of a low-pressure region in the midst of those spinning winds. “These contrasts look similar to what we see in hurricanes on Earth,” Akins says.</p>



<p>Excluding Mercury, all the planets in our solar system have now been observed to host <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/huge-cyclone-churns-saturns-north-pole">some kind of swirling air mass</a> at their poles (<em>SN: 10/14/08</em>).</p>



<p>Akins plans to continue to observe the cyclone to see how it changes. Previous observations from 2015 suggest it is growing stronger. Researchers wouldn’t expect Uranus’ atmospheric circulation to change on such a relatively short timescale, Akins says, so a continued strengthening of the storm would suggest there’s more to learn about how the planet’s atmosphere works.</p>



<p>In 2022, experts brought together by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-decadal-survey-uranus-enceladus-astrobiology">recommended NASA send a probe to Uranus</a> (<em>SN: 4/20/22</em>). “The more we can learn about Uranus as we begin to plan a mission,” Roman says, “the better we can focus our planning for that mission.”</p>

<p>Thirty randomized clinical trials involving a researcher in Egypt who has already had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dAbd-Elsalam%252c%2bSherief">six papers retracted</a> show signs of research misconduct and data fabrication, according to the authors of a <a href="https://osf.io/vjcnp/">recent preprint</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/ben-w-mol">Ben Mol</a>, one of the authors of the preprint and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Monash University in Australia, has spent several years investigating the work of <a href="http://tdb2.tanta.edu.eg/staff/SheriefAbd-Elsalam">Sherief Abd-Elsalam</a>, a hepatologist and gastroenterologist at Tanta University in Egypt. Abd-Elsalam denies that his research is false or fabricated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol has been exposing research misconduct in his own field for years. His work <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">revealed dozens of dodgy obstetrics papers</a> by Ahmed <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/10/critics-face-legal-threats-as-journal-takes-more-than-three-years-to-act/">Badawy</a> and Hatem <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/08/ob-gyn-loses-phd-after-committee-finds-he-made-up-research/">Abu Hashim</a> of Mansoura University, in Egypt, as well as serious problems with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/18/ob-gyn-who-called-criticism-racist-and-hate-speech-earns-retraction-several-expressions-of-concern/">clinical trials led by Ahmed Maged</a> at Cairo University, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data/?shared=email&amp;msg=fail">research about c-sections</a> also from Cairo University, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/20/urologist-blames-big-pharma-as-concerns-mount-over-his-research/">urology research</a> by Iranian researcher Mohammad Reza Safarinejad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abd-Elsalam <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abd-Elsalam-Full-Response.pdf">said in an emai</a>l that he disagrees with the allegations in the preprint. “Where is the problem? We don’t know,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127287"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mol began to question the integrity of Abd-Elsalam’s work after noticing a number of suspicious randomized controlled trials (RCTs) he helped conduct on controversial COVID-19 treatments including ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and the antiviral favipiravir.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four of the seven COVID-19 papers that list Abd-Elsalam as an author have been retracted so far, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/23/groups-second-paper-on-potential-treatments-for-covid-19-is-retracted/">we reported</a> earlier. The retraction notices cite data overlaps, inadequate data validation, and doubts about the randomization process as reasons for the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abd-Elsalam is the first author in three of the four retracted papers:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/103/4/article-p1635.xml"><em>Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study</em></a></li>



<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-021-04956-9"><em>Efficacy of favipiravir in COVID-19 treatment: a multi-center randomized study</em></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/106/3/article-p886.xml"><em>Remdesivir Efficacy in COVID-19 Treatment: A Randomized Controlled Trial</em></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14787210.2021.1950532"><em>Efficacy of combined Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia: a multicenter Egyptian study</em></a></li>
</ul>



<p>Abd-Elsalam has also earned a retraction for a non-RCT paper because of data fabrication; he disagreed with the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-017-3573-0"><em>Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for treatment of cirrhotic patients with genotype 4 hepatitis C virus in real-life clinical practice</em></a></li>
</ul>



<p>Mol’s preprint had originally included a double-up of one of Abd-Elsalam’s papers in the appendix listing his retracted work. The duplication was amended following our reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Seeing the extent of the problematic COVID-19 RCTs led Mol to investigate Abd-Elsalam’s other work.&nbsp;The preprint, which was posted in March, details all 30 RCTs Mol and his co-authors found searching PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus for papers describing clinical trials and listing Abd-Elsalam as an author. Out of the 30, seven are the RCTs on COVID-19 and the rest are in the field of gastroenterology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publications flagged by the authors have been cited more than 1,200 times. To date, just one of the gastroenterology papers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8867223/">has been retracted</a>. As a consequence, clinicians might be giving misinformed advice to patients, according to Mol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The preprint includes a series of allegations about data fabrication, inconsistencies and plagiarism in the 30 RCTs. For example, Mol and his colleagues showed that in nine of the gastroenterology studies the recruitment start date in the trial registration and the published paper were inconsistent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another detail the authors found striking among 15 of the RCTs is that they reported no drop-outs, despite some having long follow-up periods and patients with terminal illnesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The instances of data fabrication allegedly include a number of highly unlikely <em>P</em>-values among the papers. The authors decided to recalculate them by performing a comparison of means and concluded they were incorrect in nine of the RCTs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also noticed unusual data in tables reporting patient characteristics. For example, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/Abstract/2019/03000/A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_Comparing.23.aspx">one paper published in 2019</a> had 40 binary variable categories and 36 of them were even – a result which has a 0.00000929% probability of happening by chance, according to the preprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It goes on and on and on,” Mol said. “It is full of these mistakes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In his emailed response to the allegations, Abd-Elsalam wrote: “I am not sure what I did that …led them to conclude that there are concerns regarding the trials I participated in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added that the non-COVID-19 articles were mostly thesis papers, and claimed that he was listed as an author because of his writing skills.</p>



<p>In October 2022 and February 2023, Mol contacted Abd-Elsalam to share his findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe I see it wrong, maybe there’s an explanation, maybe he also regrets it and decides to retract his own work,” Mol said. “But he basically denied it all and didn’t respond very seriously, so here we are.”</p>



<p>After getting in touch with several editors, some were swifter than others in responding to Mol’s concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-021-04956-9">Efficacy of favipiravir in COVID-19 treatment: a multi-center randomized study</a>,” published in <em>Archives of Virology </em>in January 2021, received an editor’s note citing an investigation into the article in August 2021, and a subsequent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-021-05307-4">retraction</a> in November 2021. The paper has been cited 146 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Tim Skern is the journal’s editor-in-chief and also a co-author on the preprint analyzing the 30 RCTs. According to an email exchange shared by Mol, Skern wrote to Anna Lockhart, a senior editor of medicine and life science journals at Springer, expressing his concern about a second paper published in <em>Archives of Virology </em>in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-020-04639-x">High success rates for the use of sofosbuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + ribavirin and sofosbuvir/simeprevir/daclatasvir + ribavirin in retreatment of chronic hepatitis C infection after unsuccessful sofosbuvir/daclatasvir therapy: a real-life experience</a>,” has been cited eight times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an April 2022 email to Lockhart, Skern wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is clear from the analyses of two other expert statisticians that the following paper is not trustworthy (real terms fabricated) and must be retracted …</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also asked her to attach an editor’s note to the paper saying that it’s under investigation. The paper does not currently have the note. Anna Lockhart did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In April 2023, Mol shared his findings with the editors of the <em>European Journal of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology</em>, a Wolters Kluwer title, which published six of the RCTs included in the analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead publisher for medical journals at Wolters Kluwer, Phil Daly, responded with follow-up queries but to date none of the six papers has been retracted or received an expression of concern. Daly did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol and his co-authors have written to the editors of the journals which have published 10 of the 30 RCTs, not including those of the retracted papers. The only response they’ve received is the one from Wolters Kluwer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The journals don’t all respond, that is unbelievable for me,” he said. “I increasingly find that everybody is looking away from it and we don’t want to speak up. I feel myself a little bit the buffalo separate from the herd.”</p>



<p>Of the retracted COVID-19 papers co-authored by Abd-Elsalam, the journals took between 63 and 414 days to retract following an email from Mol and his colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s complicated to get the data out of these publications,” Mol said. “And it’s extremely uncomfortable to say to people well, maybe the work you were doing is not honest.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In his email, Abd-Elsalam linked to a <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2823793/v4">preprint</a> he says he co-wrote (he is not listed as an author). The paper questions the credibility of a checklist developed by Mol to assess RCTs and uses 16 of Mol’s own RCTs in its analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the preprint conclude: “Using the TRACT (Trustworthiness in Randomized Controlled Trials) checklist, 16 RCTs co-authored by its developer (Mol) showed red flags that need to be investigated further.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abd-Elsalam says he and his colleagues have also made several comments on Mol’s work on <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=%22ben+mol%22">PubPeer</a>, some of which he claims have been removed by the site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to Abd-Elsalam’s concern about his work, Mol wrote in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937823001382">retraction</a> was made at our own request because of an error. Otherwise I had 16 of my papers investigated without any concern raised.</p>



<p>One problem is that there is not a collective response from the academic community to people like Abd-Elsalam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In August 2022, the <em>Journal of Exploratory Research in Pharmacology</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/xiahepublishing/status/1556928469765963776">announced on Twitter</a> that Abd-Elsalam had been appointed to its editorial board. He is currently coordinating 74 clinical trials, with 35 trials marked as recruiting, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=abd-elsalam&amp;Search=Apply&amp;recrs=b&amp;recrs=a&amp;recrs=f&amp;recrs=d&amp;recrs=m&amp;age_v=&amp;gndr=&amp;type=&amp;rslt=">according to clinicaltrials.gov</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol and his co-authors are calling for all papers on which Abd-Elsalam is an author to be marked with an expression of concern.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Han Lu will talk about the preprint entitled &quot;Interplay between homeostatic synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity maintains the robust firing rate of neural networks&quot;.</p>
<p>Han is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Freiburg, Germany. Her studies focus on the homeostatic structural plasticity of neuronal connectivity in
response to external stimulation, using both computational and experimental approaches.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Critical network states and neural plasticity are essential for flexible behavior in an
ever-changing environment, which allows for efficient information processing and
experience-based learning. Synaptic-weight-based Hebbian plasticity and homeostatic
synaptic scaling were considered the key players in enabling memory while stabilizing
network dynamics. However, spine-number-based structural plasticity is not consistently
reported as a homeostatic mechanism, leading to an insufficient under-standing of its
functional impact. Here, we combined live-cell microscopy of eGPF-tagged neurons in
organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures and computational modeling to study the
re-sponse of structural plasticity under activity perturbations and its interplay with
homeostatic synaptic scaling. By following individual dendritic segments, we demonstrated
that the inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission did not linearly regulate dendritic
spine density: Inhibition of AMPA receptors with a low concentration of
2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX, 200 nM) sig-nificantly increased
the spine density while complete blockade of AMPA receptors with 50 µM NBQX reduced spine
density. Motivated by these results, we established network simulations in which a
biphasic structural plasticity rule governs the activity-dependent formation of synapses.
We showed that this bi-phasic rule maintained neural activity homeostasis upon stimulation
and permitted both synapse formation and synapse loss, depending on the degree of activity
deprivation. Homeostatic synaptic scaling affected the recurrent connectivity, modulated
the network activity, and influenced the outcome of structural plasticity. It reduced
stimulation-triggered homeostatic synapse loss by downscaling synaptic weights; meanwhile,
it rescued silencing-induced synapse degeneration by am-plifying recurrent inputs via
upscaling to reactivate silent neurons. Their interplay explains divergent results
obtained in varied experimental settings. In summary, calcium-based synaptic scaling and
homeostatic structural plasticity rules compete and compensate one another other to
achieve an eco-nomical and robust control of firing rate homeostasis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-roman-perfume-smell-patchouli">An old perfume bottle reveals what some ancient Romans smelled like</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprisingly well-preserved perfume bottle is providing a rare olfactory window to ancient Rome — and letting in a familiar smell.</p>



<p>Chemical analyses of the contents of a 2,000-year-old bottle <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/6/6/236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal that one of its ingredients was patchouli</a>, researchers report May 23 in <em>Heritage</em>. The earthy scent is a staple in modern perfumes, but its use by the Romans was unknown until now.</p>



<p>The essence, in a quartz flask dating from the first century, was found in 2019 in a Roman burial in the southern Spanish town of Carmona, once an important Roman settlement. Researchers unearthed an egg-shaped lead case that held a glass urn. Inside the urn they found the flask and the cremated remains of a woman who was around 40 years old, says chemist José Rafael Ruiz Arrebola of the University of Cordoba in Spain. Cremation was a common form of burial at the time, and Romans who could afford it furnished their tombs with items to accompany the deceased into the afterlife.</p>





<p>The quartz bottle was by itself a luxury object in Roman times. Quartz is extremely hard, making it difficult to shape. The tiny size and exquisite detail of the object already made it a rare finding at a burial site. Even more unusual is that it was found tightly sealed with a dolomite top covered in a dark, tarlike substance that chemical analysis revealed as bitumen. Inside the jar, there was a solid mass — the preserved original content of the bottle.</p>



<p>Ancient written perfume recipes, while vague and incomplete, have previously revealed that Romans mixed fragrant extracts with vegetable oils, such as olive oil, as preservative. And in earlier studies, researchers have detected hints of floral extracts in bottles used to keep cosmetics — known as <em>unguentaria. </em>But this is the first time the source of an aroma has been identified.</p>



<p>Laboratory analyses revealed that the bottle contained patchouli and vegetable oil. Patchouli is derived from a tropical plant in Southeast Asia called <em>Pogostemon cablin</em>. It likely reached Rome through trade networks.</p>



<p>Subjecting the bottle’s contents to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry identified multiple substances typical of patchouli essential oil — most importantly patchoulenol, or patchouli alcohol. To rule out nard oil, which has many components in common with patchouli oil but in different proportions, the researchers compared the results with modern samples of patchouli oil.</p>



<p>The bitumen seal was key in preserving the patchouli&#8217;s chemical signature. Not only did the seal keep the fragrance inside the bottle, but it also trapped the perfume molecules through a process called adsorption.</p>



<p>“Chemically, bitumen behaves like carbon, which is the best adsorbent for organic compounds,” Ruiz Arrebola says. The process is similar to carbon filters used in gas masks, he says. “Once adsorbed, [the molecules] aren’t volatile anymore and can’t escape.”</p>

It’s possible that all held the cremated remains of members of the same family.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125200">Juan Manuel Román</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The extraordinary preservation of the burial site also played a role. “Being in a closed place and in total darkness is what allowed [the perfume] to make it to our days,” Ruiz Arrebola says. “Had the tomb collapsed and let light in, it wouldn’t have survived because light is the worst enemy to this type of chemical.”</p>



<p>The discovery fits into a growing trend of piecing together a multidimensional picture of ancient life, including its sounds and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-smell-odor-artifacts-texts-egypt-archaeology">smells</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/22</em>). “There are research groups and companies trying to re-create ancient perfumes,” Ruiz Arrebola says. “This will give them very important clue.”</p>



<p>But the finding doesn’t mean that the whole Roman Empire smelled like patchouli. “At the time, perfumes were reserved for the high society,” Ruiz Arrebola says. That the perfume was made from an exotic essence likely imported from elsewhere and bottled in a costly jar point to a wealthy proprietor, he says.</p>





<p>At the same time, it isn’t clear if this perfume was intended for use in daily life or had a spiritual or funerary meaning. The unopened bottle’s presence inside a funerary urn suggests an intimate gesture, not meant for public display.</p>



<p>“Luxury is useless if it can’t be displayed in front of society,” says historian Jordi Pérez González of the University of Girona in Spain, who was not involved with the study. “So patchouli might have been linked to the funerary world rather than to the daily life.”</p>

                <p>Even as the thick clouds of smoke from wildfires raging in eastern Canada, which blanketed the U.S. East Coast in a dangerous orange haze, begin to dissipate, researchers are warning it’s a sign of the times. </p>



<p>Canada’s fire outlook will remain higher than normal for June. And on a larger scale, climate change is projected to make fire conditions more common across Canada, Russia and Alaska’s boreal forests.</p>



<p>The current fires were sparked by lightning in the Canadian province of Quebec; like much of Canada, <a href="https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agricultural-production/weather/canadian-drought-monitor/current-drought-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parts of Quebec were abnormally dry this spring</a>.</p>





<p>Their smoky haze has dominated headlines, prompting warnings of dangerous air pollution levels. People were urged to stay indoors as much as possible, or wear masks, to avoid inhaling the fine particulate matter. The smoke, a toxic brew of irritant gases and tiny particles, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-health-risks-air-smoke-west-east-united-states">can cause asthma, respiratory and cardiovascular problems</a>, and can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">exacerbate existing conditions such as diabetes</a> and chronic lung conditions (<em>SN: 6/17/22; SN: 9/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>Wildfire-driven air pollution is all too familiar to residents of the Pacific Northwest and the U.S. West, where most of the continent’s large wildfires occur, but it’s less common in the eastern part of North America. So June’s headline-grabbing haze might be a wake-up call to East Coast policy makers about the hazards of climate change, some researchers hope.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of historical precedent for that, says Nicholas Bond, state climatologist for the state of Washington, who is based in Seattle. “There were some periods when dust [from the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s] made it all the way to Washington, D.C., bringing attention to the disaster that was occurring in the Plains states,” he says.</p>



<p>Whether eastern Canada’s forests in particular <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7e6e/meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will become more fire-prone due to climate change isn’t clear</a> from recent simulations of future climate and fire behavior. The current fires are not necessarily a harbinger of things to come so much as a reminder of what’s already here: They’re burning in regions that are already considered at risk of fire.</p>



<p>Climate change is projected to boost fires across other vast swaths of boreal forest in the Northern Hemisphere. It’s already having an impact. “Wildfires in the boreal forests of Alaska burned more acres in the past 20 years” than in the previous 20 years, Bond says. How much of the forest is on fire can vary significantly from year to year; 2020 was below-average, with about 73,000 hectares burned. But the overall trend of burned area in boreal forests is expected to curve steeply upward by the middle of the century: The acreage of burned area in Alaska is projected to increase by 24 to 169 percent from 2020 to 2050.</p>



<p>Fire seasons in boreal forests are also expected to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722018459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last longer and produce larger fires</a> each year. Climate change <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36500-5?utm_campaign=related_content&amp;utm_source=EARTHENV&amp;utm_medium=communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also increase the frequency of lightning strikes </a>that spark fires such as those currently burning in Quebec — although that, too, is still uncertain.</p>



<p>Canada is currently fighting severe fires across the country, from coast to coast, stretching its resources thin. &#8220;It is quite rare for us to have fire over such a broad area. It is an exceptional situation,&#8221; exacerbated by drought conditions in regions across the country, says Ellen Whitman, a forest fire research scientist at Natural Resources Canada, based in Edmonton. &#8220;Lightning ignitions are made more likely by drought, which is associated with climate change,&#8221; she says. And “lightning is expected to become more frequent due to changes to upper air patterns related to climate warming.”  </p>



<p>The threat in Canada is expected to remain high in the coming weeks, the Canadian <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2023/06/the-government-of-canada-provides-update-on-wildfire-seasonal-outlook-and-outlines-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government reported on June 5</a>. That’s also true for the United States. “The Pacific Northwest is liable to be dealing with considerable smoke later this summer,” Bond says, based on a <a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fire potential outlook report released June 1</a> by the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center. “For personal, selfish reasons I hope the winds do not bring the smoke our way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/groundwater-toxic-pollution-superfund">Rising groundwater threatens to spread toxic pollution on U.S. coastlines</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hidden flows of water are poised to flush toxic contamination into U.S. coastal communities.</p>



<p>Sea level rise from climate change won’t just force shorelines to retreat — in inland areas, it will guilefully lift groundwater into shallower soils. That rising water could infiltrate <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.168500245.55690018/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of U.S. Superfund sites</a> — severely polluted locations identified by the Environmental Protection Agency for cleanup — researchers warn in a preliminary study posted May 25 to <em>ESS Open Archive</em>.</p>



<p>These sites — and thousands of other polluted areas — could be at risk of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permafrost-thawing-pollution-arctic-climate-change">releasing heavy metals, radioactive elements, pesticides and industrial chemicals</a> associated with human health problems (<em>SN: 4/26/23</em>). People of color and low-income communities would be disproportionately affected.</p>





<p>“Just the sheer number of Superfund sites where there are these dangerous contaminants that could be liberated — it’s astonishing,” says coastal geologist Patrick Barnard of the U.S. Geological Survey in Santa Cruz, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the study. Many of the polluted areas have been managed without regard for groundwater rise, he says. “We need to think about what the future holds for these sites.”</p>



<p>The link between climate change, the sea and underground water may not be obvious, but it is intimate. At the beach, seawater can seep into the ground and move inland, permeating layers of earth under coastal communities. Meanwhile, rain and runoff can also trickle down from above. In the ground, this freshwater often sits atop the denser saltwater from the sea. And when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-climate-change-estimate-triples-number-people-path-rising-sea-levels">the sea level rises due to climate change</a>, it pushes all this groundwater up through the earth (<em>SN: 10/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>As the top of the groundwater — the water table — nears the surface, it can damage human infrastructure. It can also spread hazardous substances in the soil, exposing people and ecosystems nearby.</p>



<p>Environmental planner and geologist Kristina Hill found motivation for the new study while investigating groundwater conditions at a former Superfund site in the San Francisco Bay Area. There, groundwater was touching pollutants in the soil. “I started wondering, what is the scale of this problem?” says Hill, of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>She and her colleagues identified which of the roughly 1,300 U.S. Superfund sites are in low-lying coastal areas — no more than 10 meters above mean sea level — where groundwater rise could potentially infiltrate.</p>



<p>They found if the sea surface rose by one meter — a <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibility by 2100</a> — then groundwater could potentially rise into contaminated soils at 326 sites. New Jersey and Florida respectively contained the most at-risk Superfund sites — 54 and 51 respectively.</p>



<p>Not every polluted site in the United States is a Superfund site, but that doesn&#8217;t make them less hazardous, Hill says. Her team assessed that potential impact with a case study of the Bay Area alone. They flagged 12 Superfund sites and nearly 5,300 state-managed contaminated areas vulnerable to that one-meter sea level rise. There could be thousands more such sites up and down our coastlines, Hill says.</p>



<p>The researchers analyzed U.S. Census data to investigate who could face the greatest risk of exposure. People from socially vulnerable communities — those whose circumstances limit their ability to prevent suffering or loss in face of a disaster — bore disproportionate risk, they found.</p>



<p>“The findings are not surprising,” says hydrogeologist Holly Michael of the University of Delaware in Newark. This study takes the first step in addressing the hazard, by calling out where it could arise, she says. More local research will be needed to thoroughly assess each site’s risk and determine next steps, be that treating contaminated soils or removing them altogether.</p>



<p>As the ocean encroaches, Hill says, helping people move inland won&#8217;t be enough unless we also clean up our mess. “Otherwise, there will be a toxic area that we leave behind, and that will spread.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drought-forests-trees-weather-future">Surviving a drought may help forests weather future dry spells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some forests take one-two punches surprisingly well.</p>



<p>Researchers have shown that certain California forests exposed to two successive droughts weathered the second one much better than forests only hit by the later dry period. Given that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">the frequency and severity of droughts is increasing with climate change</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>), the findings suggest that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022AV000810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forested regions might fare better than predicted</a> in the future, the research team proposes in the May 17 <em>AGU Advances</em>. That’s important because of the many resources that forests provide, including their ability to sequester about a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the atmosphere every year.</p>





<p>Carl Norlen and Mike Goulden, ecologists at the University of California, Irvine, studied roughly 520,000 hectares of California forest (about 4 percent of the state’s forested areas). The researchers focused on conifers, trees such as pines and firs that have needles rather than flat leaves. Using archival data gleaned from airplane observations, Norlen and Goulden estimated the extent of conifer die-off during two droughts that struck from 1999–2002 and 2012–2015. “Both of them when they happened were considered some of the most severe droughts ever in California,” Norlen says.</p>



<p>When the researchers looked at forests that just experienced the 2012–2015 drought, they found that over 50 percent of forested areas showed evidence of die-off. But when Norlen and Goulden analyzed forests that had weathered both droughts, they were surprised to find that only 13 percent of those forested areas showed evidence of die-off after the second drought. The researchers also analyzed satellite data that revealed the severity of tree die-off, and they again found that forests hurt by one drought were better prepared to weather another.</p>



<p>The underlying cause of those differences probably has to do with the tree mortality that occurred during the first drought, Norlen and Goulden propose. Roughly 31 percent of the forested areas that experienced both droughts showed signs of die-off during the 1999–2002 drought. “We think that it has to do with experiencing die-off the first time,” Norlen says.</p>



<p>That makes sense, says William Anderegg, an ecologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who was not involved in the research. “You might have culled out the weak trees,” he says.</p>



<p>Norlen and Goulden speculate that the first drought eliminated trees <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bark-beetles-fungi-chemical-signals-infest">weakened by pests like bark beetles</a> (<em>SN: 2/21/23</em>), or perhaps that the dry conditions prompted trees to protect themselves by growing deeper roots. Those changes would have helped protect the remaining trees from future droughts, Goulden says. “You effectively have a stronger population.”</p>



<p>Getting at the root of why exactly some forests are better prepared to weather successive droughts will require more investigation, the researchers say. One way forward is to monitor individual trees to better understand their physiology, which other teams have done by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-trees-drought-survival-secrets">outfitting trees with sensors</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/23</em>).</p>



<p>However, the new findings already provide some hope for the forests of the future. Modeling work has suggested that <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/11/jcli-d-12-00430.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upwards of 50 percent of present-day conifer tree coverage could be lost</a> in the Northern Hemisphere by the end of the century. But this new work shows that that prediction might well turn out to be an overestimate. “There’s an element of it that’s actually hopeful,” Goulden says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-enceladus-plume-water-space">JWST captured Enceladus’ plume spraying water nearly 10,000 kilometers into space</a></h4>

              
                <p>Enceladus’ famous plume dwarfs the moon itself.</p>



<p>Geysers on Saturn’s icy moon <a href="https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov/apps/Enceladus_JWST.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spew water vapor nearly 10,000 kilometers into space</a>, a distance about 19 times the diameter of Enceladus, researchers report in a paper accepted in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. If the geysers were on Earth, the plume would touch the edge of our planet’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>NASA’s now-defunct Cassini spacecraft discovered almost two decades ago that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">Enceladus ejects salty water</a> from a subsurface reservoir (<em>SN: 5/2/06</em>). But the spacecraft’s orbit around Saturn meant it was too close to the moon to see the plume’s true extent.</p>





<p>In November, the James Webb Space Telescope turned its powerful infrared camera on Enceladus for the first time, gazing at the moon for about four minutes. JWST’s vantage point from across our solar system let it see the plume extending at least 9,600 kilometers from the south pole.</p>



<p>“Seeing it so big, water being everywhere, it was kind of a surprise,” says planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>



<p>JWST’s observations also shed light on how much water the plume pumps out and where those molecules end up.</p>

<p>Enceladus has been spewing the same amount of water since Cassini arrived at Saturn’s system 19 years ago: about 10 million billion trillion molecules per second (that’s a 10 followed by 28 zeros).</p>



<p>Roughly 30 percent of the molecules feed into a donut-shaped ring — called a torus — that encircles the entire Saturnian system. The remaining water either helps create one of Saturn’s iconic icy rings, or gets blown across the system, where the water may affect the atmospheric chemistry of Saturn and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/20-new-moons-saturn-now-most-any-solar-system-planet">its other moons</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/19</em>).</p>



<p>The plume’s consistency gives Villanueva hope that whenever scientists send another mission to Enceladus, the geysers will still be active. In the meantime, JWST will keep checking up on the moon. “The beauty with James Webb is we can point to it very often and see if that thing remains active all the time,” he says.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y" target="_blank">scientific paper</a>&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/30/560837881/brain-patterns-may-predict-people-at-risk-of-suicide" target="_blank">international</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-a-machine-identify-suicidal-thoughts/" target="_blank">headlines</a>&nbsp;with its bold claim that the combination of brain scans and machine learning algorithms could identify people at risk for suicide with 91% accuracy.</p>



<p>The promise of the work garnered lead author&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/just-marcel.html" target="_blank">Marcel Adam Just</a>&nbsp;of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and co-author&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/about-us/our-people/faculty/david-brent-md" target="_blank">David Brent</a>&nbsp;of the University of Pittsburgh a five-year,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2018/august/marcel-just-nimh-suicide-grant.html" target="_blank">$3.8 million grant</a>&nbsp;from the National Institute of Mental Health to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/t5aT9-W7QECwxmxDXtFrRw/project-details/10386788" target="_blank">conduct a larger follow-up study</a>.</p>



<p>But the 2017 paper attracted immediate and sustained scrutiny from other experts, one of whom attempted to replicate it and found a key problem. Nothing happened until this April, when the authors admitted the work was flawed and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/06/high-profile-paper-that-used-ai-to-identify-suicide-risk-from-brain-scans-retracted-for-flawed-methods/" target="_blank">retracted their article</a>. By then, it had been cited 134 times in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science — a large amount for a young paper — and received so much attention online that the article ranks in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/28130609#score" target="_blank">the top 5%</a>&nbsp;of all the research tracked by Altmetric, a data company focused on scientific publishing.</p>



<p>All this could have been avoided if the journal had followed the advice of its own reviewers, according to <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23837846/nature-human-behavior-editors-decision-letters-and-reviewers-comments.pdf">records of the peer-review process</a> obtained by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/" target="_blank">Retraction Watch</a>. The experts who scrutinized the submitted manuscript for the journal before it was published identified many issues in the initial draft and a revised resubmission. One asked for the authors to replicate the work in a new group of study participants, and overall, they recommended rejecting the manuscript.</p>



<span id="more-127269"></span>



<p>The records also show the journal’s chief editor initially followed the reviewers’ advice — but then accepted the paper with some changes to its text, but no added data. The documents don’t explain the editor’s decision to publish, and a journal spokesperson declined to discuss the reasons.</p>



<p>“I was very upset,” said one of the reviewers, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of breaking the convention of reviewer confidentiality. “Everybody knew this paper was garbage … and yet they went ahead and sent it out into the world.”</p>



<p>Just and colleagues’ manuscript began the peer-review process at the journal Nature Human Behaviour in early 2017. The paper described how the group used machine learning algorithms to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of people’s brains and identify those at elevated risk for attempting suicide.</p>



<p>The researchers used fMRI to catch a glimpse of what happened in the brains of 79 young adults when asked to think about concepts such as “death,” “trouble,” “carefree,” and “good.” After excluding participants whose scans the scientists said had too much noise, they applied machine learning algorithms to the data from 17 of the people who had previously thought about dying by suicide, and 17 control participants who had not reported having suicidal thoughts.</p>



<p>Using a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statology.org/leave-one-out-cross-validation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common method</a>&nbsp;for testing the performance of algorithms, the researchers trained their system on the data of all but one participant, and then asked the model to predict whether the left-out participant had thought about suicide or not. They repeated this process until the model had made a prediction for each participant, and reported the model made the right call 91% of the time. Specifically, the algorithms correctly identified 15 of the 17 participants who had suicidal thoughts and 16 of the 17 controls.</p>



<p>Two of the three experts who reviewed the submission at the request of the journal called the reported accuracy “impressively high,” but offered detailed critiques of the work.</p>



<p>One reviewer called aspects of the methodology “concerning,” such as the authors omitting about half of their original sample of participants when testing their model in the paper’s main analysis. Even if those choices didn’t introduce bias into the model, the reviewer wrote, they indicated the approach was “likely limited” in its usefulness for the general population.</p>



<p>Another reviewer who detailed many concerns with the manuscript called for the authors to test their model on a separate group of people.</p>



<p>The other expert wrote that the paper’s results were “remarkable,” but asked the authors to address “several problems.” That reviewer wanted to see individual brain data included in the supplementary material, and for the authors to show more of their data that went into their statistical analyses.</p>



<p>Based on the feedback, Stavroula Kousta, Nature Human Behaviour’s chief editor, invited the authors to address the reviewers’ “quite substantial concerns” in a revision.</p>



<p>The authors did so, submitting the updated manuscript for another round of review by the two more critical experts.</p>



<p>One of the reviewers was not impressed, because the main analysis still focused on 34 participants “cherry-picked” from an original pool of 79, the reviewer wrote.</p>



<p>The other reviewer was initially more positive, because the revision clarified that the authors had used the same algorithms to evaluate scans of 21 of the participants who were initially excluded from their tests, and achieved an accuracy of 87%.</p>



<p>But in additional comments, that reviewer noted “several irregularities in the details” of the analysis of the excluded participants.</p>



<p>“These things make me a bit worried that some liberties are being taken to make the results better than they would be with a truly straightforward, unbiased replication of the findings in a new sample,” the reviewer concluded. “I would feel more comfortable with an independent replication in a new sample without the ‘fudge factors’ that seem to be present in this analysis.”</p>



<p>In July 2017, Kousta rejected the manuscript.</p>



<p>In the rejection letter, Kousta wrote that “we would be very pleased to consider a revision” if the authors performed an independent replication in a new sample of participants. “Without these data, however, the reviewers’ concerns with the present dataset &amp; analyses are such as to preclude publication in Nature Human Behaviour.”</p>



<p>Yet in October 2017, the journal published the paper, without this additional data. The published version, however, describes the analysis of 21 of the participants who had been excluded from the main analysis, yielding 87% accuracy. The authors concluded these results demonstrate “the findings were replicated on a second sample,” thus “supporting the generalizability of the model.”</p>



<p>Soon after publication, experts took to Twitter to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/06/high-profile-paper-that-used-ai-to-identify-suicide-risk-from-brain-scans-retracted-for-flawed-methods/" target="_blank">critique the paper</a>&nbsp;for its small sample size and questioned whether the model could be broadly applied.In response to renewed criticism in 2019, an account for the journal&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/NatureHumBehav/status/1156894892062367747?s=20" target="_blank">tweeted</a>&nbsp;that the paper was published “following thorough peer review because it provided important proof of concept for a potentially valuable method on a question of substantial clinical relevance.”</p>



<p>The authors&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01581-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retracted</a>&nbsp;the paper this year after Timothy Verstynen of Carnegie Mellon University and Konrad Paul Kording of the University of Pennsylvania submitted a&nbsp;<a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP1952727XEAD4F4DB36F749F198B6A7490000A415YI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41562-023-01560-6&amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matters Arising</a>, a paper detailing their unsuccessful attempts to replicate the 2017 work with the code and data the authors had made available, and their concerns about bias in the model.</p>



<p>“While revising their response to these concerns, the authors confirmed that their method was indeed flawed, which affects the conclusions of the article,” the retraction notice stated. “The authors aim to demonstrate the predictive value of machine learning applied to fMRI data for the classification of suicidal ideators using new data and analyses in an independent future publication.”</p>



<p>In a statement, Just of Carnegie Mellon said they had discovered an “error in the statistical analysis” of the paper that “overestimated the strength of the main finding,” but “the main effect is present and clearly reliable.”</p>



<p>Just said the group was preparing a new submission describing the corrected results, and added the authors had notified their grants officer at the National Institute of Mental Health of the retraction. Their successful grant application&nbsp;<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/t5aT9-W7QECwxmxDXtFrRw/project-details/10386788#description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included the findings</a>&nbsp;described in their now-retracted paper.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Nature Human Behaviour said that the journal “cannot discuss the specifics of individual cases,” but added that, in general, a paper’s authors can appeal the rejection of a submitted paper.</p>



<p>The journal’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/submission-guidelines/editorial-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editorial policies</a>&nbsp;state that “decisions are reversed on appeal only if the editors are convinced that the original decision was an error.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad it only did six years worth of damage rather than 10 years worth of damage,” said the anonymous reviewer about the paper’s eventual retraction. “But it should never have been let out.”</p>

Their work draws on a strong body of evidence to reveal what really drives team effectiveness in organizations. Eduardo Salas is the Allyn R. &amp; Gladys M. Cline Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychological Sciences at Rice University, a prolific author, and active consultant. Scott Tannenbaum, as the President of the Group for Organizational Effectiveness, has advised hundreds of organizations globally, including more than 75 Fortune and Global 1000 companies across every major business sector.</em></p><p><em>Read an interview with the authors exploring aspects of teamwork and the future of work.</em></p><h2>What are the building blocks for a successful team?&nbsp;</h2><p>We think the science is clear here. Teams that have some degree of task interdependence need a number of “key ingredients” in order to be effective. To begin, role clarity is a must. Then the team needs to have a compelling reason to be a team. That is, clear, valued goals and a purpose. The team leader matters—a leader who orchestrates the functioning of the team moment-to-moment by providing guidance, support, and caring for team members’ well-being and focus. They set the tone for the behavioral norms and how to resolve conflict and move ahead. This means the team members must perceive they have psychological safety to raise issues of concern. And finally, to mature, evolve, and be resilient—teams need a discipline of debriefing. Engaging in reflections of what transpired and how they can improve.</p><h2>What is the difference between good and bad team communication?</h2><p>The funny thing about team communication is that there is a belief that “more is better.” But research shows that “better is better” and not more. In fact, from our experience the best teams are relatively quiet. That does not mean there is no communication going on, there is, but its timely and efficient. We think that what matters in teams is to hold robust information exchange protocols—protocols that allow for clear and accurate exchange of information and encourage team members to share unique information that others don’t possess.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Organizations need to provide team and leader development and tools that mimic the new remote world.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><h2>How do we develop and support the next generation of leaders in a more remote world?</h2><p>Yeah, the world of work has changed. Hybrid work might be the new normal. Although some organizations are going back to in-person too. In a “remote world” the teamwork issues are more challenging. More salient. Teams must pay more attention to the building blocks we noted as they are less likely to just “happen.” For example, it often takes longer to create psychological safety and mutual trust in a team when some teams members are remote, while others are collocated. So, organizations need to provide team and leader development and tools that mimic the new remote world. For team training, it can be helpful to use “simulations” as a means of building teamwork “muscles” that are relevant to the context they work in.</p><h2>How does increased flexibility impact employees and organizations?</h2><p>Flexibility has two sides. Personally, most employees want flexibility, including having some degree of control over where and when they work. But employees also need to know where and how to communicate and coordinate with co-workers… and it is more difficult to maintain an awareness of who is available and who has the latest information when team members have a great deal of personal flexibility. To attract, retain, and engage employees, employers need to allow ample flexibility. And they then need to provide the tools, resources, and processes that enable them to coordinate effectively.</p><div><blockquote><p>“To attract, retain, and engage employees, employers need to allow ample flexibility and provide the tools that enable them to coordinate effectively.”</p></blockquote></div><h2>What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?</h2><p>From the teamwork and collaboration angle—teams are here to stay, whether they are in person, remote, virtual or some hybrid form. More collaboration will be needed. People will be more connected, there will more networks that need to coordinate, communicate, and cooperate to succeed. We think a disproportionate share of breakthroughs, innovation, and knowledge generation will come from multi-disciplinary teams.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/pages/what-is-the-future-of-work?utm_campaign=1600526366456057904&amp;utm_source=oupblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=button&amp;utm_term=Salas"><strong>Visit the Rethink Work hub for more organizational psychology insights</strong></a></p></blockquote><p><em><sub>Featured image: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/745058687/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/745058687/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f06%2fTeamwork-Stock-Image-Canva-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/finding-purpose-for-the-corporate-office/">Finding purpose for the corporate office</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-veronica-schmidt-harvey-and-kenneth-p-de-meuse/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Veronica Schmidt Harvey and Kenneth P.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-bone-flute-lure-falcon">These ancient flutes may have been used to lure falcons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perforated bones excavated at an ancient settlement in northern Israel may be the oldest wind instruments found in the region. The small flutes could have been used to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35700-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make music, call birds or even communicate over short distances</a>, the researchers suggest June 9 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>The instruments were unearthed from the remains of small stone dwellings at a lakeside site called Eynan-Mallaha, which was home to the last hunter-gatherers in the region until about 12,000 years ago, says Laurent Davin, an archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. All of the flutes were made from the wing bones of waterfowl that spent winter months at the lake, he notes. Of the seven flutes found, the largest appears to be intact and is about 63 millimeters (2.5 inches) long.</p>





<p>Microscopic analyses of the instruments clearly show that the finger holes were carved by humans and were not the results of gnawing by rodents or tooth marks left by predators, says Davin.</p>



<p>Davin and his team used the wing bone of a modern-day female mallard to make a detailed replica of the ancient flute. When played, the instrument produced high-pitched sounds similar to the calls of the common kestrel and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, raising the possibility the instruments were used to lure birds. Evidence suggests the inhabitants of Eynan-Mallaha used the talons of these birds of prey as tools and may have worn them as ornaments, Davin says.</p>

<p>Such flutes may have themselves been worn when hunting, says Davin. The largest of the flutes was decorated with red ochre and had a worn spot where it may have hung from a string or a strip of leather.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/taurine-slows-aging-mice-energy-drinks">Taurine slows aging in mice. Will it ever work for people?</a></h4>

              
                <p>An ingredient common in energy drinks and baby formula <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn9257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes mice healthier and extends their life spans</a>. It also appears to make worms live longer and improves the health of middle-aged monkeys, a large international group of scientists reports in the June 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The ingredient, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/herminia-pasantes-taurine-brain-cell-neuroscience">an amino acid called taurine</a>, is made by our bodies, and we eat it in meats (<em>SN: 7/21/22</em>). It’s not known whether extra taurine slows aging in people or if it is even good for us, though the new study turned up an association between lower levels of the amino acid and conditions such as diabetes and obesity.</p>





<p>Aging “is one of the great biological unknowns,” says biologist and cardiologist Toren Finkel of the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study. “So any way you can chip away at that edifice is great. And this is a new set of findings that deserves to be followed up.”<br><br>The results, 11 years in the making, center on taurine in part because scientists found its levels fall with age in the blood of mice, monkeys and humans. As far as amino acids go, taurine is an oddball: Unlike other more familiar amino acids, it doesn’t get incorporated into proteins. Nevertheless, it has a range of suspected jobs in the body, from helping the developing brain to eye health to digestion.</p>



<p>Molecular physiologist Vijay Yadav of Columbia University Irving Medical Center and colleagues found that extra taurine extended mice’s median life spans by 10 to 12 percent. For example, the median life span for female mice that didn’t get extra taurine was around 29 months. With taurine, that increased to nearly 33 months. Taurine led to a similar life span boost for shorter-lived worms; <em>C. elegans</em> went from a median of almost 20 days to about 23 days on the highest doses tested.</p>



<p>Taurine was also linked with health in mice and female monkeys. Extra taurine led to improvements in aspects of bone strength, muscle coordination and memory in experiments with groups of five to 10 mice. Six middle-aged rhesus macaques fed extra taurine for six months seemed healthier, weighed less, had denser bones and showed signs of better metabolic health compared with five monkeys that didn’t get extra.</p>



<p>The mice experiments used taurine levels that would be equivalent to about 3 or 6 grams per day for an adult human, Yadav says. A typical energy drink contains 1 gram. There aren’t obvious, known risks of taurine, but thorough long-term studies at these high doses for people have not been done.</p>



<p>Yadav and his colleagues did look at data of nearly 12,000 people and found that individuals with obesity or diabetes had less taurine in their blood than people without the condition. Those links are correlations; it’s not known whether low taurine had a part in causing those conditions. In a separate experiment, an intense bout of exercise led to more taurine in people’s blood. As to whether taurine supplements improve people’s health, “we need to wait for a clinical trial,” Yadav says.</p>



<p>For now, taurine “is promising as a life span and health-span intervention,” says John Tower, a molecular biologist and geneticist who studies aging at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who wasn’t involved in the study. But lots of questions remain, he says, including what taurine actually does in the body and whether it works similarly in different animals, including people. &#8220;We’ve got a long way to go.”</p>



<p>Finkel is circumspect, too. Because aging is so complex, a singular fountain of youth probably doesn’t exist. “I think there are going to be many tributaries of youth,” he says. “And so maybe this is a tributary, not a fountain.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronaut-brain-swell-space-recover">Brain cavities that swell in space may need at least 3 years to recover</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spacing out spaceflights may benefit astronauts’ brains.</p>



<p>While outside Earth’s atmosphere, fluid-filled chambers in the brains of astronauts tend to adapt to microgravity by expanding. But after a space mission, these structures might take <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33331-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three years to shrink back to normal</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The finding suggests that astronauts might need at least that much time between flights before their brains are ready to be in space again.</p>



<p>At the brain’s center sit four cavities — or ventricles — brimming with liquid that cushions the organ and clears out waste. But with little gravity in space, fluids accumulate in an astronaut’s head. So the ventricles adapt by taking in more fluid and expanding, says space scientist Rachael Seidler of the University of Florida in Gainesville.</p>





<p>Researchers knew that astronauts often return to Earth with enlarged ventricles. But Seidler and colleagues wanted to see if time spent in space or how much time had elapsed since past flights affect how much the brain changes during a mission.</p>



<p>The team examined MRI brain scans of 30 astronauts from before and after one of each astronaut’s missions. Analysis showed that the longer the mission, the more three of the four ventricles seemed to expand. The fourth ventricle is so small that possible volume changes may have been too tiny to detect, Seidler says. While two-week trips left a minimal mark on ventricles, six- and 12-month missions resulted in enlargement by fractions of a milliliter. The two longer durations led to similar amounts of expansion, suggesting the swelling slows after six months in space.</p>



<p>For the 18 astronauts who had flown before, time between missions also appeared to make a difference. In those who last visited space three to nine years prior, three of their ventricles expanded — on average, roughly 10 to 25 percent — during the mission that the researchers studied. But ventricles grew little to none in astronauts whose last spaceflight took place less than three years prior, which suggests their brains may not have had enough time between missions to fully recover, the scientists say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m glad that the [study] authors took the first step and are looking at this question,” says neuroradiologist Donna Roberts of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. “There are so many variables that could play into the brain changes that we’re seeing, and it’s hard to sort them out.”</p>



<p>Spaceflight’s effects on the brain are even more pressing now that NASA aims to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-mission-new-diverse-crew-astronauts-moon">send people to Mars</a>, which could be a two-year round trip, she notes (<em>SN: 12/1/22</em>). “Everybody talks about the rocket technology to get to Mars,” Roberts says. But “the humans — that’s the real challenge.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-editing-octopus-dna-cold-protein">RNA editing helps octopuses cope with the cold</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ocean can be a cold place to call home. Mammals like seals stay warm by enveloping themselves in a layer of thick fur and blubber. Cephalopods — the group of (mostly) ultrasmart mollusks that include squid and octopuses — don’t have that luxury.</p>



<p>Instead, some octopuses and squid cope by altering their bodies on the molecular level.</p>



<p>When water temperatures inside their tank dropped by 10 degrees Celsius, California two-spot octopuses (<em>Octopus bimaculoides</em>) changed what proteins they produce <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00523-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by editing vast swathes of their own RNA</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Cell</em>.</p>





<p>The “astounding high levels” of molecular editing — most of which occurs in the nervous system — could help octopuses’ brains function when temperatures plunge, says Joshua Rosenthal, a molecular neurobiologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass.</p>



<p>Another study in <em>Cell</em>, also published June 8, found a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.04.032" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar effect of temperature on RNA editing in California market squid</a> (<em>Doryteuthis opalescens</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have known for over a decade that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-squid-rna-editing-dna-cephalopods">cephalopods are masters of RNA editing</a> (<em>SN: 5/19/23</em>). DNA holds the instructions to make proteins, one of the key building blocks of the body. But it relies on messenger RNA — or mRNA — to shuttle those instructions out of the cell nucleus and to the proteins responsible for building other proteins.</p>



<p>Usually, mRNA faithfully copies these instructions. But sometimes, mRNA is edited, which can change how those proteins behave or even what proteins are made. For instance, about 3 percent of mRNA in humans has the capacity to be edited, though even fewer are edited.</p>



<p>Octopuses and squid take this editing to extremes — changing thousands of mRNA.</p>



<p>What sets off this storm of editing isn’t always obvious. Previous research suggested that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1212795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temperature might be a trigger</a>. To test this, Rosenthal and his colleagues either heated or cooled the tank temperature of octopuses and looked to see what proteins they produced in their brains. While heat set off very little editing, octopuses that experienced cool temperatures altered over 20,000 mRNA sites, which changed around a third of the instructions for making proteins.</p>



<p>This fury of editing started in the space of only a few hours — probably changing the behavior of octopus brains. For instance, the team found that mRNA editing caused kinesin, a protein that shuttles cargo in nerve cells, to slow its movement. Why this happens is unknown, but it might help the cargo-carrying protein harmonize its movements with other processes in the cell if they too become sluggish, Rosenthal says.</p>



<p>Cold-exposed squid also edited their kinesin — though in their case, the changes helped the proteins move greater distances inside cells, says Kavita Rangan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Diego who conducted the squid study.</p>



<p>Previous studies have shown that disease can cause RNA editing. This “truly amazing body of work” shows that environmental changes, like temperature, can also shape mRNA editing, says Heather Hundley, an RNA researcher at Indiana University Bloomington who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>Octopuses have long captured the public imagination through their intelligence and camouflage, says octopus study coauthor Matthew Birk, a cephalopod biologist at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Penn. “We’re now learning that they are strange not just on the outside, but down to the molecular level.”</p>

                <p><em>Written by Lindsay Morton</em></p>



<p><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">Data sharing</a> has long been a hallmark of high-quality reproducible research. Now, Open Data is becoming the norm, an increasingly expected component of the publication process, encouraged and rewarded by top institutions and major funders. PLOS&rsquo; pioneering data policy helps researchers share data in an ethical way that supports reproducibility while honoring privacy. Learn how you can prepare to meet new and increasing data-sharing requirements with ease, and how we can help.</p>



<h2>The rise of data sharing</h2>



<p>For nearly a decade, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">PLOS&rsquo; data availability policy</a> has required authors to share the raw research data underlying their findings alongside published articles&mdash;with sensible exceptions respecting privacy, vulnerable populations, and dual use research of concern (DURC). That&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands of datasets available for validation, reuse, reanalysis, cross reference, database inclusion, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that same time period, much of our scholarly research community have embraced similar policies. Institutions and funders like <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/knowledge-sharing/cern-announces-new-open-data-policy-support-open-science">CERN</a>, <a href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/data-software-materials-management-and-sharing-policy">Wellcome Trust</a>, <a href="https://openaccess.gatesfoundation.org/how-to-comply/data-sharing-requirements/">Gates Foundation</a> and, soon, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">all US government funding bodies</a>, require data sharing, while others, including the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/guidance-on-the-implementation-of-plan-s/">Plan S</a> <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/organisations/">signatories</a>, strongly encourage it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In just the last four years, <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">we&rsquo;ve seen</a> an increase in public data sharing among PLOS comparators from 41% in 2019 to 47% in 2022. Repository use among PLOS authors has risen from 23% to 28% in the same period, and from 9% to 15% among comparators.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s highly likely that data-sharing requirements will continue to increase, and that the rates of both data sharing and repository usage will continue to trend upward in the coming years.</p>



<h2>When it comes to data, how Open is Open enough?</h2>



<p>Open Data is key to the verification and replication of published research; it demonstrates reliability, makes reuse possible, and enhances understanding of the work. When handled properly, publicly available data has also been associated with a 25% <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">increase in citations</a> on average.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Open&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean simply &ldquo;available.&rdquo; Just like Open Access research articles, truly Open Datasets are accessible, shareable, and reusable without restriction. But, importantly, Open is just a type of license. Data sharing doesn&rsquo;t work in practice unless datasets also meet accepted standards for findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability&mdash;better known as FAIR. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">Introduced in 2016</a>, the FAIR principles outline a <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">framework</a> for good data management that can be used as a guide in nearly any circumstances, whether research is published Open Access or in a subscription journal.</p>



<h2 id="success">Setting yourself up for data-sharing success</h2>



<p>Data-sharing <em>does </em>require some extra effort&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be demanding. By thinking about data presentation early in the research process you can make sharing your data a natural part of communicating your research and reap dividends in readership, citations, and attention.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Plan ahead<br></strong><br>Before you begin your research, create a <a href="https://plos.org/resource/how-to-store-and-manage-your-data/#data-management-plan">data management plan</a>. If you&rsquo;re applying for funding, you may already have given this some thought. Especially when you&rsquo;re working with a team it can be incredibly helpful to <a href="https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/data-management-guide/organising-your-data#Metadata">articulate expectations and establish norms</a> for things like the types and formats of data, storage, backup, and naming conventions, and file structures.<br></li><li><strong>Think about future users as you go<br></strong><br>Often when deep in a research project it&rsquo;s easy to use shorthand and temporary solutions&mdash;file names that make sense to you and no one else, column headers that don&rsquo;t specify units of measurement, dates that don&rsquo;t include the year. It&rsquo;s difficult and time consuming to go back and fix these things at the time of publication, long after the research has been completed. Instead, take a little time as you complete each element to think about what a researcher (another postdoc in your own lab, for example, or even you yourself a year or two in the future) might need to know in order to use the data and make those changes in the moment. When in doubt, refer back to your data management plan.<br></li><li><strong>Prepare a readme file<br></strong><br>Including a file contextualizing your data can make reuse <em>much </em>easier. Your readme file need not be complicated. Try imagining that you are writing a cover email to a collaborator, and include all the details you would want them to have when reviewing your data for the first time. Cornell University Library provides a useful <a href="https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme">template for organizing data readme files</a>.<br></li><li><strong>Choose a repository<br></strong><br>Depositing research data in a purpose-built repository is <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/10/data-repository/">the best way</a> to meet FAIR standards&mdash;especially the standards for findability and reusability. In <a href="https://plos.org/resource/how-to-store-and-manage-your-data/#choosing-repository">choosing the right repository for your research</a>, consider the content of your dataset and your audience. Does your project span several disciplines, making it suitable for a general data repository (like Dryad or figshare), or occupy a specific niche with a database all its own, (like GenBank, Crystallography Open Database, or ArrayExpress)? Where are readers most likely to look for a dataset like yours? If you are targeting a specific journal, do they offer any partner integrations you might take advantage of?<br></li><li><strong>Make sure your metadata makes sense<br></strong><br>The &lsquo;F&rsquo; in FAIR stands for &lsquo;findability&rsquo;&mdash;a quality that depends almost entirely on whether your data has been uploaded to a repository (see point 4), and thoroughly described using metadata. Some metadata may be generated automatically based on factors like your dataset title, field labels, descriptions, and abstract. In addition, most repositories will invite you to enter metadata as part of the upload process. You can prepare in advance by taking some time to consider keywords and search terms that are particularly relevant to your work. And of course, don&rsquo;t forget to switch your dataset from private to public, and include the correct link in any related publications.</li></ol>

<p>Each year, the 500 undergraduates at <a href="https://saveethadental.com/">Saveetha Dental College</a> in Chennai, India, participate in 4-hour <a href="https://www.saveetha.com/best-practices">exams</a> that require them to write a 1500-word manuscript on research they have conducted. After faculty and students review and revise the papers, they use an online tool to add references to previously published work. Many of the papers are then submitted to and published by journals; the process contributed to the more than <a href="https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=Saveetha%20Dental%20College&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedDate&amp;orderBy=%2B_score&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=true&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;publishedDate.from=2022-01-01&amp;publishedDate.to=2022-12-31">1400 scholarly works</a> the dental school published last year.</p>



<p>Saveetha, which calls itself a&nbsp;<a href="https://saveethadental.com/research1">“pioneer in undergraduate publications,”</a>&nbsp;says the exercise is designed to help every student gain practical research experience—as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saveetha.com/best-practices">at least 10 publications listed in Scopus</a>, the vast literature database maintained by the publisher Elsevier.&nbsp;<a href="https://saveethadental.com/research1">The college’s website boasts</a>&nbsp;that one Saveetha student published 24 papers.</p>



<p>But the torrent of undergraduate manuscripts—on topics including&nbsp;<a href="https://digibug.ugr.es/handle/10481/79920">fruit intake by students</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=09757619&amp;AN=139149326&amp;h=wELaoTxj%2bpM9kRzof%2fjyTlmYuClMCT6TVeZnBStylzI5Vkuzr0ikqtrj6KmNWWphpdnX8HY9xqWCyvpyLiZZJw%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=/do/10.1126/science.adj1231/full/login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d09757619%26AN%3d139149326">awareness of mental health among teenagers</a>—also appears to serve a less savory purpose, an investigation by Retraction Watch has found.

<p><strong>Fly factory planned for Mexico </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/natural-sciences-10"><em>Science News</em></a>, June 2, 1973</p>



<p>A ‘fly factory’ whose product is living flies — 300 million of them every week — is to be built in southern Mexico to help eradicate screwworms, a major livestock pest.… They feed on living host animals through open wounds or sores. The fly factory will raise millions of screwworm flies, sterilize them with radiation, and release them from low-flying aircraft to mate with native flies, producing eggs that will not hatch.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Mexico and the United States joined forces to finally purge North America of the screwworm scourge. The fly factory opened in 1976 and legions of sterilized screwworm flies were released in both countries, including along Mexico’s Isthmus of T­ehuantepec to obstruct northerly incursions. The eradication program was so successful that it spread to Panama.</p>



<p>By 2006, the United States, Mexico and Central America <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/3/4/930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared themselves rid of the pest</a>. Though brief outbreaks still occur, such as in Florida in 2016, deploying sterile flies remains an effective remedy. The tactic has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/screwworm-flies-sterilization-insect-control">inspired more recent efforts</a> to control <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-oks-first-gm-mosquito-trial-us-hurdles-remain">mosquitoes</a> and other harmful pests (<em>SN: 11/23/18, SN: 8/5/16</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">The Parker Solar Probe may have spotted the origin of high-speed solar winds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spacecraft plunging into the sun’s atmosphere has revealed the likely source of powerful blasts of plasma in fast solar winds.</p>



<p>Far from the sun, the solar wind is a nebulous, turbulent plasma. But when NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">Parker Solar Probe</a> dipped within about 8 million kilometers of the sun’s surface, it detected narrow plasma streams (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>). The streams appear <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05955-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be guided by magnetic fields</a> tracing back to two relatively cool regions of the sun’s atmosphere known as coronal holes, researchers report June 7 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>The solar wind — the steady stream of charged particles flowing from the sun — has two distinct speeds, dubbed as “slow” and “fast.” Until now, it wasn’t clear what was speeding the fast solar wind along. The plasma in most of the solar wind consists of protons, electrons and the nuclei of atoms blowing at hundreds of kilometers a second. But plasma from the area above the coronal holes can travel more than 10 times as fast.</p>



<p>The fast plasma streams were associated with events <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">known as switchbacks</a>, in which portions of the magnetic fields near the sun reverse direction (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>). Switchbacks can result when magnetic field loops close to the sun’s surface connect to long field lines extending away from the sun. The reconnection leads to a sharp switchback kink that kicks the plasma on its way into space as the kink straightens out.</p>



<p>Higher energy streams, the researchers propose, are the result of newly reconnected field lines with sharply kinked switchbacks, while lower energy streams come from field lines with older kinks that had become more smoothed out.</p>



<p>Although the evidence that the fast solar wind is due to magnetic reconnections is compelling, it’s still circumstantial, says astrophysicist Stuart Bale of the University of California, Berkeley. “Our results suggest that the solar wind can be accelerated to high speeds very close to the sun,” Bale says.&nbsp;“This is somewhat different [than the] standard scenario of wind energization,” where the acceleration takes place farther from the sun.</p>



<p>Getting a handle on processes like the origin of the fast solar wind is important for practical reasons, Bale says. “We also believe that magnetic reconnection is responsible for solar flares and is involved in the release of coronal mass ejections, which have a major impact in space weather.” Solar flares and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-solar-flares-scientists-predict-sun-outbursts">space weather they create</a> have led to electrical grid disruptions on Earth and interrupted radio communications, and they may threaten astronauts (<em>SN: 7/30/2020</em>).</p>



<p>The findings are also an important clue in the enduring mystery of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona">why the sun’s atmosphere is millions of degrees Celsius hotter than its surface</a>, says astrophysicist Gary Zank, who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 8/20/17</em>). “But they do not identify the heating mechanism.” </p>



<p>The observations identify the importance of magnetic reconnection close to the sun, says Zank, of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. “The next step is to link that to the dissipation of the magnetic energy in determining the actual heating process.”</p>



<p>Another interesting aspect of the study is how the structure of the solar surface seems to be imprinted on the solar wind near the sun despite the presence of turbulence, says Amitava Bhattacharjee, a Princeton University astrophysicist who was not involved with the study. Other researchers have proposed that it can happen, he says, but in the new study, “the experimental and simulation evidence is more convincing.”</p>



<p>Parker’s ever closer encounters with the sun could confirm the source of the fast solar wind more definitively. And future passes will come as the sun heads into a phase with increasing numbers of sunspots and more solar wind, on the way to peak solar activity around July 2025.&nbsp; “As we move into solar maximum,” Bale says, “we expect some serious surprises.”</p>

<p>A public-health journal has retracted a study from Ethiopia that made unlicensed use of a questionnaire developed by a U.S. researcher known to aggressively protect his intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time, he didn&#8217;t have to: The journal’s publisher flagged the copyright infringement itself, Renee Hoch, managing editor at PLOS Publication Ethics, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<span id="more-127251"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0000099">study</a> found that people with diabetes who had a glucometer at home were more likely to take their medicine as prescribed. It has been cited three times since it was published last year, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science, including once by a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274971">paper in <em>PLOS ONE</em></a> by the same group.</p>



<p>The Morisky Medication Adherence Scales (MMAS)-8 survey used in the study was first described in a 2008 publication by <a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/donald-e-morisky">Donald Morisky</a> of the University of California, Los Angeles. Since then, Morisky has demanded <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pay-or-retract-survey-creators-demands-money-rile-some-health-researchers">steep payments</a> from hundreds of researchers using the questionnaire, causing some who couldn&#8217;t pay to retract their work, as we reported in 2017 in partnership with <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morisky registered the copyright for the MMAS-8 scale in 2018 and trademarked it the following year. Philip Morisky, managing partner of Donald Morisky, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am not familiar with the article in question. Copyright exists automatically in an original work of authorship once it is fixed, but a copyright owner can take steps to enhance the protections.</p>

<p>He did not comment on the chilling effect such steps could have on public-health research, particularly in poorer countries. But Hoch said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As an Open Access publisher, we regret that license fees and other restrictions can create barriers to utilization of resources such as the MMAS-8, thereby creating inequities within the research community and impeding the advancement of research. Nevertheless, work published in PLOS must meet all applicable ethical and legal requirements, and we will take editorial action as needed if authors did not have requisite permissions or licenses for use of a third party resource.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hoch added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Of note, this type of issue can arise due to honest error if researchers are unaware of the applicable license requirements.</p>

<p>Neither the corresponding author nor the second author of the paper responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its May 10 <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0000099">retraction notice</a> for the study, titled &#8220;Medication adherence and its associated factors among type 2 diabetic patients in Ethiopian General Hospital, 2019: Institutional based cross-sectional study,&#8221; the journal states that the issue regarding permission to use the questionnaire could not be resolved during discussions with the authors, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Considering the nature of the concerns in this case, the article contents were removed from the journal’s website at the time of retraction.</p>



<p>The authors did not reply or could not be reached to comment on the retraction decision.</p>

<p>Update, 6/9/23, 1115 UTC: Sofonyas A. Tiruneh, the second author of the paper, tells us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All the authors are from a developing country, and honestly, we were not aware that the Donald Morisky medication adherence tool required a fee to use. When we received the retraction notice, we attempted to contact Morisky, but unfortunately, no one responded to our emails before the retraction was initiated by the journal.</p>



<p>We are extremely disappointed with the situation, as it will have a negative impact on our professional profiles moving forward. We are uncertain about how we can reverse the retraction at this point, but we are willing to take any necessary steps if there is a possibility to do so.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-dying-star-supernova">A simulation of a dying star shows how it could create gravitational waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cocoons of debris around dying stars could shake ripples in spacetime unlike any astronomers have ever seen.</p>



<p>“This is a potential source of gravitational waves that has never been investigated before,” astrophysicist Ore Gottlieb of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., said June 5 in a news conference at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Albuquerque.</p>



<p>The waves could potentially be picked up in the latest run of LIGO, which began on May 24.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">LIGO’s first detection in 2015</a>, all the gravitational waves seen thus far have been from the spiraling death dance of two compact objects — black holes, neutron stars or both (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). These events give off what are called coherent gravitational waves. “You can think of it as an orchestra playing harmonically,” Gottlieb said.</p>





<p>A second type, incoherent waves, are expected to come from stellar explosions like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-searching-sources-gravitational-waves">supernovas</a> (<em>SN: 5/6/19</em>). Because those bursts are spherically symmetrical and relatively slow, their waves are difficult for LIGO to detect. They’re more analogous to individual instruments playing different songs at the same time.</p>



<p>Gottlieb and colleagues considered another type of stellar death called a collapsar. When massive stars collapse into a black hole, they can emit jets of material traveling close to the speed of light. Computer simulations of how those jets form <a href="https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAS242/ViewSubmissionFile.aspx?sbmID=120&amp;mode=html&amp;validate=false&amp;key=0Fs85MQav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a cocoon of material surrounding the jet</a>, full of hot, turbulent gas and debris that expand in an asymmetric bubble around the dying star, says Gottlieb, who presented the research June 6.</p>



<p>As the bubble expands and pushes its way through the star, it could bump spacetime enough to produce incoherent gravitational waves, Gottlieb and colleagues concluded.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">As a massive star collapses, it emits jets of material (red) and a cocoon of other debris around the jets (yellow and green). This simulation shows how the turbulence in the jets and cocoon could shake spacetime, and translates the gravitational waves they might emit into sound.</figcaption></figure>



<p>LIGO and its fellow detectors — Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan — currently have about a 1 percent chance of detecting cocoon gravitational waves. In future runs with improved detectors, that chance will go up.</p>



<p>Catching these waves could give astronomers a glimpse into the innermost parts of dying stars, which can’t be studied any other way, Gottlieb said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/masturbation-evolve-primates">When and why did masturbation evolve in primates? A new study provides clues</a></h4>

              
                <p>Though masturbation is common across the animal kingdom, it seems, at its face, to be an evolutionary paradox: Why would an animal waste time, energy and reproductive resources on self-pleasure instead of copulating with a partner?</p>



<p>Studies on individual species have found some explanations. Low-ranking Japanese macaques (<em>Macaca fuscata</em>), for example, masturbate to keep their sperm fresh for when they get a rare chance to mate. But the questions of when and why masturbation evolved in the first place have remained unsolved.</p>





<p>A new study, published in the June 7 <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>, suggests that the evolutionary history of masturbation in primates extends back at least 40 million years, and the behavior might indeed help male primates <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.0061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be ready to mate when they get the chance, and also stay free of disease</a>.</p>



<p>The authors are “the first to use a cross-species approach” to explore the function of masturbation, says Lateefah Roth, a biologist at the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry and Sex Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. It’s “a great starting point,” Roth says.</p>



<p>To determine when masturbation first evolved in primates, evolutionary biologist Matilda Brindle of University College London and colleagues sifted through the scientific literature to find records of which primates masturbate and which do not, whether in the wild or in captivity. </p>



<p>To fill gaps in the data due to masturbation not always being easy to observe (or looked for at all) by biologists, Brindle also sent out questionnaires to researchers to ask about their observations of primate masturbation that weren’t reported in the literature. This was especially important for information on female masturbation, Brindle says, which tends to go unnoticed because of a lack of an easy-to-spot erection. The team then used computer analyses to determine where in the primate lineage the behavior most likely originated.</p>



<p>Because of missing data, Brindle can’t definitely say whether the first ever primates masturbated. But she can say that from around 40 million years ago, “the ancestors of all monkeys and apes” seemed to have masturbated. This would be around when simians — apes and monkeys — split from the tarsiers, diminutive, bug-eyed primates that live in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>Once Brindle had identified when, she next turned to why. She looked at whether primates that masturbate tend to mate with multiple partners. This mating system would lead to evolutionary pressure for both males and females to gain more control over the mating process, like by being able to copulate more quickly, being readily aroused for preferred partners or by improving male sperm quality, as seen in the macaques. </p>



<p>Brindle also looked to see if primate species that masturbate tend to be infected by more pathogens, including those that cause sexually transmitted infections. Male Cape ground squirrels (<em>Geosciurus inauris</em>), for instance, are known to masturbate after sex to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013060" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleanse their systems</a> of infectious agents.</p>



<p>Brindle found that multiple mating partners and pathogen prevalence are associated with masturbation in male primates, but not in females. Masturbation can help males be ready to mate quickly with fresh sperm while also purging their reproductive tract of pathogens. But for females, the two hypotheses don’t mix. “Normally, the vagina is mildly acidic to keep pathogens at bay,” Brindle says, but it becomes less so when the female primate is aroused so that sperm aren’t killed on arrival. Making the vaginal environment safer for sperm also makes it safer for pathogens.</p>



<p>While the study found no correlation between female primate masturbation and having multiple mating partners, Brindle suspects that there probably is a relationship that would come to light with more data. “I would bet a lot of money on the fact that if we got more data down the line,” she says, “then we would find an effect for females.” The paucity of data for females may be driven in part by the historical tendency to think of female animals as “passive recipients of male behavior,” Brindle says.</p>



<p>The stigma around studying masturbation and sexual behavior has started to ease up, Brindle notes, which makes her hopeful that more discoveries will be made soon. But given that other mammals, as well as birds and reptiles, also masturbate, Roth says, “if we want to understand the bigger evolutionary picture of this behavior, we need to look beyond primates.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-shot-cats-spay-pregnant">A gene therapy shot might keep cats from getting pregnant without being spayed</a></h4>

              
                <p>Invasive surgeries to spay cats could one day be a thing of the past, replaced instead with a single shot. &nbsp;</p>



<p>An injected gene therapy given to female cats <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38721-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented them from getting pregnant</a>, researchers report June 6 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. None gave birth to a litter of kittens even after mating with a fertile male. The tactic, if it holds up in further testing, could offer a more efficient way to control a global population of feral cats that numbers in the hundreds of millions.</p>





<p>“We love domestic cats, but they are killers out in the environment,” says Bill Swanson, a conservation biologist at the Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden. Every year, free-roaming cats around the world probably kill <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cat-meat-meals-diet-playtime-wildlife-birds">billions of birds and small mammals</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/13</em>). Spaying both feral and pet cats can help to keep feline populations, and their casualties, under control. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The experimental gene therapy targets anti-Müellerian hormone, also known as Müllerian inhibiting substance, a protein that helps fetal sex organs develop. After injection, a modified virus introduces the gene that makes the hormone into the cats’ cells. The cells then make more anti-Müellerian hormone than normal. High levels of the protein may prevent a cat’s ovaries from releasing eggs by keeping follicles — the structures that house and release eggs — in a dormant state.</p>



<p>In the new study, Swanson and colleagues treated six female cats with the gene therapy. Three received a high dose and another three received a lower dose. An additional three control cats got a placebo. None had any severe side effects.</p>



<p>The team housed all nine cats together with a fertile male in two, four-month-long trials. One trial took place eight months after treatment; the second, with a different male, happened nearly two years after the injection. In both trials, the control cats gave birth to litters after mating with males only once. But none of the six treated cats became pregnant, despite two of them mating with the males.</p>



<p>The proof-of-concept study is “the first real sign of hope that we could do something besides spaying cats,” says Julie Levy, a veterinarian at the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved in the study. The single-dose injection is especially promising to control feral populations, eliminating the need to bring wild-living cats into a clinic for surgery or trap animals more than once to administer multiple doses.</p>



<p>Past alternatives to surgery, such as vaccines, proved ineffective over the long term. Vaccines teach the body to attack foreign invaders. Crafting a contraceptive vaccine targeted at the pituitary, which releases the hormones that spark ovulation, was difficult. “Your whole immune system is tuned to know what’s you, and it should not attack, and what is foreign, and it should attack,” Levy says. Diseases can develop when immune responses learn to attack the body itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many researchers tried to develop various vaccines as a cat contraceptive, but “we gave up,” Levy says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The experimental gene therapy could be a better approach because it doesn’t rely on the immune system and instead makes more of something that the body already has, so the immune system ideally won’t get involved at all.</p>



<p>What’s more, the gene is delivered to muscle cells, says David Pépin, a reproductive biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. There, the cell makes the hormone using small, circular strings of DNA. These strings float around the cell and aren’t inserted into the cell’s instruction manual, the DNA housed inside the nucleus. Because muscle cells generally don’t die, the DNA can stick around for a lifetime.</p>



<p>The study reports results after two years, Pépin says, but to date the team has followed the cats for more than four. Because gene therapy can last for a lifetime in other animals, including people, it’s likely that, with proper dosing, the same would be true for cats.</p>





<p>In the study, two of the treated cats mated with males. One mated a total of nine times yet still never got pregnant. Zooming in on all the cats’ hormones revealed that the treated females didn’t ovulate, but other hormones involved in reproduction and estrus — also known as heat, a time when female cats are ready to mate — remained intact.</p>



<p>The four treated cats that never bred with the males had spikes in estrogen levels, one sign of estrus. But you’d never have guessed that based on the cats’ behavior, Swanson notes. The females didn’t allow the males to breed, a sign those females weren’t in heat.</p>



<p>Males pursuing a ready-to-breed female are incredibly persistent if she’s in estrus, he says. A male will become restless, endlessly following a female and attempting to mount her if he thinks it’s possible to breed. “It’s like velociraptors in Jurassic Park testing the fence. All the time they’re testing these cats if they’re in estrus.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the kind of annoying behavior that makes people not want cats in their neighborhoods, Levy says. For her, the ideal cat contraception would keep females from allowing any males to breed with them. Hopefully that would stop fertile, disruptive males from yowling, spraying urine to mark territory and fighting other males when chasing a female rendered infertile by gene therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will still be years before the treatment makes it to vet offices, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar agencies around the world. Swanson, Pépin and colleagues are still tweaking the gene and method of delivery, exploring how to make it as effective as possible as well as cost-effective to make. Clinical studies with more cats are also required to verify the injection’s safety and efficacy.</p>



<p>Still, “it’s a really different way to do contraception,” Pépin says. And anti-Müellerian hormone is common among animals, so it may be possible to expand to other invasive species. Pépin and others are even exploring ways to leverage the hormone <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birth-control-research-moving-beyond-pill">in humans as a nonpermanent form of contraception</a> (<em>SN: 8/22/17</em>).
