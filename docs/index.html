<p>The journal <em>Nature Synthesis</em> has pulled <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00068-7">a high-profile article</a> describing the creation of a new type of carbon after a university investigation found some data were made up.</p>



<p>“The authors of the original paper claimed to have created an entirely new form or carbon, graphyne, which is fundamentally different common diamond or graphite,” said <a href="https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/valentin-rodionov-0">Valentin Rodionov</a>, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, whose team has been investigating the now-retracted work for the past two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If true, this would have been a groundbreaking discovery,” Rodionov told Retraction Watch. His team described its findings in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-024-00642-1">a commentary</a> published on September 2 in the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129941"></span>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-024-00627-0">retraction notice</a> released the same day stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A formal investigation was launched by the Office of Research Integrity at the University of Colorado after concerns were raised about the validity of some of the data reported in this work. From this investigation, it was concluded that the data used to produce Supplementary Figure S10 were fabricated and that the procedures used to produce Figure 2b deviated from standard practices. The investigation committee agreed that the data in Figure S10 are not critical to support the major claim of the manuscript and do not affect the overall scientific advance presented in a significant way. Out of a sense of responsibility, the authors have decided to retract the Article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited well over 100 times.</p>



<p>The corresponding authors of the study – <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/chemistry/wei-zhang">Wei Zhang at the University of Colorado, Boulder</a> and <a href="https://en.yz.qust.edu.cn/Tutor.htm">Yingjie Zhao of Qingdao University of Science and Technology in China</a> – did not respond to requests for comment from Retraction Watch. Asked for comment, a Springer Nature spokesperson referred us to the retraction notice.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Rodionov explained that the authors used a “method called ‘alkyne metathesis,’ which was always expected to be the path to this new material. While this approach failed to work for the last 25 years, in the hands of the authors it has seemingly produced the desired result.”</p>



<p>But the findings didn’t hold up when Rodionov and his colleagues looked more closely. Of the two crystal structures for the synthesized material described in the paper, one “featured a distance between non-bonded carbon atoms which in our opinion is impossibly short,” he said. Furthermore, the reported spectroscopic characterization appeared to disagree with the structure claimed by the authors.”</p>



<p>It turned out that structure “could be generated through a common type of a computer simulation, if the parameters for the simulation were set to incorrect default values.” And that “structure was a perfect match for the reported X-ray diffraction data,” he said, referring to a technique for direct measurement of interatomic distances. Those data “featured an unusual distribution of experimental noise, and overall the noise level was lower than expected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither discrepancy could be “explained by any reasonable means,” said Rodionov, whose team shared their findings with the University of Colorado and the journal starting in late 2022.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00136-y">correction to the paper in July 2022</a> added a Research Resource ID which had not appeared in the original version.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bailey.gif"><img decoding="async" width="168" height="210" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bailey.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-127175"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michael Bailey</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Springer Nature has halted an accepted paper criticizing the publishing giant’s controversial <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02635-1">retraction</a> last year of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9">an article</a> that surveyed parents of children with gender dysphoria, leading an associate editor to resign, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>According to emails we obtained, the blocked paper was slated to appear as a commentary in <a href="https://link.springer.com/collections/dcdbjehcbb">a special issue</a> of Springer Nature’s <em>Current Psychology</em> that aimed “to stimulate discussion of all aspects of the ‘unpublication’ of scientific articles.”</p>



<p>“This is the only time I&#8217;ve had an accepted paper overruled in 4 years” as an associate editor at this journal, Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University in Florida, one of two guest editors of the special issue, told us by email.</p>



<span id="more-129938"></span>



<p>Ferguson resigned from <em>Current Psychology</em>’s editorial board on August 29, a decision he said “pretty much sums up my feelings” about the publisher’s handling of the manuscript.</p>



<p>The aborted commentary, a draft of which Retraction Watch has seen, excoriated Springer Nature for pulling the article “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9">Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria: Parent Reports on 1655 Possible Cases</a>,” which was published in March 2023 in the <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we explained last year in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/24/after-backlash-publisher-to-retract-article-that-surveyed-parents-of-children-with-gender-dysphoria-says-co-author/">a story</a> preceding the <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/104685">much-criticized</a> paper’s retraction:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD) is, the article stated, a “controversial theory” that “common cultural beliefs, values, and preoccupations cause some adolescents (especially female adolescents) to attribute their social problems, feelings, and mental health issues to gender dysphoria,” and that “youth with ROGD falsely believe that they are transgender,” in part due to social influences.  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the canceled commentary, which contained several instances of opinion and conjecture, Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and a coauthor of the 2023 paper, argued that retractions are “increasingly a vehicle for scientific censorship.” He laid out the details of how his work was withdrawn and speculated about the publisher’s motivations.</p>



<p>“I was critical of Springer Nature, because I believed its decision to retract my 2023 article was made for ideological rather than ethical reasons,” Bailey told us by email. “Furthermore, I criticized other actions by Springer Nature and its journals, such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2"><em>Nature Human Behaviour</em></a>, which deemphasize scientific integrity for the sake of identity politics. This recent experience does nothing to dampen that criticism.”</p>



<p>Bailey described himself in the commentary as “tenured, thick-skinned, and annoyed by present trends in academia away from academic freedom and towards identity politics.” Other academics have made similar points in the past, <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2015/02/galileos-middle-finger-scientists-under-attack/">highlighting the risks to democracy</a> when activists attack scientists over research they find politically unacceptable.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to the author, Ferguson had invited him to contribute to the special issue on retractions in <em>Current Psychology</em> in June 2023. Bailey submitted his paper two months later. In October, editor-in-chief of the journal Richard Ferraro told Bailey by email that two of three reviewers had recommended acceptance, but noted that “the Reject review aligns with my thoughts to an extent” and asked for a revision.</p>



<p>Bailey replied that he would not make the changes suggested by Ferraro, but was “willing to consider very specific modifications” that Ferguson had recommended. On December 18, Ferguson wrote to Bailey, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This is a tricky issue and I know you (and I) want you to have your chance to get on the record with this. I also think this is an important message to get into the public. Although it’s true you could publish this in [the Journal of Open Inquiry in Behavioral Science, a title published by the <a href="https://www.soibs.com/">Society for Open Inquiry in Behavioral Science</a>, which Bailey co-founded in 2021], I think there are some advantages of you publishing this with Springer/Nature, not the least of which is that it weakens censorship efforts by tackling it directly at the source. Put bluntly, perhaps, I see value in publishing a criticism of Springer/Nature’s censorship in Springer/Nature.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(The retracted paper was since <a href="https://researchers.one/articles/23.10.00002v1">republished</a> in the<em> Journal of Open Inquiry in Behavioral Science</em>, <a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2023/10/24/junk-science-journal-republishes-retracted-anti-trans-paper/">drawing flak</a> from the LGBTQ community.)</p>



<p>Bailey said he submitted a revision of his manuscript on March 27 and that it was accepted on May 21. In July, however, the paper had still not been published, and Bailey asked Ferguson for an update.</p>



<p>“Well it’s done and scheduled for the special issue, so there’s no plan (that I know of) to squish it,” Ferguson responded, adding that the paper had been “switched to a ‘commentary.’”</p>



<p>Ferguson added: “Do I suspect they feel a bit embarrassed by your article…maybe…but they seem to have done the ‘right’ thing.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Then, on August 29, Bailey received an email from Ferraro, one of the journal&#8217;s two editors-in-chief:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dear author,</p>



<p>You have submitted a manuscript to a special issue in Current Psychology, Retractions and Their Discontents. The guest editors had in principle accepted your manuscript and based on their recommendation, we also provisionally accepted your manuscript. As the Editors-in-Chief of Current Psychology, the final responsibility for the content of the journal, including its special issues, lies with us. </p>



<p>Upon further review and after careful consideration following conversations with the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group, we have decided not to proceed with the publication of your manuscript. What you have submitted appears to be an opinion piece, rather than an original research article and therefore not suitable for publication. We have therefore rescinded the accept decision.</p>



<p>Best regards,</p>



<p>F. Richard Ferraro</p>



<p>Lauren S. Seifert</p>



<p>Co-Editors-in-Chief of Current Psychology </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ferguson said he was informed of the decision to withdraw the acceptance of the commentary that same day.</p>



<p>“Apparently some kind of ‘Integrity Group’ at Springer got a hold of it, decided to squash it, and used the excuse that this was because it was an opinion piece (of course there are zillions of opinion pieces in all manner of psychology journals including, I am sure, many others Springer publishes),” he told us. “So I think it was this Integrity Group that [prompted the retraction], pretty much supervening all the actual scholars involved.”</p>



<p>Teresa Krauss, Publishing Director at Springer Nature, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Springer Nature expects all submitted manuscripts – whether original research, commentaries, or editorials – to contain factual and accurate information as part of our commitment to maintaining the validity of the scientific record. Journal editors can contact the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group for advice on any manuscript under consideration. In this instance, RIG was consulted due to concerns about the accuracy of some statements in the manuscript.</p>



<p>After examination of these concerns, the Editors were advised that they may want to review the manuscript again. After further careful consideration, they took the editorial decision to rescind the initial acceptance decision.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/spotlight-on-eve-corrie">Spotlight On: Eve Corrie</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We are back with our &apos;spotlight on&apos; interview series, shedding light on inspiring women working in the field of neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. The questions posed to these individuals explore the themes of job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations in the neuroscience field, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to see new interviews every few weeks from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This month, we interviewed Eve Corrie, an </span></span></strong><em><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">in vitro</span></span></strong></em><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> neurobiologist working at Medicines Discovery Catapult, an independent, not-for-profit drug discovery innovation centre. Eve discusses her decision to move from academia to industry and the benefits she has experienced so far!</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I can probably trace the start of my interest in neuroscience back to a particular day in Year 11. A neuroanatomist had come to do some outreach during a lunchtime session, and she had brought a human brain in a bucket to pass round the whole class to hold. I remember thinking that it was so intense that I was holding the organ that makes a person a person, and how small it seemed. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After reading many popular neuroscience books during my gap year I ended up at UCL for 4 amazing years and got interested in the neuroscience of pain signalling. Having insisted for years that I didn’t want to do a PhD, I then ended up in Sheffield doing a PhD investigating the utility and mechanism of novel, engineered botulinum toxins as pain therapeutics. I got a taste of the drug discovery industry during a six-month placement at Eli Lilly as part of my studentship and realised that this was the sort of role that I wanted when I finished my doctorate. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have since moved over to industry where I currently work for Medicines Discovery Catapult, part of the Catapult network set up by Innovate UK to enhance and accelerate UK research and industry. I work on drug discovery projects using human stem cell-derived models of the brain and nervous system, mostly in the neurodegenerative disease space. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What made you pursue the position you are currently in?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I managed to find one of the only neuroscience industry jobs that let me stay up North! That’s sort of a joke, but not really. I really did not fancy moving down to London, Oxford, or Cambridge after I had become used to the significantly improved quality of life you can afford when you don’t live in the golden triangle. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It wasn’t just geography though, obviously the organisation and the role also seemed very good otherwise I wouldn’t have ended up here. The way MDC works is unique, being partially publicly funded and non-profit, but with aspects of working for a commercial company – a blend which seemed very appealing. It also allowed me to transition away from animal work and get experience working with human induced pluripotent stem cells, a transition that I think will serve me well as science moves away from the over-reliance on animal, particularly rodent, models.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I interviewed for one other role as I was applying for this one, and I’m now very glad I didn’t get it as it would have been entirely desk-based. Things like moving around the labs, physically doing things, and learning how to use pieces of equipment are quite important to my job satisfaction and I really enjoy that aspect of wet lab science. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It’s also great to be exposed to new projects in different disease areas, through meeting new potential clients and developing new ideas together. It’s very different to academia where you’re digging down into one tiny area of science for many years – rain or shine. Some people love that, but I need variety. We’re constantly developing new assays and learning new techniques in the lab and it’s very satisfying when it pays off. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I also enjoy working for a company with such a broad remit. It’s almost like a blend of the best bits of working for a drug discovery company or a contract research organisation, mixed with some of the freedom to innovate that you get in academia. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are some of the challenging aspects of your current job?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Science is always challenging, whatever role or sector you’re in! Working with stem-cell derived models is particularly fiddly, as they are very sensitive and take a long time to mature. When you’ve been babying some precious cells for weeks, it can be kind of crushing when something goes wrong. Unfortunately, that’s just the nature of life in the lab. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience job?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’m having to learn how to sell what we do. I’m trying to learn how to network more efficiently, for example when attending and presenting at conferences. I’ve even been involved in a few social media posts and videos to advertise our neuroscience capabilities and conference posters, which has been a learning curve! The hard bit for me is not when you’re in the middle of a project, running the experiments. The hard bit is meeting the right people, building enough rapport, then having good enough ideas that they want to collaborate with you. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I went to Lyme Regis last summer, in order to visit where Mary Anning lived and worked along the Jurassic Coast in the 1800s. Mary was one of the best fossil hunters of history, discovering the first complete ichthyosaur skeleton, the first plesiosaurs, and the first pterosaur outside of Germany. She would walk the coastline every tide, especially in stormy weather, as this was when the rock would be eroded and reveal new specimens. She mostly did this to sell her findings to tourists to make a living, but in doing so changed the course of palaeontology, with many of her specimens still exhibited in the Natural History Museum today. Of course, as a working-class woman at that time she was never accepted into the scientific community and is only nowadays credited as the amazing scientist she was, but she’s one of my historical inspirations for her tenacity and diligence to her work. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">More personally, I’ve been lucky enough to be surrounded by inspiring women in science all the way from school, to my integrated masters, through my PhD and in my current role. My current manager is such a kind, supportive, clever person and she’s a joy to work with. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’ve never been particularly future-thinking or goal-seeking. I tend to bumble along in my career until the next thing happens to me, and this strategy has served me well so far. I imagine I’ll stay in my current role until I’m either no longer enjoying it or no longer progressing, then will look for the next step as that time approaches. I sometimes feel like there’s so much pressure to have the most impressive career in the room and always be striving for the next best thing, but unfortunately that also can tend to come with a lot of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. As long as I feel fulfilled in what I’m doing, and I’m surrounded by good colleagues around me, then why would I leave? </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">If I was hard-pushed to have a goal for myself then maybe in the future I’d like to move onto something more directly patient-focused or clinical, but I couldn’t tell you what that would look like.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Don’t panic if something you’ve been aiming for doesn’t pan out. There will always be something else that comes along that will be equally good, if not better. Try and think about the choices you make along the way, make informed decisions and life changes when you need to, but it’s not the end of the world if something goes a bit awry at some point. There are so many examples of scientists whose careers have taken a huge turning point they couldn’t have predicted, whether down to choice or something out of their control – just listen to a few episodes of The Life Scientific and you’ll realise how common it is. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Also, don’t give up immediately if something is tough! Stick it out for a while because, chances are, you will be capable of adapting to it. A bit of grit and tenacity will get you a long way. Obviously, even if after a decent adjustment period you’re still unhappy, or it’s affecting your mental health, then make one of those informed decisions and life changes, but make sure you allow for a decent settling period first. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Different sectors of STEM have significantly different problems. For example, in bioscience there seems to be a relatively equal split of men to women at all levels, and I’ve never felt any sort of way about being female in this environment. However, move over to the computer science sector and almost everybody is male. Maybe it’s a coincidence that the pay is significantly higher in this sector than bioscience, but maybe it’s not. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Something I think is a broader problem in all of STEM and academia is the noticeable lack of distribution across different “social classes” and representation from deprived areas. This problem can only be addressed at the root, very early on in childhood. It depends on the catchment area you are born in, whether you have guardians with time to read with you, whether your school has any resources to support your individual interests, whether you have to work part-time through university to supplement your Maintenance Loan which doesn’t cover your rent, whether you have the financial ability to relocate to begin a PhD project in a different part of the country… Until there is more support and less reliance on family to fill the gaps that should be provided by the government, this disparity will remain, and so much talent will continue to be wasted.</span></span></p>

<p>Last November, the VA published <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/03/2023-24342/findings-of-research-misconduct">findings</a> stating Hee-Jeong Im Sampen, formerly a research biologist at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Chicago, faked images and inflated sample sizes in three published papers, a grant application, a presentation, and an unpublished manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the findings, the VA banned Sampen, who publishes under the name Hee-Jeong Im, from conducting research for the department and requested retractions of the three publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the papers, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcp.25015">Development of an Experimental Animal Model for Lower Back Pain by Percutaneous Injury-Induced Lumbar Facet Joint Osteoarthritis</a>” and “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcp.24946">Environmental Disruption of Circadian Rhythm Predisposes Mice to Osteoarthritis-Like Changes in Knee Joint</a>,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Cellular Physiology</em> in 2015, and don’t currently have any sort of notice about the VA finding they contain faked images.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129930"></span>



<p>In response to our inquiry, a Wiley spokesperson said the publisher was aware of the VA’s request to retract the paper “and has investigated.” The retractions “are in progress and should take place within the next few weeks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third article in the VA’s findings, “<a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/75/12/2133">PKCδ null mutations in a mouse model of osteoarthritis alter osteoarthritic pain independently of joint pathology by augmenting NGF/TrkA-induced axonal outgrowth</a>,” was retracted July 1. <em>Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases</em>, the BMJ journal in which the paper appeared, “was notified in February 2024” about the findings of research misconduct, according to the <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/83/7/e17">retraction notice</a>. The journal also acknowledged and linked to the November 2023 Federal Register notice about the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three papers have been cited more than 100 times collectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, with a handful of those coming after the VA’s publication of its findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sampen, who holds a part-time, untenured position as a research professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Illinois, Chicago, told us she disagrees with the retractions, and the findings were “unjustified.” She previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/06/a-travesty-a-researcher-found-guilty-of-misconduct-by-federal-u-s-government-responds/">disputed the VA’s findings at length</a>, saying they “appear to serve some VA administrative purpose and led to my termination, but they lack validity from a legal, ethical, and practical scientific perspective.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings in her case are currently under review at the US Office of Research Integrity, Sampen told us. She continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>But whatever ORI decides, I would like to tell you that the scientific validity of my lab’s research and findings have never been questioned. The allegations of research misconduct against me are based on my supervisory role, concern a tiny fraction of the enormous amounts of data my lab has published, and simply involve erroneously placed figures or images.</p>



<p>Throughout my entire life, I have humbly pursued science and put in a tremendous amount of effort while progressing as an academic. Science was my whole life. I never expected my reputation would hinge on alleged errors of which I was unaware and beyond my direct control.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction of the two <em>Journal of Cellular Physiology</em> papers will bring Sampen’s total to four, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dIm%252c%2bHee-Jeong">by our count</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Arthritis Research and Therapy</em>, a Springer Nature title, retracted another of Sampen’s articles, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ar3441">Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 is principally responsible for fibroblast growth factor 2-induced catabolic activities in human articular chondrocytes</a>,” in August. The <a href="https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-024-03381-y">notice</a> states “an investigation jointly conducted by Rush University and the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center (JBVAMC) has determined that Fig. 5B contains fabricated and/or falsified data,” though the paper wasn’t listed in the VA’s published findings. The paper has been cited more than 100 times. </p>



<p>Sampen has continued to publish after the findings were announced, with “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi5501">Nanoparticle-based inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors alleviates osteoarthritis pain and cartilage damage</a>” appearing in <em>Science Advances</em> in February. The paper, which received coverage in <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2417059-injections-of-drug-filled-nanoparticles-may-relieve-arthritis-pain/">New Scientist without any mention of </a>the public misconduct findings, describes experiments administering an experimental drug formulation to mice with osteoarthritis.</p>

                <p>This coming <strong>Monday, September 2nd, 2024</strong>, the arXiv team will be observing Labor Day, a federal holiday in the United States. This holiday will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This brief change will only affect the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As our team celebrates Labor Day, announcements will be slightly deferred.</p>
<p>As you plan your submissions to arXiv this week, please be aware of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday, September 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Friday, August 30, 2024, and before 14:00ET Tuesday September 3, 2024 will be announced on Tuesday, September 3, 2024 at 20:00ET.</li>
<li><strong>September arXiv IDs. </strong>September arXiv IDs will be assigned to articles submitted in September at or after 14:00ET Tuesday, September 3, 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>To stay up to date on arXiv news and changes to the announcement schedule, subscribe to <a href="http://blog.arxiv.org/">the arXiv blog</a> or follow us on social (<a href="https://twitter.com/arxiv">Twitter/X</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arxiv">LinkedIn</a>) for timely updates.</p>

<p>A researcher who posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ssad_kth-mdu-academicmisconduct-activity-7201577707405549569-vceW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">LinkedIn</a> about a paper that plagiarized his work says he’s now the subject of an email campaign making false allegations about his articles.</p>



<p>In July, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/04/elsevier-withdraws-plagiarized-paper-after-original-author-calls-journal-out-on-linkedin/">we reported</a> that <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/sasansad">Sasan Sadrizadeh</a>, researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, had his work plagiarized in a now-retracted paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In what seems to be a <em>direct</em> response to our efforts,” as Sadrizadeh wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7227692500075851776/">recent LinkedIn post</a>, his bosses, colleagues, and journals have been <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSude_1xigUrMInbxWBh8Aggn6Qije6Y8nbv3s45tNk/edit?usp=sharing">inundated with emails</a> from impostors, accusing Sadrizadeh of misuse of funds and calling for the removal of his articles. At least one journal editor seems to have taken the allegations seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129919"></span>



<p>Sadrizadeh’s case is reminiscent of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/04/cyberstalking-pits-harvard-professor-against-pubpeer/">2023 cyberstalking</a> of Harvard Medical School professor Joseph Loscalzo on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone impersonating <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hamacher-thomas">Thomas Hamacher</a>, a researcher and professor at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, emailed several journal editors-in-chief in July, claiming to speak on behalf of the German Energy Agency (dena). However, the domain the email came from, “dena-de.net,” is registered to a Squarespace account that was created in June, according to the <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domain=dena-de.net">WHOIS domain database</a>, while the official email domain of dena is dena.de.net.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one instance, the false Hamacher sent an email to the editors of several journals, including <em>Building and Environment Journal</em> and <em>Total Environment Journal, </em>alleging Sadrizadeh had failed to disclose funding from dena for the research described in the publications. The emails accused Sadrizadeh of “misappropriation” of funds and “serious ethical misconduct.” They then request the “immediate withdrawal” of the article and “a pause on the review of publication of any pending submissions” by Sadrizadeh. “Relevant officials” from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology were copied, including the president, Anders Söderholm, and several vice presidents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bin Chen, an assistant editor at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-cleaner-production"><em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em></a>, where Sadrizadeh has at least <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624015804">two</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622051095">papers</a> published, reached out to Sadrizadeh after receiving an identical email from the Hamacher impostor. Chen asked for a “prompt and full response within two weeks” and said he would also consider informing the research institution and funding agency that supported the research. “Please note that if we do not have an adequate and timely response, we may be forced to conclude that the allegations are truthful,” he said.</p>



<p>After Sadrizadeh responded, informing the editor that the emails were spam, Chen told him the journal “understand[s] the case now” and that Chen would inform the other editors.</p>



<p>Sadrizadeh told us that he does not receive funding from dena. The grant number cited in the impostor emails was “DEA 2024.315.4H.”</p>



<p>Fiona Vonnemann, a member of dena’s legal council, told Retraction Watch she “cannot confirm” if the grant “even exists” and said it was “likely fabricated.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On July 30, the Hamacher impostor sent an email to KTH President Anders Söderholm, telling him “a lawsuit has been filed against him by the German Energy Agency.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadrizadeh said he sent Hamacher an email letting him know that he was being impersonated. Sadrizadeh said the two then spoke on the phone and that Hamacher is aware of the problem. Hamacher did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Vonnemann confirmed “the sender’s email address is not ours” in an email sent to Sadrizadeh. She also said “there is little we can do in this situation, as these actions do not constitute a criminal offense.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Vonnemann confirmed that the emails are not affiliated with dena. “The statements in these emails do not in any way reflect views of dena. They appear to be spam emails,” she told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An unnamed representative of dena in a different email said they had contacted the dena IT department, and asked for Squarespace correspondence from Sadrizadeh “so i [sic] can look into pressing charges.” However, Vonnemann said in an email the “only action we are taking (from a legal standpoint) is to prevent the misuse of an email address that mimics ours.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadrizadeh sent Squarespace an email requesting an investigation into the domain and for Squarespace to reveal the people behind it. A representative responded, saying they “take reports like this very seriously, and we actively keep track of them.” The domain no longer works and it isn’t available online. Emails we sent to the address that contacted the journals bounced back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Squarespace did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone using another email account purporting to be that of <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/fariborz-haghighat.html">Fariborz Haghighat</a>, a researcher at Concordia University, sent an email to several KTH faculty members, including Sadrizadeh, with the subject line “No place for energy engineering &lt;brainfarts&gt; in scientific literature.” The email contained only a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Amirmohammad+Behzadi">link to the PubPeer page</a> for the PhD student mentioned in our original post, Amirmohammad Behzadi. Many of his papers have PubPeer comments accusing Behzadi of over-citing his own work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Haghighat did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Although Sadrizadeh told us he believes the comments are another attempt to discredit him and Behzadi, some of the PubPeer comments date from <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6D48C768CFC4F77E86EFEE461C9BC5">December 2023</a>, months before he went public with his plagiarism charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the comments contain similar critiques of unnecessary self-citation. In one, on the paper “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319921016347?via%3Dihub">4E analysis of efficient waste heat recovery from SOFC using APC: An effort to reach maximum efficiency and minimum emission through an application of grey wolf optimization</a>,” user “Tricorynus dichrous” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4E23292792C0503E58042596FBFADC">commented</a>, “fundamental terms don’t need to be cited with any source because they are direct explanations of the first and second law of thermodynamics,” but the paper had cited previous work of Behzadi and his colleagues for these equations. If any citations were necessary, the authors should have used a primary source such as a book, Tricorynus wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Behzadi declined to comment on these allegations, but Sadrizadeh told us he thought they were “false” and referred us to Behzadi’s <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57201652822">SCOPUS profile</a>, which Sadrizadeh said shows only 8% of Behzadi’s citations are self-citations. Clarivate’s Web of Science shows the same percentage of self-citations.</p>



<p>Sadrizadeh said self-citation is “not only common but also often necessary to demonstrate the continuity and development of their research” and that failure to do so would make it “challenging to trace the evolution of their research and the cumulative knowledge they have contributed to the field.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his LinkedIn post about the emails, Sadrizadeh also said those who commented on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ssad_kth-mdu-academicmisconduct-activity-7201577707405549569-vceW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">previous LinkedIn post</a> calling out the plagiarism of his paper received emails accusing him of misconduct, as the journals had. Ola Eriksson, a professor at the University of Gävle in Gävle, Sweden, who had commented on the first post, replied that he had a “strong suspicion” the email he received was “bogus.”</p>



<p>Sadreizadeh told us the apparent retaliation against him felt like “organized crime. If you even go against these kind of people, they do whatever they can to stop you.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="333" height="333" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-129915" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius.jpeg 333w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">René Aquarius</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Two Dutch researchers were preparing a review of preclinical animal models for hemorrhagic stroke last July when they stumbled across a disturbing pattern in the literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, they found many more papers on the topic than the 50 or so they expected based on their experience: more than 600.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, nearly every study proposed a different intervention, which was “very unusual,” said René Aquarius, a neurosurgery researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. “Why would you show a very beneficial effect and then say, ‘let’s do something else?’”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129907"></span>



<p>Aquarius and his colleague, Kim Wever, an assistant professor in the department of anesthesiology, pain and palliative medicine at the same institute, didn’t have experience with scientific sleuthing. But they recently had seen <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/elisabeth-bik/">Elisabeth Bik</a> speak about image manipulation, and her experience inspired them to dig deeper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pair decided to collect images of Western blots from a random sample of the papers, project them on a meeting room wall, and gather two biomedical students to help with the detective work. Within a few minutes of scrolling through the images, Wever recalls someone exclaiming, “Hey, I think I saw that one before!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers’ investigation revealed unexpected overlaps between data in three papers of a neurosurgical group in Taiwan. They kept digging, and found problems in a total of 24 of the group’s papers which reused the same data while purporting to show different experimental conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One article at a time, Aquarius and Wever pieced together their findings, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22aij+lie+kwan%22">posted them on PubPeer</a>, and contacted the journal editors. Their efforts so far have led to nine retractions and two corrections. But the problems in the field extend far beyond this one group in Taiwan, they say.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In each of Aquarius’ posts on PubPeer, he states he “noticed a considerable overlap between figures published in different studies.” So far, an author has responded to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8B12E9D4BF6121C2E76AF61040CBAD">only one of his posts.&nbsp; </a>Chih-Zen Chang of the Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan claimed the figures are “original” and apologized for not being able to offer the original films since they “were spoiled in a damaged box.” Chang did not respond to requests for comment from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chang frequently appears as a co-author of Aij-Lie Kwan, a neurosurgeon at the same institute and the former president of the International College of Surgeons. Kwan did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All nine of the retractions posted so far note that the authors did not respond to correspondence from the journal. In contrast, they seem to have offered responses regarding articles that now have corrections. <a href="https://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/abstract/2017/05000/hyperglycemia_aggravates_cerebral_vasospasm_after.28.aspx#errata">In one correction</a>, the journal wrote “the error stems from a misclassification in the authors’ computer folder,” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4877462/">In another</a>, the authors claim to have “mistakenly used the same Western blot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the retracted papers linked to Aij-Lie Kwan are:&nbsp;</p>

</ol>



<p>Aquarius described his experience with journal editors and ethics teams as “hit or miss.” He said some are “very dismissive and say, well, I don’t see a problem.” One journal declined to take further action on a paper after relying “in good faith upon the authors&#8217; representations,” according to Aquarius’ post <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/396AEC52D03A285971D90B526186B2">on PubPeer</a> about the journal’s response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also noted the inconsistency of the journals’ decision making. The same set of data led to a retraction of one paper, but resulted in a correction for another. “It’s super weird to me that a publisher comes to a different conclusion based on the same type of evidence,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other publishers were helpful and immediately started investigating, Aquarius said. One journal, <em>Acta Neurochirurgica</em>, which published six of the now-retracted articles, declared the editor-in-chief “no longer has confidence in the presented data” because of duplications and other errors with the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wever and Aquarius said they see the problems and flag them, but leave the judgment for the journals. “Whether the problem is an honest mistake or sloppy science or even worse, scientific misconduct,that&#8217;s not up to us to decide,” Aquarius said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 600 papers found by the pair suggest there is extensive research into potential treatments for early brain injury. However, “it just gives a completely false idea of the research field,” according to Wever. For Aquarius, he hears firsthand about the consequences of hemorrhagic stroke from patients in a clinical study, and stresses that “errors in the scientific record need to be resolved.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their analysis so far has revealed no common denominator for the problematic articles. “It’s all over the world, all different types of universities,” Aquarius said. “From top universities to not very known universities… from the top journals to the worst.”</p>

<p>One in four papers on research involving scanning electron microscopy (SEM) misidentifies the specific instrument that was used, raising suspicions of misconduct, according to a new study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/4wqcr">published</a> August 27 as <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/4wqcr">a preprint</a> on the Open Science Framework , examined SEM images in more than 1 million studies published by 50 materials science and engineering journals since 2010.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers found only 8,515 articles published the figure captions and the image’s metadata banners, both of which are needed to determine whether the correct microscope is listed in papers. Metadata banners usually contain important information about the experiments conducted, including the operating voltage of the microscope and the instrument’s model and parameters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of these papers, 2,400 (28%) listed the wrong microscope manufacturer or model, raising questions about the integrity of the conducted research.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129909"></span>



<p>“This is a very weird mistake to make,” says study coauthor <a href="https://amaral.northwestern.edu/people/richardson/publications-by-date/">Reese Richardson</a>, a doctoral candidate at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “It’s like if you wrote all of your code in your manuscript in <em>R</em> and then you said we used Python for all software development.”</p>



<p>For Richardson, there are telltale signs that suggest many of the images in question originate from the same source. For instance, captions in many different papers refer to using a Czech Hitachi instrument even though Hitachi is a Japanese company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a sort of bizarre mistake,” Richardson said. “Yet it shows up repeatedly with the same author present on all of these articles. So this is just an instance where the author is reusing text over and over and over again.” What’s more, in many of these papers, the authors used an instrument from Tescan, not Hitachi, Richardson said, referring to two major manufacturers of the devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The levels of misreporting the study found are “genuinely concerning,” said Angus Wilkinson, a materials scientist at the University of Oxford, in the U.K., and a <a href="https://cen.acs.org/people/Materials-scientist-explains-why-he-started-commenting-PubPeer/102/web/2024/06">part-time scientific sleuth</a>, who was not involved with the new analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, articles with no authors in common nonetheless contained identical typos in the section describing the microscopes the researchers used. “It is pretty clear that these articles were generated or were synthesized at scale without regard for the actual results or the quality of the articles,” Wilkinson added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many papers also misidentified figures as originating from “Amirkabir,” Richardson pointed out, yet none of the authors was affiliated with Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. “So it seems very likely that someone at Amirkabir University is just leasing out these images to be used by other people,” he said.</p>



<p>For many of the articles with the odd mistakes, Richardson and his team began to suspect misidentified microscopes were a sign of a manuscript originating from <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">paper mills</a>, which typically churn out bogus or plagiarized papers and sell author slots on them in exchange for a fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wilkinson agreed: “The majority of these cases probably are either poor-quality articles at best where that attention to detail has been lacking or indeed are fingerprints of paper mills.”</p>



<p>It’s technically possible researchers had more than one microscope in the lab and named the wrong one by mistake, noted Nick Wise, a fluid dynamics researcher at the University of Cambridge, in the U.K., whose sleuthing work has resulted in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">hundreds of retractions</a>. But Wise also thinks a significant proportion of the 2,400 studies could be researchers blindly reusing figures that aren’t theirs. “It’s a symptom of academic fraud,” he said.</p>



<p>A key limitation of the study is its reliance on authors themselves revealing what instruments they used in figure captions and not cropping out relevant image metadata, Richardson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But he doesn’t blame journals for the missing image metadata, as editors generally have cropped these out, often to make sure papers fit in print. This practice changed recently when the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR principles</a> for scientific data were established, and Richardson said journals now play an important role in ensuring full documentation of image metadata.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers found only 43 of the 2,400 suspect papers had been flagged on PubPeer for other issues such as duplicated images, manipulated data and hand-painted graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richardson said he believes many more of the papers would have ended up on the online forum if someone had scoured through them or run them through AI tools like <a href="https://imagetwin.ai/">ImageTwin</a> that can identify integrity issues in figures of scientific manuscripts.</p>



<p>According to Richardson, some authors in the study sample made identical mistakes in the figure captions across several different studies. The most productive authors, who published hundreds of studies since 2010, got the SEM wrong 20% to 50% of the time, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The most prolific author that made this mistake in their articles had done it more than three dozen times and they tended to publish very frequently in the same journals,” Richardson added, “as many as 16 times in the same journal in the same publication year, and a lot of these articles of theirs had already been flagged on PubPeer for other data integrity issues.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/aruk-panel-questions-blog-addressing-unanswered-queries">ARUK Panel Questions Blog: Addressing Unanswered Queries</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It was fantastic to see the huge amount of thought-provoking questions for our panel at our ARUK24 workshop, ‘Tackling gender gaps in dementia research’. We were not able to address all of your questions on the day, however, we have reached out to our panellists, as well as other WiNUK members, to answer the questions that we missed. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_384bc6087ea149f5b778adf237686b03~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Our incredible panellists!"></figure>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you comment on the pressure to move around? I have been told that staying in the same place is a career killer, but I have family commitments so cannot move.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the questions posed to our panellists revolved around the pressure to relocate for career advancement. Fiona shared her perspective, saying, &quot;I personally did not feel any pressure to move, but I did move a lot for exciting opportunities. I think there are pros and cons to moving or staying. I think the best thing is to focus on your goals and try to avoid making comparisons to others. Take (or chase) the opportunities that excite you and motivate you to get up in the morning and work hard. Your success is driven by your output and your growing experience, which you can apply to your role as it expands, and that doesn’t rely directly on location but is a combination of effort, hard work, commitment, grit, riding the wave, soaking up broad learnings and some luck.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam reflected on her experience of feeling pressured to relocate in order to achieve academic independence. She recounted, &quot;Ten years ago, I was coming to the end of my PhD and I applied for a fellowship to be able to stay in the department where I was working. When my application was rejected, one of the reasons given was that I wasn’t moving to another lab. I was warned that it could happen, but it just didn’t seem rational to me. I felt like if I had everything set up to make the project a success, and I had a support network already established to enable me to be successful, why should I have to move to a place where things might be done differently and I wouldn’t know anyone?&quot; Kam continued, &quot;The rationale was that I wouldn’t be able to establish independence whilst still working closely with my PhD supervisor, and I ended up moving to three different cities in the UK with successive postdoc positions. This wouldn’t have been possible if I had financial or family commitments, and I would have had to leave academia through circumstance rather than choice.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">However, she has noticed some improvements in this area. She explained, “I don’t think that the pressure to move is as prevalent as it was 10 years ago, as I see more and more ECRs (early career researchers) staying for postdocs and fellowships in the same institution where they have done their PhDs. So I think we are seeing positive changes in attitude regarding this.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Maternity/caring responsibilities are a big barrier, but what about women-specific illnesses such as endometriosis, which can severely impact the ability to work?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Fiona highlighted the diverse challenges individuals face in their careers and the need for systemic improvements to create a more inclusive environment. Fiona emphasised, &quot;We all face different challenges at different times. Chronic illnesses are really tough and probably require individual considerations within the context of the role. By increasing awareness of each of our individual challenges, we can work to improve the systemic infrastructure to support us and our needs and create a more inclusive environment.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">She further stressed the importance of focusing on personal goals and seeking support, saying, &quot;I think you have to focus on what you can do and who can support you in achieving your goals, and also support others with theirs.&quot; We resonate with Fiona&apos;s insights, calling for a heightened awareness of individual circumstances and a collective compassionate effort to address these obstacles effectively to help even the playing field on wellbeing and productivity in research.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What do you think of women in senior roles who display internalised misogyny? How can we stop ECRs from thinking that to succeed they need to be the same?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When asked about the issue of internalised misogyny among women in senior roles, Fiona offered a nuanced perspective. Fiona cautioned against stereotyping specific styles, acknowledging that responses can be influenced by various factors and may not always reflect intentional bias, but that does not mean it never happens. ‘’We have all experienced examples of direct or indirect misogynistic, or other unacceptable, behaviour and I personally find it easier to have a strategy to try to manage it and focus on outcomes rather than let it get to me, but that isn’t always easy’’. She explained, &quot;I think we have to be aware that every individual has a different style and any stereotyping of specific styles can be unproductive, as a response that seems one way could be situational or unintentional, or misinterpreted.&quot; </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">She highlighted the importance of focusing on your personal response to behaviour rather than necessarily overthinking the behaviour itself, emphasising the need to focus on what one can control. Fiona shared, &quot;A mentor gave me some very good advice: that you can only control yourself and how you respond in situations and you have to focus your energy on the things you </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">can </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">control, which can include how you respond to someone else’s behaviour.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Additionally, Fiona stated, &quot;I try to focus on assuming good intent and leading by example, treating others as I would like to be treated, with the goal of creating a work culture where we support each other and lift each other up where we are able.&quot; </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">At WiNUK, we believe that addressing misogynistic behaviours from people of all genders is important for fostering an inclusive and supportive work environment. Internalised misogyny is defined as sexist behaviour towards women </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">by </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">women, which can include mistrusting themselves and other women, and showing gender bias in favour of men. To prevent early career researchers (ECRs) from adopting similar behaviours, it is essential to promote awareness and education about the impacts of misogyny on women. We recommend mentorship and training offerings that emphasise empathy, respect, and collaboration to help ECRs develop healthier leadership styles. Additionally, organisations should implement policies that encourage feedback and open dialogue about workplace behaviours, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. By creating a culture of mutual support and understanding, we can help neuroscientists to realise that success does not require perpetuation of negative behaviours, and it instead can come from inclusive practices. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Do you think that a lot of the differences between women at student and group leader level could be due to historical bias against women, rather than current bias?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite the relatively equal percentage of female and male undergraduates in STEM, and more females successfully completing their degrees, just 25% of professors are female (Joyce et al., 2024). When asked whether the differences between women at the student and group leader levels could be attributed more to historical bias than current bias, Fiona reflected on the interplay of both factors. She stated, &quot;There is a lot of research confirming that there are specific barriers we experience as women. I do think bias is still playing a big role and most women in leadership I talk to have had to take a lot on their shoulders on their way up. Behaviours like assertiveness, taking balanced risks, or being ambitious/hungry can be viewed negatively in women, whereas a man would be viewed positively for the same trait.” Additionally, Fiona shared, &quot;The more responsibility and decision-making I’ve had in my roles, the more I have experienced stereotypes I thought were only in textbooks on historical biases, but I do think this is changing as we have more awareness and also more diverse teams generally sitting with us in the room.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">She also pointed out that biases extend beyond the workplace, adding, &quot;The biases can be at home as well as work, such as the judging comments we receive when we travel for business, that our male counterparts do not experience so much.&quot; </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women continue to experience systemic challenges which can include insufficient funding, lack of female role models and visibility, harassment and, often, a greater workload at home. Despite this, Fiona did highlight the positive shift that is taking place, with more women now entering higher positions, indicating progress toward reducing these biases.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">How do you answer people that are surprised by these statistics and say they do not see any problem for women in neuroscience?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When asked how she responds to individuals surprised by statistics indicating gender disparities in neuroscience, Fiona shared her initial reaction of speechlessness. She elaborated, &quot;What can you say other than point out that they may actually sit at the root of the problem? A lot of people say this as they are lucky to be completely naïve, or don’t want to address their own biases or admit there is any problem. Until someone has walked in your shoes, it is hard sometimes to see. I remember the first time someone did a very stereotypical behaviour in a meeting—I was floored as I thought those days were gone, but sadly, as I’ve become more senior in my roles, I have experienced it more. But we are going to change it!&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam suggested a direct approach to addressing scepticism about gender disparities, emphasising the importance of acknowledging and analysing data. Kam indicated that individuals who disregard data to fit their biases may undermine the scientific process: “I would suggest that if they took the same approach and ignored data within their scientific field to fit their biases, they really shouldn’t be doing science.” This highlights the need to acknowledge statistics, even if we do not like what they say. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Have you asked women about their reason for leaving science?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When asked if she had inquired about women&apos;s reasons for leaving science, Fiona shared, &quot;Yes – many leave as they want to do different things. Others leave due to a personal experience at work, or to go to new opportunities that fit their interests or home lives better. There isn’t a single reason normally.&quot; Fiona emphasised the diverse factors influencing individual decisions, noting that the absence of a singular reason underscores the variety of personal and professional motivations. A key reason appears to be personal experience at work, which can include instances of gender bias and sexism, but this is often part of a diverse range of factors.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Many of you are talking about alliance building. Have experiences of gender disparities fed into how you approach partnership and influencing?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Fiona provided insights into how gender disparities have shaped her approach to partnership and influencing strategies. She explained, &quot;Sometimes you need to prepare for a meeting by getting some of the stakeholders on your side in advance to avoid surprises. If you aren’t being heard, it can be good to work with another colleague who makes sure your voice is amplified in meetings, for example.&quot; </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite the challenges, Fiona highlighted her focus on future interactions and learning from past experiences, adding, &quot;Generally, I try not to focus on gender or other characteristics. If I have a bad interaction, I try to let it go and focus on the outcomes I need to achieve and the future. I also try to look back and evaluate whether I might have handled the situation differently if it happened again, so I can ensure I capture the learnings.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">All three of you have specifically mentioned a man who has championed you and your career. What can we do as men to be those champions?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When asked about how men can champion women in science, Fiona emphasised the importance of equitable treatment and support in overcoming imposter syndrome. She stated, &quot;Treat us equitably and help us overcome any doubts quickly. We all experience the occasional but debilitating bout of imposter syndrome, which is hard to avoid, and we need to be reminded we can do it in that moment. Most champions help us to see our best selves. I’m so lucky to have had many great and diverse mentors in my career, and from broad perspectives in science and other industries.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam highlighted that gender bias affects everyone, not just women, and urged men to actively mentor female early career researchers (ECRs). She explained, &quot;Gender bias is not a woman’s issue, it’s everyone’s issue because we’re all diminished if we lose good neuroscientists due to the challenges women continue to face. I would encourage men to be good mentors by ensuring they provide support for female ECRs. For example, suggest conferences they can go to and present at, advise them on how to get published, have early discussions about the next steps in their career, and share your network with them. They should show as much interest in their ECRs&apos; career development as they do in the data they are generating for the lab. Reflecting on her own experiences with male mentors, Kam underscored the necessity for all PIs to prioritise mentorship in supporting women in science. She shared, &quot;All my PIs have been men and have provided me with mentorship throughout my career. These are things PIs should be doing anyway, but through my work with ECRs, I’m consistently finding they’re not.&quot; Kam&apos;s insights emphasise the practical steps men can take to champion women and the ongoing need for dedicated mentorship in academia.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The insights shared by Fiona and Kam shed light on the importance of addressing gender disparities and fostering inclusivity in the scientific community. Their perspectives underscore the need for collective action to support women in science and create equitable opportunities for all researchers. By championing diversity, promoting mentorship, and advocating for systemic change, we can work towards a future where every individual, regardless of gender, has an equal opportunity to thrive and contribute to scientific progress.</span></span></p>

<p>In June of last year, Salvador Pineda received an email from a researcher at Zhejiang University in China informing him one of his articles had been plagiarized. </p>



<p>The researcher pointed Pineda to a paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014206152100418X?via%3Dihub">A robust optimization method for optimizing day-ahead operation of the electric vehicles aggregator</a>,” which appeared in Elsevier’s <em>International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems</em> in November 2021. The article, by researchers at the University of Lahore, Pakistan, contained several figures copied from Pineda’s 2020 paper “<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9122589">An efficient robust approach to the day-ahead operation of an aggregator of electric vehicles</a>,” as well as similar text.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uma.es/departamento-de-ingenieria-electrica/info/113635/salvador-pineda-morente/">Pineda</a>, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Málaga in Spain, immediately wrote to the journal’s editor-in-chief, who said he’d retract the article, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Yet the article remains intact, more than a year later, with the publisher blaming the delay on staffing changes at the journal.</p>



<span id="more-129880"></span>



<p>“We are feeling extremely frustrated and cannot understand why it is taking so long to retract such a clear case of plagiarism,” Pineda told us.</p>



<p>A week after Pineda’s email, Vladimir Terzija, editor-in-chief of the <em>International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,</em> told Pineda and several other researchers the journal would retract three papers for plagiarizing their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The corresponding author of the plagiarized papers accepted his mistake and expressed a strong apology, promising that something like that will never happen in future [sic],” Terzija wrote in emails we have seen. Terzija declined our request for comment.</p>



<p>Ubaid ur Rehman, the corresponding author mentioned by Terzija, last year lost <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dur%2bRehman%252c%2bUbaid">two papers </a>for plagiarism in a Springer journal. “As other plagiarized authors have informed me, papers in other journals [by ur Rehman] were retracted immediately” after the editors received concerns, Pineda said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other papers Terzija promised to retract as well as Pineda’s are &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061522001326">A robust vehicle to grid aggregation framework for electric vehicles charging cost minimization and for smart grid regulation</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061521005974">Optimal power management framework for smart homes using electric vehicles and energy storage</a>&#8221; All three articles remain intact in the journal.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In June, one year after Terzija promised the retractions, Pineda <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7208434135948763136/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7208434135948763136%2C7208515850205569024%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287208515850205569024%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7208434135948763136%29">posted on LinkedIn</a> asking fellow researchers for advice on the unresolved situation. Following that post, ur Rehman emailed Pineda to say he had also requested retraction of the paper and was unaware of the “many plagiarism rules.”</p>



<p>“As a young and immature member of the academic community I would like to ask you to please delete this post, I accept that I made mistake [sic] and I ensure you I have a deep regret on this thing, however your LinkedIn post is highlighting this matter on social media which is highly damaging for me,” ur Rehman told Pineda. Ur Rehman did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>“We are aware of these papers and the retraction process is indeed underway,” a spokesperson for Elsevier said, adding, “journal staffing developments presented some delays.”</p>



<p>We’ve previously covered many cases of journals taking a while to act, including a bioinformatics journal that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/02/one-year-later-bioinformatics-journal-with-unclear-leadership-yet-to-retract-plagiarized-article/">failed to retract an article</a> following a year of requests from the aggrieved author and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/03/two-years-ago-an-author-asked-a-journal-to-withdraw-a-paper-it-still-hasnt/">a 2020 request for retraction</a> over falsified data. Both of those papers still have not been retracted.</p>



<p>“It is deeply disappointing to see that some scientific journals disregard both the integrity of science and the efforts of those who contribute honestly to the field,” Pineda said.</p>
