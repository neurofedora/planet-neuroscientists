<p>Ranga Dias, the physics researcher whose work on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00716-2">room-temperature superconductors</a> has been retracted after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/room-temperature-superconductor-retract-journal-nature-e554536a">coauthors raised concerns</a> about the data, has lost another paper for the same reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This retraction brings Dias’ total to five, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dDias%252c%2bRanga%2bP">by our count</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Rochester in New York, where <a href="https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/people/faculty/dias-ranga/index.html">Dias</a> is an assistant professor, is investigating his work, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/another-retraction-looms-embattled-physicist-behind-blockbuster-superconductivity"><em>Science</em> has reported</a>. Washington State University, where Dias obtained his PhD, is also investigating <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/plagiarism-allegations-pursue-physicist-behind-stunning-superconductivity-claims">allegations of plagiarism</a> in his thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dias has not responded to our request for comment about his latest retraction, of a 2021 paper in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> titled “<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.117003">Synthesis of Yttrium Superhydride Superconductor with a Transition Temperature up to 262 K by Catalytic Hydrogenation at High Pressures</a>.” The article has been cited 178 times, according to information presented on its abstract page. </p>



<p>In December, the journal published an <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.239902">expression of concern</a> for the paper, stating it was investigating concerns “regarding the origins and integrity of the transport data” in several of the paper’s figures “with the cooperation of the authors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On June 13, the journal retracted the paper. The <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.249901">notice</a> states: </p>



<span id="more-129463"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, a majority of the co-authors of this study raised concerns about the origins of the superconductivity in this study as presented in Fig. 1C, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. S10B, Fig. S13, and sections of Table S1. These figures and the table were provided solely by Ranga P. Dias. After the origin of the data for these figures and the table was put into question, Physical Review Letters published an Expression of Concern.</p>



<p>After repeated attempts to locate the raw data and obtain an authoritative account of its origins, Physical Review Letters concurs that the article is not supported by its data and that it needs to be retracted. Ranga P. Dias stands by the data in the aforementioned figures and table, and does not agree to retract the paper. The remaining authors regret any confusion or inconvenience caused to the scientific community.</p>

<p>Daniel Ucko, head of ethics and research integrity for the American Physical Society, which publishes the journal, told us the society had “no information to add” to the published notices. </p>

Watching the same movie stimulates similar neural activity across brains: a phenomenon referred to as inter-subject correlation. Subjects sitting in the same room and talking over the content have been shown to increase various other measures of brain synchrony.</p><p>Now it turns out that we don’t even need to be discussing what’s on the screen to get more in tune with each other during the next show.</p><p>Lead author Dr. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/member/sd2035/">Sara De Felice</a>, Professor Antonia Hamilton, and other colleagues at University College London used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain activity in 27 pairs of adults as they each watched two different episodes of the short <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b00xgpj9/dipdap?page=1">BBC children’s cartoon <em>Dipdap</em></a>. In between the episodes, the subjects talked over trivial facts unrelated to the show, such as exotic animals and musical instruments. The researchers then compared the data on brain activity recorded during each episode to see if the non-relevant chatter had affected mental synchrony.</p><p>Their <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/oons/article/doi/10.1093/oons/kvae006/7634764?login=false">results</a>, published in <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/oons">Oxford Open Neuroscience</a></em>, showed increased brain synchrony over the right dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC) and right superior parietal lobe (SPL) in familiar pairs (housemates, friends, or partners) watching the cartoon together compared to pseudo pairs who had not met, and who watched the short film alone. These results are in&nbsp;line with previous studies into&nbsp;these brain regions which indicate that the DLPFC is associated with functions like working memory, abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility while the SPL receives significant visual input, and is also associated with reasoning and memory, as well as attention.</p><p>The study also found that co-watching <em>after&nbsp;</em>a conversation was associated with greater brain synchrony over the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ)–an area of the brain famous for allowing other perspectives (theory of mind)–compared to co-watching before a conversation. This effect was significantly higher in familiar pairs engaging in conversation with each other than in&nbsp;pseudo pairs who talked to someone else.</p><p>“Two things are surprising and novel here,” says Dr. De Felice (now at the University of Cambridge). &#8220;First, having a chat resulted in brains also synchronising&nbsp;afterwards. Second, the chat didn’t have to be related to the movie to see this effect.”</p><h2>Brain games</h2><p>The scientists selected&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/16/4/345/6126231">fNIRS</a> for this research as it uses light to map blood flow in response to neural activity at sites across the head, allowing the study of natural face-to-face interactions because subjects aren’t&nbsp;physically confined in a noisy fMRI machine.</p><p>“fNIRS is non-invasive and robust to movement, allowing the measurement of brain activity from people as they act and interact normally,” says Dr. De Felice. On the downside, its lag time of around five seconds makes it much less spatially and temporally accurate than other techniques.</p><p>The researchers found no significant differences in the other five brain regions selected for measurement.</p><p>&#8220;Brain synchrony was observed in three areas (the DLPFC, SPL, and TPJ) which play a key role in our ability to interact with others, understand intentions and emotions, and interpret other people’s perspectives,” explains Dr. De Felice. “It makes sense that we observe synchrony over these areas during co-watching of the BBC <em>Dipdap</em> cartoon, where the watcher is encouraged to follow and predict what the puppet will face next.”</p><p>She suggests the findings, along with those from&nbsp;numerous other studies, could indicate&nbsp;that brain synchrony extends to and from further behaviours: “This might explain why people who spend considerable time together often find themselves in greater agreement with each other than with those they’ve never met. Through such interactions, individuals can develop a shared reality, both physically and mentally.”</p><p>The next challenge is to better explore the causal relationship between synchrony and social interaction, examining if altering this synchrony using brain stimulation would alter the parameters of interaction, she says.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@sarandywestfall_photo">Sarandy Westfall</a> via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/couple-sitting-on-sofa-beside-dog-inside-room--itLKdE7ojA">Unsplash</a>. </sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/899818373/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/899818373/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f06%2fsarandy-westfall-itLKdE7ojA-unsplash-1260485-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/899818373/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/state-supported-covid-19-nudges-only-really-worked-on-the-young/">State supported Covid-19 nudges only really worked on the young</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/05/mental-disorder-or-something-magical/">Mental disorder or something magical?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/a-sand-county-almanac-at-75-the-evolution-of-the-land-ethic/">A Sand County Almanac at 75: the evolution of the land ethic</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>While presenting a paper in journal club, neurology resident at Baylor College of Medicine, <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/peter-campbell-83231">Peter Campbell</a>, noticed a potential problem. Two infants in a 2018 paper were reported to have died, but their data also appeared in a follow-up study published two years later with no mention of them being deceased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is unclear how a patient who reportedly died could be available for follow-up at 2 years,” he wrote in an email reporting his concerns to Frontiers, the publisher of the articles. The email, sent in April, went unanswered. </p>



<span id="more-129406"></span>



<p>“<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00086/full">Raised Plasma Neurofilament Light Protein Levels Are Associated with Abnormal MRI Outcomes in Newborns Undergoing Therapeutic Hypothermia</a>,” and its 2020 follow-up, “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.562510/full">Raised Plasma Neurofilament Light Protein Levels After Rewarming Are Associated With Adverse Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Newborns After Therapeutic Hypothermia</a>,” have four of the same authors, including lead author Divyen Shah, researcher at Queen Mary University of London. Both appeared in <em>Frontiers in Neurology.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The 2018 paper has been cited 22 times and the 2020 paper eight times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The data in question concerns patients 1 and 3 from <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/310895/fneur-09-00086-HTML/image_m/fneur-09-00086-t002.jpg">table 2</a> of the 2018 paper, who are labeled as having died. Yet their data matches those of participants 4 and 2 in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/562510/fneur-11-562510-HTML/image_m/fneur-11-562510-t003.jpg">table 3</a> of the 2020 paper as “babies with cerebral palsy,” without any indication of death.&nbsp; The data from the second study were purportedly collected after the children were 18 months old.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/irene.litvan">Irene Litvan</a>, editor-in-chief of the journal, told Retraction Watch she was “not made aware of this matter” but that the research integrity team at Frontiers is investigating the issue after receiving Campbell’s email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from the publisher confirmed “we are actively checking the discrepancy brought to our attention by Dr Campbell.”</p>



<p>Shah defended the data.&nbsp; The two children died “later after developing cerebral palsy” and were therefore represented in both studies, he told us in an email. “We have neurodevelopment outcomes for them although they later died,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Campbell was unsatisfied with that explanation: “Is it reasonable to say in a first paper that the children died and then in the next simply say they had poor developmental outcomes? That seems strange.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors should have included more information about the deaths of the patients, and “been more clear,” he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a second email to Retraction Watch, Shah clarified that patient 1 died “after 2 years of age with severe global cerebral palsy” and patient 3 died “at 19 months of age with again the most sever [sic] global impairment and cerebral palsy.” The patients were recruited “between January 2014 and January 2016,” he said, so when the 2018 paper was written, “we already had information about later outcomes for some of these children.”</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.mona.uwi.edu/npi/researchers/ina-vandebroek">Ina Vandebroek</a> read the latest edition of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780443186578/pharmacognosy"><em>Pharmacognosy</em></a>, an Elsevier textbook to which she contributed a chapter for the 2017 edition, she was shocked. Although she had declined to write for the 2023 update, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128021040000330">her chapter</a> was still in the book, under a different author’s name.</p>



<p>“When I first saw this, it was like somebody hit me on the head with a hammer and everything that I&#8217;d worked for all my life was put into question,” Vandebroek, an ethnobotanist and senior research fellow at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Kingston, Jamaica, told Retraction Watch. “This shakes my foundation of what I think science should stand for.”</p>



<p>The situation arose when one of the textbook’s editors, <a href="https://uwischolar.sta.uwi.edu/scholar/d11c7a3e-296a-3254-99e8-574b09737e90">Simone Ann Marie Badal</a>, a researcher at UWI, asked if Vandebroek wanted to revise her chapter for the new edition. Vandebroek declined, assuming her chapter would be omitted from the book.</p>



<span id="more-129446"></span>



<p>But the chapter, “Ethical aspects of working with local communities and their biological resources,” not only remained in the book, this time the author is listed as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443186578000128">S. Badal</a>. The new chapter is identical to the original, except for two added sentences from Badal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April, Vandebroek sent a cease and desist letter to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andregwolff/">André G. Wolff</a>, a publisher for Elsevier, alerting him of the issue and requesting the company stop “distributing and selling copies of the textbook that contain the plagiarized chapter and take appropriate steps to collect and destroy all physical and digital copies that have been distributed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In emails seen by Retraction Watch, Wolff acknowledged “this credit line does not reflect appropriately the chapter authorship. We have placed a correction request to rectify the issue.” He also said “miscredited chapter authorship” occurred in other chapters and he would communicate with the affected authors about the corrections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six other chapters mention Badal as a co-author, and three list her as the sole author, including Vandebroek&#8217;s contribution. In the original 2017 book, the chapter “Waxes” was written by W.F. Tinto, T.O. Elufioye, and J. Roach, and the chapter “Evolutionary Perspectives on Plant Secondary Metabolites” was written by R. Delgoda and J.E. Murray. Both chapters in the 2023 version credit only S. Badal. Of the 34 chapters, many new author names appear under chapters previously attributed to other researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Badal said Vandebroek’s signed agreement stipulated ownership of the material transfers to the publisher of the book:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When asked to revise her chapter for the second edition, the author refused and I therefore I undertook [sic] this task. After the book was published, the author contacted the Publisher regarding the crediting of authors. The Publisher&#8217;s representative from Elsevier clarified that the chapter formatting credited current authors at the top of the chapter and acknowledged prior authors in footnotes. Although not required to do so, the Publisher apologised to the author and promised to make the relevant and appropriate edits.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Several chapter authors declined to revise their chapter for the second edition of the book and these chapters were reviewed, and in some cases updated by the volume editor. An error in the production process resulted in the original author names being replaced by the volume editor. This was a production error and not the responsibility of the volume editor and these errors are in the process of being corrected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corrections will credit the original authors along with the revising author as appropriate, the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vandebroek objected to this correction, telling Wolff that Elsevier’s failure to attribute the work solely to her “misleads readers and constitutes a clear assault on [her] reputation.” Wolff’s last response, in May, said the publisher would revert authorship entirely back to her, effective in print and electronic books, in the next two months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, he said, the contributor agreement Vandebroek signed puts Elsevier “under no obligation” to ask authors to participate in any subsequent editions of the Work, and may use all or any of their contribution in further revisions and/or editions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vandebroek said she worries the stipulations of the contributor agreement leave future editions vulnerable to the same situation. Non-participating authors will be credited in subsequent editions to reflect their contribution, a spokesperson for Elsevier said.</p>



<p>“Should we scientists now hire legal representation from our own pocket every time we want to publish to make sure our rights will not be trampled on?” she said. “I just want this to stop. This is damaging, exhausting, demotivating, and corrupt.”</p>

<p>Women often experience acts of obstetric violence or mistreatment during labor and delivery. Conflicts and crises add new challenges to vulnerable health systems, disrupting emergency as well as maternal health services. These occurrences may further deteriorate maternal care, thereby contributing to increased mortality and morbidity. Person-centered maternity care (PCMC), defined as care that is respectful and responsive to women’s needs and preferences on clinical decisions is increasingly regarded as an essential component of healthcare during childbirth at the global level and a vital factor in reducing maternal mortality.</p>
<p>PCMC becomes vital in humanitarian settings, where conflict and displacement pose additional challenges to delivering respectful and responsive maternity care. However, evidence of its implementation and effectiveness in refugee camps remains scarce.</p>
<p>The authors of this study explored Sudanese refugee women&#8217;s experiences of PCMC in Chad&#8217;s refugee camps, offering valuable insights into the practices that support or hinder respectful maternity care in these challenging environments. With facility assessments and additional interviews with trained and assistant midwives as well as birth attendants, the researchers aimed to align the providers&#8217; and patients&#8217; perspectives on PCMC and determine the capacity of the maternities serving refugee camps to provide PCMC. Whilst many women reported positive experiences with maternity care providers, challenges such as insufficient staffing, language barriers, and physical constraints of the health facilities occasionally led to feelings of neglect or disrespect. Overall, these findings indicate that PCMC can be effectively provided in refugee settings but targeted action needs to be implemented to ensure all women receive high-quality care. This study contributes to our understanding of PCMC in refugee settings and demonstrates the need for systemic changes to address resource shortages, improve training for healthcare providers on PCMC and ensure respectful and supportive care.</p>

<p>Hypertension is a main preventable risk factor for all-cause mortality and one of the most important modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Self-measured blood pressure monitoring (SMBP or home blood pressure monitoring) has been shown to improve hypertension control.</p>
<p>In addition to facing well-known disparities in hypertension management as other minorities and medically underserved communities, resettled Iraqi and Syrian refugees have been listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a high-risk population for hypertension. This qualitative investigation aimed to enhance our understanding of SMBP monitoring among Arab American refugees and inform future interventions targeting hypertension control within these communities.</p>
<p>By interviewing a large sample of refugees, these researchers identified key barriers and facilitators to SMBP, such as the lack of access to home blood pressure monitors or the hesitancy in using public devices, as well as the pivotal, positive role of family support.</p>
<p>Interestingly, factors such as poor hypertension literacy, cultural stigma of illness, and anxiety about poor health significantly influenced SMBP practices within this community, thereby underscoring the need for tailored interventions that address both socioeconomic and cultural determinants. Based on these findings, improving patient education and supporting self-management of hypertension become imperative objectives of any hypertension intervention for this refugee community.</p>
<p>Lessons from this study are transferable to other minoritized communities and highlight the importance of understanding the culture of minoritized communities to improve healthcare delivery and clinical practice.</p>

<p>Reliable health monitoring and determination of disease estimates in refugee centers are hindered by missing data to capture the population at risk, an issue generally known in health services research as the &#8220;denominator problem&#8221;. The detrimental effects of the denominator problem are particularly evident in refugee settings epidemiology due to the high mobility and fluctuating dynamics of populations residing there, leading to potential bias in measures of illness and health care utilization.</p>
<p>This study proposes an empirical approach to estimate disease frequency in refugee camps with fragmented health and occupancy data. The researchers utilized individual-level patient data from primary care surveillance systems and matched these with aggregated occupancy data from German refugee centers. This innovative method enabled the analysis of relationships between occupancy, patient numbers, and disease incidence, which, in turn, could be used to predict the ratio between patients and total occupancy and disease incidence when only occupancy information was available.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this research offers a potential solution to the denominator problem in refugee health research and presents significant implications for health needs assessment, health service planning, and surveillance in refugee settings.</p>
<p>By enabling more accurate prediction models and estimates of disease frequency, this method can improve health systems&#8217; ability to quantify needs, plan services and detect infectious disease transmission among highly mobile populations.</p>

<p>Arabic-speaking refugees or immigrants resettled in Canada report poorer mental health compared to refugees or immigrants from other regions e.g. Latin America or US.</p>
<p>Particular emphasis needs to be given to the mental health of refugee or immigrant children and adolescents, as migration stressors mark a critical period in their development and are known to be related to depression, anxiety, and elevated symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Remarkably, however, evidence shows that newcomer children and youth consistently underuse mental health services compared to Canadian-born peers with comparable mental health status.</p>
<p>This qualitative analysis of the perspectives of providers identifies barriers and examines opportunities to improve mental health care for Arabic-speaking newcomer children and families.</p>
<p>Lack of resources, cultural misunderstandings, staff shortages, lack of mental health knowledge or cultural competency contribute to mental health services inadequacy. At the individual or family level, mental health literacy, prioritized settlement needs, stigma, and fear of repercussions for disclosing a mental health concern are found to be major impediments to help-seeking, ultimately, leading to underutilization of mental health services among newcomer families. While barriers at the level of systems, providers, individuals, and families create disparities in access and quality of mental health care for children and families of newcomers, service providers have advocated for a shift to culturally competent, integrated, collaborative, and community-based models of care to increase accessibility, reduce stigma and mistrust, and promote the well-being and resilience of new Canadians.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996?via%3Dihub">March 2020 paper</a> that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/19/french-hydroxychloroquine-study-has-major-methodological-shortcomings-and-is-fully-irresponsible-says-review-but-is-not-being-retracted/">helped spur the discredited claim</a> hydroxychloroquine could treat COVID-19 is under investigation – again – after some of its authors asked to take their names off the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead author, retired researcher Didier Raoult, has 12 retractions, according to <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dRaoult%252c%2bDidier">The Retraction Watch Database</a>. Those retractions involved <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/08/journals-retract-six-didier-raoult-papers-for-ethics-violations/">violations of ethics rules</a>. Journals are <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/embattled-researcher-didier-raoult-earns-dozens-more-expressions-of-concern-and-another-retraction/">investigating</a> many other articles by Raoult and his colleagues, including <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2023/05/29/covid-19-didier-raoult-s-questionable-methodology-once-again-under-fire_6028408_10.html">their work</a> on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID. </p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996?via%3Dihub">Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial</a>,” was published in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-antimicrobial-agents"><em>International Journal for Antimicrobial Agents</em></a><em>.</em> It has been cited more than 3,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129441"></span>



<p>Soon after publication, critics pointed out <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/06/hydroxychlorine-covid-19-study-did-not-meet-publishing-societys-expected-standard/">flaws in the article</a>. The journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920302260#bib0059">commissioned a review</a>, in which <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/frits-rosendaal">Frits Rosendaal</a>, of Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands, called the researchers “fully irresponsible” for presenting flawed information “coupled with the potentially serious side-effects of hydroxychloroquine.” In an <a href="https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement">official statement</a>, The International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC), which co-owns the journal with Elsevier, said in April 2020 that the article “does not meet the Society’s expected standard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, the journal did not retract the paper. In an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092485792030251X">editorial</a> published along with the critical reviews, ISAC leadership wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We believe, in addition to the importance of sharing observational data at the height of a pandemic, a robust public scientific debate about the paper&#8217;s findings in an open and transparent fashion should be made available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A group of scientists again called for its retraction in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Costagliola-et-al.pdf">June 3 email sent to Elsevier</a> and seen by Retraction Watch. Despite ISAC’s April 2020 statement of concern, “nothing happened during the last four years, which seems unusually long to us,” the scientists wrote. In addition, three of the authors told the group they had asked for their names to be removed from the paper at the end of 2023, the group wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Elsevier responded to the group’s email three days later, confirming three of the authors had asked to take their names off the paper “on the grounds of their having concerns about the article of a methodological nature.” The representative told us they “can’t divulge” which authors made the request, or when they did so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The representative also stated that the journal was re-opening the previously closed investigation after receiving the authors’ requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raoult has not responded to our emails seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fabrice Frank, one of the email’s authors and retired independent researcher, told us at least two of the authors had been added “without their consent and without knowing it.” The authors asked to remain anonymous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lonni Besançon, a researcher at Linköping University in Linköping, Sweden, called the fact the article remains available “unacceptable,” adding: “All of the concerns were raised years ago and the paper is clearly responsible” for a waste of scientific efforts, money, and time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besançon and Frank have <a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4">raised concerns</a> about other papers by authors affiliated with the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection (IHU-MI) in Marseille, France, where Raoult was the former director. Nearly all of the authors of the March 2020 paper have ties to IHU-MI.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/01/elsevier-investigating-articles-linked-to-controversial-french-researcher/">Elsevier is investigating</a> some of these claims, and has issued more than 100 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/embattled-researcher-didier-raoult-earns-dozens-more-expressions-of-concern-and-another-retraction/">expressions of concern</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is known that organic waste such as dairy by-products can be used to produce biogas. This is not only a useful way to obtain valuable renewable energy energy, but also an efficient disposal method for large volumes of waste material. Biogas production</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> is achieved by anaerobic digestion, a process involving anaerobic bacteria to break down the organic matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This research explores the kinetic parameters required to effectively use anaerobic reactors for this process, with the objective of preventing the unwanted mixing of spoiled milk and effluent, which is potentially recyclable by other means. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The study determined optimal pH range for methane-producing bacteria (5-8), chemical oxygen demand, total solids, inoculum and retention time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall the optimized parameters and the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor used produced 70.4 liters of biogas per liter of spoiled milk. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The study concluded that optimization of the kinetic parameters and the use of an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor are important elements to consider in biogas production. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Portezuelo Formation in northern Patagonia is a region rich in fossil remains. This study reports the identification of 32 shed teeth discovered in the Portezuelo Formation and attributed to theropods, large bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The teeth, from the middle Turonian to late Coniacian, show different levels of preservation. They were identified as belonging to Megaraptoridae, Abelisauridae, Abelisauroidea and Alvarezsauridae. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The presence of a second, previously undocumented morphotype of megaraptorid and alvarezsaurid as well as the unusual denticle density of Morphotype 6, which suggests the existence of medium-sized abelisauroids, point towards a greater theropod diversity than previously reported and highlights the importance of future expeditions to Sierra del Portezuelo to fully explore this diverse ecosystem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Climate change is a very prominent topic, often discussed in relation to disappearing natural habitats and the risk of extinction of animal species, but what is its effect on the human body? It is increasingly being suggested that heat exposure can be linked to a multitude of health effects in vulnerable groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this study, the authors carried out a systematic review of the long-term effects heat exposure can have on the foetus. They found that heat exposure is associated with a detrimental effect on neurodevelopment and consequentially on associated socioeconomic and behavioural aspects. They also found this to be more prevalent in marginalised groups. While studies did not use widely accepted exposure indices when accounting for heat exposure, making data assessment challenging, this research highlights the need for further investigation into the effect of heat on the human body development. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Statistical measures related to infectious diseases were brought to the public’s attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reproduction number, or R number, was communicated via the media regularly as an indication of the spread of the disease (the average number of people that are infected by a single person).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The authors of this study investigated the public’s understanding of the R number and what factors, such as visual aids, might affect it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">They found that the majority of the population (55.7%) understands its meaning. The use of a visual aid did not improve this, while an evaluative label did. The propensity to adhere to preventive measures was found to be higher after seeing the R number, irrespective of the use of evaluative label or visual aid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Brain signals can be analyzed and translated into commands to external devices using systems called brain-computer interfaces. These technologies have been employed for tasks such as wheelchair control, prosthetics control and speller systems as well as rehabilitation therapies, and as such are increasingly promising solutions as assistive technologies for people with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This review explores how generative AI has been adopted to overcome limitations in the use of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces. Specifically, it enhanced the performance of BCI with respect to four different challenges: limited data availability, low signal resolution, inter-subject variability and development of end-to-end BCI applications. The review also discusses current limitations preventing a more widespread incorporation of generative AI in BCI. </span></p>

<p><em>Nature</em> has retracted a 2002 paper from the lab of Catherine Verfaillie purporting to show a type of adult stem cell could, under certain circumstances, “contribute to most, if not all, somatic cell types.” </p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature00870">Pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult marrow</a>,” has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1024602878849692040">controversial since its publication</a>. Still, it has been cited nearly 4,500 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – making it by far <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/top-10-most-highly-cited-retracted-papers/">the most-cited retracted paper ever</a>.</p>



<p>In 2007, <em>New Scientist</em> reported on questions about <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325915-200-flawed-stem-cell-data-withdrawn/">data in the <em>Nature</em> paper</a> and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325964-600-fresh-questions-on-stem-cell-findings/">another</a> of Verfaille’s <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/98/9/2615/53471/Purification-and-ex-vivo-expansion-of-postnatal">articles in <em>Blood</em></a>. <em>Nature </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05812">published a correction</a> that year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The errors the authors corrected “do not alter the conclusions of the Article,” they wrote in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129437"></span>



<p>The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in Minneapolis, where Verfaillie worked when the <em>Nature</em> paper was published, in 2008 found the <em>Blood</em> paper <a href="https://archive.ph/20120712090732/http://jobs.chronicle.com/article/U-of-Minnesota-Panel-Says/41756/">contained falsified images</a>, but Verfaillie was not responsible for the manipulations. <em>Blood</em> <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/113/10/2370/24360/Reyes-M-Lund-T-Lenvik-T-Aguiar-D-Koodie-L">retracted the article</a> in 2009 at the request of the authors. </p>



<p>Verfaillie moved to KU Leuven, where she is now an <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00048658">emeritus professor</a>. She has not responded to our request for comment. </p>



<p>KU Leuven conducted an investigation of Verfaillie’s work in 2019-2020, after Elisabeth Bik posted questions about the data in her papers, including <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DF95522E3585E37663CAD1972E70BD#">the one from 2002 in <em>Nature</em></a>, on PubPeer. The <a href="https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/content/2020/ku-leuven-completes-research-on-possible-breach-of-research-integrity">university found</a> “no breach of research integrity in the publications investigated.” </p>



<p>Bik tweeted about the retraction:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last December, Elsevier’s Scopus index <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/28/elseviers-scopus-deletes-journal-links-following-revelations-of-hijacked-indexed-journals/">deleted all links to journal homepages</a> in response to the widespread issue of journal hijacking, when a legitimate title, website, ISSN, and other metadata of a journal are taken over without permission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scopus has been a major target. I’ve cataloged <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24855">67 cases</a> since 2013 of hijacked journals penetrating the database.&nbsp; I found 23 profiles of journals that contained links to a cloned version, and 33 cases of content from the cloned version of a journal that had not been peer reviewed appearing in the profile of the legitimate journal, while 11 did both.</p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages">deletion of all homepage links</a> in the profiles of journals in Scopus, how journal hijackers would adapt their shady business practices has been unclear. We assumed they would continue hijacking new journals,&nbsp; would they continue to target Scopus, given they could index only unauthorized content?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, we have evidence hijacked journals remain in the database and continue to infiltrate it.</p>



<span id="more-129426"></span>



<p>Before Scopus deleted the links to journal homepages, the webpage in the profile of<em> Pakistan Heart Journal </em>directed to a cloned version of the journal. Later, unauthorized content from a cloned <em>Pakistan Heart Journal </em>&nbsp;appeared in Scopus, such as a paper titled “A new strategy for the genetic therapy of oral cancer: an update.” This title doesn’t correspond to the journal’s specialization in heart diseases, a mismatch typical for hijacked journals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXda9vQaIRn27zP2wBbHejcqKAerHlEEeQW4NIq2UGIsHzXN9cjFUvxK2RtDKcsu8PokL4SGgjc7akQCOs2H_pYXCn7RgTd7tm96QQb5b7GK81uDFhUXALiPDHYC9V5l-fHlXyaRZBQwuGNAWiKF7fh3e_E?key=4qYMo3mlZby2jMM1JAAwSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The cloned version of the <em>Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University</em> indexed some new content in the original journal’s Scopus profile, even after the index had previously deleted dozens of unauthorized papers. Screenshots of the publication list show papers from the original (above) and cloned journals (below) are indexed simultaneously. Two different papers are listed on the same pages of the same issue, which is impossible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd-ASaiWMXCbr3xVdEKG__7AxNOraYpeC3CGKuMAVZw5SZ4r_1GHDhnVzAKqiKkQzZU6SspClMcy9MfCMFzvhHNHdpIzngh80AQOxyE003vYInLOfykZsYcphlI5bNlBStczueh0qWczwyZzxyMwdyMD_BX?key=4qYMo3mlZby2jMM1JAAwSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Another suspicious case concerns <em>Obstetrics &amp; gynaecology forum</em> (ISSN 1029-1962) published in South Africa. <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ogf">Several</a><a href="https://www.obstetricsandgynaecologyforum.com/index.php/ogf"> webpages</a> related to the journal exist. While this<a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ogf"> link </a>is legitimate, I couldn’t confirm the authenticity of another <a href="https://www.obstetricsandgynaecologyforum.com/index.php/ogf">&nbsp;webpage</a> <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/obstetricsandgynaecologyforum.com">registered</a> in 2023 with the anonymous registrar GoDaddy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In house Publications,” which once published the journal, no longer does so, and the company did not respond to my queries about whether the journal had been transferred to another publisher.&nbsp; Neither the editor-in-chief nor the senior editors replied to my requests for information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problematic version of the journal has published three special issues including papers on medical topics unrelated to obstetrics and gynecology, including prostate cancer, ischemic stroke, minerals in different fruits, liver cirrhosis, and kidney diseases.</p>



<p>Eleven papers from the first special issue (nine co-authored by the same researcher) have been indexed in Scopus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXffzYes4iwphhcerQrBSPKkYoVjZsLIPtB6ziM00efD4N9d6hfS8Z1w3ZmkeqrbHO7wWVU7fBuVc6ZGxVXLwVEuSIwXCB2TE5RBHd9_S7Tjxsxur7QlMQTfcL0heczgKOA7S8N8uh88CmQRdhBitiZFO9sR?key=4qYMo3mlZby2jMM1JAAwSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>These cases show that hijacked journals and problematic journals still target Scopus to index unauthorized content. We have no reason to expect them to stop.</p>

<p>Two years after a journal told sleuths it wouldn’t retract flawed papers, it changed course and pulled them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/m-bolland">Mark Bolland</a>, a researcher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who is <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/20/the-notices-are-utterly-unhelpful-a-look-at-how-journals-have-handled-allegations-about-hundreds-of-papers/">no stranger</a> to unearthing academic wrongdoing, first sent complaints about one of the papers to <em>The International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics</em> (IJGO)&nbsp; in March 2021. He said the data on bone mineral density in “<a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.ijgo.2008.07.011">Isosorbide mononitrate versus alendronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis</a>,” which has been cited 26 times according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, were “impossible.”<br><br>Bolland said the data the researchers reported were not consistent with the reference values provided by the maker of the device used to measure bone density in the study. The normal ranges are 0.96 +/- 0.12 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas the experiment reported much lower values of 0.21-0.24 g/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Bolland’s colleague <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-grey">Andrew Grey</a> called the data “laughable, frankly.”</p>



<span id="more-129401"></span>



<p>A portion of the email Bolland sent to the journal reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The findings of this study which reported large effects of nitrates and alendronate are totally inconsistent with clinical trials from other groups, the lead author previously extensively plagiarized a report of another nitrate trial, and a systematic evaluation using the REAPPRAISED checklist raises a number of concerns about the integrity of the publication including concerns regarding trial ethics, participant recruitment and that the bone density baseline and outcome data are implausible or incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson from the journal assured Bolland three times in September 2021 they had reviewed the data and found them to be correct – only for <em>IJGO </em>to <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.15297">retract</a> the article two years later in December of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead author of the study, <a href="https://www.asu.edu.eg/staffPortal/en/staffProfile/9050">Ashraf Nabhan</a> of Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt, was editor for Contemporary Issues in Women’s Health and systematic reviews <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14824">until April of 2023</a>. His name <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/18793479/editorial-board/editorial-board">no longer appears</a> on the editorial board. He currently sits on the senior editorial board for <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, where 10 editorial board members<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/06/editorial-board-members-resign-from-obstetrics-journal-to-protest-handling-of-allegations/"> resigned earlier this year</a> because they felt the journal mishandled allegations of data fabrication. He didn’t respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But this wasn’t an isolated instance for IJGO. In&nbsp; March 2020, Grey notified the journal of issues with a second, unrelated article led by Indian researcher <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subrata-Seal">Subrata Seal</a>. The paper, “<a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.09.019">Randomized controlled trial of elevation of the fetal head with a fetal pillow during cesarean delivery at full cervical dilation</a>,” which has been cited 24 times, is part of a trio of papers by Seal published in different journals. Grey’s concerns included implausibly high reductions in relative risks for maternal outcomes, data discrepancies between study groups, and calculation errors.</p>



<p>The paper was used in a <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN150053.pdf">licensing document</a> for a medical device called a fetal pillow in 2017, which is still <a href="https://www.coopersurgical.com/brand/fetal-pillow/">available for purchase</a>. In his email to the journal, Grey raised concern about the device being used clinically, even after the retraction: “According to the manufacturer’s website, the fetal pillow is now used in more than 20 countries and in &gt;85 hospitals in the United Kingdom, and more than 26,000 devices have been used worldwide,” he wrote.</p>



<p><em>IJGO </em>&nbsp;responded in October 2020 that all concerns had been investigated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors provided responses to each of the concerns raised, and although they did concede that there were some errors in terms of timeline reporting, they gave satisfactory explanations regarding the different authors on the publications you mention, as well as the apparent discrepancy in study sites.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When Grey took the issue directly to the publisher, Wiley responded that it wanted to share his identity with the authors: “We feel this would be helpful in eliciting a&nbsp; more detailed response,” a representative said in December 2020. Grey did not respond, and didn’t hear anything for three years — until the paper was <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14924">retracted</a> in June 2023 for inconsistency in trial results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same spokesperson from the journal, Amy Goggins, told Retraction Watch that IJGO revisited the cases after appointing a <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijgo.14292">research integrity editor</a> in 2022. “We have re-opened investigation of some older cases where there was uncertainty over the outcome, in an effort to achieve consensus on these,” Goggins said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bolland said he was both surprised and not surprised that the original outcome was uncertain, “but they certainly never indicated any uncertainty in their correspondence with me- quite the opposite: they didn’t address the concerns we raised and simply dismissed them, without making any effort to engage with us about the concerns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Grey noted that the journal’s initial assessments were “extremely poor” for the articles. “Again, not unusual. The problems with the data and the publications were really obvious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">IJGO published an <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14664">expression of concern</a> in January of 2023 regarding the fetal pillow paper. They also contacted the FDA to re-evaluate its licensing. Goggins told Retraction Watch that IJGO had been contacted by the manufacturer of the pillow device, <a href="https://www.coopersurgical.com/">Cooper Surgical</a>, but didn’t share what the manufacturer said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from the FDA told Retraction Watch: “As a general matter, the FDA does not comment on potential or ongoing investigations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only were the cases similar — so were the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A portion of Nabhan’s retraction reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns were raised by a number of third parties regarding the authenticity of the data and results presented in this study. In light of these concerns, the authors were asked to provide the raw data for the study. The authors cooperated fully and provided the raw data. Following review of the raw data by the journal&#8217;s research integrity team, it was found that there were highly similar sequences of values of in the data for the two study groups, suggesting duplication of data. Since the data of are incompatible with randomisation, this invalidates the study results and gives rise to considerable uncertainty around the observed effect of the intervention. As a result, the journal is issuing this retraction.</p>

<p>Following the publication of an Expression of Concern on this article,<sup>1</sup> further concerns were emphasized by a number of third parties regarding discrepancies between the retrospective trial registration and the published article. Following further review by the journal&#8217;s research integrity team, it was found that there were a considerable number of inconsistencies in the results presented. Unfortunately, there is no patient data available to explain or clarify these inconsistencies. This gives rise to considerable uncertainty around the benefit of the treatment intervention. As a result, the journal is issuing this retraction.</p>

<p>One other paper in Seal’s trio, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443615.2024.2348431">Does elevating the fetal head prior to delivery using a fetal pillow reduce maternal and fetal complications in a full dilatation caesarean section? A prospective study with historical controls</a>,” was published in the <em>Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology</em> in 2014 and retracted in 2024. The third, “<a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0030-1248936">Outcome in Second- versus First-Stage Cesarean Delivery in a Teaching Institution in Eastern India</a>” published in the <em>American Journal of Perinatology,</em> has not been retracted. Seal did not respond to our request for comment. </p>



<p>As for Nabhan, he has already lost one paper on the same topic. “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/21/5/1320/987286">A randomized clinical trial of the effects of isosorbide mononitrate on bone formation and resorption in post-menopausal women: a pilot study</a>.” The paper was published in 2006 and, the same year, the journal made the “unusual decision” to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/21/10/2466/2915142">retract</a> due to “extensive plagiarism.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/jim.thornton">Jim Thornton</a>, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Nottingham in the UK, left comments <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9545234F42CD6AFB7BC5E84B75972B">on PubPeer</a> about <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.ijgo.2016.01.025">another paper</a> listing Nabhan as a contributing author, Thornton and his colleagues <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176DXOrdTFiqp1hY0Mpqdic4gBnecqa4x/view">released a manuscript</a> in October 2021 discussing the ethics of clinical trials led by Mohamed Sweed, a colleague of Nabhan.</p>

<p>The journal <em>BMJ Public Health</em> is placing an expression of concern on a paper it said “gave rise to widespread misreporting and misunderstanding,” namely, “claims that it implies a direct causal link between COVID-19 vaccination and mortality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://bmjpublichealth.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000282">Excess mortality across countries in the Western World since the COVID-19 pandemic: ‘Our World in Data’ estimates of January 2020 to December 2022</a>,” appeared online June 3, and quickly attracted <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/164170334?src=bookmarklet">attention</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BD524B3E696274C2F24DFFC8CCA546">criticism</a>. The expression of concern is not yet live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their conclusions, the authors wrote: </p>



<span id="more-129413"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Excess mortality has remained high in the Western World for three consecutive years, despite the implementation of COVID-19 containment measures and COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next step, they wrote, was to distinguish “between the various potential contributors to excess mortality, including COVID-19 infection, indirect effects of containment measures and COVID-19 vaccination programmes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lots of outlets covered the study. <em>The Telegraph</em> ran its story with the headline, “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/04/covid-vaccines-may-have-helped-fuel-rise-in-excess-deaths/">Covid vaccines may have helped fuel rise in excess deaths</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>New York Post</em>’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/06/us-news/excess-deaths-since-pandemic-need-to-be-thoroughly-investigated-study/">story</a> took a similar angle, writing that the researchers found “excess mortality has ‘remained high’ since 2020 — despite the widespread rollout of COVID vaccines and various containment measures,” and quoting the paper’s statements about reported “serious injuries and deaths following vaccination.” The <em>Post</em> later corrected its story and added the following note:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An earlier version of this article did not reflect that the study did not analyze the impact of vaccination nor establish a link between mortality and vaccination status.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to the coverage, BMJ released the following <a href="http://press.psprings.co.uk/ph/june/bmjphstatement.pdf">statement</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Various news outlets have claimed that this research implies a direct causal link between COVID-19 vaccination and mortality. This study does not establish any such link. The researchers looked only at trends in excess mortality over time, not its causes. While the researchers recognise that side effects are reported after vaccination, the research does not support the claim that vaccines are a major contributory factor to excess deaths since the start of the pandemic. Vaccines have, in fact, been instrumental in reducing the severe illness and death associated with COVID-19 infection.</p>



<p>The message of the research is that understanding overall excess mortality since the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for future health policy, but that identifying specific causes is complex due to varying national data quality and reporting methods.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a similar episode, the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/06/02/nejm-issues-unusual-warning-readers-1980-letter-opioid-addiction/">added an editor’s note</a> in 2017 to a 1980 letter published in the journal that, the note said, had been “‘heavily and uncritically cited’ as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.”</p>



<p>Despite BMJ’s statement, scientists <a href="https://x.com/ActuaryByDay/status/1799439284833030192">critiqued the study’s methodology</a> on X (formerly Twitter). Ariel Karlinsky, an economist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, whose work the study cited, wrote:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karlinsky told Retraction Watch he and a few colleagues have submitted a commentary and request for retraction to <em>BMJ Public Health</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three of the authors (Saskia Mostert, Minke Huibers, and Gertjan Kaspers) are affiliated with the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology in Utrecht, The Netherlands; the fourth, Marcel Hoogland, is identified as an “independent researcher” in Amsterdam. Mostert, the corresponding author, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On June 11, the Princess Máxima Center issued a <a href="https://www.prinsesmaximacentrum.nl/en/news-events/news/the-princess-maxima-center-distances-itself-from-publication-excess-mortality-during-covid-19-pandemic">statement</a> saying it “distances itself from the publication” and will “investigate the scientific quality of this study.” The statement added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Originally, the idea was to look at the effect of COVID measures on, among other things, the mortality rate of children with cancer in low-income countries. During the course of the study, the focus shifted and diverted in a direction that we felt was too far from our expertise: pediatric oncology. We are not experts in epidemiology, nor do we want to give that impression. The Máxima Center therefore emphatically distances itself from this publication. We should have been more alert to the formation and results of this publication and will further investigate the way it was created. If it turns out that carelessness was involved in the realization of this publication, it will of course be withdrawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On June 13, BMJ sent a press release to reporters saying it is “investigating the quality of the research and the messaging” of the paper, and would place an expression of concern on the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BMJ’s press release concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As part of the investigation the authors will be asked to review and respond to the concerns raised to BMJ about the quality and messaging of the paper. BMJ will then decide what further action is needed.</p>

<p>In February, <a href="https://www.uniklinikum-saarland.de/de/einrichtungen/fachrichtungen/forensische_psychologie_und_psychiatrie/wir_ueber_uns/unser_team/wissenschaftliche_mitarbeiterinnen/dr_phil_steffen_barra">Steffen Barra</a> Googled his name. A clinician working in the field of forensic psychiatry, he was in the habit of periodically checking if anything negative had been written about him. What he didn’t expect to find was a plagiarized paper with his name attached to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Barra, a researcher at the University of Saarland in Germany, told us the 2023 article, “<a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/introducing-the-complexities-of-forensic-psychology-decoding-the-mind-behind-the-crime.pdf">Introducing the Complexities of Forensic Psychology: Decoding the Mind Behind the Crime</a>,” &nbsp; plagiarized from an <a href="https://www.centreofexcellence.com/what-is-forensic-psychology/">information page</a> from a company offering online courses. The article also resembles many college informational pages about the field, such as <a href="https://und.edu/blog/what-is-forensic-psychology.html">this one</a> from the University of North Dakota, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Concerned he might be blamed for the misconduct, Barra immediately contacted the publisher, Hilaris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A company representative responded to Barra the same day, February 29, with one phrase: “We will remove the link.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129395"></span>



<p>Once Barra pressed for an explanation, a representative from the journal named Jennifer responded: “We will take necessary action against the person who is responsible for the uploading of wrong file with your details.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Hilaris’ <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/author/steffen-barra-36371">author page</a> for Barra is still live, as is the link to the PDF of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We attempted to contact the email listed in the paper, but it forwarded automatically to Barra’s email address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Barra also reached out to Hjördis Czesnick, head of <a href="https://ombudsman-fuer-die-wissenschaft.de/?lang=en">Office of the German Research Ombudsman</a>, for help investigating the case. Czesnick found Hilaris’ registered address on their website: a PO box in Brussels. On behalf of Barra, Czesnick contacted the Secretary of the Flemish Commission for Research Integrity, as well as Belgian police.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Czesnick told us the journal in which the article appeared, <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/abnormal-behavioural-psychology.html"><em>Abnormal and Behavioural Psychology</em></a>, is “known for dubious practices” and is “probably fake.” The title appears on Cabell’s List of predatory publishers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/abnormal-behavioural-psychology.html">website </a>for <em>Abnormal and Behavioural Psychology</em> says the open-access journal charges $99 for a“Fast Editorial Execution and Review Process,” which promises a decision in three days, review comments in five days after submission, and a galley proof two days after acceptance. Any manuscript accepted for publication incurs an article processing charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hilaris did not respond to our request for comment. Their page on plagiarism states: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Ethical standards of very high-quality ensures [sic] the authenticity of the scientific publication and wins [sic] the public trust on scientific findings so that it [sic] enhances the credibility of the research work or idea.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Barra said he feels “perplexed” by the situation: “[N]o one could think of any good reason for a ‘Publisher’ to do something like that,” he told us in an email.</p>



<p>Past instances of false authorship could provide a hint. In April 2023, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">covered a similar case</a> in which a researcher was listed as an author on a plagiarized paper that had nothing to do with her field of study. Commenters on the post said including a reputable researcher in the publication may have been an attempt to improve the journal’s image.</p>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We are back with our series Bridging the Gap! For each post, we are interviewing women in neuroscience to discuss the gaps, and the health inequalities, relating to different areas of neuroscience, as well as the exciting new research that is attempting to bridge these gaps. For our second article, we talked with Dr Katelynn Boerner, investigator at the British Columbia Children&apos;s Hospital Research Institute (BCCHR) and assistant professor in the department of Paediatrics at the University of British Columbia (UBC). In our interview, Dr Boerner shared with us her experience in working with gender diverse and neurodiverse young people with chronic pain and her opinions on the importance of creating more inclusive research practices. </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Chronic pain can seriously impact the everyday life of people affected by it. In children and young people, living in pain can significantly affect their social and emotional development. Whilst any young person can experience acute or chronic pain, certain populations, including neurodiverse and gender diverse young people, are observed to report, or experience higher rates of, chronic pain. However, these populations are also often under-represented in paediatric pain research, resulting in an inability to comprehensively understand their pain experience and a scarcity of truly effective and targeted treatments. It is being increasingly acknowledged, in this field, that there is an urgent requirement to improve our understanding of the complex pain experiences endured by these young people, with different identities, in order to provide better care. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With both her clinical work and research on chronic pain in autistic and gender diverse youth, Dr Katelynn Boerner advocates for the adoption of an intersectional approach in the field of paediatric pain. This involves taking into account the broader social context that contributes to putting these people at a higher risk of developing pain conditions; in doing so, she also works to make research more inclusive by creating, in an active collaboration with patients and their families, alternative methodologies. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Could you tell me a little bit about your background in science?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I did my PhD in clinical psychology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. I was really interested in learning how physical health and psychology intersect and that’s how I ended up in the field of paediatric pain, focusing on studying the experiences of young people who live with chronic and acute pain. After my PhD, I did a clinical internship at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, and then moved to Vancouver to do two postdoc fellowships at BC Children’s Hospital and UBC. Through my experience as a clinician scientist, doing both research and providing clinical care, I started seeing these really big gaps between the kids and families that are represented in research and the kids and families that I was actually seeing in the clinic. It&apos;s really hard when I see a family in the clinic, and when I look at the research, to see how to best support them; I just don’t see anything that describes families that are in that particular situation. In this way, it’s hard to know how to provide evidence-based care. That’s why I became interested in health equality and why I started shifting my work towards trying to make research more accessible for the people that I was actually seeing in the clinic, to enable us to make better clinical decisions. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Once you started noticing these gaps, what inspired you to pursue research on chronic pain in gender-diverse and neurodiverse young people?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I was always interested in pain. Partially because pain is really everywhere; it is a feature of pretty much any disease or illness in childhood. Even ‘generally healthy’ children experience pain on a regular basis, so it’s really a topic that is relevant to everyone. During my PhD, I was investigating sex differences in pain. We know that, following puberty, we start seeing a disparity, with women and female-identifying people having higher rates of chronic pain, or being more impacted by chronic pain, and responding differently to treatments, compared to men and male-identifying people. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As a paediatric psychologist, I was interested in understanding what happens throughout the developmental trajectory, but the more I was looking at sex differences, the more I became “dissatisfied”. I was feeling that making binary comparisons was not telling the whole story. So, I started extending my perspective and became interested in looking at gender to understand some of the differences in pain experiences that we were observing, even between people with the same sex assigned at birth. Then it just sort of snowballed a bit from there. I realised that it was hard to look at just gender, without looking at other factors and other identities, so I became interested in understanding pain also in neurodiverse and autistic people. A lot of the young people that we support with pain, who are gender diverse, also identify as neurodiverse. I think the more I understood these young people’s experiences and lives, the more I realised I couldn’t just make a comparison between groups and feel like I actually knew the whole story: the more I learnt, the more I realised there are more and more layers of understanding pain, and knowing all those layers was essential to providing the best care.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>So what projects are you working on at the moment?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I would say the overall theme of my projects is trying to understand how to support young people that often end up in the limitations sections of papers, or that are often excluded from the research, either explicitly or implicitly, because the methods are not accessible to them. I have a couple of streams of research looking at the experience of trans and gender diverse youth that live with chronic pain and some work looking at pain in autistic young people, studying both everyday pain experience and chronic pain experiences. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Then I have a project called “The Living Lab at Home &apos;&apos; that I co-lead with my postdoc mentor, Dr. Tim Oberlander. During the pandemic, we realised that we needed to find a different way to do research, as we couldn’t bring people into the lab. As we were looking at this, we started to think, “maybe, even once we </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">can </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">bring people into the lab, we </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">shouldn’t</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. Maybe there are better ways of collecting data that actually reaches families where they are at”. The more we started talking about this idea to other researchers, clinicians and families, the more we realised that there are lots of families for whom coming in person to participate in a study is not accessible, because of where they live, the challenges they are dealing with, or the anxiety and trauma associated with coming to a clinical space. With the Living Lab at Home project, we have been exploring different ways to bring child health research into the community and make research methods accessible. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Some of the tools used to collect data in the community have been used for a long time, but have not been necessarily co-designed or developed with families, nor adapted to be used in populations that have different accessibility needs. So, the focus of the project is to come up with a core set of methods that have been developed with the families’ input, tried out with them, iterated and improved upon, and then to share these methods with other scientists, to use them with different research questions. I am trying to include more and more of these methods in my projects on gender diversity and neurodiversity in pain. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Are these projects done locally or would you like to do this research internationally?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Right now, most of our projects are conducted in the province where I am based, British Columbia, and only one is being done across Canada. We would love to bring our research further afield, but there are a lot of logistics we had to deal with, even with rolling out our research project across the country. It has been very interesting to think about, for example, how to bring research equipment to people, how to get it back, how to collect data from families who may live in areas where they don’t have great cell phone coverage or internet access. So it has definitely been challenging to try out our core set of research methods with teams that have different populations of interest and see what adaptations need to be made for different contexts, people, life circumstances and, most importantly, different systemic and structural inequalities that might represent a barrier in traditional research methodologies. It’s taking a lot of creativity and flexibility to think about how to do all that, and about alternative ways of conducting research, to make it more accessible. I have to say, a lot of the ideas about how to make this actually work have come from the families and the young people with lived experiences that we partnered with. They came up with a lot of the solutions, so I am fully convinced that we should never do any similar research project, or really any research at all, without hearing from the people who are actually going to be doing it and hopefully benefit from it.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Different circumstances in different places, for example here in the UK compared to there in Canada, can play a role in these projects, but would you say that there are common issues in research? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it’s one of those things that once you start to look for it, you see inequities everywhere in the way we do research. I have been thinking a lot lately about one of the tools we use in the ”Living Lab at Home”, the ecological momentary assessment, where we ask folks to fill out a couple of brief questionnaires a couple of times a day for a few weeks to get sort of micro-longitudinal data. It made us think a lot about the issue of “compliance”, a word that I don’t like to use because it implies a judgement. In a lot of studies, if a participant has “low compliance”, for instance if they don’t fill out enough questionnaire time points, then their data get excluded from the analysis. It certainly takes a lot of effort and resources to try to do things differently, but I feel like we are missing so much important information from folks that may have very legitimate reasons for why they can’t perfectly follow the research protocol. I think it is a problem if we end up excluding that data because it doesn’t conform to what we expect as researchers, or what we need statistically. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I definitely see similar issues in research on trans and gender diverse people with pain. We say these young people are not well represented in research, but then if you actually look, sometimes we do have data from them. It’s just that they get excluded because we don’t have a big enough sample size to put them in a category and allow us to do the statistics that we want. So I always feel this tension because I do very much believe in strong and rigorous research evidence, as well as the need to make clinical decisions on well conducted research. However, I think we need to realise that the traditional way of doing things is just not going to work for all situations for all people. I am getting so much more excited about the idea of pairing some of those traditional methods with alternative ways of doing things, to try and bring different sources of knowledge together and address some of these equity gaps that we see in research and then trickle down to clinical practice. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>I can see how it can be difficult, from an analysis point of view, to handle data from people that, for one way or another, can&apos;t follow the protocol. In your projects, how do you deal with all these different cases?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Recently, I have been doing a lot of qualitative research which allows for incorporating different types and levels of data and accounts for diverse experiences and perspectives. In our “Living Lab at Home”, when something isn’t working or when we are not collecting enough data, rather than throwing it away, we ask ourselves why. Embedded in all of our research protocols now, there are opportunities to get feedback from people who participated in the studies. This way, even if the actual data that they gave us might not fit the analysis, we can get feedback about what got in the way and what we could do differently as a research team to facilitate their participation. I am so privileged to work with people who have way more statistical expertise than me and, together, we are constantly thinking about ways to structure the protocol in a way that we prioritise the data that we need and to engage with families before we even start collecting the data. We are always trying to figure out how to actually make it work and the different ways of telling the story, incorporating the data that we do have, because sometimes the absence of data is actually data itself. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Before, you mentioned you started noticing, during your clinical practice, a gap between the folks that participate in research and those that come to clinics. What contributes to such a gap? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">A lot of it comes back to this issue of </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">how</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> we are conducting research. For example, the requirements to successfully complete a treatment through a randomised control trial are quite rigorous. I understand why that is, to try to isolate a specific factor and understand exactly what a treatment does for this particular issue. However, in doing that, a lot of folks are going to get excluded because of the “variance” they’d bring to the data with their profile. A really good example is neurodiversity. A lot of young people that live with chronic pain are neurodivergent, or autistic, and a lot of clinical protocols will exclude these young people. This might be because of the high amount of variability in the types of pain they experience, or maybe because they have different needs for how they communicate their pain. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We see something similar happening with medical conditions, or psychiatric conditions, that often end up not fitting the inclusion criteria in a clinical trial, again because they are trying to isolate what the impact of this treatment is on chronic pain. But the reality is in specialised pain clinic, it’s very rare to see a child where pain is the only thing they are dealing with – there are often other symptoms, diagnoses, or challenges. So it’s hard to tell a young person that has multiple co-occurring conditions whether a treatment, which hasn’t been tested on anybody with a similar experience, is going to work for them. There are certainly some good reasons to think it would work and it might need some adaptations, but we don’t have the research to help us make the decisions on what those adaptations should look like.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Similarly, you said that these young people, who are under-represented in research, are often also the ones experiencing higher rates of pain. Can you explain to us why that is?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We know that for people who are autistic or neurodivergent, there might be differences in the way pain is processed in their body and differences in the sensory and nervous system. Moreover, for a lot of young people, the discrimination against their identity - whether that is neurodiversity, gender diversity, race or socioeconomic status - can impact their health outcomes. Because they are living in a certain stressful situation, they are being discriminated against, they don’t have the same access to healthcare, or healthcare that seems safe for them to access - all of this is going to put them at a higher risk of developing a chronic pain condition, amongst other conditions.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think one of the most important things that is happening in research right now is this increasing acknowledgement that, when it comes to populations that are “at risk”, there’s a whole bunch of systems that work against this person and that put them at risk. It’s such an important message that the young person themselves, and their identity, are not the problem. This ‘damage-centred’ view has been the narrative for a long time and has taken over in research, but I am glad to see a shift happening to understand the systems and structures that contribute to putting these young people at risk in the first place. I hope that we continue this discourse and incorporate it more and more into our research, not only to understand what kind of care we can provide for the individual person, but also how we can act on some of the bigger factors that lead to the higher risk.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>When these factors are neglected, how would you describe the consequences both on the clinical and research practices?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">If you want to study a specific treatment and don’t take those factors into account, you might not actually be able to get an understanding of why some treatments don’t work. There are a lot of good treatments out there and we are asking people to use them and apply them even in really challenging conditions. If you are living under a higher amount of stress because of your social situation, because you are being discriminated against, or because you don’t have access to what you need, it might not be realistic to expect the treatment to work to its full potential. I worry that this could discourage researchers from continuing to study a treatment in a particular population, or discourage a family, or a young person, from thinking that there’s something that could help them. In paediatric pain, we do an amazing job at showing how no child lives with their pain in isolation. We have done a lot of research on how the family system, the ways the parents interact with their child, and the ways the child interacts with their health provider, influence the pain experience. Now, I think we need to continue to extend our understanding of that influence, beyond just the immediate relationships, and look at the broader context that the young person is living in and how that context can impact them in very different ways, depending on their identity. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Throughout this interview, you have emphasised the necessity to change how research is conducted. Thinking also about your own effort to do that, can you tell me how methodologies should be modified to make research more inclusive and ensure that young people of all identities are cared for?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think one of the most important things that we have been doing in our work is asking young people about what parts of the research experience has worked for them and what hasn’t. That has been helpful to make modifications to the protocol and to offer different options. Much of this comes down to a couple of key principles:</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of these is flexibility. As researchers, we like clean protocols and for things to be controlled, but figuring out where it is possible to be flexible is so important. Another is to actually </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">ask </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">the people with lived experience what would make a difference to them. Some of our qualitative data have shown how patients having a relationship with the research team, and being shown how their ideas are being incorporated, can be really powerful and helps make sure that they are getting something back too. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Indeed, we have been thinking a lot about how to create a reciprocal relationship, for example by designing our platform so that we can feed the data back to the participants. This way, they can see the data in a way that makes sense to them and they can track the things that are meaningful to them, rather than sending us information and never seeing it again. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Finally, I think that a lot of what’s needed really comes down to basic principles of respect. I feel sad that I have to say that, but when we think of some of the experiences that these families have been going through - navigating the healthcare systems, having other experiences of research participation, or just living in a world that is often not designed for them - I think it can go a really long way to think about how to approach someone with respect. There is an assumption in research that we need to have everything figured out and sometimes that prevents us from asking important questions, like how we can approach families in a way that is going to make them feel comfortable and safe, whilst also being meaningful to them. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Part of what I have been thinking about, is that we talk a lot in clinical care about providing trauma-informed clinical care, but I think we need to start talking about how to provide trauma-informed research, and that can be such an important step in undoing what has made research inaccessible for some populations. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Issues with the way research is conducted can trickle down to the clinical experiences. Can you think of any way that the clinical practices can be changed to contribute to addressing the unmet needs of young people with different identities?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think a lot of clinicians naturally make modifications to the way they provide treatment. The problem is that we don’t always know if what we are doing is working, because of how we are collecting data. I think that, again, it is so important to incorporate the patient’s and family’s perspectives on what a meaningful treatment outcome would be. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In pain trials, we always measure pain intensity, functional disability, anxiety and depression as health outcomes of a given treatment. But those are not always the outcomes that are significant to a family. Instead, it could be more important to be able to sleep better at night, or to be able to do a sport they love. So, I think that part of making a treatment accessible, is also thinking about how we can modify things to make their desired outcome happen. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">For example, there are certainly a lot of similarities between the cisgender and gender diverse youth’s experiences of chronic pain, so some treatments can still work. However, there are some parts of the pain experience that are specific to gender diverse young people. A lot of the gender diverse young people we talked to for our research have talked about chest binding and how, even if it is a source of pain, it is also very important in developing their identity. So, if we are focused on the idea that for our treatment to be effective, we need to decrease the pain from a 7/10 to a 4/10, we don’t understand that this pain represents something important to the young person; we end up missing the mark in providing really good care. We need to give the right space for that young person to talk about their experience, and what is critical for them. That’s why I think that having clinician scientists is so important, because there is such a difference between the real clinical world, that can be really messy, and what we ideally like to do in research. Incorporating this information back into research, and understanding what’s working, when and for who, is so important. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Before, you said there is an increasing awareness in research of the influence of some broader contextual factors on pain experiences of pain. Can you talk to me a little bit more about the changes and advancements you see happening in the field of paediatric pain?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it’s amazing the amount of interest there is now in trying to understand more about young people that have not been historically included in pain research. There is a really incredible community of folks that have a specific interest in gender diversity and paediatric chronic pain, and are trying to do really meaningful research. Also, I am excited about the fact that I am seeing more and more work with an intersectional perspective - projects, that are not looking at sex or gender differences in isolation, but are instead also taking into consideration race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and other social positions that might be associated with marginalisation, power or privilege. They are trying to understand how all these factors intersect and, how the health disparities that we observe, fit into this framework. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the reasons why this kind of work excites me so much is that it’s hard, it’s challenging. I like the hard things in science, because it means they are important and they open up so many interesting opportunities for amazing collaborations. Intersectionality is not a new concept, per se, but it is now being applied directly in paediatric pain research. This is leading to interesting discussions on how to translate this into practice, using mixed methods, and how to engage differently with people with lived experience (and importantly, it leads to bridging between disciplines). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Pain has always been a very interdisciplinary field anyway, where medicine, psychology, basic and clinical science are integrated. However, I am glad to see that now there is, more often, an effort to link the pain experiences to the broader social context, that goes beyond the parent-child, or provider-patient relationship. There is a shift in thinking about our research more generally, and in an intersectional way, to incorporate multiple different identities, social positions and contexts.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>To conclude, what are the future prospects in this field that you are most excited about?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are a lot of things I am excited about! One of them is the increasing representation. I will be so thrilled the day that I can have a young person walk into my office and I will be able to say, “Look, this is where you are represented in the research and we know how to help people like you. This person’s experience in research might not 100% be your experience, because you are an individual person, but science cares about you too”. </span></span></p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Shabnam Kadir will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;Visual experience, topology, and the perception of art&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The brain has access to visual information via a variety of neural codes, e.g. there are
cells tuned to edge orientation, spatial frequency, edges, corners, contrasts and colour.
Higher cortical areas of the brain are thought to then further process visual information
as well as integrate a visual scene with other senses and the conscious mind. How this
visual information is combined with experience to form a holistic experience that elicits
an emotional response of pleasure, distress and/or other forms of meaning is an active
research question. The human perception of art and the question of what constitutes art
touch upon all these elements of perception and integration. We shall show how topology
provides a vital new lens in examining these questions.</p>
<p>We discuss recent work where methods from applied topology, namely persistent homology
of certain cubical complexes, are applied to images produced by both a human artist and
a neural network shown in two exhibitions in Torun, Poland. The images shown in the two
exhibitions were matched for certain information-theoretic pixel-based characteristics.
Experimental measurements of EEG, tracking of eye movement, as well as conscious
perception/appreciation of these paintings were collected from a selection of visitors
to these exhibitions, namely second-year art students.</p>
