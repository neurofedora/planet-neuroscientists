Feeding frenzy: The world&#8217;s largest fish, a slow-moving whale shark, feeds on snipefish herded into bait balls by agile tuna in the Azores. Attribution: Jorge Fontes</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Marine biologist Jorge Fontes captured the winning photograph. Jorge works at Okeanos-UAc, Institute of Marine Sciences, and is involved in a project to study the impact of fishing on the largest animals in the oceans.  &#8220;The world&#8217;s largest fish, the whale shark, is a gentle giant found in warm tropical and subtropical waters globally,&#8221; explains Fontes. &#8220;It likes to eat plankton, which it filters through its wide mouth. During warm summers, many adult whale sharks gather near the Azores. However, because these waters are not very productive in the summer, there isn&#8217;t much plankton for them to eat. Instead, the slow-moving whale sharks feed on snipefish, herded into tight groups at the surface by large schools of speedy bluefin and smaller tropical tunas, leading to a feeding frenzy. With the baitfish gathered together, the whale sharks use powerful suction to fill their huge mouths with food. This feeding partnership between sharks and tunas is rare elsewhere but common in these islands when both are present. To better understand this unique behaviour and the impact of local tuna fisheries, we have tagged whale sharks with advanced trackers (equipped with accelerometers, cameras, and sensors to measure location, pressure, and temperature)&#8221;. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryan Wagner, a conservation biologist in the School of Biological Sciences at Washington State University, won best in category for &#8220;Research in action&#8221;. &#8220;A single mosquito bite can kill a Kiwikiu, one of the most endangered birds in the world, with only 130 remaining. Following the introduction of mosquitoes in the 1800s, which carry deadly avian malaria, native Maui birds have found refuge on the high, cold slopes of the Haleakala volcano. However, as climate change warms the islands, mosquitoes have reached previously inaccessible elevations, killing birds. In 2024, the Maui Forest Birds Recovery Project (MFBRP) made the difficult decision to catch several pairs of Kiwikiu to create a captive population. As shown in the photo, medicine administered by ornithologists provides a boost of electrolytes and protein to strengthen the bird for a quick helicopter flight to the Maui Bird Conservation Center. There, it will be treated for malaria and join a captive breeding program to help save the species from extinction&#8221;, explains Ryan. </span></p>

<p>The runner-up of the ‘Research in action’ category was Brandon Güell, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Florida International University. High phosphorus levels from agricultural and stormwater runoff is harming the Everglades&#8217; unique wildlife by affecting plant diversity and triggering algae blooms. To address this issue, the state and federal governments are funding the largest ecosystem restoration project in the world. Here Güell&#8217;s colleague, Dr. Janelle Goeke, is conducting research to understand the role of fauna in phosphorus dynamics and exploring the potential of managing fish populations as a restoration tool.</p>

<p>The winner of the &#8216;Relationships in nature&#8217; category captured an Arctic Skua mimicking the flight pattern of a Black-legged Kittiwake in an attempt to steal it&#8217;s fish. The photo was submitted by Alwin Hardenbol, a postdoctoral researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Alwin comments, &#8220;This behavior, where one animal deliberately takes food from another, was observed from a boat near Vardö, Norway. Arctic Skuas often exhibit this type of behavior, known as kleptoparasitism, in large numbers. While in Norway, I observed Humpback whales bringing fish to the surface, which the Kittiwakes and other gulls caught. The Skuas then attempted to steal the fish from them. All of the Skuas&#8217; attempts I observed were successful, demonstrating their efficiency in this relationship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Charitonidou, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Ioannina, submitted the runner-up for this category. &#8220;Unlike the majority of Ophrys orchids, which produce flowers imitating female insects, Helen&#8217;s Bee orchid is the only species in this genus known to use shelter mimicry as its pollination strategy,&#8221; Charitonidou explains. &#8220;Helen&#8217;s Bee orchid is one of the most easily recognizable members of the genus Ophrys due to its large flowers with a specialised, burgundy-coloured petal (labellum), which in the bee visible spectrum looks like a black hole on the ground that a bee would use to seek shelter. As shown in this photo, male Eucerini bees can be seen crawling into Helen Bee orchid flowers in search of shelter during early morning or late evening hours.&#8221;</p>

A concerned freeloader: A non-pollinating fig wasp uses its specialised ovipositor to deposit eggs inside a fig. Attribution: Abhijeet Bayani</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dr Abhijeet Bayani, a biologist from the Indian Institute of Science, captured the winning image for the &#8216;Life close-up&#8217; category. Fig trees, crucial in tropical ecosystems as they provide food for many animals throughout the year, have evolved to have flowers inside their fruit. The only way a fig can be pollinated is with the help of minuscule fig wasps, which burrow inside and lay their eggs within. The relationship between figs and fig wasps is highly interdependent &#8211; both rely on each other to complete their life cycles, making it a classic example of co-evolution. The female wasps enter the fig, lay eggs, pollinate it and eventually die within the fig.  Once the eggs hatch, the male wasps mate with the newly hatched female wasps and create an exit tunnel for the females to leave and locate new figs. Some fig wasps are essential for pollinating the figs, while others, like the non-pollinating wasp captured in Dr Abhijeet Bayani&#8217;s winning photo, have evolved a specialised ovipositor to cheat the fig, which is used to bore through the surface of the fruit from the outside and deposit eggs inside. Their offspring then develop inside the safety of the fig, seemingly without benefiting the fig tree itself.</p>

Inside a dinosaur bone: Unlocking the life history of Megapnosaurus. Attribution: Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Professor Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, a palaeontologist from the University of Cape Town, submitted the runner-up for &#8216;Life close-up&#8217;. Using a microscope, Chinsamy-Turan demonstrates how fossilised bones can provide valuable information about long-extinct species. Chinsamy-Turan explains, &#8220;When viewed under a petrographic microscope, this image of a thin section of a femur of Megapnosaurus, a predatory dinosaur from Southern Africa, reveals important information about the biology of this ~190-million-year-old animal. The large black areas once contained blood vessels, nerves, and other connective tissue, while the smaller black specks are the spaces in which bone cells were once located. After death, organic tissue decomposes, and the empty spaces are infilled with sediment and minerals. The vibrant colours visible in the image provide insight into the organisation of the apatite, which is the mineral component of bone that survives fossilisation. In life, collagen and apatite are intimately associated, and although collagen is no longer present, the overall arrangement of the apatite suggests that the bone was deposited rapidly.&#8221; Studying the microstructure of fossilised bone can provide valuable insight into the life history of dinosaurs and other extinct vertebrates. This can include details about the sex, growth rate, presence of disease, and the potential impact of environmental factors on the growth of the extinct animal.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-4.png"><img decoding="async" width="190" height="242" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129823"/></a></figure></div>


<p>A team of physicists has retracted a paper from <em>Science</em> after they discovered mistakes in their data and statistical analysis when following up on their work.</p>



<p>The paper “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau1949">A room-temperature single-photon source based on strongly interacting Rydberg atoms</a>” published in 2018, garnered 117 citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Of these, 97 citations came after the authors corrected the paper in 2020 to adjust for updated calibrations, which they said did not affect the conclusions of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This correction was unrelated to the reasons for retraction, said corresponding author <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/press/experts/Prof.-Tilman-Pfau/">Tilman Pfau</a>, a professor of physics at the University of Stuttgart in Germany.</p>



<span id="more-129822"></span>



<p>The now-retracted paper described a way to generate single photons on demand at room temperature rather than in extremely cold conditions. The approach could have “various applications in quantum information processing and communication,” the authors wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the retraction notice, after a recent internal reevaluation of the data, the authors “detected mistakes in data filtering and statistical calculations in one of the study’s figures.” The authors reevaluation of the data does not support the study’s conclusions, hence the retraction, the notice stated.</p>



<p>The authors found the errors in their previous data analysis while working on an update to the experiment, but with more advanced equipment, Pfau said.</p>



<p>“While analyzing this new data we realized that we did subtle mistakes in the analysis and the filtering of the ‘old’ data,” Pfau told Retraction Watch. He added that the experiment’s low coincidence rate, an important factor in quantum analysis, was “not enough to draw conclusions with sufficient confidence in retrospect.” All authors agree with the retraction, he said.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Science </em>said it’s encouraging “to see examples like this where authors uncover an error and work quickly to correct the record.” <a href="https://www.science.org/content/author/holden-thorp-phd">Holden Thorp</a>, the editor in chief of the <em>Science</em> family of journals, has previously <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade3742">expressed his desire</a> to change the retraction process, such as implementing a two-step process to speed up retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pfau said his team handled the case as transparently as possible: “In order to avoid such mistakes in the future we will intensify our training in the statistical analysis of data and will also publish alongside with future papers, the original data and the analyzing scripts.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/bridging-the-gap-ruth-dobson">Bridging the Gap: Ruth Dobson</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We are back with our series Bridging the Gap! For each post, we are interviewing women in neuroscience to discuss the gaps and the health inequalities relating to different areas of neuroscience, as well as the exciting new research that is attempting to bridge these gaps. For our new article, we talked with Professor Ruth Dobson, consultant neurologist and researcher at the Wolfson Institute for Population Health, Queen Mary University of London. In our interview, Professor Dobson shared with us her experience working on Multiple Sclerosis and her interest in equality and diversity within this field.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, with no definitive cure. It is estimated that there are more than 30,000 people with MS in the UK alone, and over 2.8 million people diagnosed worldwide. Disease onset is usually between 20 to 40 years of age and the most common symptoms include, but are not limited to, difficulty walking, fatigue, blurred vision and spasms (</span></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">see our post for MS Awareness week </span></span><u><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/womeninneurouk/p/C6E9jNwtN0N/?locale=nl&hl=af&img_index=1" target="_blank">here</a></span></span></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">). Any of these symptoms can occur in relapses or progressively worsen over time; either way, it can significantly impact quality of life. However, it is noteworthy that MS is also a highly heterogeneous disease, with symptoms and health outcomes varying across individuals. For example, in women, MS is three times more prevalent than in men and tends to develop at a younger age, significantly impacting female patients’ lives. Additionally, this disease was considered to affect mostly white people, however studies have suggested that it is more common in Black and Asian individuals than previously thought and it also tends to develop earlier and more aggressively in these populations (1,2). These disparities are driven, not only by genetic and environmental factors, but also by individual and structural social determinants - such as health care access, race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status. Still, little is known about their true effects on MS outcomes and how they potentially contribute to health disparities in MS. It is fundamental to address these issues to understand and treat the different developments of MS and its symptoms in people. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With her work on multiple sclerosis, Professor Ruth Dobson advocates for the necessity of removing biases in clinical and research practices and collecting real-world data that reflect the diversity of MS patients, their experiences and their unmet needs.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you tell me a bit about your background and your path to studying multiple sclerosis?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I am a clinician and, during my neurology training, I did a PhD looking at multiple sclerosis (MS), investigating why people develop MS and the risks of MS in people without a diagnosis. I think, during this experience, I really caught the ‘bug’ for research; I started really enjoying it and I decided I actually wanted research to be part of my career going forward. However, when I finished my PhD, it was quite hard to combine everything, so I went back to my clinical training, completed it and became a consultant neurologist. I then had the opportunity to move back to research and I have remained in it ever since, even though I still do clinical work. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What research projects are you working on at the moment?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have a few projects, but in particular I am interested in inequalities. In terms of gender-based inequalities, I am working on pregnancy and MS. Multiple Sclerosis does not only affect more females than males, but it also tends to be diagnosed at an earlier age in the former, affecting people when they could be thinking about pregnancy and family planning. So I do quite a bit of work on drug safety and pregnancy and approaches to minimise the harm to both mother and baby. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I also conduct a project on how menopause can impact MS and the causes of MS during the life course. On the other hand, in terms of the wider social determinants of health, I do some research building on my PhD work, but in particular looking at MS in people from different ethnicities and backgrounds. I am interested in exploring the pathways of MS risks, not just in a single population but across multiple ones, investigating how social determinants of health might influence things like diagnosis and access to disease modifying therapy, have an impact on MS outcomes, and look at how the safety profiles of disease modifying therapies may change over time and with the background. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">You mentioned equality. How did you become interested in specifically exploring equality and diversity within MS research?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I work in East London, so diversity is what I see every day in my clinical work. In a way, we are very lucky with MS because we have all of these drugs that can work very well. However, not everyone has equitable access to diagnosis, specifically an early diagnosis, and medication, and that is a really big determinant of long-term health outcomes in all populations. It stems from the fact that someone’s background can be associated with a preconception in clinical care about the likelihood of them having MS, which then impacts downstream. You see it in the clinics, where, in an NHS service that is incredibly strained and struggles massively with capacity, people that had generally good or high social determinants of health were able to advocate for themselves, navigate healthcare services, and access treatments more promptly and report problems. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Looking at research and treatments in MS, what would you say are some of the most impactful disparities?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As mentioned before, I think a lot of disparities actually come down to how easily people can navigate and access the healthcare services and manage to stay in the system. It can be very challenging, especially when you have a disease that may leave very little physical signs but quite a lot of impact. We see again, and again, and again people with MS who visited health services multiple times before receiving a diagnosis, who felt they were not believed or trusted and had to keep banging on the door. So, I would say differences in accessing and navigating the healthcare system influence MS outcomes. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are so many other challenges that people face, but I think that categorising people, according to factors they have potentially no control over, is not always very helpful. Instead, we should try to think more about how the services operate. For example, virtual appointments: for somebody who has low income, or poor access to the internet, and lives in digital poverty, accessing a video appointment is a massive barrier to healthcare. These sort of structural barriers that exist within the NHS may affect one group more than others and impact different health outcomes. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What can mitigate, in terms of research and clinical practices, such disparities?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think we need to understand what the barriers are, and also start from the idea that one single design of healthcare is not going to work for everyone. From a research perspective, we should investigate, using both large data and individual qualitative work, what the structural barriers that people face actually are, how these manifest, what harm they can potentially cause and where they do so along a pathway. It is also important to enter this work with an open mind, without preconceptions of what characteristics can lead people to face barriers, but keeping in mind that they do not act independently. There is an incredibly complex web of different factors and aspects that can also be very situational and depend on the particular condition. Also, in terms of healthcare, I think that, to design services that better address disparities, there should be a range of solutions impacting different factors. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Do you see changes in practices that are moving towards these  directions? And is there anything in particular that you see happening in the field of MS that particularly excites you?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it is very challenging for things to be happening with the NHS being so strained. However, there is an increasing research interest in the role of inequalities in health outcomes. What is interesting and fills me with hope, is the fact that if you go back 5 years, there was almost nothing happening in this area, but now it has become a major research priority and that brings the potential for translation into impact. </span></span></p>

<p>A paper that cited a single researcher’s work in 53 of 64 references will be retracted following our inquiries, the publisher of the journal has told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, ‘Culturally-informed for designing motorcycle fire rescue: Empirical study in developing country’, <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/14/6/065222/3297649/Culturally-informed-for-designing-motorcycle-fire">published in June in <em>AIP Advances</em></a>, overwhelmingly cites the work of Muhammed Imam Ammarullah, a lecturer at Universitas Pasundan in West Java, Indonesia, sometimes without obvious relevance to the text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An anonymous tipster came across the soon-to-be retracted paper on Google Scholar, then alerted the editors at <em>AIP Advances </em>in June to the strange citation pattern. The journal investigated, but didn’t acknowledge a problem with the excessive citations to Ammarullah’s work in their initial response to the complaint. Instead, they identified issues with six other, unrelated citations, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129814"></span>



<p>During the initial investigation, the publisher found the authors added those six references at the request of a reviewer. The references “do not appear to enrich the discussion of the results presented,” a representative from the journal wrote in an email to the tipster. But the journal found “no clear evidence of coercion to include those references by the part of the reviewer or handling editors,” although the investigation “did reveal gaps” in the journal’s guidelines for including citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we asked about the 53 citations, the publisher said they had decided to pull the paper because they found those citations were also “unrelated to the subject discussed in the text.” The authors have not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Other papers follow the same pattern. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Scientific sleuth</a> Nick Wise has flagged 13 <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=ammarullah">articles</a> on PubPeer with an unusually high number of citations to Ammarullah’s work “shoehorned” into the text, he said. Of the 13 flagged papers, two authors of two separate papers responded to our questions. Both said an anonymous reviewer added the citations during the review process. </p>



<p>Hamed Nosrati, co-author of “Artificial Intelligence in Regenerative Medicine: Applications and Implications,” <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37754193/">a paper in <em>Biomimetics</em></a> which Wise <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/12C65CFC5C8C69B0350D69BC7791AE#1">flagged</a>, said an ethical specialist at the journal contacted him after Wise’s comment appeared on Pubpeer. According to Nosrati, after a review, an academic editor concluded that the references included didn’t affect the article’s overall readability or main conclusions. </p>



<p>Kuppalapalle Vajravelu, corresponding author of “Effects of Stefan blowing on mixed convection heat transfer in a nanofluid flow with Thompson and Troian slip,” <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10407782.2023.2261626">another paper citing Ammarullah</a>, also <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/06635A5E67B4BA34F7AC9E38693078#1">flagged on PubPeer</a>, said an anonymous reviewer suggested the citations to “improve the quality of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>References can be a “grey area,” the journal’s editor, John Abraham of the University of St. Thomas, said in response to our questions, “because while topic areas may seem different, there are often subtle overlaps that justify inclusion.” Taylor and Francis, the paper’s publisher, said they were looking into the concerns.</p>



<p>Wise doesn’t see a common denominator among the papers that cite Ammarullah’s work without clear relevance. “They’re all different authors, different countries, different institutions,” he said, which could be evidence the common thread is “much deeper and worse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">Citation manipulation</a>, whether <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01532-w">coerced citations</a>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/vendor-offering-citations-purchase-latest-bad-actor-scholarly-publishing">buying citations</a>, or <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-dark-world-of-citation-cartels">citation rings</a> – groups of researchers who agree to cite each other’s work – <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2012/04/10/emergence-of-a-citation-cartel/">isn’t new</a>, but has become easier to detect and attracted more attention recently. Extreme cases demonstrate how far the practice can go. Wise was involved in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-easy-it-fudge-your-scientific-rank-meet-larry-world-s-most-cited-cat">a recent experiment</a> that garnered Larry, a feline, more than 100 citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ammarullah, who has not responded to our request for comment, has tallied <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XE_oxj0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">more than 1,200 citations</a> since the start of 2023 and is listed as an author on 53 publications in that timeframe. Clarivate’s Web of Science recently named one of his articles published in an MDPI journal <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/3891">a “hot paper”</a> – a title given to publications that rack up enough citations to place them in the top 0.1% of papers in a particular field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/mysteries-of-psilocybin">Mysteries of Psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p>From the rock art found in the Sahara Desert to the mushroom stone statues of Mesoamerican civilizations, artefacts throughout human history suggest that psychoactive mushrooms were used in religious and spiritual ceremonies across different cultures. The earliest proven use of these mushrooms can be traced back to prehistoric times, with evidence found in several archaeological and anthropological contexts. Rock paintings in the Sahara Desert, dating back to around 7000-5000 BCE, depict people with mushrooms sprouting from their bodies, potentially symbolising their ceremonial or ritualistic use. Stone carvings depicting mushrooms discovered in various locations in Central America and Mexico suggest that Mesoamerican civilizations, especially the Maya, used these mushrooms in similar contexts approximately 6000 years later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Spanish chronicles from the 16th century describe &quot;teonanácatl&quot;, Aztec for &quot;god&apos;s flesh,&quot; widely believed to be mushrooms used for healing and spiritualism​. In ancient China, the &quot;Divine Farmer&apos;s Classic of Materia Medica&quot;, an ancient text on agriculture and medicinal plants, references the use of fungi with possible psychoactive properties for similar benefits​. Additionally, Indian sacred texts dating back to 1500 BCE describe a sacred religious drink, Soma, which is believed to contain extracts from psychedelic mushrooms​​. Ironically, despite this long history, research into their therapeutic value is still in its early stages even thousands of years later. These &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; contain a molecule, psilocybin, responsible for the spiritual journey that connects the human to &quot;divine&quot; realms.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chemically named 4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin is metabolised in the body to its active component, psilocin which interacts with the serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2AR) in the brain. Serotonin is an essential neurotransmitter responsible for various activities such as mood regulation, sleep, appetite, social behaviours (sex and aggression), memory, and learning. Psilocin mimics serotonin’s function in the brain and behaves as a partial agonist at serotonin receptors, hence contributing to a psychedelic experience. Due to these effects of psilocybin on mood regulation, research is being conducted on its potential to treat mood disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Several psychological disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, death/disease-related anxiety, depression, treatment-resistant depression, major depressive disorder, smoking, and alcohol and tobacco addiction, are observed to involve dysfunctional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN). The DMN is a network of brain regions active when the brain is at rest or engaged in unfocused tasks such as daydreaming and mind-wandering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Studies conducted to understand the overall effects of psilocybin on the brain show that it &quot;desynchronizes&quot; brain activity, drastically altering the interaction between different brain regions. Psilocybin significantly impacts the DMN and the anterior hippocampus, which alters one’s sense of time, space, and self. Other significantly impacted areas include regions in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, connected to the DMN. This reduced functional connectivity between these regions can persist for weeks and is thought to correlate with increased neuroplasticity, thus contributing to the therapeutic effects of psychedelics.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although clinical trials assessing the efficiency of psilocybin-assisted therapy are limited, a small study among patients with addiction showed promising results. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants who took psilocybin had a significantly lower percentage of heavy-drinking days over 32 weeks compared to those who took a placebo. Additionally, the prevalence of smoking abstinence was 80% at 26 weeks and 67% at 52 weeks for those who received psilocybin. Another study on patients with major depressive disorder found that psilocybin-assisted therapy led to significant and sustained positive effects with minimal adverse events. Moreover, randomised controlled trials on patients with anxiety and related disorders demonstrated that psilocybin improved well-being, life satisfaction, and mood immediately after administration and up to six months post-treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, though psilocybin has been consumed throughout history for its psychedelic effects, current research suggests that it is especially effective in a psychotherapeutic setting, where patients can alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression and addiction due to actual changes in brain connectivity. While these findings are promising, there remains a need for more extensive research to fully understand and harness the potential of psilocybin-assisted therapy.</p>

<p>A former department chair engaged in research misconduct in work funded by 19 grants from the National Institutes of Health, according to the U.S. Office of Research Integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard Eckert, formerly the chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and deputy director of the university’s Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, faked data in 13 published papers and two grant applications, ORI found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-eckert-richard-l">ORI finding</a> stated Eckert “engaged in research misconduct in research supported by” every NIH grant on which he served as principal investigator, totaling more than $19 million. The finding also lists multiple “<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/ac_search_results.htm?text_curr=p30&amp;Search_Type=Activity&amp;Search.x=0&amp;Search.y=0">Center Core Grants</a>” worth hundreds of millions for shared resources and facilities at research centers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129806"></span>



<p>Of the 13 papers in which Eckert faked Western blot and microscopy image data, according to ORI, four have been corrected and one retracted, and Eckert must request corrections or retractions for the remaining eight. The 13 papers have been cited 488 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036941">Suppression of AP1 Transcription Factor Function in Keratinocyte Suppresses Differentiation</a>,” originally appeared in <em>PLOS ONE</em> in 2012 and has been cited 20 times. The journal <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247222">retracted it</a> in 2021, citing the University of Maryland’s investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The investigation committee recommended retraction of the article and concluded that it is compromised in light of their findings” about two of the figures, the retraction notice states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to ORI’s findings, Eckert erased a band in one of the paper’s figures “to falsely show a favorable result.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 13 papers and two grant applications, Eckert used and reused images “representing unrelated experiments, with or without manipulating them, and falsely relabeling them as data representing different proteins and/or experimental results,” ORI found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eckert agreed to forgo contracting with the federal government or receiving government funding for eight years, longer than the three-year bans or supervision periods that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/21/what-analyzing-30-years-of-us-federal-research-misconduct-sanctions-revealed/">ORI typically imposes</a>. Eckert also agreed not to serve on any advisory or peer review committees for the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the NIH, for eight years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eckert has not responded to our request for comment sent to his university email address, which did not bounce. The finding is the <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case_summary">fourth announced by the ORI this year</a>.</p>



<p>According to the University of Maryland’s 2019 <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2019/internationally-recognized-scientist-richard-i-eckert-phd-named-deputy-director-of-the-university-of-maryland-marlene-and-stewart-greenebaum-comprehensive-cancer-center.html">announcement</a> naming him deputy director of the university’s cancer center, Eckert “is internationally-renowned for his pioneering discoveries in the area of surface epithelial biology.” His studies “have led to enhanced understanding of normal skin biology and to insights regarding the mechanisms that drive skin diseases including cancer.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">This year marks the 20th<sup> </sup>anniversary of the publication of “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200406019">What’s in a picture?&nbsp; The temptation of image manipulation</a>,” in which I described the problem of image manipulation in biomedical research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two decades later, much has changed.&nbsp; I am reassured by the heightened awareness of this issue and the numerous efforts to address it by various stakeholders in the publication process, but I am disappointed that image manipulation remains such an extensive problem in the biomedical literature. (Note: I use the term “image manipulation” throughout this piece as a generic term to refer to both image manipulation (e.g., copy/paste, erasure, splicing, etc.) and image duplication.)</p>



<p>In 2002, I was the managing editor of <em>The Journal of Cell Biology </em>(JCB), and STM journals were transitioning away from paper submissions.&nbsp; We had just implemented online manuscript submission, and authors often sent figure files in the wrong file format.&nbsp; One day, I assisted an author by reformatting some figure files.&nbsp; In one of the Western blot image panels, I noticed sharp lines around some of the bands, indicating they had either been copied and pasted into the image or the intensity of those bands had been selectively altered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-129798" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-300x300.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-1022x1024.jpg 1022w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-150x150.jpg 150w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner-768x769.jpg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mike_Rossner.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mike Rossner</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I vividly recall my reaction, which was, “Oh shit, this is going to be a problem.  We’re going to have to do something about this.”  With the blessing of then editor-in-chief, Ira Mellman, I immediately instituted a policy for the journal to examine all figure files of all accepted manuscripts for evidence of manipulation before they could be published.  We began using simple techniques, which I developed along with three of my colleagues at the time, Rob O’Donnell, Erinn Grady, and Laura Smith.  <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/how-to-guard-against-image-fraud-47775">The approach</a> involved visual inspection of each image panel using adjustments of brightness and contrast in Photoshop, to enhance visualization of background elements.  </p>



<span id="more-129796"></span>



<p>Such adjustments can reveal inconsistencies in an image (such as sharp lines in what should be a uniform background) that are clues to manipulation such as splicing, or consistencies in an image (such as a matching pattern of background spots) that are clues to duplication.&nbsp; By this point, it was clear to me that image manipulation was an issue all journals could, and thus should, address within their production workflows.&nbsp; There were personnel costs involved, but I believed the costs were worth it to protect the scientific record.</p>



<p>As far as I know, <em>JCB </em>was the first scholarly journal to implement systematic image screening.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.8278802">Other</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10916744/">people</a> had <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Science-Design-Craft-Image/dp/0262062259/">raised concerns</a> about the potential problem of digital image manipulation in biomedical research before then.&nbsp; But, in 2002, no one had yet done anything to detect it systematically and prevent manipulated images from entering the published literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The start of <em>JCB</em>’s image screening process was announced in an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200209084">editorial</a> published in September 2002.&nbsp; That editorial also contained my first call for principal investigators to closely examine the image data in prepared manuscripts from their labs before submission to a journal, as another means of preventing image falsification.</p>



<p>After about six months of observing what authors were doing with their images, we came up with the first journal guidelines for handling digital images.&nbsp; These were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030801143445/http:/www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml#image_aquisition">published in July 2003</a>.&nbsp; At a meeting of the <em>JCB </em>editors in December of that year, I discussed with Ken Yamada ― a PI at the NIH, member of the NIH ethics committee, and a <em>JCB </em>editor ― ways we could share the image screening policies and practices we had implemented at the journal.&nbsp; Joan Schwartz, then assistant director for ethics and education at the NIH, invited us to write an article for the <em>NIH Catalyst</em>, an intramural NIH publication.&nbsp; The resulting “What’s in a picture?” article was published in May 2004 and reprinted verbatim in <em>JCB </em>two months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after “What’s in a picture?” was published, I spoke at a conference sponsored by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) about research on research integrity.&nbsp; Attendees debated the prevalence of research misconduct, because no one had investigated it in a systematic way.&nbsp; Survey data and some back-of-the-napkin calculations at the time estimated between <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/assessing_int_research.pdf">one in 100 and one in 100,000</a> researchers had committed some form of research misconduct.&nbsp; Based on the numbers of cases resulting from the systematic image screening at <em>JCB</em>, I believed the incidence of image manipulation alone was on the order of magnitude at the high end of that range; one in 100 accepted manuscripts at the journal contained evidence of image manipulation that affected the interpretation of the data.</p>



<p>That talk led to an invitation to speak to the Division of Investigative Oversight at ORI in January 2005.&nbsp; The meeting concluded with a consensus that image manipulation was a serious problem that all biomedical research journals were eventually going to have to address to prevent fraudulent data from entering the published literature.&nbsp; It also concluded with a question from Chris Pascal, then the director of ORI, asking how we were going to get other journals to start addressing it.&nbsp; The collective answer was that it was going to take a serious case of image manipulation at a high-profile journal to get other journals to take note.&nbsp; Then the Hwang case broke.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1094515">2004</a> and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1112286">2005</a>, Woo Suk Hwang and his colleagues published two papers in the journal <em>Science</em> describing the production of human embryonic stem cells.&nbsp; The work came under scrutiny after a whistleblower in the lab alerted the Korean media to potential ethical violations and falsification of data, including image manipulation, in the articles.&nbsp; After an investigation by the authors’ institution, both papers were retracted in January 2006.</p>



<p>The Hwang case jolted the biomedical research and publishing communities, and led to&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/science/it-may-look-authentic-heres-how-to-tell-it-isnt.html">publicity</a> for the image screening program at <em>JCB</em>, which, I believe, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200612154">would have detected</a> at least some of the manipulation in the <em>Science</em> articles before publication.&nbsp; Over the next several years, my colleagues and I at Rockefeller University Press trained roughly 25 other publishers in our visual screening techniques, and many of them – including the publishers of <em>Science</em> – began systematic image screening before publication.</p>



<p>But other stakeholders in the publication process – researchers, funders, institutions, most publishers – remained naïve about the extent of the problem and their susceptibility to this form of misconduct.&nbsp; It seemed like they were willing to let what they thought was just a small problem continue, because no-one was calling them out publicly.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2010, journal editors began receiving emails from someone with the pseudonym “Clare Francis,” who appeared to be scouring the published literature for examples of image manipulation.&nbsp; In the early days, many of the allegations were bizarre and lacked merit (<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/01/22/clare-francis-scores-a-bullseye-journal-of-cell-biology-paper-retracted-for-image-manipulation/">although some did</a>), which led journal editors to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/12/09/why-editors-should-stop-ignoring-anonymous-whisteblowers-our-latest-labtimes-column/">disregard allegations from anonymous whistleblowers</a> in general.&nbsp; This unfortunate attitude caused a setback in the effort to get journals to address the issue of image manipulation.</p>



<p>In July 2012, Paul Brookes of the University of Rochester started a personal blog called Science-Fraud.com.&nbsp; He anonymously posted allegations of image manipulation that he and some helpers detected.&nbsp; Within six months, the site was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/03/11/so-what-happened-after-paul-brookes-was-forced-to-shut-down-science-fraud-org/">shut down</a> due to threats of litigation.</p>



<p>However, during that same six-month period, a neuroscientist named <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pubpeer-s-secret-out-founder-controversial-website-reveals-himself">Brandon Stell</a> founded the website <a href="https://pubpeer.com">PubPeer.com</a> as a public forum for post-publication peer review.&nbsp; This site was different, in that members of the public could post comments about published articles, and they could do so anonymously.&nbsp; The right of commenters to maintain that anonymity has since been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/12/07/pubpeer-wins-appeal-court-ruling-unmask-commenters">upheld in court</a>.&nbsp; PubPeer has flourished in the intervening dozen years, and a substantial proportion of the comments on the site involve allegations of image manipulation in the biomedical literature.</p>



<p>One of the most prominent and prolific posters on the site is not anonymous.&nbsp; Elisabeth Bik has made allegations of image manipulation in thousands of articles in her posts on PubPeer.&nbsp; She rose to prominence in 2016 with a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00809-16">landmark paper</a> on the frequency of image duplication in published biomedical research articles, which represented a tour-de-force analysis of 20,000 articles.&nbsp; The frequency that she detected for image duplications that were unlikely to be due to clerical error (2% of articles screened) was in keeping with the rate of manipulation that affected the interpretation of the data at <em>JCB</em> (1% of articles screened).</p>



<p>Bik has inspired the establishment of a community of so-called image <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">sleuths</a> who scour the literature for examples of image manipulation in published articles.&nbsp; The sheer number of their postings has highlighted the extent of the problem.&nbsp; The fact that these postings are public means stakeholders are now more concerned about damage to their reputations, making them more likely to take action. &nbsp; How the sleuths choose which papers to scrutinize is unclear, but that mystery keeps all stakeholders on their toes about whether they will be called out next.</p>



<p>As sleuths work through older publications, they have demonstrated that manipulation of digital images was occurring years before I realized it at <em>JCB </em>in 2002.&nbsp; As an example, a misconduct investigation into Marc Tessier-Lavigne at Stanford University in 2023 led to the retraction of a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/05/former-stanford-president-retracts-1999-cell-paper/"><em>Cell</em> paper from 1999</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/31/stanford-president-retracts-two-science-papers-following-investigation/">two <em>Science </em>papers from 2001</a> due to image manipulation.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As far as I am aware, the first commercially available software for detecting image manipulation was released in 2007.&nbsp; That software <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200810172">did not prove effective</a>.</p>



<p>Within the last few years, however, several other companies have released commercially available algorithms for detecting image manipulation.&nbsp; One that distinguished itself was <a href="https://imagetwin.ai">ImageTwin</a>, which was the first to develop functionality to screen for duplications against a database of millions of images from previously published articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of these software developers has provided information on how effective their algorithm is relative to visual screening by someone with a trained eye for detecting image manipulation.&nbsp; I have <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/01/10/guest-post-publishers-should-be-transparent-about-the-capabilities-and-limitations-of-software-they-use-to-detect-image-manipulation-or-duplication/">written about the need for transparency</a> about the effectiveness of these algorithms, so that users are informed about their capabilities and limitations.&nbsp; Those I have tested are reasonably good at detecting duplications in micrograph images, but their effectiveness at detecting duplications in blot images is more limited.&nbsp; Their ability to detect manipulations such as copy/paste, erasure, or splicing is disappointing in their current state of development.&nbsp; Any algorithmic output must be evaluated by a trained and knowledgeable human to confirm its findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I strongly encourage the use of these algorithms to screen images at scale.&nbsp; Indeed, the screening of the images in an article against millions of previously published articles is only possible algorithmically.&nbsp; As a by-product of this functionality, collaborative efforts are <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2024/05/23/guest-post-the-research-integrity-hub-connecting-the-dots-in-a-dynamic-landscape/">in progress</a> to enable publishers to screen their submissions at scale against manuscripts submitted to other publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to their use for image screening at scale, algorithms are inappropriate for evaluating specific allegations of image manipulation.&nbsp; Visual inspection is the only standard that should be used (unless the allegation is that an image has been created using generative AI, see below).&nbsp; The algorithms I have tested have too many false negatives and false positives to be used in this capacity.&nbsp; Thus, a negative result from an algorithm is not proof of innocence, and a positive result is not proof of guilt.</p>



<p>In some cases that have <a href="https://twitter.com/MicrobiomDigest/status/1594810586487037958">played out publicly on X</a>, authors attempted to refute allegations from Bik of image duplication using algorithmic methods, but the results produced by those methods were flat-out wrong when compared to visual inspection.&nbsp; I have experienced similar situations, and Leonid Schneider has also <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/05/10/schneider-shorts-10-05-2024-socially-unacceptable-behaviour/#mario">reported</a> on <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/05/31/schneider-shorts-31-05-2024-historic-heavy-rain-and-flooding/#shock">cases</a>&nbsp; in which publishers used an algorithm to incorrectly dismiss allegations of image manipulation.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The perception that algorithms are superior to human ability is dangerous at the current stage of algorithm development—false negatives will lead to manipulated image data remaining in the published literature, and false positives will lead to incorrect accusations of misconduct.&nbsp; Visual inspection remains the gold standard for evaluating specific allegations of image manipulation.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2015, I established a company called <a href="https://imagedataintegrity.com">Image Data Integrity</a> to consult about image manipulation in biomedical research.&nbsp; I work mostly with institutions conducting internal investigations in response to allegations made on PubPeer.&nbsp; I continue to see image manipulations in the same types of images — mostly in blots, but also in other images, such as, micrographs, photographs and scatter plots.&nbsp; I continue to see the same types of manipulations and duplications.&nbsp; I also continue to see the same types of inconsistencies between loading control and experimental blot image panels (e.g., one is spliced, and the other is not spliced), indicating that they were detected on different blots, making the loading control invalid.</p>



<p>I also continue to hear the same types of responses from authors, the most common of which is, “Oh, it’s just a loading control.”&nbsp; It is time for the biomedical research community to firmly reject this perspective.&nbsp; Without a valid loading control, a blot experiment cannot be properly interpreted &nbsp;– no valid comparison of protein levels can be made&nbsp; – and thus any conclusion the authors have drawn is unreliable.</p>



<p>The predominant change in the last 20 years has been the dramatic increase in the number of published articles <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/">questioned for image manipulation</a>. The increase, which has several drivers, has occurred despite the fact that people’s skills in Photoshop have undoubtedly improved over this timespan. </p>



<p>First, we have seen&nbsp; a dramatic increase in the number of articles published per year, especially low-quality papers.&nbsp; This surge is due in part to the advent of predatory publishers, which were an unintended, but not unforeseen, consequence of the pay-to-publish open access business model <a href="https://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=17276">pioneered by BioMed Central</a> over 20 years ago.&nbsp; Predatory publishers carry out only cursory (if any) peer review to maximize the number of articles they publish and thus their profits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increase in the number of articles published also reflects the emergence of China as a global player in biomedical research within the last 25 years.&nbsp; This emergence has <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2024/04/18/guest-post-making-sense-of-retractions-and-tackling-research-misconduct/">added hundreds of thousands of articles</a> to the published biomedical literature annually, due, in part, to <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/02/22/why-fake-research-is-rampant-in-china">problematic incentives designed to boost the country’s rankings</a></p>



<p>Anonymous public commenting has become common, which has led to increased detection because of an increase in the number of image sleuths scouring the published literature for image manipulation. The accuracy of those sleuths’ allegations has improved; they are consistently more reliable than in the early days of Clare Francis and are therefore taken more seriously. Finally, algorithms that detect image manipulation have come online, lowering the bar for entry to becoming a sleuth and to implementing systematic image screening.</p>



<p>Whether the <em>percentage</em> of published articles with problematic images has changed is unclear.&nbsp; Those numbers were remarkably consistent over the 12 years that I was involved with image screening at <em>JCB</em>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.17749">similar</a> <a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1873-3468.13201">studies</a> more recently have provided similar numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this rate is irrelevant to the important consequence resulting from the increase in the absolute number of articles questioned for image manipulation.&nbsp; The increase, along with coverage by sites like <a href="https://retractionwatch.com">Retraction Watch</a>, and more recently, by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/us/stanford-president-resigns-tessier-lavigne.html">national media</a>, has led to an increase in the awareness of the problem of image manipulation among all stakeholders in the publication process and even the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increased awareness has led to some reassuring actions by various stakeholders, but more is needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">No one disputes the value of the goal of preventing manipulated images from getting into the published literature, but there is <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2024/03/28/putting-research-integrity-checks-where-they-belong/">considerable debate</a> over who should be responsible for screening and at what stage of the research process.&nbsp; In my opinion, all stakeholders should be screening data and evaluating data anomalies─in grant applications (funders), before manuscript submission (researchers and institutions), and during manuscript review (publishers). This is like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/health/coronavirus-swiss-cheese-infection-mackay.html">Swiss cheese model of prevention</a> that we became familiar with during the COVID pandemic. There will be holes in the checks at every stage, but, with more stages, more holes will be filled.</p>



<p>The goal of preventing falsified image data from reaching the published literature should be an end in and of itself, but additional benefits to all stakeholders include the savings in time, reputation, and money from dealing with fewer allegations of image manipulation.</p>



<p>Anecdotally, the availability of algorithms has led many more publishers to systematically screen images before publication.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as far as I know, no-one is tracking that number.&nbsp; For those who had previously done no screening at all, this is an improvement, and, overall, this reflects a sea change toward achieving the goal of detection before publication.&nbsp; However, some publishers have <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn7530">downgraded</a> from visual screening to algorithmic screening.&nbsp; Ideally, they would continue their visual screening and use the algorithm as an additional check.</p>



<p>Nearly five years ago, Alison Abbott wrote a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03529-w">feature article in <em>Nature</em></a> describing three European institutions that were using algorithms to screen all manuscripts produced by their staff for evidence of image manipulation before submission to a journal.&nbsp; I believe that the thousands of other research institutions around the world should do the same.&nbsp; If institutions are concerned about imposing screening on their staff, they could at least offer this as a service to those who want it.&nbsp; Institutions should also consider screening the publications of job candidates before hiring them.</p>



<p>Anecdotally, many institutions have established mechanisms to be notified about allegations made on PubPeer and social media (such as subscribing to the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/institutions">PubPeer “Dashboard”</a>), but this effort is reactive.&nbsp; Institutions must switch their footing from a reactive stance to a proactive stance to try to prevent image manipulation from happening in the first place, and, if it does happen, to prevent manipulated images from getting submitted to a journal.&nbsp; Again, these goals should be ends in and of themselves, but they will also help to preserve the reputation of the institution and keep the grant money flowing in.</p>



<p>We cannot overlook a root cause of the image manipulation problem: the institutionalized culture of publish or perish caused, in part, by the criteria used by institutions for hiring and promotion.&nbsp; A lot of ink has been spilled over the past dozen years or so discussing the need to change the incentive structure in biomedical research to reduce the pressure on individual researchers to publish positive results.&nbsp; I will not reiterate the arguments here, except to say that, as one of the <a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/innovator/dora/">founders of the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in 2012</a>, I wholeheartedly support these efforts.&nbsp; But progress in this direction is <a href="https://undark.org/2022/06/16/why-wont-academia-let-go-of-publish-or-perish/">disappointingly slow</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers know that they can get just about anything published these days.&nbsp; Under the current pay-to-publish model, there will always be publishers that game the system and publish any submission without concern for the integrity of the data.</p>



<p>But researchers also know that they cannot get just about anything funded.&nbsp; Funders could help to dis-incentivize image manipulation if they screened the applicants’ publications that are cited in a grant application.&nbsp; I am not aware of any funder that does this, and this is truly a missed opportunity to avoid funding research based on fraudulent data and feeding a vicious cycle.</p>



<p>In a promising development, the recent funding for the NIH came with an <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/congress-pushes-nih-review-reproducibility-and-near-misses">admonishment</a> from the US Congress to “proactively look for signs of academic fraud.”&nbsp; As far as I know, the NIH has not yet responded with any indication of how they will do this, but a simple approach would be to screen the PI’s cited publications in a grant application or progress report before approving it.</p>



<p>Some institutions have <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/27/broad-boston-childrens-plagiarism-detection-tools/">offered access to algorithms to their staff</a>, relying on the PIs to use them to screen individual manuscripts before submission to a journal.&nbsp; This, in my opinion, is an inappropriate work-around being offered to PIs, who should directly compare all of the data in figures prepared for a manuscript to the source data from the lab (or at least delegate this responsibility to a trusted and trained lab member or even to a core facility provided by the institution).&nbsp; This expectation needs to be codified in institutional policy.</p>



<p>Given the scale of the problem, PIs must come to terms with the possibility that image manipulation might happen in their labs.&nbsp; They also need to accept the possibility that what they’re seeing in PowerPoint presentations in lab meetings may have already been manipulated.</p>



<p>Crucial to the recommendation to compare prepared figures to source data is an understanding of what constitutes source data.&nbsp; They are not the composed, assembled display of multiple image panels in a PowerPoint file.&nbsp; They are the actual files obtained through the research process, unaltered post-acquisition.&nbsp; In the case of image data, they are the proprietary files produced by the imaging system (or the actual pieces of X-ray film, if you’re an old school autoradiography person).</p>



<p>I acknowledge that the software that drives gel documentation systems and microscopes has image-processing capabilities.&nbsp; Thus, images may have been altered before they were ever saved in the proprietary file type, and comparison to the published image would not reveal the alteration.&nbsp; But if there are any suspicions that an image in a proprietary file type has been altered post-acquisition, those changes should be present in the file metadata.</p>



<p>The only sure way to dispel an accusation of image manipulation in a published article is for the accused researcher to provide the source data for comparison.&nbsp; Too often in institutional investigations, researchers claim that they don’t have the source data because their institution did not mandate the retention of those data for more than a few years.&nbsp; That needs to change.</p>



<p>Data storage is now much cheaper than it was 20 years ago—disk storage is now <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/historical-cost-of-computer-memory-and-storage">~100-fold cheaper</a> than it was then.&nbsp; Institutions should mandate that the data underlying a published article be retained in perpetuity (at least for the actual data presented in the article) and provide the data storage and structure necessary to do so.</p>



<p>I am not talking about the multiple terabytes required to store the thousands of images in an imaging screen or the hundreds of whole slide images (WSI) that were reviewed for a study.&nbsp; I’m talking about the few megabytes (or gigabytes for WSI) needed to store the few images from that screen or study that were shown in the article.</p>



<p>The only publisher that <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/image-integrity">mentions the concept</a> of retaining data in perpetuity is Springer Nature for the Nature Portfolio of journals.&nbsp; They state that “We recommend retaining unprocessed data and metadata files after publication, ideally archiving data in perpetuity.”&nbsp; This needs to be changed to a requirement by all journals, to begin to force institutions to do the right thing with the data underlying a publication and retain it in perpetuity.</p>



<p>There are numerous precedents (many of them <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/25/jama-journal-retracts-paper-when-author-cant-produce-original-data/">cited on Retraction Watch</a>) for retractions predicated on the inability of authors to provide source data.&nbsp; Institutions will be protecting their PIs from this eventuality by requiring them to retain these data in perpetuity.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Considerable progress has been made in addressing the issue of image manipulation over the past 20 years, but challenges remain.<strong> </strong>Paper mills are a growing and dire problem for publishers and the integrity of the published literature.&nbsp; These are companies that produce wholly fabricated research papers (often duplicating images from previously published papers or fabricating them using generative AI, as discussed below).&nbsp; The companies get the papers accepted for publication in a journal and then sell authorships on those papers.&nbsp; The higher the impact factor of the journal, the higher the cost of authorship.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One study by a major publisher used software to screen manuscripts for hallmarks of paper mill production and found that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/14/up-to-one-in-seven-of-submissions-to-hundreds-of-wiley-journals-show-signs-of-paper-mill-activity/">10 to 13% of its submissions were from a paper mill</a>.&nbsp; I refer the reader to some recent <a href="https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2023/11/defence-against-dark-arts-proposal-for.html">commentaries</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5">news articles</a> on paper mills for more information.</p>



<p>The use of generative artificial intelligence exploded with the release of Chat GPT in November 2022.&nbsp; Even before then, however, computer scientists were working on machine learning frameworks for generating images, and some have applied those technologies to image types relevant to biomedical research (specifically Western blots).</p>



<p>In early 2021, Qi, Zhang, and Luo posted a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.395319">preprint</a> describing the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce synthetic Western blot images that strongly resembled authentic blots.&nbsp; In 2022, Wang and colleagues published an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2022.100509">opinion piece</a> in the journal <em>Patterns</em> in which they demonstrated the synthesis of both Western blot images and medical photographs using a GAN.&nbsp; Also in 2022, Ed Delp from Purdue University and his colleagues used a variety of generative models to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3179116">produce a library of 24,000 synthetic Western blots</a>.&nbsp; They applied various types of detectors to this data set, the best of which reportedly was able to detect synthetic blots with 90% accuracy.</p>



<p>More recently, one of the authors of that paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24954600">took the detection of synthetic Western blots a step further</a> and reported that he and his colleagues could detect the particular AI model that was used to produce a synthetic Western blot.</p>



<p>We are in the dark about how bad the problem of generative AI already is in biomedical publications.&nbsp; The only thing we can say for certain is that it will get worse, with the now-widespread access to AI models for generating images and the difficulty of detecting them visually.&nbsp; The old hallmarks of visual inspection do not apply.</p>



<p>The development of algorithms for detecting images produced by generative AI is promising, and the near-term opportunities include independently verifying their effectiveness, using them to document the current extent of the problem, commercializing them, and implementing their use among all stakeholders in the publication process.</p>



<p>While journals and institutions are still working through the massive backlog of cases of image manipulation perpetrated using old image-processing techniques, generative AI is currently creating the new front in the battle against image manipulation.&nbsp; I had hoped I would be forced into retirement by the end of image manipulation in the published literature, but it looks like I might be forced into retirement by generative AI that is impossible to detect visually.</p>



<p>Twenty years ago, people were either unaware of the problem of image manipulation in the biomedical literature, or they thought the problem was so minor that they didn’t have to deal with it.&nbsp; Today, it would be difficult to claim to be unaware of the extent of the problem.&nbsp; Twenty years ago it was mostly a one-sided arms race &#8211; images were being manipulated, but very few people were doing anything about it.&nbsp; </p>



<p>We may still be losing the arms race, but now at least it’s two-sided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In 2023, arXiv had its very first Accessibility Forum to help center accessibility issues in the open research and scientific communities. This inaugural Forum gathered accessibility experts and researchers with disabilities from across the globe to discuss potential solutions and barriers to access in science, with the goal of making accessible research papers a reality.</p>
<p>arXiv’s Accessibility Forum 2023 was a successful first step on a long journey – there is still work to be done to make sure that science and research are open and accessible to all.</p>
<p>Which means . . . it’s time for arXiv’s second-ever Accessibility Forum! Coming this September, get ready for arXiv Accessibility Forum 2024: Converging on Accessible Science Together. This Forum is free, entirely virtual, and open to all.</p>
<p>The arXiv Accessibility Forum 2024 begins on September 3<sup>rd</sup> and is composed of seven unique sessions, including a keynote, that cover a range of accessibility topics across many different scientific fields. Sessions will be about 1-2 hours long and will take place on different days over a period of two weeks &#8211; Forum attendees can choose to sign up for one, a few, or all of these sessions, as their interest and schedule allow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accessibility2024.arxiv.org/schedule">full schedule for the Forum</a> is posted on our <a href="https://accessibility2024.arxiv.org/index.html">arXiv Accessibility Forum 2024 website</a>, where you can learn more about <a href="https://accessibility2024.arxiv.org/presenters">our presenters</a>, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYBgeITZhL4&amp;list=PLYgeAMJvRZ6ZRuNQGoekx0FdjXqEG0bzM">welcome and technical videos</a>, <a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bBqisDGVGcrzQeq">send questions</a> to presenters to cover in their live sessions, or even <a href="https://accessibility2024.arxiv.org/volunteer">sign up to volunteer</a> with the Forum!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sneak peek at the schedule:</p>
<p>Week 1:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask Me Anything | </strong>Tuesday, September 3rd</li>
<li><strong>AI and Accessibility</strong> | Wednesday, September 4th</li>
<li><strong>Deaf Hub at RIT</strong> |Friday, September 6th</li>
</ul>
<p>Week 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sonification</strong> | Tuesday, September 10th</li>
<li><strong>SciELO</strong> | Wednesday, September 11th</li>
<li><strong>HTML Papers on arXiv</strong> | Thursday, September 12th</li>
<li><strong>Keynote: Universal Designs</strong> | Friday, September 13th</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to accessibility in research – that’s why it’s important for our community to join together, learn about barriers to access, and let our voices be heard when it comes to accessibility for all.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in one (or all!) of arXiv’s Accessibility Forum sessions, you can sign up for the 2024 Forum (as well as scheduling updates and post-event recordings) <a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eEZ1d27LF2fVM7Y">here.</a></p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129787" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2-300x300.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2-150x150.png 150w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2.png 561w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Laura Schaefer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On a Friday in July, Laura Schaefer Googled herself to find her <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID researcher ID</a> for a paper submission. </p>



<p>To her surprise, a paper popped up with her name in a journal she’d never published in. Her surprise quickly turned to concern – had someone copied one of her articles?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As she searched the site where the work appeared, she found more articles with her name, covering subjects she had never written about and with co-authors she didn’t know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[I] became angrier the more I found, and also started feeling really violated that someone had used my name and title to put forward something that wasn’t scientifically rigorous,” <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/laura-schaefer">Schaefer</a>, a professor of mechanical engineering at Rice University in Houston, said.</p>



<span id="more-129786"></span>



<p>Schaefer found a total of four papers bearing her name, on topics far from her expertise such as agriculture and waste disposal. The articles appeared in the <em>Journal of Robotics Spectrum</em>, <em>Journal of Machine and Computing</em> and <em>Journal of Computing and Natural Science</em>, all titles belonging to a publisher in Kenya called AnaPub. None of the journals is indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>According to their website, <a href="https://anapub.co.ke/index.html">AnaPub</a> is a “globally active publisher” with a mission to provide opportunities for authors to “publish their high-quality articles on the world [sic] best platform.” In July, Schaefer wrote to Emmanuel Sikuku Ogutu, AnaPub’s managing editor, asking him to remove the four papers attributed to her and linked to her Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ogutu apologised for incorrectly linking to her ID, but said his team had “successfully verified the authorship” of “Mr. Laura Schaefer,” who was “a past alumnus [sic] of Rice University.”</p>



<p>Schaefer promptly responded that she knew for a fact, as former department chair of Mechanical Engineering at Rice, there had never been another student with her name in the Mechanical Engineering Department or within the entire School of Engineering.</p>



<p>Lawyers for Rice also contacted a former student with a relatively similar name, Lauren Schaefer DiGloria, who confirmed she never authored any papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In emails seen by Retraction Watch, Rice’s lawyers demanded AnaPub remove the publications immediately and threatened a lawsuit for fraud. In a response on July 29, Ogutu said AnaPub has given “Mr. Laura Schaefer” 60 days to verify their identity. Schaefer and her team at Rice have not heard from Ogutu or anyone at AnaPub since. AnaPub also did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p><a href="https://css.umich.edu/people/university-affiliates/arvind-atreya">Arvind Atreya</a>, Schaefer’s supposed co-author on two of the papers, is also listed as a faculty member at Rice. Atreya is in fact a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He confirmed he did not write the papers, either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The articles list email addresses for Atreya and Schaefer at Rice’s domain that bounced back when we attempted to contact them. Another address listed for Schaefer at “hotmail.com” didn’t bounce, but no one replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schaefer has her doubts whether other authors named on papers on AnaPub’s website are truly connected with the work. They are “all people from very well-respected institutions,” she said. All four papers remain on AnaPub’s website credited to Laura Schaefer.</p>



<p>We’ve previously covered other cases of forged authorship on papers that appeared to have been plagiarized. One of the papers, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">falsely attributed to Anca Turcu</a> of the University of Central Florida, has been taken down, but the other, naming <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/">Steffen Barra</a> of the University of Saarland in Germany, is <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/introducing-the-complexities-of-forensic-psychology-decoding-the-mind-behind-the-crime.pdf">still online</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Fran Hardyman reviews </strong><em><strong>Being You: A new science of consciousness</strong></em><strong>, a bestselling book of the renown author, Anil Seth. Seth discusses the subjectivity of human experience and attempts to explain consciousness.</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What does it mean to be conscious? For Anil Seth, Professor of Neuroscience and co-Director of the Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science, it means there exists “something it is like to be you”. It is fundamentally subjective and, as any scientist knows, subjectivity is a difficult starting point for experimentation and understanding. So, how can we ever attempt to explain the physical basis of the experience we call consciousness?</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This is at the root of the so-called ‘hard problem’, as defined by David Chalmers in 1995 (</span></span><u><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/CHAFUT" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a></span></span></u><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">): why and how are the physical processes of the brain accompanied by subjective experience? Seth tackles this seemingly insurmountable question by focusing on the separate, but related, ‘real problem’ of consciousness: trying to “explain, predict, and control the phenomenological properties of conscious experience” (p22, Being You). He broadly defines these properties as conscious level (on a scale from coma, sleep, and drowsiness to alertness, and even the hyper-awareness during psychedelic use), content (sensory experience), self-awareness and free will. With this structure, he keeps the focus of the book on what can be understood through theory and experimentation, and encourages us to trust that the resulting data will provide a framework for an improved understanding of more existential questions.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Seth compares the field, as it stands now, to the study of life a few centuries ago. He argues that both ‘life’ and ‘consciousness’ refer to emergent properties that arise from varying combinations of stacked biological processes which can be examined and understood individually. He draws the contrast between this type of phenomenon and the kind modelled by temperature, which derives ultimately from a single physical feature (molecular vibration) and can be quantified by a single measure. This temperature-like approach is characteristic of integrated information theory (IIT), one of the leading current theories of consciousness, and one that Seth discusses thoroughly. It holds that integrated information itself, to a high enough degree, produces conscious experience, and that the amount of consciousness can be measured with a single unit: phi. Seth ultimately does not fully subscribe to IIT, but he does not shy away from engaging with its ‘weirder’ aspects, including the implication of panpsychism, wherein the entire fabric of the universe thrums with a background low-level consciousness, with humans, animals, and other complex systems ‘hotspots’ with high phi. What is ‘weird’ is not necessarily false, as, he reminds us, has been proven repeatedly in the last century of physics. There is no reason to expect that the ultimate explanation of consciousness will make intuitive sense.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Seth’s preferred theory of consciousness, however, centres on predictive processing; a mechanistic theory often associated with IIT as a means of integrating information. It suggests that the brain is, at its core, a ‘prediction machine’, that generates models of the world around us and ‘expectations’ of the conditions inside the body, then compares sensory inputs against these. This shifts the common conception of sensory processing from bottom-up ‘reading’ of the world to top-down interpretation of it. Thus our lived experience is a “controlled hallucination” that we design and inhabit. In order to minimise prediction errors, between our internal models and the input they receive, we often engage in ‘active inference’: homeostatic control inside the body, or action in the world, to provide the sensory signals the brain’s predictive models ‘expect’. In this way, predictions can produce phenomenological experience and a conception of the self, he argues.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Overall, this book maintained an excellent balance of science and entertainment, not shying away from the weird and the ethically complex, including panpsychism, animal consciousness, and AI, while also maintaining a hard focus on the known and knowable. Seth made a clear and convincing case for his ‘real problem’ framework for conceptualising consciousness, supported by engaging writing that made his deep expertise and thoughtfulness apparent throughout. This book came at an exciting time for consciousness science, with an advent of adversarial collaboration studies and newfound respect for the field more broadly. I certainly got a lot out of it, and I think most readers could too!</span></span></p>
