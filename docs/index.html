                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bmj_stem-cell.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bmj_stem-cell-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-133290" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bmj_stem-cell-1024x576.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bmj_stem-cell-300x169.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bmj_stem-cell-768x432.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bmj_stem-cell.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>A week after <em>The BMJ</em> published a highly publicized paper claiming stem cell therapy can reduce the risk of heart failure, sleuths have unearthed what they are calling “serious” inconsistencies in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper claims the phase III clinical trial <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2024-083382">published October 29</a> included over 400 patients in Shiraz, Iran, and tested whether stem cell therapy lowers the risk of heart failure after a heart attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results were celebrated in a <a href="https://bmjgroup.com/stem-cell-therapy-linked-to-lower-risk-of-heart-failure-after-a-heart-attack/">press release</a> by the journal and appeared in several news outlets, with <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2502081-stem-cell-therapy-lowers-risk-of-heart-failure-after-a-heart-attack/"><em>New Scientist</em></a><em> </em>calling the study the “strongest evidence yet that stem cells can help the heart repair itself.”</p>



<span id="more-133289"></span>



<p>Almost immediately after the paper was published, sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/24/improving-reproducibility-what-can-funders-do-guest-post-by-dorothy-bishop/">Dorothy Bishop</a> started noting inconsistencies with the data on PubPeer. Specifically, as she wrote in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C08779C45DB6E407DFAC85583BE9C4#1">one comment</a>, the study claimed to have enrolled only patients under 65 years old. However, in the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_b_PREVENT-TAHA8_study_Dataset_Prevention_of_Acute_Myocardial_Infarction-Induced_Heart_Failure_by_Intracoronary_Infusion_of_Mesenchymal_Stem_Cells_A_Phase_III_Randomized_Clinical_Trial_b_/29375153/2?file=55664687">accompanying data</a>, 127 of the patients were older than 65 — a “complete mismatch,” she told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Bishop, who is also a professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University, told Retraction Watch the age discrepancies alone should constitute a retraction, but after her observation, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C08779C45DB6E407DFAC85583BE9C4#1">other sleuths</a> started finding yet more issues with the data.</p>



<p>Nick Brown, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/28/hundreds-hours-work-vindicated-critic-food-researcher-reacts-new-retraction/">psychologist and sleuth</a>, discovered a “curious repeating pattern of records in the dataset,” where every 101 records, almost all the values were identical, he wrote on PubPeer. Bishop speculated it was “as if somebody’s just cutting and pasting to full up a column.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost all the patient’s weights — 288 of 334 reported cases — were integers, and multiples of five kilograms were “heavily over-represented,” Brown wrote in another PubPeer comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the data issues may have been flagged during peer review, but the sequence of events outlined in the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2024-083382/peer-review">reports</a> suggest the authors didn’t share the data until after review, Bishop said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/attachments/bmj-article/pre-pub-history/30-jan-2025_decision_letter.pdf">first decision</a>, shared with the authors on January 30, clinical editor Juan Franco said the journal had “serious concerns regarding the reporting and data sharing.” The authors <a href="https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/attachments/bmj-article/pre-pub-history/14_apr_2025_response_to_reviewers.pdf">said they uploaded the data</a>, but <a href="https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/attachments/bmj-article/pre-pub-history/27_jun_2025_response_to_reviewers_1.pdf">one of the reviewers</a> noted it was uploaded as a private file for editors only. Only after its final peer review did the authors upload the data <a href="https://authors.bmj.com/policies/data-sharing/">in accordance with <em>The BMJ’s </em>policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bishop also noted a potential undisclosed conflict of interest for author <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/mathuranthony.html">Anthony Mathur</a>, a researcher at Queen Mary University of London. Mathur is a <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10282577/officers">shareholder</a> and trustee of the Heart Cells Foundation, a charity that funds <a href="https://www.heartcellsfoundation.com/compassionate-centre/">a unit </a>for administering stem cell therapies to cardiac patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brown, Bishop and others flagged several other issues with the paper, including a “discrepancy” between the number of subjects enrolled (420) and those disclosed during the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05043610">trial registration</a> (360).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mathur acknowledged our request for comment but redirected us to the corresponding author, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/armin-attar-26ba11173/?originalSubdomain=ir">Armin Attar</a>, a professor at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attar has responded to critics on PubPeer by stating: “During an internal audit, we have noticed some inconsistencies in the baseline demographic data.” He also wrote the authors were conducting a review “expected to take approximately two to three weeks.” Attar did not respond to our request for comment via email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for whether the data were intentionally manipulated, Brown told us he believed it was “impossible that these discrepancies could have occurred by chance.” He also said the article “needs to be retracted urgently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emma Dickinson, head of media relations at <em>The BMJ</em>, responded to our request for comment: “We have noted the concerns. <em>The BMJ</em> takes allegations of data discrepancies seriously.”</p>



<p>Two of the 10 authors had affiliations with Queen Mary University of London. Seven of the remaining researchers are based in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.</p>



<p>Five of Attar’s <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Armin+Attar%22">other papers</a> have been flagged on PubPeer for image duplication and data issues, including some comments in the past week following the publication of this latest paper. None of the authors have had a paper retracted, according to our database.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/negar-azarpira-8b1a9b3b/?originalSubdomain=ir">Negar Azarpira</a>, the last author on the article and a professor at Shiraz University, has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Negar+Azarpira%22">36 papers flagged on PubPeer</a> for image and data concerns, all but four of which were flagged before <em>The BMJ</em> paper was published.</p>



<p>The cardiac stem cell field has faced controversy in the past. In 2018, Harvard and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/14/harvard-brigham-retractions-stem-cell/">requested the retraction</a> of more than 30 papers from the lab of Piero Anversa for falsified data. Many of those papers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/13/anversa-cardiac-stem-cell-lab-earns-13-retractions/">were later retracted</a>. The National Institutes of Health <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-hearts-stem-cells/">continues to fund work</a> in the field.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arXiv team is making more improvements to the arXiv submission process. To learn more about recent improvements, you can read our </span><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/09/10/attention-authors-submission-1-5-and-other-updates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submission 1.5 blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/09/10/tex-live-2025-on-arxiv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeX 2025 Live blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting this week, authors will notice three updates when submitting work to arXiv:</span><b></b></p>
<p><b>Processing .bib into .bbl files</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This update has been implemented to make uploading bibliographies easier for authors. From now on, it will not be necessary to upload precompiled bibliographies (the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.bbl</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> files), but instead upload the bibliography database files (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.bib</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> files instead), and our system will call the necessary programs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Adding support for XeLaTeX</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an update that has been asked for often from arXiv authors. XeLaTeX allows full Unicode support as well as using TrueType and OpenType fonts, as well as OpenType Math Fonts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Adding support for PDF(e)TeX</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">This update is for arXiv users who write in “plain TeX” code and use PDF figures. Until now, plain TeX (that is, not LaTeX) documents were always processed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dvi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and from there to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pdf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, similar to the L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aTeX</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> option. With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PDF(e)TeX</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enabled, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pdf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> files are directly generated from the TeX source, similar to what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pdflatex</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does for LaTeX documents.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more in depth information on these updates and how they may affect your submission process, see </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit_tex.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our help pages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv continually assesses and re-examines our submission and (La)TeX processing, and more upgrades are on the way! We are currently in the process of considering support for LuaTeX based submissions. Be on the lookout for future updates as we add support for more TeX processing, which we’ll announce here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope these changes will make for a better author experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have questions or issues with your submission, be sure to first check </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit_tex.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our help pages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for known issues or troubleshooting tips. You can also </span><a href="https://arxiv-org.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">submit a help ticket</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more support, or leave a comment below if you have suggestions for improving the arXiv submission process.</span></p>

                <p>Note: PLOS issued the following press release in December, 2023.</p>



<p><strong>Halle/Saale, Germany, and San Francisco, United States</strong> &ndash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and the Global Young Academy (GYA), an international academy based in Halle, Germany, today announced that they will collaborate with one another to increase the awareness of Open Science, its principles, and its implementation into research practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Global Young Academy is an international academy of young scientists, which aims to give a voice to young scientists across the globe. The GYA develops, connects, mobilizes and empowers young researchers to lead international, interdisciplinary and intergenerational dialogue. Much of the work of the GYA occurs within member-organized working groups, one of which is the Open Science working group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;GYA&rsquo;s Open Science working group strives to raise awareness of Open Science principles and approaches among young scientists and to provide input into Open Science policies from a diverse, international perspective,&rdquo; said Tasha Gownaris, GYA Open Science Working Group Co-Lead. &ldquo;We are excited about the work that PLOS is doing and are looking forward to closely collaborating on initiatives to make science more effective, equitable, and accessible.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This strategic partnership with the Global Young Academy will ensure that early-career researchers can inform and help to shape PLOS&rsquo; continuing efforts to increase equitable participation in Open Science,&rdquo; said Roheena Anand, Executive Director of Global Publishing Development, PLOS. &ldquo;The GYA&rsquo;s input will be fundamental to ensuring that our Open Science solutions will serve the needs of early career researchers across the globe.&rdquo;</p>



<p>PLOS and the GYA are invested in an Open future and want to work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem to promote and increase uptake of Open Access and Open Science more broadly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In April 2019, Daejung Kim, then a Ph.D. student at the University of Melbourne in Australia, found a draft manuscript on the desk of a postdoc in the same laboratory. The manuscript included the experimental results on metal alloys he had spent months collecting. Kim hadn’t been told about the paper, nor had anyone asked his permission to use the data. The findings were central to Kim’s Ph.D. thesis and publishing them would mean the data were no longer original.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was shaking in the lab,” he recalled recently. “When I saw it, I couldn’t stop myself. I didn’t know what to do.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kim took his concerns to his supervisor, Kenong Xia, a materials scientist and head of the lab, asking for his help to resolve the issue. He wanted to be credited as a coauthor on any papers using his results. He also emailed the postdoc, Ahmad Zafari, asking to see a draft of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133262"></span>



<p>But when these efforts to resolve the dispute were unsuccessful, Kim filed a formal complaint with the University of Melbourne’s research integrity office. Six months later, in January 2020, the university launched an investigation, and meanwhile, Xia and Zafari published two papers containing Kim’s results. The articles acknowledge Kim, but not as a coauthor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Kim, the investigation was just the start of a long effort to reclaim ownership of his work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Documents reviewed by Retraction Watch show an investigation panel engaged by the university found a “cultural problem” inside Xia’s lab and research violations of Australia’s code of integrity related to the use of the grad student’s work. But it also found that Kim didn’t qualify for authorship on the manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Xia and Zafari were barred from receiving grants from the Australian Research Council for two years. Since the early 2000s, Xia has received more than AU$900,000 (US$593,000) from the ARC, <a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/15008-kenong-xia">among other grants</a>, including for defense-related research. Xia remains at the University of Melbourne despite the panel’s findings of research misconduct that is “wilful and representative of an ongoing pattern.”</p>



<p>A subsequent review by the Australian Research Integrity Committee found flaws in how the university handled the case — including not protecting Kim’s interests, withholding the report, and not investigating additional allegations. Forced to change labs, Kim lost a scholarship and a job offer, and had to repay about AU$90,000 (US$58,400) to his sponsor in South Korea. The university has since offered Kim AU$15,000 (US$9,750) after he sought compensation for the financial losses and time spent doing the experimental work — although without admitting culpability.</p>



<p>Kim declined the funds, continuing to push for his data and his name to be removed from the published papers, and compensation for what he lost, which includes his intellectual property, a job opportunity, and the time he lost to changing his research topic to start his Ph.D. project over again. “I lost almost two years of my life,” he told us. “I feel that they don’t want to waste their time on my case.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Kim’s efforts to correct the papers containing his work has led to their retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One paper, published in <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S092150932030650X"><em>Materials Science &amp; Engineering: A</em></a> in May 2020, was retracted in November 2024, three years after Kim asked the editor to remove his data and name from the acknowledgements. Before the retraction, Mark Hargreaves, the University of Melbourne’s then-deputy vice-chancellor for research, urged Kim to provide retrospective permission instead, saying a retraction would “represent another sanction of Xia and Zafari … and have implications for the other authors,” he wrote in correspondence we have seen. The editors eventually pulled the article for using data without the copyright owner’s approval. Neither Xia, Zafari nor the other authors agreed with the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the other article, published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359646219304397"><em>Scripta Materialia</em></a><em> </em>in August 2019, Kim requested in 2022 and again in 2024 his data and name be removed. But the editor cited the university’s&nbsp; investigation, saying it didn’t recommend a retraction, only a correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That stance has changed. After we asked the journal on October 14 about their decision not to retract, Kim received an update on October 16 from <em>Scripta Materialia</em> telling him that following an ethics review, the journal&nbsp; decided to retract the article for using Kim’s data without permission, a decision Kim called “overdue and incomplete.” The retraction did not address his concerns about the accuracy and repeatability of some of the results, he pointed out. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359646219304397">According to the notice</a>, both Xia and Zafari have agreed to the retraction.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In Kim’s complaint to the University of Melbourne’s research integrity office in July 2019, he reported that Xia and Zafari had breached the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research. His first allegation was that they had used his experimental work without appropriate attribution. According to a copy of the panel’s report we have seen, investigators agreed Kim’s data had been used in both papers, which “clearly cut across future opportunities” for Kim to publish data from his Ph.D.&nbsp; But they found he didn’t technically qualify for authorship because he hadn’t contributed “beyond provision of primary data,” the documents state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Melbourne’s investigation found Xia and Zafari had repeatedly breached Australia’s research integrity code by excluding Kim from discussions about the papers, using his data without consent, and misrepresenting parts of the methodology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigators also described a “broader cultural problem” inside Xia’s lab, where Xia and Zafari portrayed Kim as an “intellectual bystander” on the project. According to the report, Kim was “denied the opportunity” to contribute, even though the panel considered him capable of doing so. This culture meant the panel didn’t believe Kim ultimately qualified for authorship. Xia told the panel that “[Kim] wouldn’t understand the paper,” which the panel described as a “deliberate and intentional” exclusion, and evidence of a culture where “students are not considered major contributors early in their studies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In both papers, Kim’s name was listed in the acknowledgements without his consent, which the panel said breached the code’s fairness principle and authorship guide. Xia told investigators, “My understanding is that you do not need permission to thank people.” </p>



<p>The Australian Research Council barred Xia and Zafari from receiving&nbsp; grants for two years, and the university recommended a lab culture review and additional training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation also found that Kim’s Ph.D. project overlapped with the collaboration between Xia and Zafari. Kim’s formal milestone documents identified the alloy experiments as part of his Ph.D., giving him a “reasonable expectation” that the project was his to develop. Xia told the panel that “it was never the intention that this was [Kim’s] project,” even though he had approved Kim’s milestone review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation found that Xia’s actions constituted “wilful ignorance or wilful deviation from the code.” They were “particularly disturbed” by Xia’s attempts to justify his behavior as standard practice, warning it could lead to more serious misconduct. Zafari’s breaches were deemed comparatively minor but still “crossed the boundary of accepted practice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Xia remains in his position at the University of Melbourne. Zafari is listed as a researcher on the University of Twente’s website, in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Xia has not responded to requests for comment about these findings. Zafari’s legal representatives said: “Dr Zafari is a highly regarded researcher who has not been found by any university or comparable institution to have engaged in research misconduct.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter summarizing the findings, Hargreaves told Kim that, based on the panel’s findings and “on the balance of probabilities,” Xia “committed research misconduct,” and Zafari “committed serious breaches of the Code.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel also determined that there were inaccuracies in the methodology of the <em>Scripta Materialia </em>paper. The authors misrepresented the magnifications of some figures, and didn’t report the experimental conditions accurately. Zafari admitted to using “artistic licence” when preparing some figures, but the panel found this was done for convenience rather than to mislead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, they recommended an “urgent review of student supervisory practices” as well as additional training in Xia’s group, corrections to the methodological issues, and amendments to the acknowledgements to specify Kim’s contributions.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Because Kim was only given a summary letter of the findings, despite multiple requests, Kim said he couldn’t understand how the panel reached their conclusions and he believed their process was biased. So in March 2021, a few weeks after receiving the summary, Kim appealed the outcome.</p>



<p>He later took the matter to the Australian Research Integrity Committee (ARIC), which reviews how institutions handle breaches of the code. In its September 2023 report ARIC described “significant difficulty” obtaining information from the university and found Kim was “significantly disadvantaged” by the publication of papers containing his work — especially since, when he first raised his concerns, none of the papers had yet been published. The university’s six-month delay in launching the investigation after the complaint meant the data became increasingly accessible online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ARIC determined that the university “did not do enough to protect the interests of Dr Kim” and said pausing publication of the papers could have avoided some of the breaches.</p>



<p>It recommended the university to review its policy of withholding full reports and issue a formal apology to Kim for “the disadvantage he suffered as a result of Code breaches and poor research practice in the laboratory.” In December 2023, Hargreaves wrote to Kim apologizing for “any distress caused during the investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>ARIC declined to comment on whether it has since received any updates from the university about steps taken to address the systemic problems identified in its own investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Kim says the fallout from the case had consequences on his career. He lost a scholarship and associated job offer with a company in Korea after the delays to his Ph.D. and culture of the lab forced him to move to another lab. He was also required to repay two years’ worth of the scholarship back to the sponsor — amounting to about AU$90,000 (US$58,400).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the start of this year, Kim wrote to the University of Melbourne requesting compensation for the lost opportunity and the time he spent working on generating data he was ultimately unable to claim as his own. In a response we’ve reviewed, Ben Rubinstein, the deputy dean of research in the faculty of engineering and information technology, said there was no finding in the investigation that Kim should have been paid for the work, and there was no employment relationship between Kim and the university. Rubinstein stated the university couldn’t be held solely responsible for the termination of Kim’s job offer and scholarship contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the university offered $15,000 ($9,750) as an ex gratia payment — made out of a moral obligation rather than a legal requirement — without “any admission of liability” and “in full and final settlement of all claims” against the university, Rubinstein wrote. Accepting the payment would also require Kim to agree to confidentiality and non-disparagement terms, as well as releasing the university from any current or future claims related to his time as a Ph.D. student.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kim, now working as an engineer in South Korea, says he rejected the offer. “The university didn’t consider my request at all,” he told us. “I feel that my concerns haven’t been resolved at all.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement to Retraction Watch, a spokesperson for the University of Melbourne wrote: “The investigation identified that breaches of the Code occurred, and corrective actions were required of the respondent researchers. The University has taken responsive action. The graduate researcher was also provided with additional support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The University of Melbourne considers this matter concluded and will be making no further comment.”</p>

<p>A network of peer reviewers in Italy is targeting medical journals, threatening “both the scientific record and patient safety,” a team of researchers report. Without more transparency by journals, they say, most review mills will remain impossible to detect.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.20.25338343v1">preprint</a> posted on medRxiv on October 23, sleuths Dorothy Bishop, René Aquarius and Maria Ángeles Oviedo-García say they discovered the alleged review mill when they stumbled upon seemingly “boilerplate” comments in a peer review. This discovery led the trio to search for published peer reviews that shared similar terminology — work that ultimately identified 195 suspect reviews of 170 articles published between Feb. 6, 2019, and July 7, 2025. The researchers speculate the number of articles affected is likely higher given most journals do not publish their peer reviews.</p>



<p>The alleged mill is run by “well-established, Italian physicians in the fields of gynecology and oncology,” wrote the authors of the new study, which also noted the reviewers were refereeing papers with clinical implications, a pattern the authors called “alarming.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133281"></span>



<p>The hallmarks of a review mill are a “pattern of generic, vague, and repeated affirmations” in reviewer reports and the frequent use of “coercive citations” to push authors to cite the work of mill members, as Oviedo-García articulated in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-024-05125-w">paper last year</a>.</p>



<p>Of the 195 reviews the authors identified in the new study, 186 by apparent members of the mill suggested citing “at least one article which was co-authored by the reviewer or another member of the mill,” according to the preprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The preprint authors noted when they found a review containing a boilerplate comment, it “invariably” contained other text common across reviews, indicating “a level of co-ordination between reviewers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authors of 142 of the 170 identified papers included coercive citations recommended by the reviewers, suggesting the approach was highly effective in aiding the reviewers’ h-indices, Bishop’s group found. For 59 other papers reviewed as a control group, only four reviews recommended adding citations to the reviewers’ own work.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/24/improving-reproducibility-what-can-funders-do-guest-post-by-dorothy-bishop/">Bishop</a>, professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University, told us the reviewers her team identified “frequently publish together and during their careers they work or have worked together in the same institutions.” The research group decided not to name the reviewers in their preprint because journal editors can be “squeamish” about “naming and shaming,” she told us, which could affect the likelihood the preprint is published.</p>



<p>But the <a href="https://osf.io/k5acw/overview?view_only=4667f3c3b79a4566b38773f716ee967f">supplementary materials</a> do name 14 of the reviewers <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i6kteKzhZw96hPgQtPnO4UkSOMf_w_xdWxKoNFtf8J8/edit?usp=sharing">involved in the alleged mill</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One is <a href="https://www.istitutotumori.mi.it/en/staff/giorgio-bogani">Giorgio Bogani</a> of Sapienza University in Rome, who completed 24 of the suspect reviews and holds an editorial board position at <em>Minerva Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1543-2802">Antonio Simone Laganà</a> (Reviewer 9 in the preprint) of the University of Palermo, who completed five of the suspect reviews, won several awards for peer review in 2019, including top reviewer in biology and biochemistry and clinical medicine, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. He currently serves on the editorial board of at least 18 journals, according to the preprint authors.</p>



<p>Several of the named reviewers, including Laganà, <a href="https://www.ejog.org/article">had a paper retracted</a> from the <em>European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology</em> in August 2024 after sleuth Ben Mol flagged similarities with another paper <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/2D5350CA006EEC37E7CEED189BE3E0">on PubPeer</a>. The second paper, published in <em>Climacteric,</em> shares several of the same authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/scs/researchers/ben-mol">Mol</a>, who leads the Evidence-based Women’s Health Care Research Group in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Monash University in Australia, has worked to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/06/biologically-implausible-distributions-and-self-plagiarism-result-in-10-retractions-for-ob-gyn/">raise awareness</a> of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data/">problematic</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">data</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">informing</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/high-profile-ob-gyn-accused-of-duplicating-data-threatens-to-sue-critic/">medical</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/18/ob-gyn-who-called-criticism-racist-and-hate-speech-earns-retraction-several-expressions-of-concern/">recommendations</a> for women’s health care, and to <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.18100">cleanse the literature</a> of unreliable studies. (Mol <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/15/sleuth-loses-paper-for-duplicate-publication-after-flagging-hundreds-of-untrustworthy-articles/">had a paper retracted</a> recently for duplication.)</p>



<p>Reviews by the alleged review mill were in journals from several publishers, including MDPI, PLOS, BioMed Central and BMJ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Journals with editors who are part of a review mill make easier targets, because they can give other reviewers in their network easier access to papers, Bishop told us. That, she said, was the case for 20 of the papers identified as being of concern. Bishop also said “there are likely to be many other journals involved, but we don’t know about them because they don’t have open peer review.”</p>



<p>Bishop noted “this is a (rare) case where we don’t think the publishers can be blamed, because the review mills are under the radar. Also, it would be a shame if these journals were lambasted for having review mills when they are actually doing the right thing by making peer review open – and having names of handling editors and/or reviewers published is also very useful.”</p>



<p>The preprint authors contacted <em>PLOS One</em> — home to 36 of the papers of concern — with the results, Bishop said. “They are aware of the problem and confirmed that one of these reviewers who served as editor was removed prior to our analysis,” she said. Reviewers identified as numbers 7 and 9 (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-giannini-md-phd-910026150/?locale=en_US">Andrea Giannini</a> of Sapienza University in Rome and Laganà, respectively) have been editors of <em>PLOS One</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of the authors of the implicated papers seemed to be involved in the alleged network, Bishop said, speculating the goal was to increase the reviewers’ citation counts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How to approach affected papers is still a question Bishop and her team have for the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Should they get a separate status or should they be retracted? Should they get a second chance by inviting new peer-reviewers to do additional post-publication peer-review?”</p>



<p>Regardless, the preprint authors “recommend that publishers adopt open peer review, employ automated checks, and transparently report the editors responsible for handling papers, to make detection of review mills easier for the entire scientific community.”</p>

<p>More than three-fifths of the editorial board of a biomedical sciences journal resigned after the publication’s operations moved from Hong Kong to Shenzhen, China, and the editors and software team were fired with 30 days’ notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>GigaScience</em> is published in partnership between Oxford University Press and <a href="https://www.gigasciencepress.org/">GigaScience Press</a>, the publishing division of <a href="https://en.genomics.cn/">BGI</a>, a genomics company based in Shenzhen, according to their website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On October 29, <a href="https://bioinformatics.ca/people/all/bf-francis-ouellette/">B.F. Francis Ouellette</a>, a bioinformatics consultant, sent the resignation notice in an email addressed to Oxford University Press and the <a href="https://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/dr-xun-xu-has-been-appointed-as-editor-in-chief-of-gigascience/">new editor-in-chief</a> of the journal, Xun Xu. According to the email, which was signed by 30 of the journal’s 49 board members, those resigning became “increasingly concerned about the recent structural and editorial changes at <em>GigaScience </em>and how they may affect the journal’s long-standing commitment to publishing rigorously reviewed, reproducible research.”</p>



<span id="more-133249"></span>



<p>Those changes include a move from the long-standing Hong Kong-based editorial and data teams to Shenzhen, Ouellette wrote. The changes were made “without prior consultation or communication” with the editorial board, he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within an hour of the email, the signed names were removed from the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/pages/Editorial_Board">editorial board page</a> on the journal’s website. Xu, the executive editor and the three listed editors are all based in Shenzhen and are all affiliated with BGI. Xu is <a href="https://en.genomics.cn/team/info.aspx?itemid=1929">the chief scientist</a> for BGI Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal publishes “big data” research in the life and biomedical sciences. In <a href="https://www.open-bio.org/2025/09/30/2025-09-30-gigascience/">recent coverage</a>, the Open Bioinformatics Foundation said the journal was the “equivalent to establishing a full-fledged data center.” And in September, <em>GigaScience</em> <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/raising-the-standard-gigascience-press-on-metadata-and-discoverability/">won a Crossref metadata award</a>.</p>



<p>Hongling Zhou, the newly appointed executive editor at <em>GigaScience</em>, said the journal was “now in the process of reconstituting” the editorial board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ouellette said his primary concern wasn’t the move to Shenzhen, but that the former editors were fired with 30 days notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among those let go was the journal’s founding editor-in-chief, Scott Edmunds, who was with <em>GigaScience</em> for nearly 15 years. He gave a history of the journal and his time there in a <a href="https://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/and-its-goodbye-from-me/">blog post</a> published September 17, his last day at the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edmunds told us he received “generic and vague” messages from the human resources department at BGI, informing him the move was “due to strategic planning and operational optimization.”</p>



<p>Edmunds also said he feels optimistic about the future of the journal, noting the former editors “trained the Shenzhen team well.”</p>



<p>The journal is the latest to join our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">Mass Resignations List</a>, which documents walkouts and resignations at more than two dozen journals since 2023.</p>

<p>A molecular ecology researcher has lost two papers and received an expression of concern for a third after coauthors flagged data issues with the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All three papers appeared in <em>Molecular Ecology Resources</em> and describe the use of DNA methylation as an epigenetic clock to predict the age of different animals. The journal retracted two of the studies in July. The first, published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.13440">June 2021</a>, estimated ages for three threatened fish species. The second appeared in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.13621">April 2022</a> and proposes a clock for predicting the age of sea turtles. The articles have been cited 41 and 32 times, respectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The lead author on those two studies was Benjamin Mayne, formerly a researcher at Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), based in Canberra.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133237"></span>



<p>Ben Creagh, an executive manager at CSIRO, told us Mayne is no longer with the organization. CSIRO “is aware of potential issues relating to certain epigenetic aging technologies and is undertaking further inquiries into this matter,” Creagh added.</p>



<p>According to both <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.70018">retraction</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.70016">notices</a>, coauthor <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/simon-jarman-97db3638/">Simon Jarman</a>, a researcher at Curtin University in Perth, alerted the journal to results in a figure which “are inaccurate and do not represent a real relationship between age and DNA methylation.” Mayne agreed to both retractions, the notices say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A third paper in <em>Molecular Ecology Resources </em>with Mayne as a coauthor received an expression of concern on October 16. The July 2024 study, which has been cited three times, describes a technique for estimating the age of seabirds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice says lead author <a href="https://research.csiro.au/marinedebris/our-team/lauren-roman-2/">Lauren Roman</a> raised concerns “regarding potential inaccuracies in the data presented in the article” which “suggest the study may not be reproducible.” Roman is an affiliate of CSIRO and is a fellow at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. She acknowledged our email but declined to comment further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice also says the “institution is currently investigating the matter,” but Wiley, which publishes the journal, did not confirm which institution the notice refers to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creagh of CSIRO did not confirm whether the “further inquiries” included the expression of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2024 on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/south-australian-genomics-centre_we-are-thrilled-to-welcome-ben-mayne-to-the-activity-7214754668105617408-gLuh/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SA_genomics/status/1808284774660034976">X</a>, the South Australian Genomics Centre in Adelaide announced Mayne as the senior genomics research coordinator at its Flinders University center. Sen Wang, a manager at the center, told us Mayne left his position in January of this year. We have not been able to confirm his current affiliation. An email we sent to Mayne’s CSIRO email address bounced back.&nbsp;</p>
