<p>When measuring the properties of a particular material, you want to make sure your sample is as clean as possible. But sometimes a well-intentioned effort to purify can make things worse.</p>



<p>Just ask Lindsay Greer, a professor of materials science at the University of Cambridge. He and his colleagues discovered measurements they reported in 2022 were actually an artifact of a cleaning agent used to prepare their sample.</p>



<p>Greer became aware of the issue during unsuccessful attempts to replicate his lab’s discovery of magnetic properties in an alloy their collaborators had made. Instead, they found oxidation from a cleaning product had contaminated their original results. The error led to a retraction, a declined grant, a commentary describing their troubleshooting — and a story about science working as it should.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133031"></span>



<p>“I have given several scientific talks that included our retraction story,” Greer said of the paper, which was retracted in December 2024. “Audience reaction has been uniformly positive.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202416229">now-retracted paper</a>, published in 2022 in <em>Advanced Science</em>, described the unexpected discovery that a fabricated material had desirable magnetic properties, indicating the presence of an alloy called tetrataenite. Materials with these properties typically include rare-earth metals, which can be costly and environmentally damaging to obtain. The new material did not contain these elements, so it seemed like it “might be a long-sought route to high-performance magnets without rare-earth content,” Greer told us.</p>



<p>The findings the researchers reported “were entirely accidental,” Greer said. “We were looking for good mechanical properties, not good magnetic properties.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/182">News</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-24/researchers-find-possible-replacement-for-rare-earth-in-magnets">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.enterprise.cam.ac.uk/new-approach-to-cosmic-magnet-manufacturing-could-reduce-reliance-on-rare-earths-in-low-carbon-technologies/">press releases</a> touted the discovery of the alloy’s magnetic properties as a new way to make tetrataenite, dubbed a “cosmic magnet.” The group applied for a patent on the material and a grant from the European Union to fund their efforts to optimize its magnetic properties.</p>



<p>“While awaiting a decision on that funding,” Greer said, he had members of his lab who were not on the original paper test new, related materials. However, they found “absolutely no evidence” for the component of the material responsible for the magnetic properties. They tested a new batch of the original material made in a different lab and a sample from the original, and did not find this component in either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Greer told us once the lab was unable to replicate the original results with the original material, he contacted the journal to begin the retraction process, declined the EU grant funding, and stopped pursuing the patent on the material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further studies in Greer’s lab revealed what caused the original incorrect results — a surface oxide induced by a cleaning procedure, Greer told us. “Ironically, trying to use the best ‘cleaning’ of the sample had achieved the opposite!”</p>



<p>The original article has been cited 19 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including three citations since its retraction on Dec. 18, 2024. Greer does not have any other retracted papers.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes <em>Advanced Science</em>, told us, the “authors’ willingness to flag errors that potentially undermine their findings, as was the case here, in order to correct the record, is a healthy part of the research and publishing process.”</p>



<p>The researchers who discovered the contamination issue wrote a commentary describing their attempts to replicate the original findings. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202408796">The paper</a>, titled “Reinterpretation of report of tetrataenite in bulk alloy castings,” was published in <em>Advanced Science</em> around the same time as the retraction notice for the original paper.</p>

<p>The top editors of a criminology journal have stepped down after the society in charge of the publication assessed concerns about manuscript review times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The board of the American Society of Criminology decided “a change of leadership was required due to some ongoing operational issues with the <em>Criminology</em> journal,” according to an <a href="https://asc41.org/career-center/editor-positions/">announcement</a> on the society’s website. “We appreciate the contributions of the prior editors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kelly Vance, associate director of the society, said the organization had no further comment beyond the announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133026"></span>



<p>The previous editors, <a href="https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/volkan-topalli/">Volkan Topalli</a> of Georgia State University in Atlanta and Thomas Loughran of the University of South Florida in Tampa, started their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251002145218/https://asc41.org/about-asc/history-of-the-american-society-of-criminology/editors-of-asc-publications/">terms</a> last year and were due to continue until 2029. In an email to Retraction Watch, Topalli stated he and Loughran were not removed from their roles, but “stepped down.” They declined to comment further for this story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter addressed to <em>Criminology&#8217;s </em>editorial board obtained by Retraction Watch, Topalli, Loughran, and three other editors wrote they had decided to resign “due to an unworkable relationship with the current Executive Board.” </p>



<p>The former editors cited “fundamental differences” of opinion about how to run the journal, concerns about conflicts of interest and ethical issues, and “lack of honest and collegial communication” with the society’s board. They had submitted documentation of their concerns to other society committees, as well as the Committee on Publication Ethics, they wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Topalli confirmed the content of the letter and declined to comment further.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The society’s leadership has recently acknowledged concerns about review times at the journal. In the <a href="https://asc41.org/wp-content/uploads/ASC-Criminologist-2025-07.pdf">July/August 2025 issue</a> of <em>The Criminologist</em>, the American Society of Criminology’s newsletter, three members of the 2024 ethics committee published an article analyzing review times at the society’s two scholarly journals as reported to the organization’s leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between 2008 and 2022, the average review time for manuscripts at <em>Criminology</em> was 59 days, they reported. The single longest review time in the period was 185 days.</p>



<p>The average review time was not available for 2023. Instead, the authors reported median review times, which increased from 45 to 83 days from 2022 to 2023 for all articles, including desk rejections. For only articles sent for review, the authors found the median review time increased from 54 to 99 days in those years. The longest review time in 2023 was 388 days, for an article that received a desk rejection, they wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a response article published in the same issue, Topalli and Loughran described the journal’s editorial process in detail and acknowledged “longer than desirable wait times” in 2023, their first year editing the journal. They attributed the issue to implementing new processes, a larger-than-ever number of submissions, the difficulty of finding reviewers, and the need to conduct two “time-consuming” investigations of articles. They also noted Wiley, the publisher of the journal, went through a reorganization “which left us without a publisher contact for over a month.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Topalli and Loughran charged that the article on review times focused on “outliers” of “greatly delayed” reviews. They also made process changes since 2023, they said, after which review times for desk rejections “plummetted.” They presented data on review times for desk rejections in the first quarter of 2025 they said demonstrated a “far less problematic” performance than the original article indicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the first three months of 2025, the mean number of days for a decision was 40.8, and desk rejections took 5.9 days, on average, Topalli and Loughran wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A message at the end of the article and response read: “The ASC Executive Board has been aware of concerns raised about the review times for <em>Criminology</em>. In response, the Board assessed review times and, following a dialogue with the Editors of <em>Criminology</em>, is in the process of taking corrective steps.”</p>



<p>In a rejoinder published in the <a href="https://asc41.org/wp-content/uploads/ASC-Criminologist-2025-09.pdf">September/October issue</a> of <em>The Criminologist</em>, the first author of the article on review times, Justin Pickett of the State University of New York at Albany, defended the analysis and presented data from Wiley on the journal’s median review times from 2020 to 2024. In contradiction to the numbers the editors supplied, he wrote, the official statistics “did not improve meaningfully in 2024.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incentive systems that drive academic research underlie nearly every story we write: publication counts for promotion, pressure to produce positive results, hitting certain metrics, and so on. Critics have long <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1887">called for change in these systems</a>, but support for such change is hard to come by.</p>



<p>Several organizations are now putting more than $1 million toward reimagining hiring, promotion and tenure at U.S. universities. The program, called the<a href="https://www.ma3challenge.org/"> Modernizing Academic Appointment and Advancement (MA3) Challenge</a>, is seeking proposals for “bold, creative strategies to develop academic reward systems that foster a collaborative, responsive, and transparent research environment.”</p>



<p>Organized by the Open Research Community Accelerator (<a href="http://orcaopen.org/">ORCA</a>), the program will offer grants at two funding levels — $50,000 or $250,000 — over two years. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Dana Foundation, Rita Allen Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation have provided the funding, which totals $1.5 million.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133020"></span>



<p>To learn more about the program, we reached out to Greg Tananbaum, ORCA’s executive director, and Caitlin Schleicher, its director of community and partnerships. Their responses have been edited for clarity and brevity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Scientific research in this country is facing unprecedented pressures. How did the MA3 Challenge come into existence?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tananbaum:</strong> A consistent refrain – from rank-and-file scholars, department chairs, academic leaders, policymakers, and other interest holders – has been, “Nothing will really change until you tackle academic hiring and promotion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After many years and hundreds of consultations, it was clear to us that modernizing academic assessment and advancement was essential to enabling a more open, collaborative, inclusive, efficient, evidence-driven, and trustworthy research environment. So we began building a creative coalition to do just that. With backing from several philanthropies and in conjunction with the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Aspen Institute, we designed and launched the MA3 Challenge.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What are the specific issues within review, promotion and tenure systems that need critical attention?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tananbaum: </strong>Academic assessment and advancement systems at U.S. institutions often work against their own public missions. Instead of rewarding research that addresses real-world problems or broadens access, they still rely heavily on publications in brand-name journals, citation counts, and grant dollars. Community-engaged scholarship, though valuable, is usually dismissed as “service” and carries little weight in reviews.</p>



<p>This model disadvantages faculty who prioritize societal impact, mentorship, and a host of other values-based activities and outcomes. As a consequence, many researchers see this work as something of a career risk. To get hired, to get promoted, to get tenure, they need to adhere to a system that is significantly misaligned with their interests.</p>



<p>So it’s this dual misalignment – between institutional missions and credit/reward systems, and between why researchers get into this work in the first place and what it typically takes to move up the career ladder – that needs critical attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal is to catalyze a cultural shift within academic institutions toward fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and transparent research environment. If we want the activities that advance a more collaborative, responsive, and transparent research environment to propagate at scale, we need to reward them properly.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Lots of people – including us – have been talking about changing the incentive structure for decades, with minimal movement. How do you think this project could move the needle?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Schleicher: </strong>There are several reasons incentive structures tend to be slow to change. First, it’s often easier and less time-consuming for institutions to focus on traditional outputs and metrics. Second, many institutions and disciplines have long-standing norms around what counts as excellence and impact, which can be difficult to shift. Third, shared governance structures can make decision-making complex, and there’s often a ‘chicken-and-egg’ dynamic over who should lead reform: faculty, who hold the authority over academic standards, or administrators, who need to signal and support change. Finally, reforms must compete with other institutional priorities, which can slow momentum. Taken together, these factors create a challenging environment for changing incentive structures.</p>



<p>We’re hoping this funding opportunity will stimulate real reform in several ways. First, we require that awardees spend no more than 50% of their time and budget on planning activities, including research, surveys, and discussions. We are prioritizing implementation-forward activities that will result in explicit changes in academic hiring and review, promotion, and tenure policies and practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, funding will support dedicated capacity for individuals at the institution to take on this institutional change work. Next, the projects will have a relatively narrow two-year timeline. This will spur participating institutions to be rigorous and focused in their approaches, as well as begin to provide case studies for other institutions engaging in their own modernization efforts. Finally, ORCA will be overseeing a community of practice for the cohort of awardees in the spring. This community is designed to accelerate learning, troubleshoot barriers and ensure that emerging insights can be efficiently disseminated to one another the broader higher education community.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What sort of buy-in are you requiring from the institutions to ensure the proposals have support?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Schleicher: </strong>To be eligible for this opportunity, we have asked that institutions have their academic administrators – provosts, vice provosts, deans, and/or department chairs, depending on the tier for which they are applying – serve as the principal investigator. If a proposal does not include an administrator responsible for faculty success and advancement in the PI position, we ask that applicants provide a letter of support from a member of the executive leadership team indicating the proposal team has support for this work.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What outcomes are you hoping for from the two-year projects?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tananbaum: </strong>We envision two key outcomes. At a local level, we expect that participants will have developed and tested innovative changes to their academic assessment and advancement programs. To the extent that these reforms are impactful, we hope that they will become part of the fabric of these departments and institutions, creating clearer alignment between missions and reward structures.</p>



<p>Second, we believe these projects, synthesized through the MA3 community of practice, will provide replicable roadmaps for change in how research is conducted, evaluated and shared.&nbsp; We know that many departments and institutions are conceptually aligned with these modernization efforts. But figuring out what that looks like in practice has proven difficult. The MA3 Challenge will demonstrate what is possible. It is our belief that the awardees will generate strategies that can be adapted and adopted across the higher education landscape.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What happens after that? Are the funders committed to supporting further work or implementation of the projects that bear out?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tananbaum: </strong>We believe there is a robust appetite for this modernization effort. While we are at the earliest stages of what promises to be a long journey, we believe that demonstrating what’s possible here will lead to additional experimentation and implementation.</p>

<p>A Wiley journal has retracted a paper more than a year after a researcher reported the work was hers and had been stolen by a reviewer for another journal.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/25/reviewer-accused-stealing-manuscript-publishing-as-own-denies-refereeing/">reported in July</a>, Shafaq Aftab, now a lecturer at the University of Central Punjab in Pakistan, contacted Wiley in September 2024 after discovering <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sres.3076">a paper</a> published in one of its journals, <em>Systems Research and Behavioral Science </em>(<em>SRBS</em>), was the exact work she submitted to a different journal a year earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.3192">retraction notice</a>, issued October 1, states an investigation found &#8220;significant unattributed overlap with an unpublished manuscript&#8221; and data the authors provided to the journal were &#8220;insufficient to resolve the concerns.&#8221; Subsequently, &#8220;additional scientific errors were identified in the manuscript,&#8221; according to the notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133014"></span>



<p>In November 2023, Aftab had submitted her manuscript to <em>Information Development</em> (<em>IDV</em>), which rejected the article after two rounds of revisions, Aftab told Retraction Watch. After learning about the <em>SRBS </em>study, Aftab contacted <em>IDV </em>for answers. Stephen Parker, editor of the journal at the time, wrote in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IDV_Email_Response.pdf">a Sept. 22, 2024 email to Aftab</a> that Ghorbanzadeh was a reviewer of both versions of Aftab’s manuscript, and had recommended it be rejected. <em>IDV </em>“cannot be held accountable for this behavior from reviewers,” Parker wrote.<br><br>In an October 2 email to us, first author Davood Ghorbanzadeh said Wiley “failed to provide us with solid evidence to substantiate claims of plagiarism.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh, a social scientist at Islamic Azad University of Tehran North Branch in Iran, would not discuss the retraction further, writing “the issue of article retraction is a strictly professional matter between the authors, the journal, and Wiley Publishing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh previously denied plagiarizing Aftab&#8217;s work, telling us the accusations were &#8220;entirely unfounded.&#8221; In an email, Ghorbanzadeh wrote he &#8220;did not review Ms. Aftab’s manuscript for [<em>IDV</em>], nor did I suggest its rejection, as has been claimed,” and that his study was &#8220;the result of original research conducted with academic integrity.&#8221;</p>



<p>The <em>SRBS</em> retraction is Ghorbanzadeh&#8217;s third for plagiarism in less than a year. A <a href="https://www.emerald.com/jhom/article-abstract/38/8/1182/1227612/RETRACTED-Empirical-nexus-of-corporate-social?redirectedFrom=fulltext">2024 study</a> in Emerald’s <em>Journal of Health Organization and Management</em> <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jhom-10-2024-0409/full/html">was retracted</a> in January because “a large portion of this article is taken, without attribution from an earlier, unpublished original work” by other coauthors. The notice also states all coauthors besides Ghorbanzadeh “would like it to be noted that they were not aware of this situation.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the December <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-07223-7">retraction notice</a> for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-06007-3">a paper</a> in <em>Current Psychology</em> states the article “significantly overlaps with a previously published article with a largely different authorship,” with one of the authors claiming “they were unaware of the submission of this article.”</p>



<p>The <em>SRBS</em> retraction notice states that Ghorbanzadeh disagrees with the decision to retract, while coauthors J. F. Espinosa-Cristia and N.S.G. Abdelrasheed agree with the move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Espinosa-Cristia, an associate professor at Federico Santa Maria Technical University in Chile, told us he could not talk about the case because his university is conducting an internal investigation involving the article retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other coauthors on the <em>SRBS </em>study did not return our messages seeking comment.<br><br>Aftab said she was “very happy” after a long struggle to have the plagiarism acknowledged and rectified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The retraction is a strong reminder that those who take credit for someone else’s work will eventually face consequences,” she told us. “My message to the research community is clear: If you try to steal someone’s hard work, be aware that there will be accountability. What one needs in such moments is patience and faith because truth and integrity always prevail.”</p>

<p>We don’t know if it’s the fastest retraction ever, but the speed is nonetheless notable: A journal retracted a paper 22 hours after a sleuth raised concerns about the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On August 9 just before noon, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/10/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-led-to-the-identification-of-hundreds-of-fraudulent-papers/">John Loadsman</a>, an <a href="http://www.loadsman.com/jal/">anesthesiologist</a> and journal editor in Australia, reached out to two journals to notify them of image similarities he had flagged on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loadsman asked the authors to clarify the “apparent identity” of a figure in a <a href="https://www.experimentalbiomedicalresearch.com/index.php/ebr/article/view/370/261">2023 paper</a> in <em>Experimental Biomedical Research. </em>The figure resembled one in a different paper by the same authors “representing different experimental conditions,” he wrote in his <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2751978BBD339018E354E93D51A15">PubPeer comment</a>. The second paper appeared in Wiley’s <em>International Journal of Endocrinology</em> in 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132999"></span>



<p>Loadsman said Wiley responded “almost immediately” saying they would investigate the paper in <em>IJE.</em> Geena De Rose, a communications director for Wiley, confirmed to us the older paper is being investigated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editor-in-chief of <em>EBR</em>, Hayrettin Ozturk, responded to Loadsman 14 hours after his initial email to say he was looking into the article. Just shy of 22 hours after Loadsman’s initial message, Ozturk sent another email saying the paper had been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ozturk confirmed to us Loadsman’s email initiated the inquiry, which “prompted a request for information from the authors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.experimentalbiomedicalresearch.com/index.php/ebr/article/view/370/262">retraction notice</a>, the duplicated image was “an erroneous presentation due to an inadvertent mistake and technical reasons.” So the authors requested the article be withdrawn, the notice states.</p>



<p>The “swift and rapid decision stems solely from our journal&#8217;s extremely sensitive policies on these matters,” Ozturk told us.</p>



<p>The 2019 <em>IJE </em>paper has been cited 15 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. <em>EBR </em>is not indexed on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://avesis.cu.edu.tr/spolat/iletisim">Sait Polat</a>, coauthor on the study, is a professor and a department chair&nbsp; at Cukurova University in Adana, Turkey. Neither Polat nor <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8219-2816">Gulfidan Coskun</a>, authors on the paper, responded to our request for comment. Coskun responded to Loadsman in a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2751978BBD339018E354E93D51A15">PubPeer comment</a> about the now-retracted paper stating the similarity between the figures arose “from the use of the same EDS-administered animal model in two separate studies, each approved by different ethics committees.” Coskun, a researcher at Cukurova University, said she had also contacted the journal.</p>



<p>Gulfidan also responded to Loadsman’s comments on the <em>IJE </em>article, citing an “unintentional error during the preparation of the figure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loadsman and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/28/first-time-scientific-sleuths-prompt-nine-retractions-for-neurosurgery-group/">Rene Aquarius</a>, a neurosurgery researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, have so far flagged <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=sait+polat">20 of Polat’s articles</a> for image issues on PubPeer, all within the last three months.</p>



<p>We’ve covered fast retractions before, although on the order of days, not hours. In 2021, we covered a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/01/07/this-retraction-is-one-of-the-fastest-i-ever-experienced-after-reporting-a-paper-to-a-journal-editor/">19-day retraction</a>, which sleuth Elisabeth Bik said was one of the fastest she had ever experienced. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/24/we-apologize-again-for-the-inadvertent-mistakes-during-the-assembly-of-data-due-to-our-carelessness/">another 2021 case</a> we called “reassuringly brisk,” a journal retracted a paper “within weeks” of issues being raised.&nbsp;</p>
