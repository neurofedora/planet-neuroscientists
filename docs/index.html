<p>The American Heart Association is reviewing its decision to give an award to the architect of a controversial theory that is the subject of eight retracted papers, Retraction Watch has learned. In the meantime, the researcher is using the award to contest several of the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/professional-membership/awards-and-lectures/paul-dudley-white-international-scholar-award">The Paul Dudley White International Scholar Award</a> “recognizes the team of authors with the highest-ranked scientific abstract from every participating country for each AHA scientific meeting,” according to the award website.</p>



<p>At its Basic Cardiovascular Sciences 2025 conference in July, the association <a href="https://professional.heart.org/-/media/PHD-Files-2/Membership/Awards-and-Lectures/2025-Paul-Dudley-White-International-Scholars.pdf">gave the award </a>for best&nbsp; abstract from India to <a href="https://aha.abstractarchives.com/abstract/bcvs2025-4307372/microbubble-induced-shock-waves-in-blood-investigating-multiphase-sanal-flow-choking-during-decompression">work describing “Sanal flow choking” theory</a>, which is named after lead author, V. R. Sanal Kumar, a professor of aerospace engineering at Amity University in New Delhi. As we have previously reported, some scientists have denounced the concept as “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/24/controversial-rocket-scientist-in-india-threatens-legal-action-after-journals-pull-papers/">absolute nonsense</a>” and “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/04/embattled-rocket-scientist-loses-paper-following-retraction-watch-report/">inaccurate and paradoxical</a>” — and earlier this year, a journal said it “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/10/physics-of-fluids-aip-publishing-sanal-kumar-journal-retraction-thermodynamics/">fundamentally violates</a>” a law of thermodynamics.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133153"></span>



<p>Following the conference, Kumar sent emails to at least three journals — <em>Scientific Reports</em>, <em>AIP Advances</em>, and <em>Global Challenges</em> — requesting the reversal of his retractions, citing the AHA award. He copied us on those emails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of the Sanal flow choking concept has been further validated,” Kumar wrote in the email to editors at <em>Scientific Reports</em>, which retracted <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94450-8">one of his papers</a> in 2023. “The American Heart Association recognized this work by conferring the 2025 Paul Dudley International Scholar Award.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="502" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-1024x502.png" alt="" class="wp-image-133155" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-1024x502.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-300x147.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-768x377.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-1536x753.png 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025.png 1915w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This abstract earned its authors the Paul Dudley White International Scholar Award for India at the American Heart Association&#8217;s Basic Cardiovascular Sciences 2025 meeting. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Kumar told us the award “reinforces the scientific credibility and translational value” of the theory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suzanne Grant, vice president of media relations for the AHA, told us the award “was based on abstract scores only.” She also told us “immediately” after the meeting in July, the AHA “learned of the retraction history” of Kumar. The organization was scheduled to review the award decision this week, Grant said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grant also said the AHA has “revised the process for the review” of future award submitters “to focus more on the quality of science rather than solely on the highest score for each country.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMlFPWYIrmS/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">post on Instagram</a> on July 26, Vyadh Aerospace, for which Kumar conducts research, said the award brought the research team “A Step Closer to the Nobel Prize.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous retractions don’t always get in the way of awards. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/27/cancer-researcher-under-cloud-of-suspicion-wins-300000-science-prize/">As we wrote in 2018</a>, Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University who lost several papers for image manipulation, was awarded over $300,000 from a charitable organization after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/08/cancer-researcher-dodged-accusations-decades-new-correction/">decades of misconduct allegations</a>.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2025/10/what-all-parents-need-to-know-to-support-their-teens-in-college/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/joshua-hoehne-ZFQkkUirNdM-unsplash_cropped-480x185.jpg" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2025/10/what-all-parents-need-to-know-to-support-their-teens-in-college/">What all parents need to know to support their teens in college</a></p><p>With the semester well underway, your college student is probably juggling a lot—classes, homework, exams, and writing assignments—all while managing friendships, jobs, and other responsibilities. This balancing act can be tough for any young adult, but it’s often especially challenging for students with ADHD. In high school, your teen may have benefitted from built-in structure and support systems (e.g., teachers, parents) that helped them stay on track and meet their goals. In college, those supports tend to fade, leaving students to navigate much more on their own.</p><p>As a parent, you can play an important role in helping your student adjust to these new demands. Sometimes this means offering a little extra “scaffolding”—gentle support and guidance—to help them build the skills they need to thrive on their own. That’s exactly why I wrote <em>Mastering the Transition to College: The Ultimate Guidebook for Parents of Teens with ADHD.</em> It’s packed with practical information and strategies to help you and your teen navigate these years successfully. This blog post offers a first look at some of those tips, so you’ll have tools ready if your student starts to struggle, academically or otherwise, this semester.</p><ol><li>Communication and collaboration are key. You probably know from the high school years that giving unsolicited advice to your teen can backfire. Pushing too hard often leads to resistance. Instead, try to use a calm, collaborative tone. Let your teen know you’re there to support and guide them, but that <em>they</em> are in control of their own decisions. Approaching conversations this way helps your teen feel respected and more open to brainstorming solutions with you.</li><li>Set goals. Before you can help your teen make changes, it’s important to first understand what <em>they</em> want. Ask about their goals, not just in academics, but in all areas of their life that matter to them. Once you know their priorities, you can work together to map out what steps are needed to get there. This also makes it easier to guide them without feeling like you’re imposing. Some of these steps may be addressed in the tips below.</li><li>Help your teen establish an organizational system. This may sound obvious, but it’s incredibly powerful: having a clear system to track tasks and deadlines is a game changer. Encourage your teen to choose a system that works for them. It could be a paper planner, a phone app, or a calendar on their laptop. The key is sustainability, so expect some trial and error as they experiment. Whatever they choose, the idea is that the system should be sustainable. The goal is to help them feel in control of their time, not overwhelmed by it.</li><li>Encourage your teen to develop a system for completing tasks. College life means that the to-do list is rarely empty. Your teen may feel as if their tasks are never-ending… as one is completed, another is added to the list. Therefore, developing a method for triaging what needs to get completed and by when will be crucial. An approach that balances what is important vs. what is urgent is often a good place to start.</li><li>Discuss all available campus resources with your teen. College campuses offer a lot of support to help your teen succeed. However, students (and parents) often find it difficult to know what resources are available and how to access them. Resources may be academic in nature (e.g., tutoring, office hours, advising, academic accommodations, writing center), mental health related (e.g., student health center, counseling center, skills groups), or logistical (e.g., career services, resident assistants). Knowing what resources to use, when, and how to access them will be essential for ensuring a successful college career. Further, if your teen needs more support than your conversations with them or my book can provide, finding a licensed professional may be a helpful next step. Outside help can be an important part of your teen achieving success.</li></ol><p>I hope these tips provide you with a solid starting point in supporting your teen with the transition to and through college.

<p>Academic publishing needs “renewed focus and collective action” to embrace new approaches and ensure the future of the industry, concludes <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/what-we-offer/research-publishing/publishing-futures">a report</a> from Cambridge University Press, released last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What started as an exploration of barriers to open access models turned into a call for “radical change” in academic publishing. “It has been clear for some time that the publishing ecosystem is under increasing strain,” Mandy Hill, managing director of Cambridge University Press, wrote in the introduction to the report. “This was the case before the growth of open access, but it is also clear that the shift to open has not solved the problems, as some early open access advocates may have hoped.”</p>



<p>The report, which followed workshops and interviews with stakeholders, includes results of a survey of more than 3,000 researchers, librarians, funders, publishers and societies.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133145"></span>



<p>Among its observations and recommendations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The growth in volume of research articles is overwhelming the system, as <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/low-quality-and-ai-generated-papers-could-overwhelm-publishing">other coverage</a> <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/academic-publishing-at-critical-juncture-will-break-without-change-cup-warns">has noted</a>, due to AI-generated articles and paper mill output and the increase  in scientific research more generally. </li>



<li>Economic models for publishing need reform, as “pay-to-publish and pay-to-read models continue to undermine financial sustainability” while budgets for both models remain static or shrink.</li>



<li>The academic reward system continues to incentivize quantity over quality, and “the challenges in academic publishing are inseparable from broader issues of recognition and reward.”</li>
</ul>



<p>“We fundamentally believe that publishing less – but better – is essential for the health of the entire research system worldwide,” the authors of the report state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn more about the recommendations and what comes next, Retraction Watch spoke with Hill, who stepped away from the Frankfurt Book Fair for our conversation. The text has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>We read a lot of reports on the state of publishing. This report makes some fairly provocative statements about what specific changes are needed. Why is that?</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mandy-hill-square.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="968" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mandy-hill-square-1024x968.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-133147" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mandy-hill-square-1024x968.jpg 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mandy-hill-square-300x284.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mandy-hill-square-768x726.jpg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mandy-hill-square.jpg 1509w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mandy Hill</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Mandy Hill: </strong>Doing the work over the past six months, through the survey, through the workshops, really brought home that enough is enough. We&#8217;ve got to stop talking about the problem and start doing something about it. [It has been like] everyone walking past a burning building going, “Oh, that house is on fire.” And then maybe a couple of people getting buckets of water and throwing them at the fire and saying, “Yeah, [I’ve] done my bit. Tried, didn&#8217;t work.” The only thing that is going to make the difference to put this fire out is us all working together in a concerted way to really tackle it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you&#8217;re right. We have tried to make pretty provocative statements about how serious this now is. It&#8217;s not going to be sustainable if we don&#8217;t make change. I&#8217;ve chatted to a few other publishers, including some of the large commercial publishers, and they agree that the rate of submission, and then the resultant output, is unsustainable. I think everyone sees that the incentives are wrong for some people to want to change that, but I think everyone sees we&#8217;re reaching a crunch point where something has to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a publisher, what I don&#8217;t want to do is say, “The problem’s over there. Somebody else needs to sort it.” We want to say, actually, we&#8217;re all in this together. But we have to see this as a systemic challenge where no one piece can be fixed without everything else being fixed.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch:</strong> So to that end, what is Cambridge University Press willing to do? What changes will you make?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hill: </strong>We made the conscious choice to not come up with a 10-point plan of what Cambridge is going to do, because that wouldn&#8217;t have solved this. The biggest thing we can do is grab people by the hair or the hand or whichever it&#8217;s going to take to get them around the table, and make that collective action work.</p>



<p>Realistically, we publish 20,000 research articles a year. We&#8217;re a relatively small piece of the publishing puzzle. We alone can&#8217;t change things, but that cannot be our “get out of jail free” card. So there are some things we want to do through demonstration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re looking at ourselves in the mirror. Are all of our journals adding value in their communities? What can we do to ensure they are? We&#8217;ve been very clear in our strategy that we will never be driven by quantity, that there will be times when journals will grow, but that&#8217;s always got to be quality driven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Probably the biggest way we hope we can make wider action is as a department of the University of Cambridge. We actually think the convening power of the University of Cambridge with us as a part of it — we&#8217;re both a leading university and a leading publisher — and with those two sides of our identity, we think we can really pull people together. We&#8217;ve already tried to have conversations with funders, but we hope to expand that.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>Do you think the administration at the university is up for these conversations? Do they acknowledge the problem and acknowledge that they can play a role in making changes that influence the wider circle?</p>



<p><strong>Hill: </strong>My hesitation is not wanting to put words into the mouth of the university. What I can say, though, is that we have had conversations, not only with the vice chancellor, but also with the pro vice chancellor of research and the university librarian, and they are very supportive of what we&#8217;re doing and want to work with us on that idea of convening. I think the University of Cambridge is a micro-example of the complexities of solving a problem like this. They would acknowledge themselves that this is going to be a really tricky one to solve, and there aren&#8217;t going to be easy answers. They&#8217;ve certainly said they are very keen to work with the idea of convening conversations to drive collective action.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>In terms of a business model for the university press, what would publishing less look like? Is that sustainable for an academic publisher?</p>



<p><strong>Hill: </strong>There are a number of journals, particularly that have been created over the past few years, that aren&#8217;t adding value and are just churning out quantity. One of the questions I&#8217;m asking my team is, how do we know if journals are valued by the community? What is a good rating of value? Is it something that people think, “I want to publish in that journal because I agree with the editorial policies?” Or, “They really support the development of my articles.” There&#8217;s something about the journal that is genuinely valued, and that&#8217;s something hard to quantify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other piece in the report is really talking about alternative publishing platforms. If we say there&#8217;s a whole chunk of content that does get benefit from being published in journals, fantastic. But there&#8217;s other content that&#8217;s not benefiting from being published in journals. It doesn&#8217;t warrant the cost that it&#8217;s adding into the system. It could be either of those things. There needs to be credible, scalable alternatives. So another part of the conversation we want to be part of is, what do those look like? At the moment there are loads of little things going on. Very few of them have got genuine scale, and so the reinvention of the wheel going on and the hidden costs in the system are not useful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So in answer to your question, if we were to publish fewer journal articles, can we use our publishing services to support other publishing outlets? What exactly does that look like? Ask me in five years.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>You write in the report, “The dominance of the impact factor must be replaced with more balanced metrics that acknowledge the real value of research outputs.” What do you mean by that?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hill:</strong> How long has this been talked about? <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a> has been around for how many years [saying] that the impact factor should not be used as a proxy for the quality of the individual articles that are published in that journal? And they shouldn&#8217;t, and the impact factor of where a researcher has had their research published should not be used in promotion decisions. It feels like forever, but it hasn&#8217;t changed behaviors. So there&#8217;s a cultural change that&#8217;s required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got to think together. I think it’s going to be quite a complex one, and may well vary by subject. Maybe it&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to value different outputs.The dependence on the journal article at the moment is really not reflecting the variety of research outputs that there are now. And we&#8217;re kind of shoving all research into a journal-shaped output, and it doesn&#8217;t really do a lot of things any favors. We should have more versatility.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>In the survey portion of the report, you found 86% of respondents agreed that a future where the majority of research articles are made freely available is desirable, and 69% agreed that the move to more open access journal publishing so far has made high quality research outputs easier to discover. Is a majority open access world a sustainable business model for both the publishers and for the researchers?</p>



<p><strong>Hill:</strong> I strongly believe we would think about open access as the default model, because we can see there&#8217;s so much evidence now in terms of citations and usage, and the way researchers around the world can access, the geographic distribution of usage that open access is better for research. It&#8217;s more equitable. We&#8217;ve got to have a system designed like that. So I think the question is not if it&#8217;s sustainable, it&#8217;s how we make it sustainable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A journal says it will retract a 2019 paper on an Alzheimer&#8217;s treatment after an institutional investigation found research misconduct, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. The move comes four years after another investigation by the same university uncovered image duplication in a different paper by a similar group of authors.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(19)31323-X/fulltext">The paper</a>, published in <em>Biological Psychiatry</em>,<em> </em>describes the potential of an apoE antagonist for treatment in Alzheimer’s disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://hscweb3.hsc.usf.edu/blog/2019/06/11/researchers-discover-potential-new-therapeutic-target-for-alzheimers-disease/">2019 news release </a>by the University of South Florida, home to several of the researchers involved in the study, called the work “promising.” Lead author <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3599-6859">Darrell Sawmiller</a>, an assistant professor at USF, said the study represented “the first time … we have direct evidence” apoE “acts as an essential molecule” in the mechanisms leading to Alzheimer’s. </p>



<span id="more-133134"></span>



<p>The paper has been cited 32 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Jun Tan, the corresponding author on the paper, is no longer with USF but was formerly the Robert A. Silver Chair in Developmental Neurobiology at the university. His <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X25002352">most recent publication</a> lists dual affiliations with institutions in China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have asked the university for the investigation but have not received a reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tan was one of several dozen researchers who study Alzheimer’s disease whose papers had been questioned on PubPeer and described in investigative journalist Charles Piller’s recent book, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/04/undisclosed-conflicts-lightning-fast-peer-review-one-alzheimers-journals-role-in-a-failed-drug/"><em>Doctored</em></a><em>. </em>According to the book, Tan “did not respond to queries about apparent image doctoring in fifteen studies — many concerning amyloid-beta in animal testing.”</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jun_tan_usf.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="500" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jun_tan_usf.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-133136" style="width:200px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jun_tan_usf.jpg 400w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jun_tan_usf-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jun Tan<br><em>USF</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The<em> </em>article marks the second retraction for Sawmiller, Tan, and several other common authors. The first was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2017279">a 2017 paper</a> in <em>Cell Death and Disease</em>. <em>&nbsp;</em>A USF investigation into that work found “inappropriately duplicated images” and that the “text associated with them are not scientifically defensible,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-021-04444-7">the December 2021 notice</a> says. The paper, which describes lithium’s potential as a treatment for Alzheimer’s, has been cited 21 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sleuth Kevin Patrick raised concerns about the <em>Biological Psychiatry</em> paper on PubPeer in October 2021. One of the images in the paper “seems to be duplicated … although the brightness is slightly different, suggesting that this isn’t merely due to an error during figure assembly,” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/71220E3664E86C95C8B075ACB9F30D">Patrick wrote</a> under his known pseudonym “Actinopolyspora biskrensis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick sent the PubPeer comment to the journal that same month. Editor Rhiannon Bugno told Patrick in January of this year the journal had “continued to regularly follow up with the institution.” Bugno also wrote the university told her the “investigation itself was concluded,” but USF “has yet to share any information/findings from the investigation with us.” She followed up in a later email saying the journal was “considering whether to take any action in the interim.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 16, Bugno told Patrick in an email USF “has informed us that research misconduct was identified. Therefore, we are retracting the paper.” Bugno did not reply to our email asking when the journal plans to issue the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Tan’s tenure at USF, he was the principal investigator on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NIH-funding-for-Jun-Tan-@-Univ.-of-South-Fla-NIH-RePORT.pdf">over $6 million in grants</a> from the National Institutes of Health, according to NIH RePORTER.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity, resolutions, at Springer Nature, told us the investigation into the <em>Cell Death and Disease</em> paper was initiated by comments on PubPeer, but USF reached out while the investigation was in progress to recommend retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick had also flagged that paper on PubPeer, noting <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/683702B169AF039424CA02666BE720">in a 2019 comment</a> two parts of a figure which “appear to include multiple areas of overlap.” In 2021, after the article was retracted, Patrick wrote on PubPeer the concerning images “seem to originate from the <a href="https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8875&amp;context=etd">Ph.D. thesis of the first author</a>,” <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9496-3681">Ahsan Habib</a>. Habib earned his doctorate from USF in 2018 and is an author on both the <em>Cell Death and Disease</em> and <em>Biological Psychiatry</em> papers. His <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahsan-habib-ph-d-61713886/">LinkedIn profile</a> says he is currently a lab tech at food company HP Hood LLC and was formerly a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Aging. </p>



<p>Habib did not respond to our request for comment to his professional and personal emails. We also reached out to Takashi Mori, another common coauthor currently a researcher at Gifu University in Japan, who did not respond to our request for comment. Both disagreed with the retraction in <em>Cell Death and Disease</em>, according to the notice<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sawmiller also did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Sawmiller, Tan, and Habib, as well as other shared authors on the two papers, received two expressions of concern from Sage’s <em>Cell Transplantation</em> in 2022. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09636897221112706">One, on a paper published in 2015</a>, was issued after Patrick’s <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/78696B4DD54298EFCD2117D06ADCC6#1">PubPeer comment</a> pointed out “unexpected” image duplication. A coauthor on that paper was Paul Sanberg, who, as we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/08/companys-alzheimers-treatment-study-earns-a-flag/">reported at the time</a>, was co-editor-in-chief of <em>Cell Transplantation</em> and had financial ties to the work, neither of which were disclosed in the conflict of interest section.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://health.usf.edu/medicine/mpp/faculty/psanberg">Sanberg</a>, executive director of USF’s Center of Excellence for Aging, is also a coauthor on the soon-to-be-retracted paper in <em>Biological Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09636897221120609">second expression of concern</a> in <em>Cell Transplantation</em>, for a paper published in 2018, came shortly after the first and followed <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BA0604B56429507F1DB4AD20975827">Patrick’s PubPeer comments</a> pointing out a splice in one of the figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tan was the corresponding author for all four of the papers and, according to all the notices, didn’t respond to the journals’ inquiries. The <em>Cell Transplantation</em> notices state the “remaining authors noted that the corresponding author has access to all of the data underlying the findings.” Tan did not respond to our multiple requests for comment to several email addresses under his current affiliations.</p>



<p>Several of Tan’s other papers have been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A%22Jun+Tan%22">flagged on PubPeer </a>for image issues, including a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/38AB1DF61EB47CF31AD3CEAC3D14AF">second paper</a> from <em>Cell Death and Disease</em>,<em> </em>which Springer Nature has confirmed they are now investigating.&nbsp;</p>

                FAST is the infamous acronym that can help us to recognise the signs of a stroke.  Face. Arms. Speech. Time. Within minutes, a stroke can cause permanent  damage, or even become fatal. Strokes are more common in women and risk increases with age - this could be due to a longer life expectancy than men, but emerging research suggests that there are sex-specific differences relating, not just to the risk of incidence, but to progression and outcomes. So, what are these differences?

<p>To earn their degrees, graduate students at the <a href="https://uotechnology.edu.iq/en/">University of Technology in Baghdad</a> not only must publish research in indexed journals. They also are required to cite articles in their school’s own publications, a document obtained by Retraction Watch shows.</p>



<p>Experts who reviewed the document called the citation requirement “deceptive and despicable” and said it could carry a steep price for the journals involved, one of which is indexed in Scopus.</p>



<p>Coercive citation<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733323000380"> is widespread</a> in academia and can help boost the rankings of<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/31/publisher-offers-cash-for-citations/"> publications</a>,<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings"> institutions</a> and<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02639-9"> individual researchers</a>. The practice is<a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/discussion-document/citation-manipulation"> considered unethical</a> and may<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manip"> trigger heavy penalties</a>.</p>



<span id="more-133114"></span>



<p>The document we obtained shows the University of Technology has made coercive citation official policy. In an<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf"> order</a> sent July 7 to all of the school’s colleges, the university,<a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-technology-iraq"> one of Iraq’s largest</a> public institutions, set out a number of graduation requirements for its students.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of Requirements for Master and PhD Iraq_Redacted."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-22d88367-97f3-4753-9376-a28d327a2c93" href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf">Requirements for Master and PhD Iraq_Redacted</a></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Master’s students must publish one research paper in a journal indexed in Elsevier’s Scopus or Clarivate’s Web of Science, two influential databases, or two papers in conference proceedings Scopus has indexed, according to the document. Doctoral students must publish two or more works in indexed journals as well as one paper in one of<a href="https://uotechnology.edu.iq/en/journals/"> the school’s six titles</a> or a “partner journal.”</p>



<p>For these articles to be approved by the school, both master’s and Ph.D. students must cite three research papers published in the university’s journals.</p>



<p>The order came on the heels of a meeting in the spring during which the school’s leadership discussed ways to get its journals indexed in Scopus or Web of Science. One suggestion was to “<a href="https://uotechnology.edu.iq/en/university-president-meets-with-editors-in-chief-of-scientific-journals/">increase citations of published research</a>,” according to a news report on the institution’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, only one of its publications, the<a href="https://iqjap.uotechnology.edu.iq/"> <em>Iraqi Journal of Architecture and Planning</em></a>, is indexed in Scopus.</p>



<p>Professor<a href="https://as.uotechnology.edu.iq/en/khawla-salah-khashan/?__cf_chl_tk=uBNx5zed48UW4kuoJyKbIo32a2NXOaa2tRG7wvsbsBA-1760459569-1.0.1.1-ZZDaXLOvv7xtg54JnzqLY7JLxAji07lE9FiW9UarrvU"> Khawla Salah Khashan</a>, assistant president for scientific affairs at the school, who signed the order and was also present at the spring meeting, did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did the school.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘Deceptive and despicable’ </h3>



<p><a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/john-ioannidis">John Ioannidis</a>, a bibliometrics expert at Stanford University, called the citation requirement “a horrible idea” likely aimed at boosting the rankings of the university journals.</p>



<p>“I cannot see any scientific justification,” Ioannidis told us. ”If these journals are indexed in databases that produce Impact Factor or related metrics, this alone may be good reason to remove them.”</p>



<p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stratford-school-of-interaction-design-and-business/people-profiles/lennart-nacke-phd">Lennart E. Nacke</a>, a professor of human-computer interaction and associate director of graduate studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who has<a href="https://lennartnacke.com/the-silent-threat-of-citation-hacking-to-academic-integrity/"> written about citation manipulation</a> and<a href="https://lennartnacke.com/content/files/2025/03/Citation-Hacking-Defence-Cheat-Sheet.pdf"> how to fight it</a>, echoed Ioannidis’s concerns.</p>



<p>”Requiring students to include three citations to papers from university-owned journals is a predatory practice and hits the most vulnerable academic population: Students, who have yet to complete their graduate degrees,” he told us. ”It sets a wrong precedent and is deceptive and despicable.”</p>



<p>An Iraqi academic told us that, to their knowledge, at least one other public institution in the country formally requires students to cite school publications to graduate. More broadly, asking students and faculty members for citations is ”common practice” in Iraq and helps journals ”elevate citations and be indexed in Scopus,” according to the source.</p>



<p>The academic, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, highlighted two recent Facebook posts illustrating such citation shenanigans. In one, the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251015135554/https:/rjes.iq/index.php/rjes/Editorialborad"> editor-in-chief of a university engineering journal</a> openly<a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=9650687878327839&amp;id=100001601686903&amp;rdid=3movBqQLSb3R4AnR"> promised an appreciation letter</a> from the institution’s dean to researchers who cited the publication’s papers in Scopus-indexed journals.</p>



<p>In the other, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iraq_citation_reqt_screenshot_facebook.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshot</a> shows what<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1701925596714117/permalink/4123618357878150/?rdid=V1D0MfdzHtlwvv2z"> appears to be a sloppily redacted email from Alaa H. Al-Charrakh</a>,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251015132117/https:/journals.lww.com/mjby/pages/editorialboard.aspx"> chief editorial adviser</a> at the Scopus-indexed <em>Medical Journal of Babylon</em> and a<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6533-6395"> professor at the University of Babylon</a>, to a researcher who submitted a paper to the journal. In the correspondence, Al-Charrakh requested the addition of three references to papers previously published in the journal, apparently as a condition for accepting the manuscript. </p>



<p>Al-Charrakh told us more than 3,000 papers had been submitted to the journal over the past two years and said he did “not remember writing a letter with this content.”</p>



<p>“In general,” he said, “the journal&#8217;s editorial board does not compel researchers to cite research previously published in the journal but rather asks them (optionally) to make a citation if the research topic is repeated in the journal, as follows: ‘It is preferred to make citations for at least 2 references to the <em>Medical Journal of Babylon</em> relevant to your study (if any).’”</p>



<p>In addition to citation manipulation, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/09/deputy-minister-in-iraq-losing-papers-with-signs-of-paper-mill-involvement/">Iraqi scholars say</a> fake authorship and research fraud are common in the Middle Eastern nation, which has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/iraq-corruption.html">massive problem with corruption</a> at all levels of society. Part of the reason is a lack of funding that leaves students with few options to comply with their institutions’ demands for publications (Iraq spends<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=IQ"> just 0.04%</a> of its gross domestic product on research and development, according to the World Bank). Faculty members <a href="https://doi.org/10.3167/latiss.2024.170106">are in a similar bind</a>: To be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ministerial-order_faculty-performance-scores.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allowed to teach</a>, the Iraqi government requires them to achieve <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fK2nteQsQQq09iPlzqUzXz8gSRfDWJs0/view?usp=sharing">annual performance scores</a> that depend heavily on research published in indexed journals.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, we wrote about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-hayder-abed-dhahad-5511b4200/">Hayder Abed Dhahad</a>, Iraq’s<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/navbar/agents"> deputy minister for scientific research affairs</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-hayder-abed-dhahad-5511b4200/"> </a>who<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/09/deputy-minister-in-iraq-losing-papers-with-signs-of-paper-mill-involvement/"> has lost six papers</a> with signs of paper mill involvement. In an interview for that story, Dhahad, who also<a href="https://me.uotechnology.edu.iq/en/hayder-abed-dhahad/"> is a professor and vice president for scientific affairs and higher education studies</a> at the University of Technology, denied wrongdoing and stressed his ministry’s commitment to research integrity. He did not reply to a request for comment on his school’s citation requirements.</p>

<p>After more than 20 years of criticism and calls for retraction, a journal has placed an expression of concern on a study of the antidepressant Paxil in teens that critics say has led to unwarranted and potentially harmful prescribing of the drug to youth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(09)60309-9/abstract">2001 paper</a>, published in the<em> Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</em> (<em>JAACAP</em>), reported findings from a randomized trial known as “Study 329,” which concluded the antidepressant Paxil was safe and effective in kids ages 12 to 18.&nbsp; </p>



<p>In 2012, Paxil maker GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay $3 billion to settle civil and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/glaxosmithkline-plead-guilty-and-pay-3-billion-resolve-fraud-allegations-and-failure-report">criminal charges</a> that included “unlawful promotion” of the drug for adolescents, for whom the product was never approved, and allegations the company “participated in preparing, publishing and distributing a misleading medical journal article” — the <em>JAACAP </em>paper.&nbsp; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/09/16/re-analysis-of-controversial-paxil-study-shows-drug-ineffective-and-unsafe-for-teens/">A reanalysis</a> in 2015 found the drug was “ineffective and unsafe” for the age group studied.</p>



<span id="more-133106"></span>



<p>Despite these actions and other calls for retraction, the paper received its first mark this September, shortly after <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/08/25/antidepressant-paxil-gsk-medical-journal-children-adolescents-depression-ghostwriting-retraction/">a lawsuit was filed against the journal’s owner</a>, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Elsevier, which publishes the title.</p>



<p>JAACAP “is publishing this expression of concern in order to alert readers to concerns that have been raised about the article,” the <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(25)02107-0/fulltext">September 30 notice</a> reads. “Further review is underway, and an expression of concern will continue to be associated with the article until an outcome is reached.”</p>



<p><em>JAACAP </em>would not comment on why it issued the expression of concern now,&nbsp; referring us to the AACAP. Rob Grant, director of communications for the group, said the academy&nbsp; “cannot comment on the details of an ongoing review process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“AACAP and its journals take the responsibility to investigate concerns very seriously,” Grant wrote in an email to us. The expression of concern “is an interim measure while the evaluation process continues,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email, a spokesperson for Elsevier said the publisher had no additional comment about the expression of concern, and that Elsevier does not comment on legal proceedings.</p>



<p><a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mkeller">Martin B. Keller</a>, first author on the original paper and a professor emeritus of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, did not return messages seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Critics of Study 329 called the expression of concern a long time coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s great that there&#8217;s an expression of concern. It&#8217;s the first step forward after 20 years of intermittent but frequent complaining,” said Jon Jureidini, a researcher at the University of Adelaide in South Australia and a coauthor of the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4320">2015 reanalysis</a> of Study 329.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jureidini said he and others have worked for years to get <em>JAACAP </em>to retract the paper to no avail, including devoting <a href="https://study329.org/">a website</a> to the movement. The paper has been cited 451 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including by researchers citing the work in a positive light, Jureidini said.</p>



<p>Jureidini said he thinks the expression of concern was likely triggered by a recent lawsuit against AACAP and Elsevier. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-CAB-005368.pdf">In a complaint</a> filed September 8 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, attorney George W. Murgatroyd III argued the journal is violating the <a href="https://code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/code/titles/28/chapters/39/">D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act</a> by continuing to “publish, distribute, and sell a fraudulent scientific article that contains material facts” that mislead the public and endanger adolescent mental health and safety. AACAP and Elsevier are profiting from the article by charging readers $41.50 on the <em>JAACAP </em>website and $33.39 on Elsevier’s ScienceDirect website to buy access to the paper, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Murgatroyd, who previously represented families whose children died by suicide after taking Paxil, is suing AACAP “in his capacity as a private attorney general acting on behalf of the general public,” according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complaint contains other allegations about the paper, including that the article was ghostwritten (a charge the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Response-to-BMJ-Article-9-15-15.pdf">authors have denied</a>), that many of its authors didn’t disclose “extensive conflicts of interest,” and that at least 10 of the 22 authors made no substantial contribution to the work, a claim put forth in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989620802194384">a 2008 article</a> by Jureidini.</p>



<p>The suit seeks relief in the form of a “retraction of the Keller article along with corrective notice and reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and costs.”</p>



<p>Murgatroyd said he, too, believes the expression of concern is a response to pressure from the pending lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The mechanism of self-correction isn’t working,” he told us. “When they don’t self-correct, somebody&#8217;s got to step in and say, either you do it or the court is going to make you do it.’ There is nothing good about that article. It&#8217;s evil. It promoted drugs to kids who killed themselves. There&#8217;s nothing worse than that. You can&#8217;t allow something like that to stand.”</p>



<p>Peter Doshi, a senior editor for <em>The BMJ</em> who has been critical of Study 329 for at least a decade, called the expression of concern “devoid of detail.” The stated rationale for the notice is &#8220;to alert readers to concerns that have been raised about the article,” but it omits any mention of what those concerns are, Doshi said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doshi founded Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials (RIAT), <a href="https://restoringtrials.org/about-us/">an initiative</a> that aims to address bias in clinical trials by reporting unpublished results and re-publishing misreported trials. He and colleagues with RIAT identified Study 329 as “a misreported trial in need of restoration,” which led to the 2015 reanalysis. Doshi <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4629.full">wrote an editorial</a> in <em>The BMJ </em>that accompanied it<em>.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doshi said many unanswered questions remain about the journal’s review into the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What I’d like to know: How is this new review being carried out, by whom — the editor? the ethics committee? someone else? ” Doshi said. “What is its scope? Will its findings be published, and when can we expect conclusions?”</p>
