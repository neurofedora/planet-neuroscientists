<p>Wiley has issued a mass correction at one of its journals after finding nearly 100 papers with undisclosed conflicts of interest related to submissions by board members and relationships between authors and journal editors.</p>



<p>An investigation found conflict of interest issues in 98 papers published from 2020 to 2025 in <em>Geological Journal</em>, although the issues may have gone on before then, sleuths suggest. Nearly a third of the papers shared a single co-author — an associate editor at the journal.</p>



<p>That editor&#8217;s contract was not renewed, we have learned.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gj.5230">correction notice</a>, issued in early May, the journal had not taken “measures to manage potential conflicts of interest between authors and editors” for 98 articles. </p>



<span id="more-132141"></span>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley told us their investigation “uncovered that editors of the journal, who were also authors publishing in the journal … had not disclosed their position as members of the Editorial Board at the submission stage.” The journal currently lists 29 associate editors.</p>



<p>Wiley’s research integrity team “independently re-evaluated” the peer review process and content of each article, the correction states. As a result of the investigation, the journal amended the conflict of interest statement on each of the 98 affected articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Wiley about what precedent a correction, rather than retraction, might set for other researchers. The spokesperson said the role as a publisher is “to investigate the content of the papers in question and take the appropriate action for the situation.” They also noted the inquiry turned up “no evidence” results in the papers were compromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of those papers, <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/news/413">M. Santosh</a> co-authored 32. The name may be familiar to Retraction Watch readers: Last year, Santosh was involved in an instance of “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/23/elsevier-investigating-geology-journal-after-allegations-of-pal-review/">pal review” at a geology journal</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santosh has listed affiliations in recent papers at Kochi University in Japan and China University of Geosciences in Beijing. He is also a “Highly Cited Researcher” with more than 1,600 published articles, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. His papers have been cited over 70,000 times, 12,000 of which are self-citations. Until the correction was published, he was also an <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0A969F4CF1BA3A17D9D716D29677BA">associate editor</a> at <em>Geological Journal</em>.<em> </em>According to the Wiley spokesperson, Santosh did not disclose his position as a member of the editorial board at the submission stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked why Santosh was no longer listed on the editorial board, a spokesperson for Wiley told us the journal “did not renew the contract of an editorial board member who had repeatedly submitted manuscripts without COI statements identifying his role on the Editorial Board.”</p>



<p>Santosh said he was unable to comment as a “public university employee working in China.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Geological Journal </em>published the 98 papers between 2020 and 2025, which the Wiley spokesperson called a “realistic timeframe during which we can more reliably retrace what happened.” The spokesperson also noted that around that time, both the publisher and the “scholarly publishing industry more broadly speaking began strengthening policies” for editorial conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, several undisclosed conflicts of interest at the journal took place before 2020, as detailed in a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05912EE2947A2433249AC4B62BCB6D">PubPeer comment</a> posted by “Desmococcus antarctica.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite these apparent conflicts of interest, the spokesperson said the investigation “did not find any paper mill activity” associated with the articles and each paper underwent a “substantive” post-publication review by the research integrity team. The review included “manual review by our research integrity team of each article, reviewer report, and author response,” the Wiley spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A sleuth who has asked to remain anonymous got in touch with us regarding this case. The sleuth said several of the papers to which the correction applied were “extreme” cases of conflicts of interest. These included papers where authorship relationships existed between the paper author, editor and reviewer, as detailed in another Desmococcus <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/42F812FCE41661F101869CF8ED2419#2">PubPeer comment</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/CAF799A0F4FDD982FF7D6A6AC6C30E">another example</a>, Li Tang, who is Santosh’s <a href="https://www.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CDFD&amp;dbname=CDFDLAST2017&amp;filename=1017126690.nh&amp;uniplatform=OVERSEA&amp;v=iZ5uC57E5h7aAbsZenTlD1Rm9b80GOJCJMzjEBFX1jnTApTdfWcNmSMY6DJTjGvG">former Ph.D. student</a>, served as Santosh’s handling editor while coauthoring another paper in the journal within the same timeframe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guidance from the Committee on Publication Ethics <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/flowchart/undisclosed-conflict-interest-published-article">on the topic states</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A published article might need to be corrected or retracted, depending on whether the editor considers the conflict of interest to have affected the peer review process or the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“We have additionally taken proactive steps to reinforce COI best practices with editorial teams,” the Wiley spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>Attention authors: temporary change to announcement schedule due to upcoming holidays.</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This coming Thursday</span><b>, June 19, 2025</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, arXiv staff will be observing Juneteenth, a US federal holiday. This holiday will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This brief change will only affect the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While arXiv is a global scientific resource, the arXiv team primarily takes time off according to the holiday schedule of the United States. In the coming weeks, there are a few US federal holidays that will cause some disruption to arXiv’s regular announcements, mailings, and user support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on </span><a href="http://arxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced by email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As you plan your submissions to arXiv in the coming weeks, please be aware of the delays around the following dates. Mailings and public availability of new submissions will be deferred accordingly:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Thursday, June 19, 2025.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Wednesday, June 18 2025, and before 14:00ET Friday June 20, 2025 will be announced on Sunday, June 22, 2025.<br />

<p>A journal has <a href="https://link.springer.com/search?new-search=true&amp;query=retraction+note&amp;date=m6&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;search-within=Journal&amp;facet-journal-id=10936">retracted 16 papers</a> after a whistleblower flagged it for “irregularities” in peer review, among other concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Journal of Psycholinguistic Research,</em> a Springer Nature title, published the papers between 2021 and 2024. The articles covered research ranging from studies of the work of <a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10936-024-10043-2">Haruki Murakami</a> and Kazakh<a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10936-024-10080-x"> literature</a> to English <a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10936-021-09823-x">reading fluency</a> and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10936-023-09995-8">teaching competence</a> of parents of children with cochlear implants. </p>



<p>Thirteen of the 16 articles have been cited one to five times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science; <a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10936-021-09800-4">one article</a> has been cited 19 times, the highest of the bunch. </p>



<span id="more-132132"></span>



<p>The retraction notices, dated April 10, 2025, read in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p> An investigation by the Publisher has found a number of articles, including this one, which share similar concerns, involving but not limited to, irregularities with respect to authorship, ethics approval and peer review. The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented in this article.  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many of the authors of the retracted papers are affiliated with institutions in Iran, China and Kazakhstan. At least two of the authors object to the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Following contact from a whistleblower, Springer Nature’s Research Integrity Group undertook an investigation of a number of papers of concern,” Svetlana Kleiner, a research integrity manager at Springer Nature, told Retraction Watch. The publisher looked into each of the papers and presented its findings to the journal’s editor, “leading to a number of retractions,” Kleiner said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The whistleblower, Anna Abalkina, a research fellow at Freie Universität Berlin in Germany and creator of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, told us she uncovered problems when she examined fake peer reviewer profiles in Clarivate’s Web of Science. These profiles were created by a paper mill, and one of them had been associated with the peer review for the <em>Journal of Psycholinguistic Research</em>, so Abalkina informed the journal about the issue last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dorothy Bishop, a sleuth and professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University, raised issues about the journal <a href="https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2024/10/what-is-going-on-at-journal-of.html">on her blog</a> in October 2024. In the post, she wrote about how the journal appeared to be the target of Eastern European paper mills, and that other journals found to have published paper mill papers used fake peer reviewers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/15/springer-nature-journal-has-retracted-over-200-papers-since-september/">Springer Nature</a> has had to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/08/17/64-more-papers-retracted-for-fake-reviews-this-time-from-springer-journals/">issue mass retractions</a> before for peer review manipulation, including using fake peer reviewers.</p>



<p>Ehsan Namaziandost, a coauthor <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10936-025-10136-6">on three</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10936-025-10137-5">of the</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10936-025-10134-8">articles</a> and a former academic at the Mehrarvand Institute of Technology in Iran, told us he disagrees with the retractions.</p>



<p>“I did not commit any misconduct at any stage of the publication process. From the initial submission through to final publication, all procedures were overseen and approved by the journal’s editorial team, including the Editor-in-Chief, who made the final decisions following multiple rounds of peer review — sometimes up to five rounds,” he wrote in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Namazandiost said “the responsibility for selecting reviewers and making final decisions lies entirely with the Editor-in-Chief and the Associate Editors—not with the authors. Authors do not manage or influence peer review in any way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the journal’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10936/submission-guidelines#Instructions">submission guidelines</a>, authors “are welcome to suggest suitable reviewers,” along with an institutional email address or “other means of verifying the identity” of the reviewer. The guidelines note the journal may not use suggested reviewers, “but suggestions are appreciated and may help facilitate the peer review process,” the guidelines state.</p>



<p>Irina Karabulatova, of the Peoples Friendship University of Russia in Moscow and an author on <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10936-025-10132-w">one of the retracted papers</a>, said the journal notified her “a new review was allegedly underway to make sure that the reviewers to whom the journal had once sent my article for review would confirm that they had indeed reviewed it,” she said by email. The journal didn’t receive a response, she said, and so retracted her paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I consider this attitude of the magazine to be the height of hypocrisy: to take an article and make money from it, and then publicly withdraw it a few years later for a far-fetched reason, destroying reputational capital &#8211; this is the height of hypocrisy, which negates the significance scientific publications,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kleiner would not provide details of the peer reviews in this case, citing confidentiality, but said they “can confirm that [the issues with peer review] were sufficient to call into question the robustness of the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, Springer Nature retracted <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/17/springer-nature-journal-retractions-2024/">2,923 articles</a>. Last month, <em>Oncogene</em>, one of the publisher’s titles, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-publisher/springer-retractions/">retracted 15 articles</a> by cancer researcher Jasti Rao.</p>

                <p>In the <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a></em> paper &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-07011-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spatial transcriptomics reveal neuron–astrocyte synergy in long-term memory</a>&#8221; published on March 14th, 2024, authors Sun <em>et al.</em> claimed to identify cell-type specific transcriptional signatures of memory in mouse basolateral amygdala. These claims were refuted in a &#8220;Matters Arising&#8221; reply published on June 4th, 2025 by Eran Mukamel and Zhaoxia Yu titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08988-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">False positives in study of memory-related gene expression</a>&#8221; in which Mukamel and Yu point out numerous errors in statistical methodology by Sun <em>et al</em>. The way that <em>Nature </em>handles post-publication critiques of papers is to allow the authors of the critiqued paper to reply, and that reply is published contemporaneously with the Matters Arising. Thus, along with the Mukamel and Yu&#8217;s Matters Arising, on June 4th, 2025 <em>Nature </em>also published &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08989-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reply to: False positives in the study of memory-related gene expression</a>&#8221; by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4odVrMoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Wenfei Sun</a>, Zhihui Liu, Xian Jiang,&nbsp;Michelle B.

More on this below.</p>

It is Sun <em>et al.</em> who distort what constitutes &#8220;expert opinion in the field&#8221;. Furthermore, Mukamel and Yu&#8217;s position is neither narrow nor extreme; it is coherent and correct while Sun <em>et al.</em>&#8216;s claims are incoherent and wrong. More on this below.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-96bf1a03e64ab8741a4de8a2efaf7458"><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">&#8220;Although corrections such as Bonferroni or Benjamini–Hochberg can increase confidence in results by reducing the likelihood of mistakenly identifying a result as significant, they also risk overlooking genuine effects by making the criteria for significance overly stringent.  Thus, the choice to apply such corrections depends on the specific context.&#8221;</mark> This statement conflates two different multiple testing corrections. First, the Bonferroni correction controls for the family-wise error rate (FWER). In the genomics context, when conducting, say, 20,000 tests, Bonferroni replaces the &#8220;nominal&#8221; p=0.05 threshold with 0.0000025. At this much lower threshold, the probability of a single false positive among the 20,000 tests is 0.05 (under the null hypothesis), which provides a strong guarantee against type 1 error (false positives), but indeed can be viewed as overly stringent, i.e. type 2 error (false negatives) may be high. However, the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction is a procedure designed to control not the FWER, but the false discovery rate (FDR). With Benjamini Hochberg, using a 0.05 significance level will result in a set of predictions that among them contain only (in expectation) 5% false-positives. In other words, with Benjamini-Hochberg there will be a much higher probability of a single false positives: in fact there will be many (~5% of the results), but this allows for many fewer false negatives. To illustrate the vast differences between the two approaches, consider a simple experiment where the goal is to detect, from 85 samples from two Gaussians, whether the means are the same. A total of 350 tests are run: for 290 of them, the Gaussians are the same (mean = 1, variance = 1), but for 60 they are not (mean = 1, variance = 1 for one set of 85 numbers called x, and mean = 1.35, variance =1 for another set of 85 numbers called y). In other words, the data looks as follows:</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0b31346767d3c5a0676859987d5ee2ec">The goal, using the frequentist hypothesis testing framework is to discover the blue cases, i.e. to figure out when to reject the null hypothesis that the data was generated from Gaussian distributions with the same means. In this setting, we can compute 350 &#8220;nominal&#8221; p-values, i.e. raw p-values, and select as &#8220;significant&#8221; all cases where p &lt; 0.05. That strategy results in the null hypothesis being rejected 53 times. Of the 53 &#8220;significant&#8221; results, 34 are true positives, i.e. the null was rejected and indeed the numbers in y were generated from the Gaussian with mean = 1.35, not mean = 1. However there are 19 false positives results resulting in a high false discovery rate of 0.36 (= 19/53). More than a third of the predictions are wrong; moreover many true cases are missed (26 out of the 60, or 43%). In this case, the Bonferroni correction yields 6 predictions, among which there is no false positive for a false discovery rate of 0. This is, by design, because the probability of even a single false positive should be &lt;5%, and therefore the expected number of false positives is 0.3. Most of the time Bonferroni, in this setting, yields 0 false positives. Of course, the false negative rate is high; with only 6 predictions (all correct), 54 are missed (90%). Bonferroni is indeed, arguably, overly stringent. But the Benjamini Hochberg correction yields 20 cases where significance is reached, and it does so controlling the FDR at 5%, with a single false positive. This illustrates that lumping Bonferroni together with Benjamini-Hochberg as &#8220;such corrections&#8221; is a false equivalence. Moreover, this example shows that with only 350 p-values, a multiple testing correction is already essential to avoid an extremely high false positive rate. In fact, with 3,500 tests the false discovery rate using nominal p-values is 85%. Clearly, <strong>in the context of genomics<em>, </em>control of FDR is essential</strong>.</p>

It is standard practice to perform multiple-testing corrections in genomics. The two references Sun<em> et al.</em> have provided (3,4) are two papers from 1990 written prior to the genomics era, and written five years before the Benjamini-Hochberg correction was published.

And they were considering the need, or lack thereof, for corrections in biological experiments with a handful of measurements. Today, there is no question that multiple testing corrections must be applied when analyzing genome-side single-cell RNA-seq data: &#8220;<em>P</em>&nbsp;values obtained with DGE tests over conditions must be corrected for multiple testing&#8221; (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-023-00586-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Heumos et al., 2023</span></mark></a>). Therefore, it is not surprising that the senior authors of Sun <em>et al.</em> have frequently used multiple testing correction in their papers. In fact, Südhoff and Quake published a single-cell RNA-seq analysis together in 2016 where the used what they now call the &#8220;overly stringent&#8221; Bonferroni correction (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(16)30813-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Gocke <em>et al.</em>, 2016</span></mark></a>).

However, we applied our statistical analyses on 56 genes that emerged from systematic unbiased filtering using multiple criteria&#8221;</mark>. <strong>The filtering criteria used by Sun <em>et al.</em> were not unbiased</strong>. To the contrary, Sun <em>et al.</em> perform the statistical error of double dipping by filtering on log-fold change prior to performing hypothesis testing. Specifically, they applied a log-fold change filter, requiring genes to have a log-fold change of at least 1.75, a filter that Sun <em>et al.</em> refer to as selecting for genes with &#8220;biologically meaningful regulation&#8221;. To illustrate the effects of such a selection procedure, we return to the example of the Gaussians above. When first applying a fold-change threshold of 1.3 prior to testing, the resulting Benjamini-Hochberg corrected results yield 44 discoveries of which 12 are false positives yielding a false discovery rate of 0.27. <strong>In other words, selection prior to testing, i.e. double dipping, leads to a more than 5-fold increase in the number of false positives</strong>. This is no surprise. Without selection, p-values are uniformly distributed under the null, with an excess of small p-values due to the alternative hypotheses:</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d92391586f8adec427cd13b4d46b8c74">This issue is well known. The abstract of the classic <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</span></mark></a> paper on double dipping, or circular analysis, explained it well on the pages of <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> more than 15 years ago: &#8220;In particular, &#8216;double dipping&#8217;, the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis.&#8221;</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">&#8220;Third, to ensure biological significance, we further restricted the analysis to DEGs that were expressed in at least one-quarter of the cells and with a biologically meaningful regulation (for example, a fold change of at least 1.75). These procedures are not “post hoc criteria”, as fold  change and memory-specific filtering are not an adjustment or reinterpretation of prior statistical analyses.&#8221;</mark> <strong>Yes, these procedures are post-hoc criteria</strong>. Applying a log-fold change filter of at least 1.75 as Sun <em>et al.</em> did after seeing the data prior to performing multiple-testing correction constitutes application of a post-hoc filtering criterion. The paragraph by Sun <em>et al.</em> should state: &#8220;Third, to ensure statistical significance, we further restricted the analysis to DEGs &#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">&#8220;This approach resulted in a list of 56 putative DEGs in Gpr88 engram neurons (Fig. 2e of our Article2) that were evaluated statistically with the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test, a method that is well-suited for differential gene expression analysis in single-cell RNA-sequencing data<sup>5</sup>. This non-parametric method is robust to outliers and is effective with small sample sizes. It resulted in 32 DEGs that were predicted to be statistically significant. This statistical approach has been adopted in many papers<sup>6–10</sup>.&#8221;</mark> The &#8220;statistical approach&#8221; described here, namely of filtering the list of genes to be tested to 56 prior to performing statistical testing, and then not applying multiple testing correction is <strong>not</strong> an approach that has been adopted &#8220;in many papers&#8221;. I reviewed references 6-10 and none of them adopted this approach: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01462-3">Wang, B. <em>et al.,</em> 2023</a> (reference 6) did not apply post-hoc filtering and also applied the Bonferroni correction. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf5464">Wang, F. <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a> (Reference 7) used the Seurat FindAllMakers function which performs Bonferroni correction. In the case of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01215-0">Yeo <em>et al</em>., 2022</a> (Reference 8) the Methods description is poor so it is unclear if multiple testing correction was performed for selecting markers (although it was performed for their GO analysis), but it is clear that there was no selection prior to testing (effect sizes were examined <em>after</em> testing). <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15298-6">Ma <em>et al</em>., 2020</a> (Reference 9) presents a method called iDEA for joint DE and GSE analysis and has no relevance for the claim of Sun <em>et al.</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17440-w">McFarland <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a> (Reference 10) performed multiple testing correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and did not select based on fold-change prior to testing. The only relevance of these papers to Sun <em>et al.</em> is that they utilized the Wilcoxon test at some point, but it is not true that &#8220;[The Sun <em>et al.</em>] statistical approach has been adopted in many papers.&#8221;</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">&#8220;Given the application of 56 statistical tests, we calculated that approximately 5% (or 2.8 genes) could be false positives.&#8221;</mark> The statement, as written, does not even make sense. The percent of false positives resulting from a hypothesis test will depend on the significance thresholds applied, the test used, and on the number of instances derived from the null vs. the alternative. Sun <em>et al.</em> seem to have misunderstood that that while it&#8217;s true that in a hypothesis testing framework, under the null hypothesis the expected fraction of p-values less than some threshold <em>X</em> will be <em>X</em>, the nature of type I (false positive) error in a particular test is not just &#8220;5%&#8221;. Moreover, Sun <em>et al.</em> performed post-hoc filtering (see above) so Sun <em>et al.</em> were not operating in the standard hypothesis testing framework.</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">&#8220;Mukamel and Yu<sup>1 </sup>argue that the false discovery rate (FDR) is a standard practice and should be applied to all genomics data. However, this perspective has been debated<sup>3,4</sup>,&#8230;&#8221;</mark> Again, as pointed out above, references 3 and 4 were written in 1990 prior to the genomics era and the availability of genomics data. The first organism to be sequenced was the bacteria <em>H. influenzae</em> in 1995. Mukamel and Yu are correct that control of the FDR is standard practice in hypothesis testing in the context of genomics.</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">&#8220;Nonetheless, in pursuing the suggestion by Mukamel and Yu, we have now also applied the q-value test and Benjamini–Hochberg correction to these 56 genes (Fig. 1b,c). The q-value method is more appropriate for genomics data than the FDR test using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction<sup>11</sup>, which can be overly conservative and result in a substantial loss of power.&#8221;</mark> There is no such thing as an &#8220;FDR test&#8221;. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction is a multiple testing correction for controlling the FDR, not a test. There is also no such thing as &#8220;the q-value test&#8221;; it doesn&#8217;t exist. I recommend <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1530509100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Storey and Tibshirani&#8217;s classic paper on q-values</a> to understand how q-values relate to the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">&#8220;Moreover, Mukamel and Yu<sup>1</sup> suggest that our engram single-cell data should be analysed as pseudobulk expression profiles for each individual animal—that is, that the statistical n value should refer not the cell but to the animal. This question has long been debated in the field. Although the vast majority of papers published in the field<sup>12–14</sup> use the cell as the statistical n, it has also been argued that pseudobulk approaches are preferable<sup>15</sup>.&#8221;</mark> The question of whether it is legitimate to use the cell as the statistical <em>n</em> has <strong>not</strong> &#8220;long been debated in the field&#8221;. It&#8217;s incorrect to use individual cells as a proxy for biological, experimental replicates. The authors know this. Here is an excerpt from the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.03.626516v1.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tabula Sapiens preprint</a> posted on December 4, 2024, authored by Stephen R Quake and The Tabula Sapiens Consortium: &#8220;<strong>To assess differential gene expression between male and female samples at the tissue-cell type level, we employed a pseudo-bulk approach with edgeR (v-4.0.1)<sup><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.03.626516v1.full#ref-149">149</a>,<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.03.626516v1.full#ref-150">150</a></sup>, which has been recommended as an effective method to prevent false discoveries in datasets with covariates<sup><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.03.626516v1.full#ref-151">151</a></sup></strong>&#8221; Proposed reading: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21038-1">Zimmerman et al., 2021</a>.</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">&#8220;Nevertheless, we have reanalysed our data treating the number of mice as n and found that several of the most important genes investigated in our paper also show nominal statistical significance, including Penk, Ramp1, Egr1, Hnrnph1 and Aptx (Fig. 1d,e).&#8221;</mark> In this sentence the phrase &#8220;nominal statistical significance&#8221; just means that in Fig. 1d,e, Sun <em>et al.</em> are reporting the uncorrected raw p-values. Amazingly, they barely pass the p = 0.05 statistical significance threshold, which means they likely <strong>do not</strong> pass the significance threshold after multiple testing correction.</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">&#8220;Finally, although statistical methods are powerful tools for interpreting results, independent measurements to validate findings are often the strongest evidence for ground truth.&#8221;</mark> This is true.</p>

<p>Moreover, this is not the first time problems have been identified in a paper of senior co-corresponding author Thomas Südhof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_C._S%C3%BCdhof">His Wikipedia page</a> states that &#8220;Südhof retracted [the]&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300363120">Lin et al. 2023</a>&nbsp;research paper published in PNAS from his lab due to falsified data, and since mid-2022, PubPeer<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_C._S%C3%BCdhof#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;commenters including&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Bik">Elisabeth Bik</a>&nbsp;have flagged 46 of Südhof’s papers, which explore how neurons communicate across synapses.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_C._S%C3%BCdhof#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>&#8221; .

<p>I have highlighted in red the statements that are false. It is possible to respond to a BioRxiv preprint; in fact <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2019/10/21/zero-data-rna-seq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Quake, one of the two senior co-corresponding authors of the Sun <em>et al.</em> paper disagrees with his coauthor</a>. He has been very vocal and supportive of preprints, stating that &#8220;… people have to agree to use BiorXiv or a preprint server to share results… and the hope is that this is going to accelerate science because you’ll learn about things sooner <strong>and be able to work on them</strong>.&#8221; Furthermore, it is possible to discuss PubPeer allegations fairly; authors can respond to any comment about one of their papers via the PubPeer website. Finally, the &#8220;accusation&#8221; characterization misrepresents the allegations in the Mukamel and Yu critique, in which they stated clearly in their abstract that &#8220;This [the Mukamel and Yu analysis] suggests the [Sun <em>et al</em>.] data do not support the author’s claim to have identified cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of memory in the mouse basolateral amygdala.&#8221;<br><br><strong>Code availability</strong></p>

<p>More than 20 years after publishing a letter saying a set of papers should be retracted — and PubMed marking them as such — the journal has finally retracted the articles, following a Retraction Watch inquiry.</p>



<p>Let’s back up.</p>



<p>In 1998, the journal <em>Contraception </em>published <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/issue/S0010-7824(00)X0049-2">a supplement</a> with six articles on Implanon, a subdermal contraceptive implant. The papers examined the implant’s pharmacodynamics and side effects. The next year, the journal published two clinical studies of the implant, one on <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(99)00015-3/fulltext">its effectiveness as a contraceptive</a> and the other on its <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(99)00099-2/fulltext">effect on lipid metabolism</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those two studies took place at centers in Jakarta, Indonesia. Some of the study data published in the supplement also included patients at those centers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132123"></span>



<p>In 2004, <em>Contraception</em>, the journal of the Society of Family Planning and published by Elsevier,<em> </em>published <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(04)00194-5/fulltext">a letter to the editor</a> about an audit of the clinical studies conducted in Indonesia. It found “incorrect data” had been included on case report forms, which were in turn included in the databases for some of the studies. As a result of the audit, study investigators and the sponsoring company, NV Organon, “jointly concluded that the results of these studies cannot be considered valid and that the publications of the results should be retracted.”</p>



<p>What happened next is a bit of a guess: The journal probably linked the papers to the letter to the editor when indexing it for PubMed, and marked them as retracted articles in the indexing file. At least, that’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15504385/">how they show up in the PubMed entry</a> for the letter. But the journal didn’t take the step of retracting the articles at the time, so they remained unmarked on the <em>Contraception</em> website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research director Alison Abritis found the disparity in 2024, and wrote to the journal’s editor-in-chief detailing the issue. Over a year later, on May 19, she heard back from a publishing ethics expert at Elsevier, who told Abritis, “We have ascertained that PubMed/PMC wrongly picked up” the letter to the editor “as a retraction notice. Sadly, the journal delayed the retraction of the articles, which is however now complete.”</p>



<p>The journal <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/inpress#20250530">published retraction notices</a> for all the papers on May 30.</p>



<p>Collectively, the eight papers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Contraception-retractions.pdf">have been cited a total of 452 times</a>, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Of those, 329 citations are from 2005 onward – after the publication of the letter to the editor stating the articles should be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We followed up with Elsevier to ask for their take on why the papers hadn’t&nbsp; been (officially) retracted and how they might have ended up marked as such in PubMed. An Elsevier spokesperson told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The journal received an enquiry from the Retraction Watch director in April 2024, thanks to which the case was referred to Elsevier’s Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics team. Research integrity, a collective challenge facing the whole academic publishing world, is of the highest priority to Elsevier. When these matters come to our attention through our own extensive screening, and occasionally via external parties, we act appropriately. These papers have now been retracted, and we continue to investigate the exact reasons for this very rare occurrence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The papers represented more than 6% of 2004’s total retractions, according to the Retraction Watch Database. Based on the number of retractions in recent years, they will represent around 0.1% of this year’s total.&nbsp;</p>
