<p>“<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-222/v2">Efficacy and risk of sexual orientation change efforts: a retrospective analysis of 125 exposed men</a>,” published in <em>F1000Research </em>in March 2021, found conversion therapy (referred to in the paper as sexual orientation change efforts) was “effective and safe.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>F1000Research</em> is an open publishing platform where peer review takes place after publication. The title is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science but does appear in Scopus, which reports the paper was cited seven times.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131114"></span>



<p><em>F1000Research</em> <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-222">retracted</a> the article on February 4 after two independent external reviews, according to the notice. “The methodology, and subsequent statistical analysis, employed by the study cannot support the conclusions around efficacy and effectiveness,” the notice reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study’s lead author is D. Paul Sullins, a sociology professor at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. We wrote about him <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/08/25/publisher-flags-paper-sex-parenting-neo-nazi-group-cites/">in 2017</a> when his paper on same-sex parenting received an expression of concern after it was cited on posters distributed by a neo-Nazi group.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As conversion therapy has a controversial history, so do its papers. Many face scrutiny, and have been retracted for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/06/17/catholic-medical-journal-pulls-paper-on-conversion-therapy-over-statistical-problems/">statistical problems</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/02/journal-retracts-70-year-old-article-on-homosexuality-for-long-discredited-beliefs-prejudices-and-practices/">antiquated beliefs</a>. They can even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/12/30/conversion-therapy-statements-pulled-from-homosexuality-paper/">perpetuate stereotypes</a> about the gay community. Despite some authors’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/30/psychologists-want-to-retract-old-papers-about-conversion-therapy-elsevier-says-no/">regrets about publishing</a>, the papers can end up <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/04/12/controverial-homosexuality-reparative-therapy-paper-staying-put-despite-authors-regrets/">staying in the literature</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversion therapy has been <a href="https://theconversation.com/conversion-therapy-is-discredited-and-increases-risk-of-suicide-yet-fewer-than-half-of-us-states-have-bans-in-place-161330">discredited</a> by many members of the scientific community and has been denounced by the American Medical Association, the American Counseling Association, and the American Psychological Association. Despite this, Sullins and his coauthors sought to “overcome ideological polarization in data acquisition and studies of this controversial topic,” he <a href="https://researchers.one/articles/24.09.00002">wrote online</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper was originally published in <em>F1000Research</em> in March 2021, but a second version appeared five months later that had been revised to include a missing citation and corrected two misreported numbers. The retraction applies to both versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February 2024, a concerned researcher who asked Retraction Watch to stay anonymous raised concerns to <em>F1000Research </em>about the article in an email seen by Retraction Watch. The researcher alleged flaws in the research design, including a failure to establish common treatment methodology, duration of treatment, or accreditation of the people administering the therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sullins <a href="https://researchers.one/articles/24.09.00002">reposted an updated version</a> of the paper in September 2024 on the platform Researchers.one after<em> F1000Research</em> did not allow the authors to make further revisions, he said. “Rather than permitting the journal <em>F1000Research</em> to suppress evidence and debate on this issue, we hope in this forum to instead enable more debate and consideration of the evidence, from any ideological point of view,” he wrote in the post’s comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sullins told us in an email the authors are in the process of republishing the study at the <em>Journal of Open Inquiry in the Behavioral Sciences</em>, which claims to “share science, not control narratives,” <a href="https://unsafescience.substack.com/p/the-journal-of-open-inquiry-in-the">according to one of its founders</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in the Researchers.one comments, Sullins posted his correspondence with <em>F1000Research</em>. The emails from F1000 revealed the paper was also retracted because it bore similarities to another article. An unnamed representative from <em>F1000Research</em> said “the underlying data presented in the above article is the same data used in the article: ‘&#8217;Effects of Therapy on Religious Men Who Have Unwanted Same-Sex Attraction.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That paper, which was <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0024363918788559?journalCode=lqra">retracted in 2020</a>, shares a coauthor with the <em>F1000Research</em> paper: <a href="https://saintjosephpsychologicalclinic.com/">Paul Santero</a>, a psychologist at Saint Joseph Psychological Clinic in San Diego.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santero did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same comment thread, Sullins said the authors “do not agree that declining to cite a retracted study constitutes some sort of nondisclosure,” but decided to add the citation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The study has come under scrutiny before. In 2021, shortly after the paper was published, a commenter on PubPeer using the pseudonym “Crotalaria dewildemaniana” pointed out <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/085220A82C58195A9F368B2CF5E57C">ethical concerns</a> with the work. The commenter noted the American Psychiatric Association <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/getattachment/3d23f2f4-1497-4537-b4de-fe32fe8761bf/Position-Conversion-Therapy.pdf">opposes conversion therapy</a> and many states ban the practice, a number that has since risen from 13 <a href="https://counseling.northwestern.edu/blog/conversion-therapy-in-the-united-states-accessible/">to 28</a>, according to Northwestern University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-222#article-comments">lengthy comment</a> published on the article in 2023, <a href="https://psych.indiana.edu/directory/faculty/lorenzo-luaces-lorenzo.html">Lorenzo Lorenzo-Luaces</a>, a researcher at Indiana University in Bloomington, questioned the use of language in the article like “forgiveness of sins,” which he said implied a religious perspective that could have influenced the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark Robinson, a media relations manager for Taylor &amp; Francis, which owns <em>F1000Research</em>, told us more than one person contacted <em>F1000Research </em>regarding potential issues with the paper, which led to the investigations.</p>



<p>An external reviewer agreed with Lorenzo-Luaces, according to the correspondence posted on Researchers.one.The reviewer also pointed out that “discussing same sex behavior and/or orientation as something that goes into remission is also problematic.”</p>



<p>“Given the problem with the methods here, it is not possible that the statistics could be solid,” the reviewer wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the comments on the Researchers.one version of the paper, Sullins noted that version “corrects a coding error in the reported percentages in Tables 3, 5 and 6, which slightly strengthens the results.” This version also includes a disclosure of the retracted Santero study, Sullins said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sullins also affirms the religious perspective Lorenzo-Luaces criticized, stating the authors “made it obvious” that the men in the sample were “extremely religious,” which could have influenced their positive experience with conversion therapy. However, the authors removed the term “remission” from the new version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The anonymous researcher who emailed Retraction Watch also noted the study authors did not disclose potential conflicts of interest, including Sullins’ ties to “anti-LGBT” organizations such as the <a href="https://ruthinstitute.org/">Ruth Institute</a>, for which he is a <a href="https://ruthinstitute.org/about/fr-sullins/">senior research associate</a>. No competing interests were disclosed in the study.</p>



<p>Sullins told us his association with these groups is “personal, not contractual or financial.” He continued: “Not that these other affiliations are a secret. Many are disclosed on my c.v., which &#8230; can be discovered from a short web search,” he wrote.</p>

                <p>Since its founding over twenty five years ago PLOS has been dedicated to advancing open science, ensuring that knowledge is accessible to all, for the benefit of all.&nbsp; We believe that for science to maximally benefit society and inform policy, its core principles&mdash;integrity, transparency, inclusivity, and collaboration&mdash;must be upheld. These same principles are the foundation of our mission and guide our unwavering commitment to champion science that is independent, rigorous, and open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are deeply concerned about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00525-1">a range of recent US Executive Orders </a>that collectively have the potential to dismantle the US scientific enterprise as it has existed for the past 70 years.&nbsp; We are already seeing the impact of these disruptions and censorship efforts within our communities.&nbsp; Any attempts to restrict knowledge creation or censor its dissemination&mdash;whether through limiting research topics, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00367-x">mandating or restricting specific language</a>, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/trump-dei-cdc-fda">removing scientifically and medically valuable data from government websites</a>&mdash;undermine the core principles of scientific inquiry and obstruct progress. And they stand in direct conflict with our core values, our mission and our editorial policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS will not compromise on issues of scientific rigor and editorial integrity. Our editorial policies, designed to safeguard the integrity of the peer review process and ensure the accuracy, reliability, and accountability of published research, remain unchanged. We will not approve changes to terminology or removal of data that compromise the scientific accuracy of content. Requests to remove legitimate authors from manuscripts violate our authorship policies which are grounded in principles of credit, accountability and transparency. Our editorial policies ensure that we work within a framework of agreed-upon standards and practices that foster consistency and maintain accuracy across the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research thrives when rooted in the open exchange of ideas, different perspectives, and international cooperation. A variety of perspectives in the editorial process is essential to ensure a broad range of expertise and experiences inform how research is conducted, interpreted and evaluated. At PLOS, we seek diversity because more expert voices make for better science. We are proud to collaborate with a global community who dedicate their time, energy and expertise to ensuring&nbsp;that research serves society in the most impactful way possible.</p>



<p>We are actively working to understand the evolving implications of these directives and the disruption they have brought.&nbsp; Many researchers and institutions are facing difficult challenges and we want to reassure our community that we remain dedicated to the advancement of open science. Openness enables rigorous review and objective analysis, allowing the self-correcting mechanisms of science to function and ensuring research stands up to scrutiny. And open science facilitates innovations that continue to improve virtually every aspect of human and planetary life.</p>



<p>PLOS will always anchor our decisions in our values and our principles. And we will continue to speak up vocally for open, independent science.</p>

<p>A Wiley journal has retracted more than two dozen articles in the last few months for peer review issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The articles, which appeared in <em>Environmental Toxicology</em>, have been retracted in batches, the latest on February 16-17, with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?Ppub=&amp;field1=Title&amp;field2=AllField&amp;field3=AllField&amp;publication%5B%5D=15227278&amp;publication=&amp;sortBy=Earliest&amp;startPage=&amp;text1=Retraction&amp;text2=&amp;text3=">previous sets </a>in January and November.</p>



<p>The retraction notices of all 26 papers read in part:</p>



<span id="more-131105"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following an investigation by the publisher, the parties have concluded that this article was accepted solely on the basis of a compromised peer review process. Therefore, the article must be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All authors of the retracted papers are affiliated with universities in China. Most of the corresponding authors had email domains not associated with a university or research organization, containing random sequences of letters and numbers, a potential sign of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/09/20-ways-to-spot-the-work-of-paper-mills/">paper mill activity</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from the Wiley press office told us in an email the journal had “identified concerning peer review patterns associated with manuscripts in progress as well as some previously published papers.” The batches in November and January were retracted as part of the same investigation, the representative confirmed. They did not immediately respond to our request for additional information regarding the February retractions or inform us whether they plan to continue retracting papers.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Wiley has had mass retractions for peer review anomalies. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/03/wiley-medical-journal-retracts-dozens-of-paper-for-manipulated-peer-review-with-more-to-come/">June 2024</a>, <em>International Wound Journal</em> retracted dozens of articles for “compromised” peer review. And since late 2022, the publisher has retracted more than 11,000 papers from Hindawi journals, which Wiley acquired in 2021.</p>



<p>Nine of the retraction notices stated that one or more of the authors disagreed with the retractions. <a href="https://en.cpu.edu.cn/zlf_en/main.htm">Zheng Lufeng</a>, associate professor at China Pharmaceutical University in Nanjing, was co-corresponding author of the retracted article “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24204">MiR-375 impairs breast cancer cell stemness by targeting the KLF5/G6PD signaling axis</a>.” He told us in an email the authors were not involved in the peer review process. “This is the editor’s responsibility,” he said. Lufeng also wrote he hoped the editors would amend the retraction notices to indicate the retractions had “nothing to do” with the authors.</p>



<p>Aside from Lufeng, none of the corresponding authors responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the papers retracted so far, all but two were published in 2024 issues or online under Wiley’s “<a href="https://authorsupport.wiley.com/s/article/what-is-early-view#:~:text=Question%3A-,What%20is%20%22Early%20View%22%3F,offered%20by%20many%20Wiley%20journals.">EarlyView</a>” service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notices stated all articles were “retracted by agreement between the journal Editor-in-Chief” and Wiley Periodicals LLC. Paul B. Tchounwou, associate dean at Morgan State University, was the editor-in-chief of the journal until November. The current editor-in-chief is Christyn Bailey, a full-time editor at Wiley. Neither Tchounwou nor Bailey responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> is a search engine for scientific publications. There are alternatives like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a> (not a search engine but a database, often used in the medical field), <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> (also a database, but with richer annotations), <a href="https://citationgecko.azurewebsites.net/">Citation Gecko</a> (to discover networks of forward- and backward-citations, which is handy to check for missed papers), all of which I&#8217;m using from time to time. Or new tools based on large language models like <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">perplexity.ai</a> or <a href="https://www.litmaps.com/">litmaps</a>, which still have to show their value in the long run. Personally, I prefer Google Scholar. It casts the widest net among all these tools, covering not only journal publications but also conference preceedings, thesis publications, patents. This strategy also indexes crap from predatory journals, which is usually easy to spot for a scientist, but also some hidden gems that you would otherwise miss.</p>



<p>Google Scholar can be used not only as a search engine but is at the same time a tool to assemble the publications associated with a single researcher in a Google Scholar profile. Here are my pieces of advice on how to make the best use of your Google Scholar profile as a researcher in neuroscience (and related disciplines). Let me know if I missed something important!</p>



<p><strong>1. Create a public Google Scholar profile</strong></p>



<p>Once you have a Google account, it is pretty straightforward to create <a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html">a Google Scholar profile</a>. As soon as you have own publications associated with this profile, it also makes sense to make the profile public &#8211; this renders you searchable via Google scholar as a person with an ID. Since most people in the neurosciences are using Google Scholar (with a larger minority of medically-oriented or traditional researchers still preferring PubMed), this small step makes you more visible as a identifiable researcher, without having to go back to OrcID or other identifiers.</p>



<p><strong>2. Curate your publications</strong></p>



<p>From time to time, you will be informed by Google Scholar about new publications that are associated with your name. You can tell the algorithm to automatically update new publications (I&#8217;d choose this option only if you are very busy) or to decide by yourself each time (recommended). In the latter case, don&#8217;t forget to forward updates from Google Scholar in case you are not using the associated gmail account for your daily business.</p>



<p>Such a manual curation is a good use of your time to make your Google Scholar page useful to others and more readable.

<p>Sometimes, Google Scholar decides to include non-peer-reviewed scientific work in its search results, for example your thesis. I noticed that Google Scholar also includes posts of this blog post if they are structured like a scientific article and include a list of references. For example, the following email showed up when I posted a blog post reviewing papers on <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2024/07/08/four-recent-interesting-papers-on-astrocyte-neuroscience/">astrocytic physiology</a>:</p>

<p>I believe it is nice that Google Scholar also picks up these instances of scientific output in its results, but I don&#8217;t include them on my Scholar profile in order not to confuse the profile&#8217;s typical human viewer.</p>



<p>In theory, it is possible to add your own items to Google Scholar, based on Github repositories or other scientific output that is not found by Google Scholar. However, I would not recommend it since it may appear as if you were trying to artifically inflate the number of publications in your profile.</p>



<p><strong>3. Annotate shared first authorships</strong></p>



<p>As most tools for literature search, Google Scholar normally does not display &#8220;equally contributing&#8221; first authors. For many projects in experimental neuroscience, however, two or more authors are &#8220;equally contributing&#8221;, without being reflected by Google Scholar&#8217;s author list. To fix this issue and to make your Google Scholar profile a more accurate reflection of your contributions to  publications, you can click on an article, hit the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button and add asterisks (*) to the equally contributing first authors. Note that this procedure will update the author list in your Google Scholar profile but not in the Google Scholar search results. For example, an item may then appear like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="147" data-attachment-id="7925" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/02/18/how-to-use-google-scholar-as-a-neuroscientist/image-7/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2.png" data-orig-size="2522,363" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2.png?w=640" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7925" /></figure>



<p><strong>4. Set up personalized alerts to stay up to date</strong></p>



<p>Apart from being a useful web display of your publications, Google Scholar can also be used to keep you updated about current research related to your own publications. To do so, go to your Google Scholar profile page and click on the &#8220;Follow&#8221; button in the top right corner. This window will pop up:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="652" data-attachment-id="7927" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/02/18/how-to-use-google-scholar-as-a-neuroscientist/image-9/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4.png" data-orig-size="1510,962" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4.png?w=640" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7927" style="width:394px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>Hit the checkbox &#8220;New articles related to my research&#8221;, and you will be informed via email about publications related to your own (published) research. From my experience, &gt;90% of these &#8220;related publications&#8221; are irrelevant and can be ignored, while the remaining &lt;10% are useful. It&#8217;s certainly better than relying on bluesky or other social media or going through table of contents of journals. The updates are quite independent of journal names and not biased by the usage of social media by a specific researcher. Therefore, it is also possible to spot relevant and well-done research published in smaller journals or by less prominent researchers, without losing track of &#8220;high profile&#8221; studies.</p>



<p>Of course, if you don&#8217;t have yet any publications, it does not make so much sense to receive alerts about publications related to your work. In this case, go to the Google Scholar profile page of your supervisor, scientific hero, postdoc colleague or anybody who in your opinion does great research. Then, hit the &#8220;Follow&#8221; button on his/her Google Scholar profile page and select &#8220;New articles related to this author&#8217;s research&#8221;, and you will be updated about research close to your interests.</p>



<p>Of course, getting updates about new research can be quite stressing sometimes, and it is impossible to fully stay up to date with the literature. If you have the feeling that you cannot keep up with the &#8220;related&#8221; literature anymore, that&#8217;s okay. Just cancel your Google Scholar alerts, do some real science and come back to literature search at a later timepoint. Of course, you may miss some of the hottest developments. But following all the newest trends and hot topics can also be stressful, and we all should do our very best to purge any sources of unnecessary stress and distraction from our work life as researchers.</p>



<p><strong>5. Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Google Scholar. But it is always imporant not to get sidetracked by pure citation counts. Don&#8217;t judge a person based on their profile with its citation counts per year and numbers of publications. Always pick one or two first-author publications that you can judge scientifically, and check out what is behind the title, in the abstract, the figures, the methods sections, or the acknowledgements. Citation metrics can be manipulated and gamed, and nothing replaces the deep dive into real science.</p>



<p>Google Scholar also comes with quite a good documentation. Check <a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html#setup">it out</a>!

<p>Nick Wise had a prolific start to his sleuthing journey. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">July 2021</a>, the fluid dynamics researcher started looking for tortured phrases in published papers, and has since had a hand in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=%22Nick+Wise%22+">at least 1,000 retractions</a>. He also helped identify unique phrases for the Tortured Phrases Detector, a function of the Problematic Paper Screener that identifies signs of misconduct. Last month, Wise teamed up with other research fraud hunters in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00212-1"><em>Nature </em>article</a> that outlined “five essential steps to combat industrialized scientific misconduct.”</p>



<p>His success in calling out research misconduct helped him land a full-time job.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7284533579181666304/">In January</a>, Wise started a new position as research integrity manager at publisher Taylor &amp; Francis. We spoke with him about how his new position will impact his career trajectory and how he plans to use his sleuthing past in his new position.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131089"></span>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch:</strong> As research integrity manager, what will you be doing?</p>



<p><strong>Wise: </strong>I will be primarily investigating research integrity concerns, whether raised internally or externally, for both published and unpublished works. The cases could be relatively simple plagiarism or image manipulation concerns for a single paper, or larger cases involving tens or even hundreds of papers across multiple journals, including where we may suspect paper mill involvement.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch:</strong> What from sleuthing will you take into your research integrity job?</p>



<p><strong>Wise: </strong>I wouldn’t have this job without my sleuthing work, and I think almost every aspect of it transfers to my new job. I think that my knowledge of paper mills and selling authorships will be particularly useful, and there have already been cases where I have recognized names from investigations I conducted before starting the job.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>Will you be able to continue sleuthing outside of your job?</p>



<p><strong>Wise:</strong> I feel that, in effect, I am sleuthing from 9 to 5 every day, so I don’t have a great desire to keep going into the evening, and that’s before getting into potential conflicts of interest. I’m very interested in what other sleuths find and I’m still in contact with them. It’s important to my work to keep track of new investigations and developing trends in research misconduct.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>Any interesting lessons from your first few weeks on the job?</p>



<p><strong>Wise: </strong>I thought I was fairly cynical about the kinds of misconduct that goes on, but it turns out I am not cynical enough. Being able to look behind the curtain and see reviewer’s reports, communications between authors and editors etc. really opens your eyes to what some people are trying to get away with.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>What are your thoughts on sleuths being compensated for their work? Would having a paid opportunity to continue your sleuthing have altered your career trajectory?</p>



<p><strong>Wise:</strong> I would have loved to be able to be employed full time by an organization to investigate research integrity issues, with the ability to look at any publisher. However, as far as I know, no such positions exist. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/02/introducing-the-retraction-watch-sleuth-in-residence-program/">Retraction Watch sleuth in residence</a> scheme is excellent, but it is just for a single year. There are other initiatives to pay sleuths for investigations, however that would be as and when required, so the sleuth would still need other employment. There are no stable options.</p>



<p>As I said, I feel that I am a paid sleuth at Taylor &amp; Francis. I am restricted to one publisher, but there’s more than enough to keep me busy.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>What are your thoughts on the integration of AI in publishing practices? (T&amp;F supports “<a href="https://taylorandfrancis.com/our-policies/ai-policy/">responsible use</a>” of genAI.)</p>



<p><strong>Wise: </strong>My personal opinions on generative AI are that it is a tool that can be used competently or incompetently, for good or bad. It can do things that other tools have been able to do for years that we have no problem with: search, translation, grammar and spell checking, etc. It can also generate entire papers, along with hallucinating references to texts that do not exist and creating anatomically implausible diagrams.</p>



<p>There is no point banning the use of generative AI as there is no way to tell for sure that something is AI-generated. Even if we could say for certain that some content was the output of a generative AI, an author could say that they had used the AI for spell checking, or some other acceptable task. I think that all publishers can do is ask people to use AI responsibly. Pandora’s box is already open.</p>

<p>The 3,000+ journals in the Springer Nature portfolio published over 482,000 articles in 2024, according to data published this week on a new <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/advancing-discovery/research-integrity">research integrity page</a> on the company’s website. The page also shares a data point you don’t typically get from publishers: 2,923 articles were retracted.</p>



<p>The numbers are a small part of the page, which outlines the tools the publisher uses for quality control, what prompts a research integrity investigation, and what happens during such investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher breaks down the retraction numbers a little more:</p>



<span id="more-131073"></span>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>61.5% (1797 articles) of the retractions were of papers published before January 2023.</li>



<li>38.5% (1126) of retractions were for articles published after January 2023.&nbsp;</li>



<li>41% of the retractions for content published after January 2023 were for open access articles.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We asked Springer Nature why they chose to share these numbers, and who the intended audience of the page is. Alice Henchley, director of communications, integrity, ethics and editorial policy for the Springer Nature Group, replied: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We created the page to help provide more information on how the accuracy and integrity of research is maintained, particularly in light of the growing interest in how new technologies are impacting the research system. We hope that this transparency will be helpful to the community and further demonstrate our commitment to scientific integrity, both in terms of the rigour we apply prior to acceptance, and the responsibility we take for updating the publication record when concerns are identified after publication.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Among the Springer Nature retractions in the Retraction Watch Database, <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>tops our list. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/22/sleuths-spur-cleanup-at-journal-with-nearly-140-retractions-and-counting/">reported in August</a> that the journal, which lost its impact factor in June, was cleaning up hundreds of papers for “suspicious citations, tortured phrases and undisclosed use of AI in the journal’s articles.” </p>



<p>Also high on the list: <em>Scientific Reports</em>, which has made headlines here for a retraction on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/11/all-the-red-flags-scientific-reports-retracts-paper-sleuths-called-out-in-open-letter/">an article full of tortured phrases </a>and others for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/19/papers-in-scientific-reports-and-their-expressions-of-concern-raise-questions/">concerns over paid authorship</a>; and <em>Applied Nanoscience</em>, which<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/26/springer-nature-journal-pulls-nearly-three-dozen-papers-from-special-issues/"> retracted 34 papers</a> in special guest-edited issues riddled with problems.</p>

                The funding agency aims to cap “indirect costs” in biomedical research grants. But this behind-the-scenes work is crucial to making research happen.

<p>The chief editors of the journal <em>Sedimentology</em> have resigned, along with nearly a third of its associate editors, as the society running the title amended its publishing contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The International Association of Sedimentologists (IAS), a scientific society based in Belgium, owns the journal and contracts with Wiley to publish it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAS had run an operating deficit since its 2021-22 fiscal year, and began discussing “legal, financial, and strategic considerations” in October 2023, according to a letter from IAS acting president Daniel Ariztegui to its members. These moves included changes to the handling of manuscripts and copy-editing at <em>Sedimentology</em> and an amendment to the society’s contract with Wiley.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131066"></span>



<p>The journal’s chief editors and many associate editors opposed the changes, and resigned their positions, according to a February 10 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adam-mcarthur-7457a725_calling-all-sedimentologists-below-activity-7294636701442846720-8AuL/">letter</a> Adam McArthur of the University of Leeds posted on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These are quite extraordinary and troubling times in the IAS,” McArthur, one of the resigning editors, wrote in his post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We, like the [contributing editors] who resigned, believe that the move to a Wiley-led model, and the loss of all internal editorial assistance is extremely detrimental to the future of <em>Sedimentology</em>,” the resignation letter stated, citing changes to the role of the journal’s longtime editorial office manager.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter also faulted the IAS leadership for its decision-making process:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>More consultation was appropriate, and a wider base of consent should have been built before actions were taken. Had it been so, the situation where all the Chief Editors for <em>Sedimentology</em> have resigned because they felt that their positions had become untenable would not have arisen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McArthur has not responded to our queries, nor have the four <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241012184521/https://www.sedimentologists.org/about-ias/about-the-association/editors/">former chief editors</a> of the journal.</p>



<p><em>Sedimentology </em>joins our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">Mass Resignations List</a>, which documents walkouts and resignations at nearly two dozen journals since 2023.</p>



<p>Ariztegui responded to the resignations in a February 8 letter to members also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-j-g-reijmer-47921925_the-ias-side-of-things-ugcPost-7295082462672551936-YVt9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAA4i8PMB-MyL-FVAwrEPoG3MwLLDIk4Ssg0">posted on LinkedIn</a>. He referred to “a misunderstanding or misstatement of the facts” in the resignation letter from the associate editors, which he said had been sent by 12 of the journal’s editors. Twenty-six associate editors remain on the journal’s <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13653091/homepage/editorialboard.html">editorial board page</a>, down from 39 on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230715052951/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13653091/homepage/EditorialBoard.html">archived version</a> of the page from 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Sedimentology</em> is not and will not be in the future a ‘Wiley-led’ journal,” Ariztegui wrote. According to his letter, the society’s leadership had voted to amend its contract with Wiley to have the publisher provide “secretarial support” to the journal’s editorial board and run the ScholarOne website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAS owns <em>Sedimentology</em> and appoints all its editors, who are unpaid and operate “without influence from Wiley,” Ariztegui told Retraction Watch in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This fundamental structure remains unchanged,” he wrote to us. “The only modifications involve Wiley handling the transfer of manuscripts to the Chief Editors and managing copy editing post-acceptance—a process aimed at streamlining operations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ariztegui noted another journal the IAS owns, <em>The Depositional Record</em>, operates with a similar model. “The adjustments being made to <em>Sedimentology</em> align with this model while ensuring that IAS remains in full control of editorial decisions,” he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contract between IAS and Wiley comes up for renewal in 2028, and the IAS can give 12 months notice if it decides not to renew, he said. “All changes proposed and approved by the Council of Management, in accordance with the association statutes, have been implemented to address the IAS budget deficit and ensure alignment in the operations of all journals owned by the association,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the editorial office manager, Elaine Richardson, Ariztegui told us she “is not being dismissed,” although McArthur’s LinkedIn post said her position “has been terminated.” She has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are in the process of negotiating a new service agreement, and hopefully she will continue to provide copy-editing services for the IAS,” Ariztegui told us. “This has been clearly communicated in our previous statements.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ariztegui’s letter to IAS members went into more detail on the reasons for changing the role, namely to comply with Belgian and European law on self-employment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also defended the IAS decision-making process as in line with “good governance,” but noted most of <em>Sedimentology</em>’s chief editors stopped engaging in discussions in October 2024, “as they disagreed with the proposed changes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We recognize that communication between the Council of Management and the Associate Editors of <em>Sedimentology</em> could have been more frequent and effective,” Ariztegui told us. “Additionally, adjustments to the management structure may have contributed to communication challenges.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 2017 paper coauthored by Nobel laureate Thomas Südhof has been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “Conditional Deletion of All Neurexins Defines Diversity of Essential Synaptic Organizer Functions for Neurexins,” was published in <em>Neuron </em>in May 2017 and has been cited 145 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00074-1">retraction notice</a>, issued February 11, states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We, the authors of this publication, have decided to retract the paper because we found that the images in Figure 1D and Figure S4B contain aberrations that cannot be explained, and the original data for these figures are missing. Raw data for the other components of the paper are available, and their reanalysis confirmed the conclusions of the paper. We would like to thank M. Schrag for bringing these image aberrations to our attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-131061"></span>



<p>The article was the subject of a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F7C42C356B2E7049FDB68A434EF4F8">lengthy PubPeer thread</a> initiated in April 2024 by Lulu Y. Chen, the paper’s lead author and, at the time, a postdoc in Südhof’s lab at Stanford University. Chen wrote that she “discovered I inadvertently duplicated a panel” in one of the paper’s figures, and she was “posting this finding preemptively.” In the months following, several sleuths, including Elisabeth Bik and Matthew Shrag, noted issues with other figures in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The Transmitter </em><a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/retraction/second-paper-from-lab-of-nobel-prize-winner-to-be-retracted/">reported in August</a> that an update <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/sudhoflab/integrity---pubpeer.html">on Südhof’s website</a> stated the authors had requested a retraction of the article. (Note: Retraction Watch cofounder Ivan Oransky is the editor-in-chief of <em>The Transmitter</em>.) The article has been cited seven times since August.</p>



<p>When <em>Neuron </em>issued the retraction notice this week, Bik posted the text of it, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Of note, the authors&#8217; wording of &#8220;we found&#8221; and &#8220;can not be explained&#8221; seem not reflect what was discussed above on this thread. It is also remarkable that only Dr. Schrag is thanked for bringing this to the authors&#8217; attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction is the second for Südhof. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28erratum+or+correction%29+AND+%28thomas+sudhof%29&amp;filter=datesearch.y_5">Several corrections</a> on his papers have also been issued recently, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nobel-winning-neuroscientist-faces-scrutiny-data-discrepancies-papers"><em>Science </em>reported in May</a>, with many other papers <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Thomas+Sudhof">flagged on PubPeer</a>. A regularly updated <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/sudhoflab/integrity---pubpeer.html">page on Südhof’s website</a> details the concerns and actions taken to investigate.</p>

<p>When scientists face critique of their published work, they should be proactive in responding to the issues and to questions about it from the public and the media, says <em>Science </em>editor-in-chief Holden Thorp <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw5838">in an editorial</a> in the Feb. 14 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“In an age of growing, intense attacks on science, silence can be detrimental to both public trust and the careers of scientists who are under scrutiny,” writes Thorp and coauthor Meagan Phelan, communications director for <em>Science</em>. “For better or worse, journalists, social media professionals, and the public may take a response of ‘no comment’ as a concession that the critics are correct, so forthright communication about research questions is more urgent than ever.”</p>



<span id="more-131058"></span>



<p>The editorial goes on to advise researchers to discuss any integrity inquiries with their institution, but to make their own decisions when it comes to discussing the issues openly with the media. In <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/some-guidance-authors-engaging-media">an accompanying blog post</a>, Thorp and Phelan give tips on steps to take when questions arise about the integrity of a published paper, including pointers on how to prepare for a conversation with reporters. (In the interest of transparency: Retraction Watch cofounder Ivan Oransky provided Phelan feedback on the tips at her request.)</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to be partnering with foremost scientific sleuth <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/about/">Elisabeth Bik</a> on a new way to support scientific integrity: The Elisabeth Bik Science Integrity Fund.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/eye-for-manipulation--a-profile-of-elisabeth-bik-65839">Bik</a> is a renowned science integrity advocate and microbiologist who investigates and exposes research misconduct, including image duplication and data manipulation, to uphold transparency and ethical standards in scientific publishing.</p>



<p>The Fund, launched with the proceeds of <a href="https://award.einsteinfoundation.de/award-winners-finalists/recipients-2024/elisabeth-bik">Bik’s Einstein Award</a>, will provide financial resources to Bik and other sleuths and collaborators, as well as provide funding for training programs, grants, or awards for science integrity advocates. Plans also include funding educational or outreach initiatives promoting transparency and accountability in scientific research. Based on a fiscal sponsorship model, and leveraging our experience in nonprofit development and administration, Bik will have full direction over the Fund’s resources.</p>



<span id="more-131033"></span>



<p><strong>“</strong>This Fund is a great chance to help science integrity advocates work better together to ensure research misconduct<strong> </strong>is exposed and addressed,” said Bik. “Keeping science honest takes a team effort, and with this support, I want to bring together even more sharp-eyed sleuths to keep research on the right track.<strong>”</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are delighted to partner with Bik, whose work has been so crucial to efforts to clean up the scientific record, to provide administrative support as well as a way donors can support her efforts and earn a tax deduction,” said Ivan Oransky, cofounder of Retraction Watch and executive director of The Center For Scientific Integrity, Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit organization. “We see the Fund fitting extremely well with our efforts at Retraction Watch and the Retraction Watch Database, as well as the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/02/introducing-the-retraction-watch-sleuth-in-residence-program/">Retraction Watch Sleuth In Residence</a> program. We are grateful that Bik has chosen us as a partner and can’t wait to see how much more impact the Fund will allow her to have.”</p>

<p>We hope to grow the Fund to increase its impact. Contributions are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law, and can be made <a href="https://square.link/u/k2uruo0a">here</a> or by check, made out to The Center For Scientific Integrity and sent to 121 W. 36th St., Suite 209, New York, NY 10018, with a note in the memo field saying “Bik Fund.” Should you be in a position to contribute securities, please contact <a href="mailto:ivan@retractionwatch.com">ivan@retractionwatch.com</a> for instructions.</p>
