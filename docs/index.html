                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Susan-Schiffman.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" width="128" height="128" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Susan-Schiffman.jpg?resize=128%2C128&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128987" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Susan Schiffman</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A journal has issued an expression of concern for a 2008 paper suggesting artificial sweetener Splenda could disrupt the gut microbiome and cause other havoc with the gastrointestinal system – and which is cited by a paper at the center of a lawsuit against one of its authors by the maker of the sugar substitute.</p>



<p>The article, “Splenda Alters Gut Microflora and Increases Intestinal P-Glycoprotein and Cytochrome P-450 in Male Rats,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A</em>, a Taylor &amp; Francis title. The journal has a <em>Part B</em>, too, which also is part of this story.</p>



<p>The paper, which has been cited more than 200 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, caught the attention of Elisabeth Bik, who last year <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A7318BB8B79BE174BCCF82C0EDD5CB">commented on the article on PubPeer</a>, noting potential problems with four of the figures, including Western blots and missing error bars. </p>



<span id="more-128986"></span>



<p>Susan Schiffman, the last author of the paper and a psychologist then at Duke University in Durham, N.C., but who has since moved to North Carolina State University in Raleigh, responded to Bik’s post. She said a researcher named in the acknowledgements of the paper had been asked to perform the Western blots “because she is highly skilled and very accurate,” and some of the others figures had included error bars but they made the figure “too busy.” She said she did not have access to the original data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15287394.2024.2321747">the expression of concern</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After publication of this article, questions about the scientific integrity of the article were brought to the Editor’s and Publisher’s attention. We contacted the authors, but have not yet received the required data or supporting materials necessary to complete the investigation. As this investigation may take some time to resolve, we advise readers to interpret the information presented in the article with due caution. The authors have been notified about this Expression of Concern.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last May, <em>Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B </em>published a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10937404.2023.2213903?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">review</a> by Schiffman and several of her colleagues that argued sucralose is “genotoxic” and its presence in the food supply should be the focus of “a regulatory status review.” It also cites the paper that is now subject to an expression of concern.</p>



<p>The May 2023 paper – which has been cited four times – did not please TC Heartland, the maker of Splenda, which <a href="https://www.splenda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-Complaint-Heartland-v-Schiffman.pdf">has sued </a>Schiffman for defamation. Heartland, which brought the case in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, claims Schiffman:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>chose to chase headlines rather than tell the truth. Dr. Schiffman spread falsehoods about Splenda, and in doing so she harmed Heartland and the millions of consumers who rely on Splenda as an important part of achieving their health goals. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper, the company claims, is “dishonest and deeply flawed for numerous reasons,” and “Schiffman’s subsequent claims about Splenda on her press tour were plainly false: Her paper expressly confirms that the sucralose Schiffman claimed to have studied for it was not the sucralose used in Splenda.”</p>



<p>Schiffman and Duke did not respond to requests for comment. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">One more note: The lead author of the article was Mohamed B Abou-Donia,&nbsp; of Duke. That name might be familiar to readers of Retraction Watch from this 2021 post about an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/06/pentagon-funded-duke-research-on-soldier-brain-damage-under-investigation/">investigation</a> at the institution involving three papers on which he was the second of two authors. Abou-Donia died in 2023 of complications of COVID-19, according to Schiffman’s comments on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those articles have all since been retracted with the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/187/11-12/e1501/6596490">same notice</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following an institutional investigation, the journal is retracting this article. The institution determined there is insufficient source documentation to verify either the reliability of the published results or the origins of the samples used. The institution also determined that the first co-author should not have been named as co-author of the article.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> </strong>&#8211; <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-024-06277-6">Effect of early vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of preeclampsia in primigravid women: a randomised clinical trial in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo</a></p>
<p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that affects around 5% of pregnant women globally and it can bring to preterm delivery, low birth weight and even to the death of the mothers and their newborns. The causes of preeclampsia are still largely unknown, however there has been progress in understanding the related pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors. A series of studies have revealed how low vitamin D levels are associated with preeclampsia, although only few studies have been conducted to determine the benefits of maternal–fetal vitamin D supplementation.</p>
<p>In this multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial, the authors evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation administered in early pregnancy on the incidence of PE in 1159 primigravidae in fourteen antenatal care health facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, along with the evaluation of adverse maternal-fetal-neonatal outcomes, such as preterm delivery, birth weight and height, mode of delivery, and APGAR score. The intervention group received a single monthly dose of cholecalciferol (60,000 IU) orally for 6 months, while the control group received no vitamin D supplementation or placebo.</p>
<p>The findings showed a significant reduction in the risk of preeclampsia, preterm and caesarean delivery in the intervention group, with newborns showing a higher APGAR score at the 5th minute in comparison to the control group. This study highlights the importance of monitoring the blood level of vitamins D throughout the pregnancy in the context of antenatal care, to reduce the maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality risks related to PE.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Health Services Research</em></strong> &#8211; <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-023-10492-w">A cost-effectiveness analysis of a universal, preventative-focused, parent and infant programme</a></p>
<p>Parenting support groups through dedicated programmes can enhance parenting skills and parent-child relationships, reducing the risks of inadequate care and abuse. Parents with babies are the best target for these kind of interventions as the earliest childhood years have a critical influence on child development and are responsible for the well-being outcomes in adulthood.</p>
<p>This study explored the cost-effectiveness of a universal early parenting intervention called the Parent and Infant (PIN) programme in an Irish setting when compared to the services as usual (SAU). The PIN was represented by 15 sessions consisting of 106 parent-infant dyads that participated in a series of workshops with the aim to enhance parent knowledge and skills. The SAU group was represented by 84 parent-infant dyads that receive the usual care provided by their local health service. The primary outcome measure for the economic evaluation was the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC).</p>
<p>The authors found that the parents in the PIN programme had positive outcomes in terms of parenting attitudes and that the PIN programme was cost-effective at a relatively low willingness-to-pay threshold when compared to SAU. The average cost of the PIN program was € 647 per dyad. This study provides important information for practitioners and policy makers and promote the debate on the importance of preventative parenting interventions.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Primary Care</em> </strong>&#8211; <a href="https://bmcprimcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-024-02297-5">Project nature: promoting outdoor physical activity in children via primary care</a></p>
<p>In children of all ages, time spent outdoor is associated with an increase of physical activity (PA) and an improvement of physical, mental, and cognitive health. Family circumstances, environmental constraints and behavioral factors, are some of the barriers that parents meet when they try to support their children’s outdoor play.</p>
<p>This study described a primary care-based family-centered behavioral intervention named Project Nature (PN), aimed to promote active outdoor play in children. The first phase, “adaptation needs assessment” was used to understand barriers and facilitators to outdoor play and it was based on qualitative interviews and focus groups with 14 parents with children ages 3-10, and 14 pediatric providers. The second phase, “usability testing”, was used to adapt the existing PN toolkits for children ages 0-3, for older children and it was based on qualitative interviews for 20 parents and 5 clinical staff. The third phase, “pilot evaluation”, evaluated the preliminary efficacy of the adapted PN for older children, using pre-post quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, and included 26 parents of children ages 4-10 years, and 4 pediatric providers.</p>
<p>Both providers and parents found that nature toys and brochure help children and parents to spend more time outdoors. This study highlighted the role of pediatric providers in encouraging outdoor play and the importance to have more policies to increase the number and the quality of the green spaces.</p>

<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the most common technique used to estimate SARS-CoV-2 re-infectious, however the use of this approach solely can bring to an undercount of cases mostly due to testing availability, undermining the confidence in the re-infection rates.</p>
<p>In this longitudinal study the authors used data from a cohort study of 736 individuals experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Canada, between June and September 2021. This population was characterized by a higher COVID-19 infection burden when compared to housed counterparts and was prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination. The participants provided saliva and blood samples every three months. The samples were used respectively for PCR testing or Rapid antigen test (RAT) to test for current SARS-CoV-2 infection and for a plate-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test past SARS-CoV-2 infection/vaccination.</p>
<p>The combined approach with serology and testing data, defined as the comprehensive method, allowed to identify 37.4 re-infection events per 100 person-years, more than four-fold higher than the rate from test-only methods. Considering the short- and long-term health effects of multiple infections, accurate monitoring of re-infection is crucial. The findings of the study showed how the used of comprehensive method is a valuable approach to conduct effective public health surveillance pertinent to SARS-CoV-2 re-infectious.</p>

<p>Machine-learning approach using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has been implemented into routine care and it is now broadly used for patient classification and laboratory measurements, for predicting future hospitalization and in general to build models for their use in research and clinical practice. Diagnostic codes are used to generate clinical prediction models, however there is variability among institutions as each of them use different coding processes and clinical diagnostic practices.</p>
<p>This study addressed the challenge to create a gold standard labeling process for diagnostic codes that can be used across institutions. The authors selected three cohorts, SickKids from The Hospital for Sick Children, and StanfordPeds and StanfordAdults from Stanford Medicine, and they considered seven clinical outcomes for which they created four lab-based labels based on test result and one diagnosis-based label. The five labels were evaluated in each patient admission, with a proportion of admissions with a positive diagnosis-based label significantly higher for StanfordPeds compared to SickKids across all outcomes.</p>
<p>The findings highlight how as results of different diagnostic codes, two children with the same test results can be considered differently at two pediatric institutions, based on the different categorization and labeling of the tests. Although machine learning has the potential to improve the quality of clinical research, clinical institutions should work together to implement uniformed machine learning models.</p>

                <p> <strong>Get to know who&rsquo;s helping lead complex systems research at PLOS. </strong> </p>



<p>We sat down with some of our recently appointed<em> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/">PLOS Complex Systems</a></em> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/s/section-editors">Section Editors</a> to share their thoughts and experiences, more about their current work and research projects, and what motivated them to get involved with our newest journal.</p>



<h3><strong>Matteo Convertino, Tsinghua University, China</strong></h3>



<h4>Section Editor, Climate and Natural Hazards&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong><em>Tell us a little bit about yourself and your current work</em></strong></p>



<p>I&rsquo;m currently involved in structural ecological engineering, centered on ecohydrological networks and flows for the assessment, forecasting and construction of future ecosystems considering climate change and development trajectories. We are largely focused on interfaces (or ecotones) that are essentially all water-dependent ecosystems at the interface between land and water &ndash; think about any coastline (blue carbon ecosystems), riparian areas along rivers, and other areas in between dramatically different habitats including built and natural systems.</p>



<p>I am also working with people in the School of Design to reshape the way we build in eco-symbiosis with natural habitats, in a way their complex structure triggers quantifiable positive hydroclimatic benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The core behind everything we do is for water to be linked to salient species and built environmental components, where the resulting pattern (systemic risk and value) is optimally shaped (plus minus uncertainty and adaptively for the unknown unknowns). So, we are combining engineering, eco-environmental sciences, and risk &amp; decision/design sciences in a complexity perspective to provide detailed plans for restoration and development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, I am involved in ecological information communication (to stakeholders and the wider public) to inform what people do not know and infer their needs and desires. This is important and really embraces a practical ecosystem science of complexity because any pattern/ecological state that arises cannot be defined without people.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why did you decide to get involved with the journal as a Section Editor?</em></strong></p>



<p>The first reason is that I follow opportunities that I feel close to. The combination of complex system methods and models and ecosystem science oriented toward water/climate disasters or ecosystem services, in general, has always been my core work. Therefore, topically the section is central to my activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for why being a Section Editor? I love to believe I can steer the science from the top-down, e.g. trying to promote a journal, journal topics/areas of science that are needed, and potentially also trying to change the world of publishing (for instance promoting the idea of creating shorter pieces to promote the science to the general public and addressing no-funding publications).</p>



<p>Lastly, it is also good to connect with people with similar visions and promote a similar agenda. This is a form of science lobbying that is useful and needed.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<h3><strong>Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci, Tsinghua University, China</strong></h3>



<h4>Section Editor, Concepts in Complexity</h4>



<p><strong><em>Tell us a little bit about yourself and your current work</em></strong></p>



<p>Recently, I have been working to develop new brain- and bio- inspired engineering theories for next-generation artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>More in general, the Center for Complex Network Intelligence (CCNI) &ndash; that I lead &ndash; works to create pioneering algorithms at the interface between information science, physics of complex systems, complex networks and machine intelligence, with a particular focus in brain/life-inspired computing for big data analysis. These computational methods are often applied to precision biomedicine, neuroscience, social, and economic science.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why did you decide to get involved with the journal as a Section Editor?</em></strong></p>



<p>Because I work to develop new complexity-inspired theories for computing and artificial intelligence. This journal is the perfect venue to promote and support such types of research.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/plos.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" width="277" height="182" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/plos.png?resize=277%2C182&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-122703" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>


<p>The megajournal <em>PLOS ONE</em> will be correcting about 1,000 papers over the next few months, Retraction Watch has learned, and will add an author proof step – a first for the journal.</p>



<p>The corrections are for “errors in author names, affiliations, titles and references; to make minor updates to the acknowledgements, funding statements, and data availability statements, among other minor issues,” <em>PLOS ONE</em> head of communications David Knutson told us. He continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This batch of corrections does not reflect a recent change in the journal’s quality control standards or processes. Rather, we are clearing a backlog that accumulated during a 2-year period when minor corrections were deprioritized and resources were diverted to other areas. PLOS ONE is in the process of implementing an author proof step so that in the future such errors can be identified and addressed prior to publication.  </p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-128978"></span>



<p>Longtime Retraction Watch readers may recall that in 2016, a researcher noted <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s correction rate was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/08/05/plos-ones-correction-rate-is-higher-than-average-why/">much higher than that at other journals</a>. He and others chalked that up to the lack of an author proof stage, which is common at other journals. Knutson explained why the journal was reversing the policy:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are moving toward adding this service to authors because the correction request volumes in recent years have tipped the balance to where we have decided to prioritize the resources and time needed for this step in order to preempt minor corrections and ensure readers get correct information at the time of publication. For a megajournal like PLOS ONE, this is not a trivial decision given the publication volume, resources required to support this service, and the impacts of this extra step on time-to-publication which is a priority for the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> distinguishes “standard corrections” from “publication ethics corrections” such as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/09/26/plos-one-retracts-perfume-study-when-data-dont-pass-the-sniff-test/">this one</a> that led to a retraction, Knutson said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The standard corrections typically address reporting or typesetting errors such as typographical errors, broken links (e.g. to datasets with public repositories), or missing funding information. These are the types of corrections represented in the forthcoming large volume batches.</p>



<p>By contrast, publication ethics corrections (such as the one you referenced) address concerns raised about published articles, e.g. involving policy compliance, integrity, or scientific validity issues, which require a different editorial process and for which we may issue corrections, expressions of concern, or retractions depending on the nature, severity, and impact of the issues and the extent to which they can be addressed.</p>

                <p><strong>Author: </strong>Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director, Open Research Solutions, PLOS; and Chris Heid, Head of Product, PLOS</p>



<p><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></p>



<p>Research by PLOS and Research Consulting has found there is a growing need for Open Science Indicators (Open Science monitoring solutions) among some funders and institutions but implementation of monitoring solutions may be limited unless Open Science practices are a strategic priority for organisations. Research data sharing, and code and software sharing, are among the most important Open Science practices to monitor but organisations need information that is compatible with their own structure and nomenclature to be usable, which is not available currently. In the future Open Science Indicators need to monitor not just prevalence but also the effects or qualities of Open Science practices.</p>



<p><em><strong>What did we want to know and why?</strong></em></p>



<p>PLOS <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">launched Open Science Indicators</a> (OSI) in 2022 with DataSeer to support our goal to increase adoption of Open Science practices beyond open access to research articles. Previous research <a href="https://osf.io/z4py9/">by PLOS</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/3401278">others</a> has identified a similar Open Science &ldquo;measurement problem&rdquo; among funders and institutions, and a lack of suitable solutions to solve this problem. While OSI was designed to support PLOS&rsquo;s needs, sharing the OSI data and methods openly is a way to positively influence Open Science activities outside of PLOS. This Open Science approach to OSI has been reflected in numerous reuses of the OSI dataset and results &ndash; by funders, <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8117154">governmental committees</a>, <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2023/02/16/preparing-for-open-science-indicators/">institutions</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/ajhs4/">researchers</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04121339v2">solution developers</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002516">journals</a>. Therefore, we wanted to learn more about the problem of monitoring Open Science practices from the perspective of funders and institutions &ndash; and the extent to which OSI or other solutions might help to solve it.</p>



<p><em><strong>How did we find out?</strong></em></p>



<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.research-consulting.com/">Research Consulting</a> in the UK, between October and December 2023 we conducted a series of interviews with 24 representatives of 5 research funders and 10 institutions*, followed by 2 focus groups.</p>



<p><em><strong>What did we learn?</strong></em></p>



<p>Our interviews confirmed that, among our cohort at least, interest in Open Science (Research) Indicators is growing, and we confirmed an emerging link between Open Science practices and the quality and reliability of research &ndash; as shown for example by the <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8117154">UK Committee on Research Integrity&rsquo;s interest in these indicators</a>.</p>



<p>Of the various Open Science practices &ndash; beyond open access to research articles &ndash; that may be important to monitor, interest was greatest in research data sharing; code and software sharing, and the quality or &ldquo;<a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIRness</a>&rdquo; of data and metadata. This aligns to some extent with findings of previous research, with the exception of the Open Science practice of study registration (preregistration), which was the highest priority in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001949">a peer-reviewed study targeted at the biomedical research</a> field.</p>



<p><strong><em>Figure</em></strong><em>: Relative importance of 6 Open Science Indicators that emerged from our interviews, ranked during the focus groups</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="723" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/OSI-chart-1024x723.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22294" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/OSI-chart-1024x723.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/OSI-chart-300x212.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/OSI-chart-768x542.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/OSI-chart-1536x1084.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/OSI-chart.png 1758w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Open Science Indicators are being used by the senior leadership of a minority of funders and institutions we interviewed, to track the effects of, or to develop, open science plans and policies. While &ldquo;compliance monitoring&rdquo; could imply punitive outcomes for non-compliance, this isn&rsquo;t the case. The intent of such activities is to identify where researcher or institutional support is needed&nbsp; &ndash; in line with how OSIs are being used at PLOS, to promote improvements in practice. For institutions in particular, Open Science Indicators are also being used at a more functional or departmental level, such as to make a case for budget or to provide training. Indeed, attention on Open Science practice is more likely to be at a &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; or department, rather than senior leadership level, and many organisations would support making Open Science more of a strategic priority. This desire for greater priority, or resources, for Open Science practices echoes what PLOS has heard from representatives of other publishers who want to see better practice in research data sharing and policy at their journals.</p>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.openresearch.manchester.ac.uk/support/tracker/">institutions</a> and <a href="https://avointiede.fi/en/policies-materials/monitoring/monitoring-results-2022">funders</a> have been experimenting with monitoring solutions but participants in our research reported difficulties in gathering sufficiently comprehensive or detailed information to meet their needs. Resources such as PLOS Open Science Indicators could form part of an Open Science monitoring solution for funders and institutions, but a complete solution would require more comprehensive coverage of an organisation&rsquo;s research outputs and greater metadata quality that allows users to view the results according to their organisation&rsquo;s structure. Also, being able to benchmark an organisation against a relevant comparator organisation or group is important &ndash; to give context to results and help make a case for intervention, while avoiding the (re)creation of institutional rankings on the information.</p>



<p>Our focus groups revealed several desirable characteristics of monitoring solutions that would make them more trustworthy to their users. These included:</p>



<ul><li>Endorsement and recognition from a range of sector stakeholders</li><li>Transparency of data sources, data collection methods, datasets and analysis</li><li>Clear OSI definitions and specifications</li><li>Coverage of a large number of organisations</li><li>Use of open infrastructure based on Open Science principles</li></ul>



<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>



<p>While PLOS Open Science Indicators is not a product or service as such, it&rsquo;s crucial for PLOS to understand the needs of our stakeholders and customers who share a desire to increase adoption of Open Science &ndash; if this is to be achieved beyond content published in PLOS&rsquo; journals, which is our aim. PLOS is involved in several initiatives in the burgeoning Open Science monitoring space including a <a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/building-an-open-science-monitoring-framework-with-open-technologies-unesco-workshop-19-12-23/">new initiative led by the French Open Science Monitor in collaboration with UNESCO</a>. Also, in collaboration with DataSeer and others, we are developing <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/2023/12/15/reflections-on-ukrn-open-research-indicators-work-so-far/">Open Research indicator pilots for UK institutions &ndash; led by the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN)</a>. The insights from this research are informing how we are approaching collaboration with these community initiatives. The results have also been influential in our 2024 plans for OSI, in terms of what new features or indicators to consider and in improvements to data quality &ndash; for users at and outside of PLOS.</p>



<p>A theme from our findings and what we are hearing from research institutions in our collaborations with the UKRN is a need to think beyond the <em>prevalence </em>of Open Science practices &ndash; to the <em>effects and qualities</em> of those practices. This is also in line with the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889">original principles and concept for OSI</a> or, to use another widely adopted framework that informed OSI, the &lsquo;Interoperable&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reusable&rsquo; (I and R) parts of <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">the FAIR acronym</a>. Watch this space for more information on work already underway to better understand the effects of Open Science practices.</p>



<p><em><strong>Limitations of our findings</strong></em></p>



<p>We did not target particular research topics or disciplines in these discussions, but did focus on funders and institutions in the US and Europe, where Open Science policies may lend themselves to a potential need to monitor Open Science. As such our findings are not representative of all funders and institutions, and likely reflect the views of early adopters and innovators in this area.</p>

<p>A journal has retracted, over the objections of the authors, a controversial 2023 paper claiming a dig site in Indonesia is home to the largest pyramid built by humans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work was led by the Indonesian geologist-cum-archeologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Hilman_Natawidjaja">Danny Hilman Natawidjaja</a>, of the Research Center for Natural Disasters in Bandung.</p>



<p>Hilman has been working <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunung_Padang">at the site</a> in Java for <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/digging-for-the-truth-at-controversial-megalithic-site-20130726-2qphb.html">many years</a> in his quest to prove it contains the ruins of a massive pyramid built by an advanced culture between 9,000 and 27,000 years ago. Hilman has also tried to link the site to the l<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PLATO-NEVER-LIED-ATLANTIS-INDONESIA-ebook/dp/B00I3SIFRQ">ost city of Atlantis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the notion that Gunung Padang is the mother of all pyramids – and, according to Hilman, the world’s oldest building – has been dismissed by some as “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180505213518/https://webs.ucm.es/info/arqueoweb/pdf/18/04_PerezGarcia.pdf">pseudoarchaeology</a>,”</p>



<span id="more-128975"></span>



<p>The paper, “Geo-Archaeological prospecting of Gunung Padang buried prehistoric pyramid in West Java, Indonesia”, attracted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/16/really-really-weak-experts-attack-claim-that-indonesia-site-is-worlds-oldest-building">mounds of critical attention</a> when it appeared last October in&nbsp; <em>Archaeological Prospection</em>, a Wiley title. Among the skeptics was <a href="https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/dibblew">Flint Dibble</a>, an archeologist who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxaHo3V4lGg">reviewed the research</a> on his YouTube channel in February.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the abstract of the article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Radiocarbon dating of organic soils from the structures uncovered multiple construction stages dating back thousands of years BCE, with the initial phase dating to the Palaeolithic era. These findings offer valuable insights into the construction history of Gunung Padang, shedding light on the engineering capabilities of ancient civilizations during the Palaeolithic era.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1932">retraction notice</a> states, the dating appears to have been fatally flawed:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following publication of this article, concerns were raised by third parties with expertise in geophysics, archaeology, and radiocarbon dating, about the conclusions drawn by the authors based on the evidence reported. The publisher and the Co-Editors-in-Chief have investigated these concerns and have concluded that the article contains a major error. This error, which was not identified during peer review, is that the radiocarbon dating was applied to soil samples that were not associated with any artifacts or features that could be reliably interpreted as anthropogenic or “man-made.” Therefore, the interpretation that the site is an ancient pyramid built 9000 or more years ago is incorrect, and the article must be retracted. Danny Hilman Natawidjaja responded on behalf of the authors, all of whom disagree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>News of the retraction was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/science/indonesia-oldest-pyramid-gunung-padang.html">first reported earlier today</a> by <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>



<p>Hilman, who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dannyhilman.natawidjaja/posts/10221568918126201">posted a response</a> to the retraction on Facebook – along with a Dropbox folder with materials he believes supports the validity of the work – told us he and his colleagues “are baffled” by the journal’s decision:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>we disagree because they (the Wiley Team) did not even care to give us sufficient evidence and scientific rationale to support the alleged major error.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Facebook, the researchers wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Was the decision to retract our paper a severe form of censorship, blatantly disregarding the fundamental principles of scientific inquiry, transparency, and fairness in academic discourse?</p>



<p>We urge the academic community, scientific organizations, and concerned individuals to stand with us in challenging this decision and upholding the principles of integrity, transparency, and fairness in scientific research and publishing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We caught up with Dibble in Greece. He told us the conclusion in particular doesn&#8217;t &#8220;really match any of the actual evidence presented in the body of the paper.&#8221; He also speculated that the peer reviewers may have been focused on their own areas of interest and not able to see the larger picture:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A wide range of methods were presented in the paper, so there wouldn&#8217;t really be many people who were familiar with all those methods in addition to the local archaeological context. It does seem likely that none of the reviewers were familiar with that archaeological context at all. And, that&#8217;s an issue for sure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dibble noted that he could think of only one similar retraction in the field of archeology, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/21/journal-investigating-sodom-comet-paper-for-data-problems/">2022 article</a> about an ancient airburst:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;m guessing these two papers were retracted because the journal editors felt embarrassed for having published pieces whose conclusions were sorely lacking in evidence. But, that&#8217;s just a guess? It&#8217;s so uncommon. In both cases, authors on these teams were associated with more prominent pseudoarchaeological ideas. So, that might also have something to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On X, in a thread worth reading, Dibble also <a href="https://twitter.com/FlintDibble/status/1770428110116196596">expressed annoyance</a> at the journal (and the media coverage of the article and its aftermath) for focusing on what isn’t as opposed to what is known about Gunung Padang – knowledge generated by other archeologists:&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Inspired by neurodiversity celebration week, we are starting a new series, Bridging the Gap! For each post, we will have a conversation with a woman in neuroscience to discuss the gaps and the health inequalities relating to different areas of neuroscience, as well as the exciting new research that is attempting to bridge these gaps. First up, we have Dr Jessica Agnew-Blais, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Queen Mary University of London. In our interview, Dr Agnew-Blais shared with us her opinions and expertise on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or “ADHD”, and on the importance of investigating it more in women.</strong></p>

Its symptoms are broad, but the core traits are considered to be restlessness or hyperactivity, difficulties concentrating and impulsivity, although not everyone experiences all of these. Usually these characteristics are observed during childhood, which leads to the diagnosis of the majority of cases during the early years, especially in males. However, an increasing number of women are being diagnosed later in life, during early adulthood. This observation is slowly contributing to a shift in the conceptualisation of ADHD and it has highlighted the need to improve our understanding. The Medical Research Council (MRC) has recently prompted the initiation of new projects, <a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/new-studies-aim-to-bridge-knowledge-gap-in-adhd/" target="_blank" >,,<u>aimed at further investigating ADHD</u></a>. Dr Jessica Agnew-Blais is one of the MRC awarded researchers and talked to us about her work on ADHD in women.</p>


<p><strong>Could you tell us about your research on ADHD and what inspired you to investigate this?</strong></p>

<p>At the very beginning, I was investigating how ADHD changes when we grow up. I was working on a study called ‘E-RISK study’, which is a UK-based longitudinal twin cohort study that follows people from when they were born and assesses them at four different times during childhood. I was working with them when [the subjects] were 18 years old and we found that a lot of people that had met ADHD criteria at age 18 - showing high levels of symptoms and high levels of impairments - had not met the criteria when they were kids. This was very surprising because ADHD is supposed to have an early onset in childhood and having symptoms as a kid is actually part of the diagnosis. It was a bit of a mystery seeing all these people that seemed to have ADHD symptoms when they were young adults but not when they were kids, at least according to the parents and teachers that were rating their symptoms at the time. Interestingly, one thing that we identified about this group of late ADHD people, is that they tended to be women. So that’s what got me thinking: “What’s going on in women with ADHD? Are people not picking up on their symptoms when they are kids?” If we look across different population surveys, generally we do see more boys than girls being diagnosed during childhood. However, if we look during adulthood, the ratio is more even. That means that more women are diagnosed when they are adults and I really wanted to understand why this is the case! </p>

<p>So for part of my project, we will use longitudinal cohorts, based in Bristol, to look at the childhood characteristics of women that have a late recognition, or late emergence, of ADHD. The idea is to try and understand if there are things that could be identified in women with ADHD that are being missed when they are kids, or if there are any exacerbating factors occurring during teenage years that are making their ADHD more obvious in young adulthood. A second part of the project will then look in detail into adolescence and puberty. Using, this time, a US-based cohort, we want to understand: “Is there maybe a subgroup of girls for whom symptoms might actually get worse in adolescence?” Maybe there is! No one really knows or has looked at this before.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a third aspect of the project. The idea for it actually came from twitter, when I saw women saying that, at certain times of their menstrual cycle, their ADHD symptoms were worse and their medication didn’t work as well. I found that strange and I started looking if there was any research on that…there was nothing! I thought, “Well, that’s a problem!” So for this study, we will recruit women and follow them for three months while they do daily questionnaires about their ADHD symptoms and other related things, such as irritability, brain fog and fatigue. In the meantime, we will track their menstrual cycle and try to see if there are changes in the levels of ADHD symptoms and impairments across the cycle. Generally oestrogen declines during the menstrual period and low oestrogen is associated with lower dopamine availability. As we know that dopamine plays a key role in ADHD, and in stimulant medications, it would make sense that drops in oestrogen might lead to an impact on ADHD symptoms and medication.</p>


<p><strong>You mentioned that, in general, boys are diagnosed earlier than girls. What would you say are the main reasons for such a big gap in ADHD diagnoses between men and women?</strong></p>

<p>I think there are many reasons. One is that there is still a bias thinking that ADHD is a male disorder. I think that if there is a gender bias in how clinicians, teachers or parents perceive kids, this could lead to under-diagnosing some kids. For example, we see a tendency for girls with ADHD to have more inattentive symptoms or less comorbid conduct problems. As a result, these girls might be less troublesome and less disruptive. If you are a teacher and you are prioritising who to refer for an assessment, you might notice a really disruptive kid that is messing with the classroom rather than the daydreaming girl that maybe is not concentrating as much as she should, but is not creating disruptions. I also think there is a fundamental issue in a lot of studies in which the symptoms were described largely in boys. As a result, even the way symptoms are described could be gendered. We don’t know if, in girls, these symptoms reflect ADHD in the same way as in boys and there could be subtle differences in the way they are presented. For example, girls, driven also by some cultural expectations, may be more likely to express hyperactivity through talkativeness and verbal impulsivity, as opposed to physical impulsivity. The same cultural expectations may pressure girls to conform to a sort of level of agreeableness, especially maybe in the classroom. As a result, girls might end up making a lot of effort to mask their symptoms, compensate for them and be more social, and for this reason, people may not notice their ADHD as much.  </p>


<p><strong>How do you think delaying diagnosis affects how women experience ADHD and are impaired by it?</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s a really profound problem. While I was designing this study, I talked to a lot of women that had been diagnosed with ADHD as adults but had received a lot of other diagnoses before, like for depression, borderline personality disorder or anxiety. This means they had to wait for years to be finally given a very effective treatment. I would say that delaying appropriate medications is definitely a negative effect of under-diagnosing women.</p>
<p>I also think that a lot of women developed a negative self-concept because they didn’t know they had ADHD. They would tell me they thought there was something wrong about them, or that they were a bad kid, or daughter or student, or that they were stupid and that they felt bad about themselves. They were kind of attributing all their symptoms to something negative about themselves because they had not received a diagnosis. Because of that, they had low self-esteem and maybe all these negative things about themselves, swirling around, were even contributing to the depressive feelings. A lot of women end up looking back and feeling sad for all the things they could have done, or done better, if they had had that self-knowledge and that treatment. I think there is a feeling of regret and sadness for their younger self that had not received the right support. </p>


<p><strong>So, how do you think that research methodologies and questions could be changed to investigate, more accurately, ADHD in women and girls?</strong></p>

<p>On a basic level, we have to make sure to include women and girls in the studies because, even now, sometimes that doesn’t happen and that’s a fundamental issue. There is also some work being done to adapt some of the questionnaires to be more appropriate for women. For example, a researcher from the Netherlands, named Sandra Kooij, is adapting for women some of the questions of the DIVA, one of the adult ADHD diagnostic interviews. One of the things she’s including in this interview is asking people what part of the menstrual cycle they are in. Because, if your menstrual cycle affects your symptoms levels, and you do the interview when you are at the lower level of your symptoms, it may not capture the full picture of what your symptoms are like. I thought that was very interesting because, for my study, I was thinking about how people that had already been diagnosed are affected by hormonal fluctuations, while she took it a step further saying even when you are assessing somebody, you might want to know what part of the cycle they are in.</p>

<p>Then, in terms of issues that are relevant to women and should be taken into consideration investigating ADHD, one thing that comes up a lot is pregnancy and the pre- and post-natal period. Oftentimes, women are advised to stop their medication when they are trying to get pregnant. For people that have been relying on medication for a long time, that could be very difficult and they are not really provided with a lot of other means of support. On top of that, getting pregnant could take a long time, and with the 9 months of pregnancy and the breastfeeding period, it could add up to years with women not getting their treatment and this is not something that has been very well addressed. </p>

<p>Another noteworthy thing is perimenopause and menopause. A lot of older women I talked to felt like the hormonal changes during that period were exacerbating their ADHD symptoms. This is completely under-researched and I hope to look at these symptom changes during the menopausal transition, with a new PhD student, because this was the number one issue raised by the women I talked to. In general, I would say that these things that are more ‘women-specific’ just aren’t investigated in ADHD research, which is actually common to a bunch of other health issues. </p>


<p><strong>You talked about how women might not show ADHD symptoms during their childhood, how hormonal factors could influence that and how current diagnostic tests might not be able to pick up on this. You also mentioned women being asked to stop taking medications during pregnancy. So in relation to these things, how could clinical and diagnostic practices be modified in a useful way to address women?</strong></p>

<p>I really wrestle with the requirements of childhood onset. People may be looking for a diagnosis when they are adults, and some clinicians ask for their primary school records, or to talk to their parents or their teachers. Maybe the patients are 50 years old, they can’t provide those written records or evidence anymore. I understand that if they never had any issue for all their life and suddenly they do, the clinician might want to check for other neurological things but I don’t think it’s very useful to ask for evidence that other people thought they had ADHD as kids, because teachers and parents might not have noticed. We know that, and the thing that is frustrating, from the perspective of a researcher, is that a lot of these things that we know, don’t necessarily get translated into a clinical environment. For example, I was talking to a student who waited for ages to get her NHS assessment for ADHD and she was told she could not have ADHD because she went to university and had a master’s degree. That is absolutely not true! I hope, with this new research, to have an element of clinical education, not only for the end person that is doing the assessment, but also for the GP and for the people earlier on that have to do all these referrals. Just because someone is functional, it doesn’t mean that they are functioning the best for themselves or that they are not struggling. Just because ‘on paper’ a woman made it to university, that doesn’t necessarily mean she can’t have ADHD. I find that so frustrating and I understand, on some level, why the childhood onset criteria is there, but I don’t know if there is much utility for it, and denying someone treatment because they don’t have teacher reports (saying that they were hyperactive) is not a good strategy.</p>


<p><strong>Would you say that the general understanding and perception of ADHD is changing lately, and if so, how?</strong></p>

<p>I think there is a better recognition, now, of the fact that girls and women can have ADHD. A lot of studies that looked at medication use found that there are a lot more women getting prescribed with ADHD medications than in the previous years. I also think now ADHD is not necessarily viewed as a deficit. It’s not to say that people might not need support and treatment, but I think the whole neurodiversity movement started an important change in saying, “We don’t need to be fixed, there are things in the environment that can be adapted better for people with different neurodiversities''. Also, I think it’s really good that now a lot of funders, like UKRI, require that you have people who have lived experience as part of designing your research. I have a panel of women who have ADHD who advise on the questionnaire and the study design. It’s amazing, they are just fabulous and so insightful. The research has so much improved by incorporating the thoughts and the feedback of women who actually have ADHD. It is a key, positive step to involve them, because you don’t want to do some research that is not going to end up being relevant to people, asking the right questions or asking them the right way.</p>


<p><strong>Speaking of research, what do you think are the most exciting future prospects that you can see happening in ADHD research?</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s important to investigate more time and hormonal transitions. There is also an exciting, growing recognition that we need to study more ADHD in adults. For example, I am working with a colleague in Edinburgh to research neurodivergent parents and how being neurodivergent can affect your parenting. A lot of research tends to be about the kids and it ignores the fact that those same people with ADHD grow up. In general, I would also say that we used to think of ADHD as very static. However, increasingly, we are seeing more work looking at how much symptoms and impairments can change depending on the context and the demands that are placed on the person with ADHD. For a long time I think there was a bit of a pushback against the idea that context can matter. One of the reasons for this may be that, before, a lot of people wouldn’t believe that ADHD even existed, so researchers and clinicians were trying to address this by saying, “No, it’s a brain disorder, it exists and it doesn’t change ''. Instead now, we are recognising more and more that yes, it is in the brain but that doesn’t mean that the social context you are in, or what you are experiencing, or where you are in your life - for example, if you are going through an hormonal transition - all these things, can impact you, your symptoms and your functioning. I would say this leads to an interesting and new complexity around ADHD and ADHD research.</p>


<p><strong>Thank you, this was all very interesting and insightful. I would just like to conclude by asking you, what advice would you give to women that have just been diagnosed or are attempting to receive a diagnosis?</strong></p>

<p>My first advice would be: if you are attempting to receive a diagnosis, don’t give up in the meantime, because it can take a long time. A lot of women I talked to, even after getting a diagnosis and maybe some medications, they didn’t necessarily feel like they got a lot of support after that. They told me: “I didn’t feel like I had a roadmap for what to do'' or “I learned more from this Facebook group of women with ADHD than I did from my clinician”. Indeed, a lot of the support that women get comes from other individuals with ADHD through, for example, blogs, groups and podcasts that help them with practical advice, strategies and insights. It is super useful to have these less formal kinds of support and this community that offers both emotional and instrumental support. </p>

<p>A journal has retracted a controversial 2010 article on intelligence and infections that was based on data gathered decades ago by a now-deceased researcher who <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43768132">lost his emeritus status in 2018</a> after students said his work was racist and sexist.</p>



<p>The article, “Parasite prevalence and the worldwide distribution of cognitive ability’, was published in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>, by a group at the University of New Mexico. Their claim, according to the <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2010.0973">abstract</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The worldwide distribution of cognitive ability is determined in part by variation in the intensity of infectious diseases. From an energetics standpoint, a developing human will have difficulty building a brain and fighting off infectious diseases at the same time, as both are very metabolically costly tasks.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Overlaying average national IQ with parasitic stress, they found “robust worldwide” correlations in five of six regions of the globe:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128943"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Infectious disease remains the most powerful predictor of average national IQ when temperature, distance from Africa, gross domestic product per capita and several measures of education are controlled for. These findings suggest that the Flynn effect [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">which posits that average national IQs increase over time</a>] may be caused in part by the decrease in the intensity of infectious diseases as nations develop.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The study – and a related paper by a different group of authors – caught the attention of the popular science media. The <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/why-is-average-iq-higher-in-massachusetts-than-louisiana/2011/09/16/gIQA7P3UXK_blog.html">covered the research</a> (pointing out some shortcomings), as did <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/do-parasites-make-you-dumber"><em>Science</em></a>, and the lead author, Christopher Eppig, wrote about it for <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-average-iq-higher-in-some-places/"><em>Scientific American</em></a>. In that article, Eppig wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In our 2010 study, we not only found a very strong relationship between levels of infectious disease and IQ, but controlling for the effects of education, national wealth, temperature, and distance from sub-Saharan Africa, infectious disease emerged as the best predictor of the bunch. A recent study by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000572">Christopher Hassall and Thomas Sherratt</a> repeated our analysis using more sophisticated statistical methods, and concluded that infectious disease may be the only really important predictor of average national IQ.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But as the <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.0463">journal notes in the retraction</a>, Eppig and his colleagues based their study on an analysis of data published in 2004 by Tatu Vanhanen and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lynn">Richard Lynn</a>, who died in 2023: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following the publication of this article, Proceedings B was recently made aware of potential problems with the underpinning datasets used in the analyses, which were drawn from published sources [<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.0463#RSPB20240463C1">1</a>,<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.0463#RSPB20240463C2">2</a>]. The editors&#8217; attention was drawn to the fact that the datasets on between-country variation in IQ had been the subject of several critiques claiming that they contain substantial inaccuracies and biases that throw substantial doubt on inferences made from them, and that these problems had not been resolved in revised versions of the dataset used by Eppig and colleagues. Upon detailed scrutiny, the editors found these claims to be convincing and asked Eppig and colleagues for their response. While the authors acknowledged at least some of the claimed flaws, they maintained that the inferences from the data were nevertheless reliable.</p>



<p>Proceedings B publishes research of outstanding scientific excellence and importance, conforming to recognized standards of scientific procedure in terms of methodology and ethical standards. Journal policy stipulates retraction where editors have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable (and may invalidate the conclusions of the paper). After carefully considering the dataset, the critiques, the authors’ response and the potential harms created by using a dataset that appears to portray human populations in some geographical regions as of below normal intelligence on average, the editors concluded that the manifest problems in the data warranted retraction in order to uphold these standards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lynn’s career, and views, have been highly visible for many years in the United States in the United Kingdom, where he worked. In 2018, Ulster University, where he was a professor emeritus, agreed to demands from students that the school revoke his academic status – news covered by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43768132"><em>BBC </em></a>among other outlets (including <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/08/08/prof-who-lost-emeritus-status-for-views-on-race-and-intelligence-has-paper-flagged/">this one</a>).<br><br>We emailed the chief editor of the journal, and received a reply from a spokesperson for the Royal Society, who told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In July 2023, the editorial team was made aware of criticism about the dataset used by Eppig et al. in a 2010 paper in Proceedings B. After considering a wide array of evidence, including the original data set, subsequent critiques and the authors’ response, the editors concluded problems with the study were sufficient to call its conclusions into question and warrant retraction.<br><br>The decision to retract was made in January 2024, and the authors were informed at that time, the spokesperson added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Randy Thornill, the last author of the paper, did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">So what about the other paper that used Vanhanen and Lynn&#8217;s data? Hassall and Sherratt told us that in light of the retraction, they would ask <em>Intelligence</em>, where they published their paper in 2011, to revisit the research. Hassall, of the University of Leeds, in England, told us: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our paper was really focused on statistical issues when looking at spatial patterns in anything, but with IQ data as a case study (prompted by the fact that Eppig et al (and many others) were doing these kinds of analyses). As a result, I’d be hesitant to retract the whole thing as it has value as (and was always intended as) a methodological contribution.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, both researchers agreed the journal ought to do something to indicate the work was potentially fraught. Hassall said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>researchers are clearly using our work to support the idea of an IQ-disease link.</p>



<p>Taken together, it’s a complicated picture:</p>



<ol>
<li>The point of our paper is the method and the method is sound and important, independent of data</li>



<li>Our analysis yields quantitatively the same conclusions whether based on a problematic dataset (IQ) or on a robust dataset (PISA) that is measuring something similar</li>



<li>Researchers cite our work sometimes for the methods and sometimes for the (potentially questionable) results.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>



<p>Sherratt, of Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While our paper does a service by educating researchers on why autocorrelation matters and how to address it, at very least there needs to be a “public health warning” on the data set on which our methods paper is based. We should insist on this. A corrigendum might do the trick if it is seen whenever a reader views our paper … The fear is that if we don’t do anything then, now that Epigg et al. (2010) has been taken out of circulation, our paper can still be used to provide general support for the relationship!</p>

                <p><em>How does the role of NUAK1 tau phosphorylation differ within mouse and human brains, and why could inhibiting this enzyme open the door to future therapeutics within Alzheimer’s disease research?</em></p>

<p>A new paper published by the journal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10766794/" target="_blank" >Acta Neuropathologica</a> has highlighted a possible driver of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease is the <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" >most common form of dementia</a> worldwide, encompassing a range of symptoms such as memory loss, that contributes to cognitive decline within individuals. Since age is the <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors#:~:text=The%20greatest%20known%20risk%20factor,Alzheimer's%20doubles%20every%20five%20years." target="_blank" >greatest risk factor</a> to developing the disease, it is most widespread in people aged over 65. With more people living longer due to advances in global healthcare systems, the number of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease is <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/facts-media#:~:text=There%20are%2055%20million%20people,to%20139%20million%20by%202050." target="_blank" >set to increase</a>. As there is no cure, recent advancements in <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/three-promising-drugs-for-treating-alzheimers-disease-bring-fresh-hope#:~:text=Lecanemab%20was%20fully%20approved%20by,Alzheimer's%20disease%20in%20July%202023." target="_blank" >disease-modifying treatments</a> are the only possible therapies shown to slow down the progression of the disease.</p>
<blockquote>"Phospho-tau 356 appears to correlate with Alzheimer’s disease progression"</blockquote>
<p>Neurons within Alzheimer’s disease <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" >fail to communicate</a> properly due to a build up of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, resulting in neuronal cell death. These tau tangles are made up of hyperphosphorylated tau. Enzymes, known as kinases, can regulate the turnover of tau by phosphorylating the protein. One kinase in particular, named NUAK1, is responsible for generating a type of phospho-tau 356.</p>

<p>Recently, researchers at the <a href="https://ukdri.ac.uk/news-and-events/study-uncovers-potential-driver-of-alzheimers-disease-progression#:~:text=A%20study%20led%20by%20Dr,the%20development%20of%20future%20therapeutics" target="_blank" >UKDRI University of Edinburgh</a> used high resolution imaging to find that levels of phospho-tau 356 correlated with Alzheimer’s disease progression within human post-mortem brains. It was noted that post-mortem brains at later disease staging had higher levels of phospho-tau 356. Moreover, phospho-tau 356 was found within the between the synapses of neurons in post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease patients, near neurofibrillary tangles, possibly disrupting cell-to-cell communication. Therefore, phospho-tau 356 appears to correlate with Alzheimer’s disease progression.</p>

<p>Next, scientists blocked the action of NUAK1 by using an inhibitory drug. By using mouse brain slice cultures, the overall tau levels decreased both in the neuron and within the synapse itself. However, when used on valuable left-over human brain tissue from tumour removal surgery, the drug demonstrated more specificity compared to mice brain slices, by selectively lowering phospho-tau 356 levels alone.</p>

<p>Overall, these findings have determined that phosphor-tau 356 correlates with Alzheimer’s disease progression, with higher levels of phospho-tau associated with more severe Alzheimer’s disease cases post-mortem. Thus, phospho-tau 356 could be a future therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease via inhibiting NUAK1 enzyme activity. Finally, this study highlighted differences in tau turnover from NUAK1 activity within both mouse and human brain tissue; indicating the importance of translating animal research into human therapies.</p>

On the other hand, there is the meaningless, purposeless universe of secular atheism. However, I’ve come to think both views are inadequate, as both have things they can’t explain about reality. In my view, the evidence we currently have points to the universe having purpose but one that exists in the absence of the traditional God.</p><p>The theistic worldview struggles to explain suffering, particularly in the natural world. Why would a loving, all-powerful God choose to create the North American long-tailed shrew that paralyses its prey and then slowly eats it alive over several days before it dies from its wounds? Theologians have tried to argue that there are certain good things that exist in our world that couldn’t exist in a world with less suffering, such as serious moral choices, or opportunities to show courage or compassion. But even if that’s right, it’s not clear that our creator has the right to kill and maim—by choosing to create hurricanes and disease, for example—in order, say, to provide the opportunity to show courage. A classic objection to crude forms of utilitarianism considers the possibility of a doctor who has the option of kidnapping and killing one healthy patient in order to save the lives of five other patients: giving the heart to one, the kidneys to another, and so on. Perhaps this doctor could increase the amount of well-being in the world through this action: saving five lives at the cost of one. Even so, many feel that the doctor doesn’t have the right to take the life of the healthy person, even for a good purpose. Likewise, I think it would be wrong for a cosmic creator to infringe on the right to life and security of so many by creating earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters.</p><p>Looking at the other side of the coin, the secular atheist belief in a meaningless, purposeless universe struggles to explain the fine-tuning of physics for life. This is the recent discovery that for life to be possible, certain numbers in physics had to fall in a certain, very narrow range. If the strength of dark energy—the force that powers the expansion of the universe—had been a little bit stronger, no two particles would have ever met, meaning no stars, no planets, no structural complexity at all. If, on the other hand, it had been significantly weaker, it would not have counteracted gravity, and the universe would have collapsed back on itself a split second after the big bang. For life to be possible, the strength of dark energy had to be—like Goldilocks&#8217; porridge—just right.</p><p>For a long time, I thought the multiverse was the best explanation of the fine-tuning of physics for life. If enough people play the lottery, it becomes likely that someone’s going to get the right numbers to win. Likewise, if there are enough universes, with enough variety in the numbers in their ‘local physics,’ then statistically it becomes highly probable that one of them is going to fluke the right numbers for life to exist.</p><p>However, I have been persuaded by philosophers of probability that the attempt to explain fine-tuning in terms of a multiverse violates a very important principle in probabilistic reasoning, known as the “Total Evidence Requirement.” This is the principle that you should always work with the most specific evidence you have. If the prosecution tells the jury that Jack always carries a knife around with him, when they know full well that he always carries a <em>butter</em> knife around with him, then they have misled to jury—not by <em>lying</em>, but by giving them less specific evidence than is available.</p><p>The multiverse theorist violates this principle by working with the evidence that <em>a</em> universe is fine-tuned, rather than the more specific evidence we have available, namely that <em>this </em>universe is fine-tuned. According to the standard account of the multiverse, the numbers in our physics were determined by probabilistic processes very early in its existence. These probabilistic processes make it highly unlikely that any particular universe will be fine-tuned, even though if there are enough universes one of them will probably end up fine-tuned. However, we are obliged by the Total Evidence Requirement to work with the evidence that <em>this </em>universe in particular is fine-tuned, and the multiverse theory fails to explain this data.</p><p>This is all a bit abstract, so let’s take a concrete example. Suppose you walk into a forest and happen upon a monkey typing in perfect English. This needs explaining. Maybe it’s a trained monkey. Maybe it’s a robot. Maybe you’re hallucinating. What would <em>not</em> explain the data is postulating millions of other monkeys on other planets elsewhere in the universe, who are mostly typing nonsense. Why not? Because, in line with the Requirement of Total Evidence, your evidence is not that <em>some </em>monkey is typing English but that <em>this</em> monkey is typing in English.</p><p>In my view, we face a stark choice. Either it is an incredible fluke that these numbers in our physics are just right for life, or these numbers are as they are <em>because</em> they are the right numbers for life, in other words, that there is some kind of “cosmic purpose” or goal-directedness towards life at the fundamental level of reality. The former option is too improbable to take seriously. The only rational option remaining is to embrace cosmic purpose.</p><p>Theism cannot explain suffering. Atheism cannot explain fine-tuning. Only cosmic purpose in the absence of God can accommodate both of these data-points.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/873689576/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/873689576/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f03%2fGoffBlogBanner-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/02/african-american-religions-and-the-voodoo-label/">African American religions and the voodoo label</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/03/chewing-the-cud-and-ruminating-on-word-origins/">Chewing the cud and ruminating on word origins</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/03/unheard-voices-overcoming-barriers-in-womens-music-composition/">Unheard voices: overcoming barriers in women&#x2019;s music composition</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/spotlight-on-laura-elin-pigott">Spotlight on: Laura Elin Pigott</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>We are back with our 'spotlight on' interview series, shedding light on inspiring women working in the field of neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. The questions posed to these individuals explore the themes of job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations in the neuroscience field, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to see new interviews every few weeks from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_4aa8b4cee1024bd2b0bf3809472ca30d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_602,h_641,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Laura Elin Pigott, Lecturer and Researcher at London South Bank University." ></figure><p>We interviewed Laura Elin Pigott, a Lecturer and Researcher at London South Bank University. Laura also has other research affiliations, including with Queen Square Institute of Neurology and University College London (UCL). Laura previously completed a MSc Clinical Neurosciences degree, and we will be exploring her subsequent career path in this interview, as well as her experiences and useful insights as a woman in neuroscience.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about your background in science/neuroscience? </strong><em> </em></p>

<p>I started off interested in the human body and how we can help rehabilitate people; even as a child I read books on anatomy and the workings of the human body and brain. I think this curiosity, coupled with my personal experiences of hospitals and rehabilitation, was why I pursued a BSc in Physiotherapy. I cannot remember a time when I wanted to be anything else. </p>

<p>Then, during my first degree, I got the incredible opportunity to conduct some research, which I later presented at a conference. I remember thinking that translating research into <em>real </em>change could help, not just the hundreds of patients a clinician sees, but the thousands or millions of patients to come. So, I decided very quickly that I wanted to pursue neuroscience and research. Then, during my MSC in Clinical Neurosciences, I was encouraged to push myself and think outside the box, and so I did – what better way to learn? </p>

<p>I think it is because of this curiosity that I have found myself in a few different areas of sub-specialisms, but they all have one thing in common, the incredible capacity of our brain. </p>


<p><strong>Can you tell us about your current role/area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</strong></p>

<p>I am very lucky to work in a field that I am passionate about and to have the opportunity to join research, such as the study I am a part of at the Neurophysiology unit at UCL on epilepsy. I was drawn to this because of my interest in neural networks: how we can monitor them and how they differ in disease. </p>

<p>My main research, over the past few years, has been on the surveillance of high-grade gliomas at the Queen Square Institute of Neurology. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made. Cancer will touch all of us, in one way or another, at some point in our lives and the possibilities for new cancer treatments provide us all with hope. </p>

<p>Most recently, I have started a study at LSBU, looking at the impact of social media on brain development. Due to my interest in neural networks, I’m fascinated by how these connections develop and what can influence them. I’m also excited about this new project as I have also had the opportunity to get students involved through research placements. </p>


<p><strong>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</strong></p>

<p>I honestly believe this is the best job in the world - the endless learning and imagination that comes with academia and research, the excitement of students eager to learn, and that proud feeling you get when someone does well in an exam or project. </p>

<p>That “Aha, I get it” feeling when I am researching something or when a student has an “aha” moment when they are learning something. </p>


<p><strong>What are some of the challenging aspects of your current job?</strong></p>

<p>Time and money, as with any job. As academics we are constantly juggling our time, and as researchers we are constantly needing funding. </p>


<p><strong>What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience role?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to develop more research projects for students to take an active role in. I had the opportunity to participate in research as a student and I would love to feed that back. I want to show students that research can be exciting, creative, and inspiring. </p>

<p>I also want to learn more about the money distribution within research and how we can optimise this. </p>


<p><strong>Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</strong></p>

<p>There are so many women who have inspired me and helped me get to where I am today. There have been some truly amazing women in neuroscience and science over the course of history; some received the recognition they deserved, and others silently paved the way for women like us. Anita Harding, Elizabeth Roboz Einstein, Marie Curie, Rosalind Franklin and Cécile Charrier are a few that, despite the challenges they faced, pushed back against the stereotypes. </p>

<p>More recently, scientists like May Britt-Moser, Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier, Wendy Suzuki, who push the boundaries of research and academia with their ambition and imagination, inspire me. </p>

<p>Beyond science, or perhaps before I had my love for science, my mum inspired me; she always encouraged me and she embodies the phrase “a woman can do anything a man can, just in heels too!”. My sister, who possesses a kindness with no room for outside malice, also inspires me. The women who, through work or friendship, accept me and challenge me to be a better neuroscientist and a better person; one cannot exist without the other. And also the men in my life, like my dad, who support me and have given me the resilience I needed to succeed. </p>

<p>One woman in particular stands out, Tirion Havard, my academic mentor, who called me out when I wasn’t “standing on the right side of feminism”. We had just met in a research meeting and were chatting after it had finished. At the time, I was a lot more timid and still finding my footing in the research and academic world. She asked me what kind of woman I wanted to be – did I want to be small and get “trodden on”, or did I want to be heard. She told me I needed to put on my “big girl pants and get my elbows out”, because I was coming through. And it’s a memory I look back on fondly; it was one of those mind-blowing moments, where you think to yourself: <u>I can do this and I will do this. </u></p>


<p><strong>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</strong></p>

<p>I’d like to complete my PhD and I’d also like to become a Professor of Neuroscience. </p>

<p>I recently delivered a Seed Talk, which educates the public on various topics; my talk was on “The Science of Neuroplasticity”. I would love to grow more into public speaking, as I think we should all have the knowledge and the tools we need to be informed about the workings of our own body. </p>

<p>On this note, over the coming months, I’m hoping to work on a ‘public engagement and highlighting need’ project about stroke recovery with Start Something: Women in immersive tech, Different strokes and Local strokes in the southwest with Anna Ridley. </p>

<p>I’d also like to see myself mentoring other young professionals; I think that academia and research can be lonely sometimes and having a go-to person makes life easier. I want to be the reason young women stay and succeed, not the reason we continue to have high attrition rates. </p>


<p><strong>What advice would you give to females at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</strong></p>

<p>Keep going. You can do it! </p>

<p>We are programmed from such a young age to be amenable and to not take up space, but as I learnt, sometimes we have to put our big girl pants on and get our elbows out. So be vocal and voice your ideas and DON’T be afraid to put your name to it. </p>

<p>Create a network. This is something I struggled with, but now having so many supportive colleagues around me, means that the bad days don’t seem all that bad after all.</p>

<p>Don’t take the notes. I mean you can if you want to, but do you? Really? And why doesn’t Tim do it? It’s okay to say, “I think someone else should, so we have some variety within the team!” or “I actually have a few points I’d like to discuss today so perhaps someone else could pitch in”. </p>

<p>Have pre-prepped “stock answers” for when you feel something inequitable is happening. This helps me feel more prepared. </p>

<p>Think like a man. I think sometimes we are our worst enemy. My male alter ego is Laurence and when I catch myself doing, or about to do something, that may be an unwanted/unnecessary ‘pink task’, I say to myself, “Would Laurence do/take this?” and if the answer is no, then my answer should be no too. </p>

<p>Make male allies. My supervisor, Sotirios Bisdas, challenged me and never treated me any different. Most of my male colleagues listen and look to me for my speciality, just as I look to them for theirs. This should be the norm, and I am confident that one day soon it will be. Science will be so much more productive if we all work harmoniously. </p>


<p><strong>What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need improving/addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</strong></p>

<p>Today, the challenge we face is more covert than it once was; they are sexist notions that trickle in from our societal standards of what a woman should be, look like, and do… This covert hostility, or persistent quiet sexism, brews and seems harmless to some, but the statistics would indicate that this is in fact endangering the future of equality. So, challenging these notions is important, especially if we want to recruit more girls into STEM. </p>

<p>Without gender equality in science, scientific progress will fulfil just half of its potential.</p>

<p>Overall, the percentage of female graduates with core STEM degrees is steadily growing, however, the split is still just 26%. This figure is also translated into the female STEM workforce, with women making up 24%. This shows that there is still work to be done to encourage women to study these subjects, transition into the workforce and, importantly, remain in these fields.</p>

<p>Once women are in the workforce, we receive less research funding and fewer prizes for scientific contributions, with women receiving, on average, 60 cents to every dollar a male researcher receives. This means that gender inequality will directly impact scientific discoveries, as well as equality in the workforce (as promotion applications have sections dedicated to funding and prizes). How can we expect to increase the percentage of women in STEM, sitting at a mere 24%, when the money is unequally distributed?</p>

<p>This brings me to my next issue that I would like the industry to tackle; attrition of women in STEM. </p>

<p>The competitive nature of academia is unlikely to change, both because of the low number of faculty positions available, and because of the driven nature of those in the field. However, talented women are currently discouraged from academia, or left behind, for example due to the added pressure of parenting responsibilities, to which the academic environment is hostile.</p>

<p>Even with policies in place, a broad cultural change will be necessary to precipitate true equality. Only a quarter of fathers take paternity leave, with this number dropping over the past few years – this is troublesome for the future of gender equality and also indicates a significant ingrained bias. </p>

<p>If we are stopping women from succeeding in their careers, what example are we setting for our future generations?</p>

<p>Finally, scientifically, we need to look at the research we are outputting; is this representative of our populations? Historically, we have seen the horrendous consequences of not conducting research on people of the reflected population of use. We must learn from this. As research advances, and we see awesome new methods and technologies, guidelines and policies will be useful in ensuring we are equitable and progressive in our approach to research and development.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 2022, a researcher in Turkey was reviewing a paper for a cardiology journal when an image of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/western-blot-288/">Western blot</a> caught her eye: A hardly visible pair of “unusual” lighter pixels seemed out of place. Magnification only bolstered her suspicion that something was off.</p>



<p>“This image made me think that the bands were cut one by one and pasted on a membrane background,” Şenay Akin, of Hacettepe University in Ankara, wrote in her comments to the editor of <em>Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy</em>, a Springer Nature journal. “If this is the case, it indicates a manipulation [of] the results of this study.”</p>



<p>The editor, Yochai Birnbaum of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, made a note to check the figure, adding below Akin’s comments in the editorial-management system: “I agree with the reviewer. It could be that the I/R band was manipulated.”</p>



<span id="more-128933"></span>



<p>Akin followed up with Birnbaum to ask why the paper was eventually rejected. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We emailed the corresponding author using his email addressed to ask clarification and data concerning the western blots. As he did not responded, I finally rejected the manuscript</p>

<p>We asked Birnbaum whether the rejection was related to the alleged manipulation, but he and a spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes the journal, declined to comment, citing confidentiality concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A few months after the manuscript was rejected by Birnbaum’s journal, however, it appeared in the pages of the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology</em>, an Elsevier journal, under the same title, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2023.175774">Inhibition of MALT1 reduces ferroptosis in rat hearts following ischemia/reperfusion via enhancing the Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway.</a>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The image Akin had flagged in the rejected paper “had been modified” in the published version, she told us, softening the suspicious features in the original. Some of the error bars and <em>P</em>-values in the paper also differed from the material she had reviewed.</p>



<p>Akin took it upon herself to alert the journal’s editor-in-chief, Frank Redegeld of Utrecht University, in the Netherlands, to her misgivings. But Redegeld dismissed her concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Redegeld wrote that he had investigated the allegations about the Western blots with “very sensitive AI image analysis software.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The analysis did not detect any issues with the western blot images as published,” he told us. “Therefore, we have no reason to assume the published figure was manipulated and we have closed this case accordingly.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ya-Qian Jiang of The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in Changsha, China, lead author of the paper and one of the authors credited for conducting the experiments, told us by email:“We actually provided all the raw data for [the Western blots] as the supplemental materials in the process of review.” Jiang also sent us <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jjX1bubn50ZjCZ6YGySnMPXBM5O31Y6K/view?usp=sharing">the image</a> purported to be the original Figure 1F.</p>



<p>“Anyone [who] has the hand-on experience in doing WB should understand why he/she does not use the full-size membrane to incubate with the antibody and why there [are] some peculiar features — haloes around the bands,” Jiang said.</p>



<p>But David Sanders, a scientific sleuth and biologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, said the blots published in the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology</em> had “clear discontinuities,” adding that “some of the bands appear to be pasted on to other bands as background.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Sanders could not rule out legitimate image processing had caused the anomalies, magnifying the image revealed clear rectangular outlines for the bands that were posted on a background, he told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The addition of those <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/page-4-Inhibition-of-MALT1-reduces-ferroptosis.via-enhancing-the-Nrf2_SLC7A11-pathway.pdf">smudges in the upper left hand corners</a> of each of the lanes is certainly not consistent with this being a normal immunoblot image,” Sanders said.</p>
