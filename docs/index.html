                <p>A cancer researcher at the University of Cambridge in the UK has retracted a paper from <em>Cell</em> after commenters on PubPeer questioned aspects of 10 images in the article.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/steve-jackson.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="605" height="400" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/steve-jackson.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-90011" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/steve-jackson.jpg 605w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/steve-jackson-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Jackson</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Though an institutional investigation found the figures were “not reliable,” another of the authors objected to the retraction as “an overreaction.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.stevejacksonlab.org/steve-jackson">Steve Jackson</a>, the University of Cambridge biology professor and lab leader, previously <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dJackson%252c%2bStephen%2bP">retracted three papers</a> – including one in <em>Nature</em> and one in <em>Science</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/04/11/authors-have-papers-in-nature-and-science-retracted-on-the-same-day/">posted on the same day</a> – after a Cambridge investigation found a co-author, Abderrahmane Kaidi, had falsified data.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130268"></span>



<p>Kaidi is not a co-author on the <em>Cell</em> paper, “<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)01038-X">hnRNP K: An HDM2 Target and Transcriptional Coactivator of p53 in Response to DNA Damage</a>,” which appeared in 2005. The article has been cited more than 300 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jackson requested the retraction, according to the <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01156-5">notice</a>, published October 9. It stated:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We, the authors, have become aware of various duplications and strong similarities between images in the following figure panels: 1E, 1F, 3A, 4A, 4B, 4D, 4E, 6B, 7A, and 7B. These issues occur in both control data and in experimental data. Unfortunately, we no longer have access to the original results from the 2005 study and are therefore unable to ascertain how these issues arose. As these issues impact confidence in the paper’s conclusions, we are retracting the paper. We sincerely apologize to the scientific community for any inconvenience and confusion that we have caused.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Commenters on PubPeer had identified similarities in all of the figure panels mentioned in the retraction notice as early as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5E558FEF86ADED8E186DF6F71576D9#1">March 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the notice, the authors also wrote: “none of the issues that we have become aware of relate to experiments carried out at KuDOS Pharmaceuticals, Ltd,” one of a few startups Jackson has founded based on his research. AstraZeneca in 2006 acquired KuDOS, which developed the cancer drug Lynparza, approved for sales and marketing in the US and EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Cell Press said the publisher had no comment beyond the retraction notice. We reached out to Jackson for comment and received the following statement from a spokesperson for the University of Cambridge:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Professor Sir Steve Jackson was made aware of irregularities in figures in the Moumen et al. (2005) Cell paper, on which he is a co-author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Cambridge, with Professor Jackson’s full cooperation, investigated this matter and concluded that these figures are not reliable. The University found no evidence of wrongdoing by Professor Jackson.</p>



<p>Following this process, Professor Jackson contacted the Editor of Cell and has requested to retract the article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first author, Abdeladim Moumen, “declined to sign this retraction,” according to the notice. Moumen is a research director at the Moroccan Foundation for Advanced Science, Innovation and Research in Rabat, and founded a diagnostics startup of which he is chief scientific officer, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdeladim-moumen-49a41a60/?locale=en_US">his LinkedIn profile</a>.&nbsp; Images in some of Moumen’s other papers have been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22abdeladim+moumen%22">flagged on PubPeer</a>, as reported by <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2021/04/01/steve-jackson-and-the-moumen-troll/">For Better Science</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moumen provided a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moumen-Response-to-retraction-watch.docx.pdf">detailed defense</a> of the paper in response to our request for comment, and told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A thorough investigation conducted by the University of Cambridge concluded that no misconduct was established on my part or by any of the authors. The criticism leading to the retraction request was based solely on image comparison, alleging similarities between bands. However, these were most likely unintended errors during image assembly or paper editing. In fact, most of the criticized images involved tubulin controls, which could easily be redone without any fabrication. Thus, there was no incentive or need to manipulate these images.</p>



<p>It feels deeply unfair to retract a paper that presented original, reproducible findings over minor image issues that did not affect the scientific conclusions. In similar cases, when image concerns arise, authors are often asked to reproduce the experiments, which are then published online as corrections. In our case, the key findings have already been independently confirmed by other groups, which highlights the robustness and originality of our work.</p>



<p>I feel unfairly targeted by the retraction process and believe this situation has not been handled justly. Given the importance and impact of our work, I see this retraction as an overreaction to what are ultimately correctable mistakes.</p>

                <p>Happy International Open Access Week! October 21st through October 27th, 2024 is International Open Access Week (or OA Week), where across the globe we celebrate and highlight the importance of open access infrastructures and movements. We believe that free access to knowledge is an essential human right, and this #OAWeek we will be discussing how open access infrastructures like arXiv contribute to the advancement of science for the global good. This week, we ask for your support and for you to imagine &#8211; what would my work and life look like without open access? You&#8217;ll have the opportunity to have your voice heard and follow us along here, on the blog, as well as on social media (<a href="https://x.com/arxiv">Twitter/X</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arxiv/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@arXiv">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/arxiv.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>).</p>
<p>We will also be co-hosting a webinar on open access licenses and preprints with our friends Creative Commons, bioRxiv and medRxiv &#8211; join us tomorrow to learn more about the different licenses that are available to authors, and how each one affects the impact and reach of a scientific work.</p>

<p>The sudden death of a 27-year-old woman in the Romania offices of MDPI, a major open-access publisher with a worldwide presence, has grabbed national headlines and raised questions about the conditions under which the firm’s employees work.</p>



<p>Local <a href="https://observatornews.ro/fii-observator/o-tanara-de-27-de-ani-a-facut-infarct-si-a-murit-la-birou-lesinase-mai-devreme-dar-nu-a-fost-lasata-sa-plece-595469.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFuIeBleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHS6Qsypdkw_C_bmhiHRCqQX1n_C7lb01IRnhTInaj3Bmo_zpwU9gfM6qdw_aem_BUWWsD8nCHuAUw5VU_vlkw">news</a> <a href="https://www.stiripesurse.ro/caz-revoltator-in-bucuresti-o-tanara-de-27-de-ani-a-facut-infarct-la-serviciu-si-a-murit-i-s-a-facut-rau-dar-sefii-nu-au-lasat-o-sa-plece-acasa_3452867.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFuId1leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHYvO3U8JtS96sHgfqsMd88cBb1dEFFeJ1PYgodKsWZYyoRchEBiVwHj3Iw_aem_CwUkIVDlWhLHW9sXubx_sQ">reports</a> said the woman had initially fainted in MDPI’s Bucharest office on Friday, October 4, but that her superiors refused to call an ambulance or let her go home after she revived. She later collapsed again and died from a heart attack after efforts to resuscitate her failed, according to the reports.</p>



<p>A business consultant in Romania also wrote about the case in a blog post, quoting emails from anonymous MDPI employees describing <a href="https://dorusupeala.ro/infarct-la-birou-moartea-rapeste-din-nou-o-tanara-angajata-dezvaluirile-angajatilor-mdpi-acuza-grav-managerii/">a “toxic” work environment and “constant pressures” to perform</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in an interview with Retraction Watch, a colleague of the deceased woman, <a href="https://www.mediafax.ro/comunicate/comunicat-mdpi-pierderea-tragica-a-colegei-noastre-22508151">identified as Maria Alexandra Anghel</a>, contested the media’s account of events.</p>



<span id="more-130262"></span>



<p>According to the source, a member of MDPI’s editorial staff in Bucharest, only a few minutes passed between the first and second time Anghel fainted. To the source’s knowledge, no one had tried to prevent her from going home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The media reports, I think, are a bit exaggerated,” said the source, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation (their identity is known to us).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the editorial worker called the blog post’s description of the many workplace problems “spot on.” They highlighted an extreme culture of performance focused on quantity rather than quality, frequent culture clashes with managers in China and micromanagement “on another level.” (A day after we contacted the firm for comment about the workplace conditions, MDPI adjusted its performance targets for employees.)&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In a statement about Anghel’s death, MDPI offered condolences and said it was cooperating with authorities investigating the “circumstances surrounding this tragic incident.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Out of respect for Alexandra&#8217;s family and loved ones, we are not providing further details at this time,” the publisher said. ”We will share more information once the investigation is complete.“</p>



<p>MDPI CEO Stefan Tochev did not respond directly to the accusations in the media or the allegations our sources made. He told us in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Stefan-Tochev-email.pdf">an email</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Many colleagues in our Romania offices have expressed that the media and blog speculation surrounding this situation has been deeply traumatizing. As a priority, we have focused on providing grief counseling and immediate support to our teams, offering time away and work-from-home options to help them during this difficult time. We continuously review our processes and operations, and employee safety remains a top priority for us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tochev added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Linking this tragic event to working practices would be completely inappropriate without you having the facts or formal information. An independent investigation is ongoing, and our top priority remains supporting Alexandra’s family and our colleagues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">MDPI <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/anniversary25/history">was founded</a> in 1996 in Basel, Switzerland, by the Chinese chemist Shu-Kun Lin, who remains <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shu-kun-lin-mdpi-9053542a/?originalSubdomain=ch">president of the company</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/board">chairman of its board</a>. A <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2020/08/10/guest-post-mdpis-remarkable-growth/">fast-growing</a> open-access publisher with <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2309/2309.15884.pdf">speedy review timelines</a> and a <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/03/30/guest-post-of-special-issues-and-journal-purges/">plethora of special issues</a>, the firm has faced questions about the quality of its papers. Some of its journals have been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/28/finland-group-downgrades-60-journals/">downgraded in influential rating systems</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/02/exclusive-mdpi-journal-undergoing-reevaluation-at-scopus-indexing-on-hold/">reevaluated</a> or <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fast-growing-open-access-journals-stripped-coveted-impact-factors">removed</a> from indexing services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Performance metrics for editorial staffers prioritize the quantity of published manuscripts over their quality, our source in Bucharest said. Editors get one performance point for every published manuscript they handle, but only half of a point for rejecting a manuscript. Staffers who reach a certain number of points get a monthly bonus. Assistant editors, for instance, had a target of 15 points per month until Oct. 22, 2024, the day after we emailed MDPI the allegations in this story, when the number was lowered to 12, according to our source.</p>



<p>“It kind of incentivizes us to push towards publication instead of rejection,” the source said. “They say they want quality. They never want quality, they just want quantity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For editors who manage special issues, the target is to send out 40 to 50 email invitations to potential guest editors every week, the employee added. “The way they operate the special issues is again quantity over quality.”</p>



<p>The source expressed concern for how the performance culture affects the scientific enterprise. “It&#8217;s not really scientific what we do,” they said. “It&#8217;s just money printing, pretty much.”</p>



<p>An employee at MDPI’s other Romania office, in the city of Cluj-Napoca, echoed this description.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In this company we are treated as a number,” said the employee in an email translated from Romanian. “Either you perform and bring profits to the company, or it&#8217;s more convenient to leave.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source described having been asked to work during time off because the local group leader worried about losing money. “The group leaders do not receive their bonus during our days off,” the source told us. (We confirmed the source works at MDPI’s office in Cluj-Napoca, but they would not share details allowing full identification given the potential legal repercussions of violating the non-disclosure agreement MDPI makes employees sign. The information this source provided was consistent with what the Bucharest source told us.)</p>



<p>Tochev told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While some individuals may use this opportunity to voice frustration, something we understand and respect, it’s important to note that their views may not reflect the reality or opinion of the majority of our staff, management, or operational practices.</p>



<p>At MDPI, employees are encouraged to maintain both quality and efficiency in their work. Decisions on which papers are accepted for publication are made solely by independent Academic Editors, scholars in the field, and not by MDPI staff.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Bucharest staffer acknowledged the decision to publish belonged to the academic editor, with support from reviewers, but said the in-house assistant editor at MDPI “is the one who chooses all of them.” The source added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When inviting reviewers you see that some are more prone to reject than others. We always get told to avoid reviewers that have a lot of reject decisions in the past.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The two MDPI employees both described “constant” micromanagement from managers based in China. At the very beginning of the workday in Romania, or even before it starts, managers in China send messages on the Microsoft Teams platform with specific tasks, or checking on the status of manuscripts, the sources said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If an employee doesn’t have time to do a task one day, the next day managers will ask why, the Bucharest staffer said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Managers in China also compile reports of “mistakes” employees have made over the past few months, according to the source in Cluj-Napoca. Then, they summon the employee to a meeting “where you have to explain to them why you made those mistakes 6 months ago with some manuscripts that you don&#8217;t even remember.”</p>



<p>The reports are one of a number of tactics MDPI allegedly uses to target low-performing employees. According to our sources, the publisher last year launched a system to monitor performance and put staffers with an unsatisfactory output under observation unless they agree to resign “by mutual consent.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Most employees get intimidated and put into observation period just to force them to resign,” the Bucharest staffer told us in an email, adding that “this comes with a lot of ‘sabotage’ from the Chinese colleagues.” Examples of sabotage include delayed response times from colleagues in China, leading targeted employees to miss important deadlines, and being assigned subpar manuscripts that are likely to get rejected, yielding fewer performance points and thus creating a vicious circle, the sources explained.</p>



<p>Both said they believed Anghel was under observation by her managers when she died, or had been previously. “As far as I know, Alexandra was put under observation multiple times,” the Bucharest staffer told us.</p>



<p>The Cluj-Napoca employee also described surprise visits from Chinese colleagues who would work 10-hour days, getting up from their chairs only for lunch or meetings and using the bathroom only during lunch breaks. The unannounced visitors would “often hide when they&#8217;re on social media or texting relatives,” according to the source, and would take pictures of their Romanian colleagues chatting to each other or relaxing on beanbag chairs provided by the company.</p>



<p>“I believe [MDPI’s] unethical practices and the publication of low-quality manuscripts for financial gain pose a significant threat to the academic community,” the Cluj-Napoca employee told us. “While I am certainly frustrated with their practices, my primary concern is the potential impact on academic progress. Additionally, the company has exhibited abusive and controlling behavior toward its employees, which needs to be addressed.”</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>At a time when scientists and scientific research are already being criticised by persons who identify science with technology and who deplore some of the consequences of technology, dishonesty among scientists causes unease among scientists themselves and regretful or gleeful misgivings among publicists who are critical of science.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p><em>Daryl Chubin wrote that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01099941">in 1985</a> &#8212; a time when institutions we now take for granted, like the U.S. Office of Research Integrity, did not yet exist. We asked him to reflect on what has happened in the intervening four decades.</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The phrase “misconduct in research” today is a quaint reminder of how much science has been captured by for-profit, politicized, international interests. As a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01099941">four-decades-removed</a> social researcher of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/690053">misconduct</a>, I marvel at how an investigation industry has emerged to monitor, analyze, report and decry the mischief around us. This “watcher community” represents an industry in an era of science most of us never envisioned.</p>



<p>In the days before the Office of Research Integrity, many accused researchers and their academic institutions were grasping for an accountability structure that was fair to all parties — adhering to due process – and swift in its resolutions. Good luck!&nbsp; Today, the headlines in <em>Retraction Watch </em>reflect a publishing industry seemingly under siege—awash in retractions, plagiarism, AI mischief, undeclared conflicts of interest, whistleblowing, and a subset of ills that are dizzying and disconcerting to degrees never seen before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch monitors an industry ever more self-conscious about misdeeds in research, from analysis to interpretation to reporting. By setting the threshold low, it focuses on misdeeds that may be rare in a particular field, but substantial when aggregated across fields. Yes, there is a risk of overgeneralizing from statistical anomalies, but readers care about violations that sully &#8220;their&#8221; field.</p>



<span id="more-130249"></span>



<p>Within this environment of deceit and suspicion, I worry about besieged editors and the effect on collegial relations between known and unknown authors and reviewers. I despair for a peer review system sagging under the weight of uncompensated labor, unrealistic deadlines, and the ever-higher stakes of publication-dependent outcomes such as sustained funding and tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the current AI-drenched landscape, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2023.2243814">some &#8212; such as Bruce Macfarlane &#8212; argue</a> the traditional meaning of originality and priority (enshrined in <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo28451565.html">Merton’s 1942 idealized norms of science</a>) has been displaced by a new ethos of institutional norms focused on egoism, capitalism and advocacy. Hence the elevation of findings deemed clinically-robust and bankable.</p>



<p>Within this rhetorical context, open-access publishing has traded originality for affordability. Such publication “opportunities” have disadvantaged many younger scientists/scholars and those at institutions without the wherewithal and infrastructure to contribute and compete. Then there are the now-exacerbated normal biases — unconscious and conscious — that can favor article rejection over acceptance while subordinating science content to assumed author attributes (gender, race, academic pedigree). The stakes have never been higher.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As a policy practitioner would say, the “unintended consequences” of publishing now haunt the scientific landscape. From the perspective of an observer, not the participant, I offer the watcher community some prescriptions (and a few questions) without solutions (or answers):&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Research should not be a policed activity. A policy that permutes practice can regulate or undermine it. Is the trust-based publication honor system–perhaps always a fiction–now eclipsed by extrinsic interests or actually subverted by profit motives?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Journals should be dissemination devices — depositing information, data and interpretation — that, in the process, bestow credit (and sometimes blame, issuing retractions stating malfeasance by authors). Journals were not created to be gamed or treated as a resource for trading, buying or selling. Owners, however, will often try to gain some form of advantage.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Publication metrics should capture quantitatively what a community values. Are citation counts and a 20+ h-index the best we can do? Can those numbers be evaluated without knowledge of individual and community contexts?&nbsp; What, then, is qualitatively valued: English-language articles, authors sponsored by Fortune 500 companies, sustainability of a field?</li>



<li>The frequency of scandals of fabrication and misappropriation should be statistically insignificant. But the magnitude of these relatively few misdeeds can have profound real-world consequences for careers, funding, perceptions and confidence in “scientific progress.”</li>



<li>Peer review should be recognized as service to the community. Reviewers who are specialists in the field soliciting their reviews serve as a proxy for community standards evolving, yet validating. Some of the best analysis is done in this behind-the-scenes role, yet it remains largely unrewarded. Without this specialized knowledge, reviewers lacking subject expertise are perpetrating fraud.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Anonymity protects the identity of both the innocent and the guilty. It can preserve or dilute candor — reinforce, distort or calcify prevailing community judgment. If participants in the publishing industry differ on the value of anonymity, what other values should be compromised or honored? More experiments are needed to examine the marriage of ethics to practice.</li>



<li>Policy encompasses at least a triad of stakeholders: the publishers who own the journals; the editors who steward the journals; the federal agencies whose funding both enables authors and regulates their misbehavior. The triad too often appears to compete against each other than to collaborate. Shared objectives for the enterprise are elusive. How can policymakers broker more constructive relationships?</li>



<li>The watcher community should be mindful of both “lab culture” and the individual aspirations of researchers. What motivates watchers’ behavior—documenting dimensions of misconduct, establishing accountability for those accused, and promulgating rules for adaptation by various research communities? Can watchers serve as honest brokers, or must they inevitably become partisan by virtue of investing in the publication industry?</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-drop-cap">These reflections derive from nearly a half-century of my own publishing, editing, and reviewing. I may be naive, unrealistic, and locked in an earlier era. Just as Merton’s norms afforded 20th century scientists with a rhetorical device to portray their research behavior as lofty and merit-based, Macfarlane’s formulation stresses the darker underbelly of scientists’ competition and avarice in the 21st. Both capture kernels of truth. Deceit and fallibility are&nbsp; manifested in publications as opportunities and situational pressures mount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, science needs a policy analysis that transcends any one research field or model of publication. My reflections here pose fundamental issues of purpose: what is publishing for, what do producers and consumers of knowledge hold to be sacrosanct, and what do they consider fundamental behavior for advancement of their field ? No doubt some of these questions are ongoing topics of debate in various communities, countries, and journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can the watcher community — which should include you and me — do more than better report the perversions of scientific publication? Indeed, how can watchers meet the moment and increase the promotion of better practices?</p>

<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/26/a-journal-editor-said-hed-retract-a-paper-for-plagiarism-a-year-later-it-hasnt-happened/">we reported in August</a>, the editor of the <em>International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems</em> in June 2023 promised to retract the articles, but they remained intact more than a year later.</p>



<p>The following papers have now been retracted:</p>



<span id="more-130220"></span>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061522001326?via%3Dihub">A robust vehicle to grid aggregation framework for electric vehicles charging cost minimization and for smart grid regulation</a> (18 citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014206152100418X">A robust optimization method for optimizing day-ahead operation of the electric vehicles aggregator</a> (20 citations)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061521005974">Optimal power management framework for smart homes using electric vehicles and energy storage</a> (31 citations)</li>
</ul>



<p>The notices call the plagiarism a “severe abuse of the scientific publishing system.” The journal’s editor in chief, Vladimir Terzija, did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier told us “The retractions were submitted during a busy period and there were delays with the publisher,” adding that the authors did not make the retraction request.</p>



<p>Ubaid ur Rehman, the first or only author of all three papers, previously had two other<a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1#?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3d1%26auth%3dur%2bRehman%252c%2bUbaid"> articles retracted</a> from Springer Nature journals for plagiarism. ur Rehman did not respond to our request for comment but previously admitted the plagiarism in emails seen by Retraction Watch. He has over the past week asked us to remove our original post because the retractions were in the works.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uma.es/departamento-de-ingenieria-electrica/info/113635/salvador-pineda-morente/">Salvador Pineda</a>, one of the authors whose work was lifted, said he was “relieved” considering how much time and energy he invested in getting the paper that plagiarized his work retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That said, I&#8217;m still puzzled as to why the process took so long, even though the plagiarism was blatant, the author admitted to it, and the editor-in-chief supported retraction from the very beginning. I can only imagine how difficult it would be if the plagiarism hadn&#8217;t been so obvious,” Pineda, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Málaga, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The journal should put more efforts to avoid the plagiarism rather than waiting for the authors to report the events,” said <a href="https://www.polito.it/personale?p=tao.huang">Tao Huang</a>, another author whose work was plagiarized and a professor at Politecnico di Torino in Italy. He recommended further penalties such as banning authors temporarily, from both the journal the plagiarized articles were published in and other journals by the same publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Surely, it is not a pleasant experience, but it was OK in the end,” Huang told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “delays” referred to by Elsevier resulted in the plagiarized papers accumulating several new citations, Pineda said, about two dozen since June 2023. “In any case, I&#8217;m happy that truth and science have prevailed in the end.”</p>



<p>Update, 2230 UTC, 10/18/24: We have corrected the number of previous retractions of papers by ur Rehman before these three papers; it was two, not three. </p>

<p>Editors of a psychology journal have published a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-31211-001.html">lengthy apology</a> for failing to identify “biased” language and information in a paper about racial prejudice of Tibetan children against Han Chinese.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2024-72017-001">The development of Tibetan children’s racial bias in empathy: The mediating role of ethnic identity and wrongfulness of ethnic intergroup bias</a>,” appeared in <em>Cultural Diversity &amp; Ethnic Minority Psychology </em>in April. It has yet to be cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors listed affiliations with institutions in China, Australia, and Canada. The article describes experiments measuring the empathy – or lack thereof – Tibetan children expressed for characters with Tibetan or Han Chinese names who experienced either social or physical pain.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130213"></span>



<p>“Our study sheds light on the development of [racial bias in empathy] in Tibetan school-aged children and highlights the importance of identifying the appropriate timing for intervening in prejudice,” the researchers concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The apology, published earlier this month, provides a detailed timeline of how a reader contacted the journal with concerns about the article soon after it was published, and how the editors responded. The reader had also asked the corresponding author to share the data reported in the publication, but hadn’t received a response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reader identified “biased language” in the article, such as the description of education in Tibet as “backward,” and “deficit-oriented interpretation of findings” attributing the development of racial bias in Tibetan children at least in part to “the geographical environment and traditional way of life in Tibet.” The area’s characteristics “limited its interactions with the outside world and contributed to a relatively closed mindset,” the authors wrote in the original article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The reader rightly pointed out that this language and interpretation reinforce imperialism, particularly given the complex relations between Tibet and China. We sincerely apologize to our readers, and especially to our Tibetan colleagues, for failing to identify these issues prior to the publication of the article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eventually, the first author shared the study data, codebook, and syntax files on an <a href="https://osf.io/texq2/?view_only=40c2f48e801340f8ae781209b481d401/">online repository</a>, and agreed to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-32719-001.html">correction</a> retracting several sentences from the article. The correction notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors wish to remove biased language and inappropriate discussion surrounding the comparison between the Tibetan sample and the non-Tibetan samples, and the text discussing the development of Tibetan children’s awareness of their own racial prejudice.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Jun Chen, the corresponding author, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Su Yeong Kim, the outgoing editor of the journal, said the authors addressed the reader’s concerns, so “we therefore decided to do an apology” instead of an expression of concern or retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The apology also lists future actions the editorial team will take, and a section with “perspectives to guide the interpretation” of findings in the original article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We (the journal) are deeply sorry about what occurred and are committed to ensuring that biased language and deficit interpretations are avoided in future publications. In addition, by requesting a retraction of biased sentences from the author and through resources provided on the interpretation of the original Sheng et al.’s (2024) publication, we have taken actions to help repair the damage caused by this publication. With these efforts, we commit more intentionally to our equity, diversity, and inclusion principles for the sake of producing anti-oppressive publications for our global readership. We acknowledge that the publication of this article may have caused readers to lose trust in the journal, and, together, we are currently taking action to reestablish reader confidence in CDEMP as outlined in the Future Actions to Be Taken by the CDEMP Editorial Team section.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Reinoud Maex will talk about his work in the presentation entitled &quot;A mechanism for ATP homeostasis based on activity-dependent synthesis and release of neurotransmitter&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It has long been recognised that many neurotransmitters bear a close relationship, for
their synthesis or degradation, to compounds of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle, the central
pathway for the production of the energy intermediary adenosine triphosphate (ATP). How
neurons maintain an almost constant level of ATP in their cytosol, in spite of varying
workloads, is still an outstanding question. Taking the relationship between glutamate
(Glu) and alpha-ketoglutarate as an example, a simple metabolic model was built of a Glu-
releasing axon terminal. The model included the interconversion between Glu and alpha-
ketoglutarate, the accumulation of Glu in synaptic vesicles, and the recycling of Glu
through an activity-induced supply of its precursor glutamine by the perisynaptic
astrocyte. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, the model was reduced to two differential
equations of the cytosolic concentration of Glu and ATP. This model showed remarkable
characteristics: at steady state, irrespective of the workload, the ATP level measured 1.5
mM, and only 4.7 % of the ATP was spent on Glu release and recycling. The speed of ATP
homeostasis was determined by the (absolute) amount of ATP the axon spent on vesicular Glu
accumulation. Overall, homeostasis came at little cost as it prevented futile ATP
production when the workload decreased. These analytical and numerical results indicate
that neurotransmitter release may confer to neurons a metabolic advantage in the form of a
more accurate ATP homeostasis.</p>

<p><em>Optical and Quantum Electronics</em>, a Springer Nature journal, has retracted more than 200 papers since the start of September, and continues issuing retraction notices en masse. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11082-024-07444-x">notices</a>, which have similar wording, the retractions come after the publisher identified problems with the articles including compromised peer review, inappropriate or irrelevant references, and nonsensical phrases, suggesting blind use of AI or machine-translation software.</p>



<p>“These investigations are based on intelligence from past work alongside whistleblower information,” Chris Graf, director of research integrity at Springer Nature in Oxford, UK, told <em>Retraction Watch</em>. But Graf declined to share the specifics of the inquiry: “We need to keep details of these investigations confidential to ensure that we do not inform the efforts of individuals who may engage in unethical activities.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130209"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03621-0/index.html">Guillaume Cabanac</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Toulouse, France, first highlighted issues with the journal in a February <a href="https://x.com/gcabanac/status/1754785367046180952">post on X</a>. Cabanac <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02134-0">has created software</a> that spots odd language in academic papers he dubbed “<a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/tainted-kids-other-odd-phrases-cropping-up-in-autism-studies/">tortured phrases</a>,” which seem to be the result of attempts to circumvent plagiarism checks. </p>



<p>His <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a> had flagged nearly 50 articles in <em>Optical and Quantum Electronics</em> riddled with tortured phrases, mostly published in 2023. “I suspect papermill submissions + compromised peer review,” <a href="https://x.com/gcabanac/status/1754785367046180952">he wrote on X</a> at the time, referring to shady services that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">sell authorship slots and citations on papers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/2F80E74D4042BDCD3537D12BDD421E">posted his concerns</a> about the papers, along with their tortured phrases, on PubPeer. In his post, he called on the publisher to retract or correct the papers that are not reliable.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Optical and Quantum Electronics </em>has three editors-in-chief, with some recent turnover. Xuelin Yang of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26581698">joined the journal</a> in January. Daoxin Dai of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, had <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/19116278">stepped down</a> in November 2023 after taking the post in April 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Yang nor Dai replied to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salah Obayya, director of the Center for Photonics and Smart Materials at the Zewail City of Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt, is one of the journal’s other editors-in-chief. He <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26581698">joined in June 2023</a>, taking over from Trevor Benson of the University of Nottingham, UK, whose tenure ended in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26613404">thank-you note</a> from Benson on the journal website reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I have served in the Editor in Chief role since mid-2005, during which time metrics confirm that the journal has grown significantly in size, stature, and reputation. Although I officially retired in July 2000, I have kept research active in seeing PhDs and projects through to completion, and with a small emeritus Fellowship from the Leverhulme Trust. As this activity is winding down, I feel the time is right for someone new to help drive the journal forward. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Obayya nor Benson responded to requests for comment. We also didn’t hear back from Marian Marciniak, the journal’s third editor-in-chief, who is based at the National Institute of Telecommunications Department of Transmission and Optical Technology in Warsaw, Poland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graf added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Alongside this work and with the Editors-in-Chief, we have been strengthening the processes for all guest-edited issues at the journal such that no unsolicited proposals are considered, an editorial board member or one of the Editors-in-Chief must be part of the Guest Editor team, and new research integrity tools have been added to the front end of our submission process. All editorial board members have also undertaken extensive research integrity training.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Earlier this month, Springer Nature began an initial public offering (IPO), noting in its prospectus that increase in undeclared use of AI in the publication process and infiltration by paper mills is a significant threat to the publishing business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher noted that earlier this year it identified “a significant number” of papers published by its journals originated from paper mills, adding:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The paper mills used guest-edited collections and fake peer reviews to evade quality control. While a large proportion of the papers and collections were brought to our attention by a third-party individual, some had already been flagged or identified through other means, and were already being investigated by our dedicated internal research integrity group. These investigations continue and could result in many retractions, which could negatively impact our reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another Springer Nature journal that seems to be retracting papers en masse is <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>. The journal was one of 17 that this year <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">lost its Journal Impact Factor</a> — which is sometimes <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/whats-wrong-with-the-jif-in-five-graphs">used to evaluate researchers and their work</a> — due to suspected citation manipulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its IPO prospectus, Springer Nature had noted that if journals are excluded from Clarivate’s Journal Citation Reports database, “this could have a material detrimental effect on the results of our operations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July, a spokesperson for Clarivate, the firm that publishes Journal Impact Factors, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">told <em>Retraction Watch</em></a> the journals were suppressed from their report for having&nbsp; “anomalous citation behavior, including where there is evidence of excessive journal self-citation and/or citation stacking (which involves two or more journals). We do not presume a motive or accuse these journals of wrongdoing.”</p>



<p>As <em>Retraction Watch</em> has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/22/sleuths-spur-cleanup-at-journal-with-nearly-140-retractions-and-counting/">previously reported</a>, Cabanac and fellow sleuth <a href="https://thebulletin.org/biography/alexander-magazinov/">Alexander Magazinov</a> — software engineer at Yandex, an IT company based in Moscow, Russia — have previously flagged around 1,850 papers published by <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>for suspicious citations, tortured phrases, and undeclared use of AI in papers. By our count, the journal has so far retracted 225 papers as part of this batch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Environmental+Science+and+Pollution+Research">search for</a><em> Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>on PubPeer yields some of the flagged and retracted studies.</p>



<p>One 2023 article <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-35102-y">retracted</a> by <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em> on 25 September, was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-26647-5">titled</a>: “Association of the corona virus (Covid-19) epidemic with environmental risk factors.” This study has so far been cited two times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4C3BF43A3E49E979B8F8D340993961">PubPeer thread</a> about this study, its corresponding author, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Majid-Farhadi-6">Majid Farhadi</a> of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Iran, wrote: “We do not insist on using invalid articles and we ask you to agree to the correction. We are prepared to remove invalid articles.”</p>



<p>Another <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-16530-6">2021 study</a>, titled, “The modulatory potential of herbal antioxidants against oxidative stress and heavy metal pollution: plants against environmental oxidative stress,” was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-35004-z">pulled</a> on 17 September. This study has been cited 32 times so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But none of the study authors agreed with the study’s retraction. “Following the notification from the journal, we conducted a thorough review of our paper and found the sentences to be coherent and the phrases to adhere to standard conventions,” wrote corresponding author Zahra Ebrahimi of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Iran, on a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DAAF3DF3A2B5D0D5FC2D332A641024">PubPeer thread about the study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ebrahimi added on PubPeer:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It’s important to note that English is not the native language for any of the authors, and while we made efforts to refine the clarity of our text using tools like Grammarly before submission, we acknowledge that it may not mirror the fluency of native English speakers. Furthermore, [at] the paper&#8217;s revision stage, in response to the journal&#8217;s request for language editing to ensure text clarity and fluency, we engaged the services of NedMedica, viz., known as Article X as well, a language editing service by Brieflands company to ensure the high quality of the paper… </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ebrahimi disagrees that the study’s peer review process was compromised, noting:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Reviewers made a total of 23 comments on our initial paper and requested improvements even in the smallest details. Upon reviewing the extensive comments provided, it is evident that the review process followed the standard procedures.

Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that none of the editorial board members are based in Iran, and we have had no prior personal or professional relationships with them.</p>

<p>She does, however, acknowledge some errors and oversights in the study’s references but remains convinced that the article’s validity remains intact. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>…it is important to highlight that the main issue in the article lies in the placement of the references rather than the validity of the references themselves. This discrepancy stemmed from the technical challenges with reference management software. We want to assure you that the references provided are capable of supporting all the claims made in the manuscript, provided they are cited in the correct locations. The scientific validity of the article remains intact. We had prepared a correction to the latest version of the manuscript we had, wherein we will indicate the appropriate placement for citing each manuscript. Ensuring the references are placed in their correct locations, removing the Vickers citation, and adding four references that were previously omitted due to technical issues, we have ensured that all claims made in the manuscript are adequately supported.</p>

<p>A public health journal has retracted an article on unintentional pesticide poisonings a year after the authors enlisted a lawyer’s help to fight the decision. </p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/15/authors-hire-lawyer-as-journal-plans-to-retract-their-article-on-pesticide-poisoning/">we reported</a> <em>BMC Public Health</em> had decided to retract the article, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09939-0">The global distribution of acute unintentional pesticide poisoning: estimations based on a systematic review</a>,” which appeared in December 2020. The article has been cited nearly 300 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including more than 100 since the journal told the authors it would be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors listed affiliations with the Pesticide Action Network, a collection of organizations opposed to pesticides. In their review, they declared unintentional pesticide poisoning “a problem that warrants immediate action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice cites a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">letter to the editor</a> from employees of pesticide manufacturer Bayer, and the trade organization CropLife International, which criticized the analysis. The authors stood by their findings in a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11941-z">response</a>, stating the critics “do not seem to have understood our estimation method.”</p>



<span id="more-130206"></span>



<p>The authors tried to overturn the journal’s decision. In July 2023, a lawyer representing them sent the editors a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-07-14-Letter-Resp.-to-Editors-re-Global-UAPP-Article-Retraction.pdf">letter</a> arguing that the retraction would be “inappropriate,” as we previously reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, a journal editor wrote to the authors:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am sorry to inform you that we will be proceeding with the retraction of your article as we have lost confidence in the conclusions presented based on the original concerns raised in the <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">Matters Arising article</a> by Dunn et al. and on the assessment and advice received from our Editorial Board Members.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reply-BMC-PH-2024-09-23.pdf">rebuttal</a>, the authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The envisaged retraction of our paper would be an unacceptable outcome of an unacceptable process. We have explained in detail in our rebuttals that the prevalences used in our extrapolations are not higher than annual prevalences and therefore no overestimation has taken place for this reason. We have repeatedly shown that even if the criticism were correct, it would have a negligible impact on the results of our study. A retraction would therefore be contrary to the journal&#8217;s own policy, which states that retractions are not appropriate when there is inconclusive evidence to support a retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-20318-x">notice</a>, published Wednesday, states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Editor has retracted this article because concerns were raised about the use of ‘ever’ prevalence of pesticide poisoning to represent annual frequency in the extrapolations by a reader and by Dunn et al. [<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">1</a>]. Expert assessment has confirmed the validity of this concern and also concluded that the assumption of annual exposure for countries where the time frame is not reported is unreliable. The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented.</p>



<p>All authors disagree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides citing the source of the “concerns” and registering the authors’ disagreement, the notice matches the one the journal editor proposed to the authors last May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the publisher what held up the publication of the retraction. Natalie Pafitis, senior editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, said in a statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While we endeavour to complete our investigations as swiftly and efficiently as possible, there are a number of reasons why these processes can, on occasion, take longer than expected.</p>



<p>In this instance, after readers raised concerns in January 2023, we launched an investigation into the paper in line with COPE guidelines, with support from the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group. This process included a post-publication review by several experts in the subject matter of the paper, and extensive communication with the authors. After careful consideration of both the post-publication reviews and the authors’ responses, we concluded that the most appropriate action to take was retraction of this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another group of authors has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/04/authors-file-complaint-with-publisher-as-journal-retracts-vaping-paper/">complained</a> about the journal’s process for retractions.&nbsp;</p>
