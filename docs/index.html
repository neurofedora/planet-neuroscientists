                <p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We are back with our &apos;spotlight on&apos; interview series, shedding light on inspiring women working in the field of neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. The questions posed to these individuals explore the themes of job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations in the neuroscience field, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to see new interviews every few weeks from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This month, we interviewed Dr Jessica Agnew-Blais, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Queen Mary University of London. Jessica discusses the journey of her career thus far, including moving to a new place, navigating finding a job, balancing motherhood, and the tips she has for students and early career researchers. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’ve been interested in issues around mental health for as long as I can remember. Why people think, feel, and act the way they do is something I find innately interesting. However, I wasn’t always very clear about my career path, and in the US we don’t specialise at university until comparatively later, so I took several kinds of classes in subjects like History, Archaeology and English Literature, which I loved. I ended up majoring in Human Biology, which was an interdisciplinary major that combined biological, behavioural, social, and cultural perspectives to study human health and disease.</span></span><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Through my coursework I learned about public health school and realised this was a great fit for me, as I was interested in mental health at a population level. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I ended up getting my PhD in Epidemiology, which was a bit unexpected as I really </span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">did not</span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> enjoy my statistics course during university. Once I learned that I could use statistics to answer questions I was really interested in, such as why certain people were more likely to suffer with certain diseases, or why some people’s health worsened whilst others improved, I started to really love it. My focus for my PhD was Psychiatric Epidemiology, and I was super lucky to work with some amazing scientists who taught me a lot and were also really lovely people, which is so important. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After I finished my PhD I moved to London with my partner, which was good timing in some ways, but not great timing in others because I was visibly pregnant at that point. So, I went to a few job interviews but I could tell people were looking at me and thinking, “um, what are you doing here?”. But it worked out well in the end, as by the time I had my daughter and was ready to go back to work, a postdoc position opened up with the E-Risk study. E-Risk is based at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London, and involves a twin study of over 2000 monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Twin studies are really cool because they leverage the “natural experiment” of twinship to help disentangle genetic and environmental effects (because identical twins share 100% of their DNA and fraternal twins share 50%, but importantly both sets of twins share the same, or a very similar, environment). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As part of the E-Risk study, we looked at the course of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from childhood to young adulthood, and found some really interesting results, especially about individuals that were meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD in young adulthood. Surprisingly, we found that a large proportion of people, who met all the symptoms and impairment criteria for ADHD at age 18, hadn’t done so when parents and teachers reported on their ADHD symptoms in childhood. This was really surprising because, by definition in the DSM (the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders), ADHD often emerges  prior to age 12.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One interesting thing, about those who tended not to meet ADHD criteria until young adulthood, was that they were more likely to be women. Trying to understand this finding steered me towards my current research, which is focused on looking at ADHD, over the life course, among girls and women. I am currently funded by a New Investigator Research Grant from the UK Medical Research Council to examine these questions, including childhood and adolescent factors that may lead to late diagnosis, how ADHD symptoms change across puberty, as well as whether ADHD symptoms fluctuate across the menstrual cycle amongst women with ADHD. More information about my current research can be found at </span></span><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://www.adhdlifelab.com/" target="_blank">our team’s website</a></span></span></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have an amazing team of early career researchers in my lab and working with them is a real highlight of my job. I also have fantastic co-workers at QMUL who are so thoughtful, supportive and fun; they improve my research as well as my mood on an everyday basis. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are some of the challenging aspects of your current job? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As a lecturer we have a lot of different responsibilities—teaching, supervising projects, students , providing pastoral care, marking, reviewing academic papers, managing research budgets, and writing grants. I find it challenging to switch back and forth between all these different tasks. It’s easy to spend all your time on short-term tasks and not focus on the deeper thinking that goes into writing and research. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience job? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Ooof, time management is eternally something I am trying to get better at. I am not naturally a super organised person, so I try to borrow various strategies from my more organised friends and colleagues, like tracking my time to see how long various tasks take. But I’m far from having discovered the secret to being good at this! </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I was really lucky to have had amazing female mentors during my PhD and postdoc, like Professor Karestan Koenen at the Harvard School of Public Health and Professor Louise Arseneault at the IoPPN at King’s College London. I am also very inspired by my female colleagues at work, several of whom also have young children, and we are always sharing the joys and the challenges of being working mothers. I also had a working mother, and I have very distinct memories of watching her go off to work when I was a kid, and I think having this in the back of my mind helped me make this choice for myself. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One study I am working on now looks at how ADHD symptoms and impairment may change for women across the menstrual cycle. The effects of hormones on the brain and on women’s mental health are often overlooked, and this is perhaps especially true for women with neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD and autism. Over the next few years, I would like to continue to focus on these questions, including a research focus on perimenopause and menopause among neurodiverse women. Perimenopause and menopause is a very under-researched phase of life for women; many women with ADHD, who I have worked and spoken to, pointed to this time period as one they were really concerned about and wanted to have more research on. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers and to women wanting to pursue a research career investigating ADHD? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think there is so much interesting work to be done in many areas, and of course, especially ADHD. As far as advice, I would say that there are ups and downs in research, and periods of time where things are going well and you’re publishing, getting grants etc, and then lulls where it feels like things are going really slowly and nothing is working out. Sometimes you just have to ride the wave for a bit (either way), know that things will change and try not to have your self-concept be too influenced by these phases. And of course, academia is not the only way to do research, and not the only way to do neuroscience, so I would also encourage people to think outside the box as well as other ways they can engage with neuroscience, via working for funders, industry, charities, the government etc. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need improving/addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it’s important for students/early career researchers to have mentors they can see themselves in - people who may have had similar experiences or faced similar challenges. Given the overall under-representation of women and people of colour in higher levels of academia, this is something that needs to be improved. </span></span></p>

<p>A nanotube researcher in Japan has earned 13 retractions, with more to come, after an extensive investigation by the country’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) revealed widespread misconduct in his work. </p>



<p>AIST’s investigation found Naohiro Kameta, senior principal researcher at the Nanomaterials Research Institute located in AIST’s Ibaraki campus, fabricated and falsified dozens of studies. He was apparently dismissed from his role following the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The institute first learned of the problems in Kameta’s work in November 2022, according to a translated version of the <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">investigation report</a>. Initially, they looked into five papers, but eventually expanded their scrutiny to 61 articles on which Kameta was the lead or responsible author.</p>



<span id="more-130178"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/Portals/0/resource_images/aist_j/information/240329_anken1.pdf">The investigation</a>, which wrapped up in December 2023, found Kameta had “independently committed research misconduct” by fabricating and falsifying data in 42 papers published between 2005 and 2022. According to the findings, Kameta cut out parts of electron micrographs to portray them as different structures. He also falsified scale bars of diagrams to be longer or shorter – <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10847-024-01257-x">in one instance</a> making the scale almost 10 times larger than the true size of the material shown. The report added Kameta’s research notes were incomplete and many of the samples he should have preserved were discarded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kameta received about $230,000 (more than ¥33 million) in grant funding for research topics broadly related to the misconduct, of which approximately $35,000 was directly spent on the work described in the papers AIST found to have fake data, according to the investigation report. The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science <a href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-kousei/sochi/2024-4-8.html">has ordered the research funds be returned</a>, and stated they will not provide funding to Kameta for 10 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investigators at AIST collected responses to a questionnaire sent to more than 20 other individuals who had co-authored papers with Kameta. According to their responses, many of them had trusted Kameta’s expertise and didn’t critically review the data or images presented in the final publications. In some cases, co-authors admitted they didn’t check the papers before submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19 papers AIST reviewed that didn’t appear to have evidence of research misconduct, the investigation found data discrepancies in 14 that did not significantly affect the conclusions of the papers. Those issues may have arisen because of “carelessness,” according to the investigators, who recommended Kameta request corrections for these articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The institution also identified Toshimi Shimizu and Mitsutoshi Masuda, colleagues of Kameta at AIST, as authors responsible for the content of the papers, but found they were not involved in any misconduct. Shimizu’s staff page <a href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/tshmz-shimizu/Home-e.html">remains active</a> on the AIST website, although his institutional email bounced back when we attempted to contact him. Masuda is listed as a <a href="https://unit.aist.go.jp/ischem/en/organization/index.html">deputy director</a> of sustainable chemistry at the institute. He did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several journals have already begun retracting Kameta’s work, and more are expected to follow. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Naohiro-Misconduct-Papers.xlsx">By our count</a>, out of the 42 papers identified as problematic, 13 have so far been retracted. Fourteen of the remaining, unretracted papers appeared in journals published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. A representative of the publisher said they were aware of the issues and would be pursuing retractions of the papers. Five other unretracted papers appeared in journals published by the American Chemical Society. The publisher has not responded to requests for comment. </p>



<p>In July, <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/au20240731_1.html">the institution released a statement regarding Kameta’s case, announcing that </a>“one employee found to have been involved in research misconduct will be dismissed.” Another employee not involved in misconduct, but responsible for the papers, would be suspended from work for a month, according to the statement. AIST’s press office would not confirm whether the dismissed employee was Kameta, but the investigators identified Kameta as the only individual responsible for the misconduct. Kameta no longer has a staff profile on the institution’s website and his email bounced back when we attempted to contact him.</p>

<p>Year after year, a husband-and-wife team at a university in Iran has been publishing studies involving research on cell lines ostensibly purchased from <a href="https://en.pasteur.ac.ir/">the Pasteur Institute of Iran</a>, in Tehran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the couple may never have been in possession of the cells. In correspondence obtained by Retraction Watch, the Pasteur Institute told their employer, Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, only three of the many cell lines described in their publications had been available at the national cell bank over the past decade.</p>



<p>A university official confirmed the two researchers – <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=wo3tSNQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Fraidoon Kavoosi</a>, an associate professor in <a href="https://medicine.jums.ac.ir/%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%87-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AD%DB%8C">the department of anatomical science</a>, and his wife <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=2gu1bA0AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Masumeh Sanaei</a>, an assistant professor in the same department – were under investigation.</p>

<p>Amir Abdoli, vice president of research and technology at Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>There were some ambiguities regarding the availability&nbsp;of cell lines in the&nbsp;Pasteur Institute of Iran as well as the place of [the couple’s] works, as their works have not been performed in the laboratories of&nbsp;Jahrom University of Medical Sciences. We asked the authors to respond several times, but we didn&#8217;t receive a reasonable answer. Hence, we had to send the documents and evidence to the Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Research for future investigation and decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have not yet contacted the journals because we are waiting for the ethics committee&#8217;s decision.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Abdoli added that following a vote by the Basic Science Research Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, the school had stopped accepting new research proposals from the two professors.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In theory, it’s possible that researchers claiming to have obtained cell lines from a repository that doesn’t stock them may still have worked with those cell lines, according to Jennifer Byrne, <a href="https://biobank.health.nsw.gov.au/about-the-biobank/meet-the-team/">director of biobanking with NSW Health Pathology</a>, in Australia, and a professor of molecular oncology at the University of Sydney:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For example, they could have obtained them from someone else who they assumed had obtained them from the claimed repository, but didn’t. The claimed resource could reflect people wanting to signal that they obtained cell lines from a known repository, as this is best practice, or a trust signal, when in fact, many researchers pass cell lines between each other as this is quicker, cheaper and more convenient. That said, claiming to use cell lines from a repository that doesn’t stock them could be considered a yellow flag, as this is a misleading claim, although a claim that could have been made in good faith.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ijc.34995">a study</a> published earlier this year, Byrne and her colleagues found hundreds of papers consistently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/11/misspelled-cell-lines-take-on-new-lives-and-why-thats-bad-for-the-scientific-literature/">misspelled the names of cell lines</a> the authors said they used in their work – <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/hundreds-cancer-papers-mention-cell-lines-don-t-seem-exist">possibly a sign of paper mill involvement</a>. The Iranian case is different, as the cell lines described in the couple’s articles seem to be real.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know how often people might claim to have obtained cell lines that do exist from places that don’t stock these cell lines, as we focussed on non-verifiable cell lines in our study,” Byrne told us.</p>



<p>Kavoosi did not respond to emails requesting comment. We were unable to find contact information for Sanaei.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Since 2014, the couple has coauthored dozens of studies, according to their Google Scholar profiles. Many have appeared in Iran-based journals, such as the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijom/pages/results.aspx?txtKeywords=fraidoon+kavoosi"><em>International Journal of Preventive Medicine</em></a>, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/adbm/pages/results.aspx?txtKeywords=fraidoon+kavoosi"><em>Advanced Biomedical Research</em></a>, and <a href="https://journals.lww.com/rips/pages/results.aspx?txtKeywords=fraidoon+kavoosi"><em>Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences</em></a>, all published by Wolters Kluwer, as well as the <a href="https://journal.waocp.org/?_action=article&amp;au=260344&amp;_au=Kavoosi,%20Fraidoon"><em>Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of their work has focused on assessing effects of established or potential drugs on human cancer cells. The suspect articles all state the cells were obtained from the Pasteur Institute of Iran.</p>



<p>But a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Letter-1-page-1.jpg">letter</a> from Jahrom’s president to the Pasteur Institute dated Oct. 31, 2023, suggests the the research duo’s institution had grown suspicious of their work.</p>



<p>According to a machine translation of the letter, Mohammad Rahmanian inquired about a long list of cell lines he said were unavailable from Pasteur’s website but were needed by his school for research. He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Letter-1-page-2.jpg">listed</a> the names of 70 cell lines he was looking to purchase in an attached spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We spot-checked the cell lines in the spreadsheet and found they appeared to correspond to cells Kavoosi, Sanaei and their coauthors stated they had purchased from the Pasteur Institute of Iran.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Letter-2.jpg">reply</a> to Jahrom dated April 16, 2024, Delaram Doroud, deputy director of research, technology and education at the Pasteur Institute of Iran, made reference to a subsequent letter and a phone call from Jahrom University and explained that, in the past 10 years, only three of the 70 cell lines had been available from the institute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We sought comment from the Pasteur Institute of Iran, including Doroud, and the Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Research, but have not heard back.</p>

<p>A psychiatry researcher who <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/ethics/fda-describes-objectionable-conditions-at-new-york-state-psychiatric-institute/">received a warning letter</a> from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this year committed research misconduct, another federal watchdog found.</p>



<p>Bret Rutherford, formerly a research psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University, “engaged in research misconduct by recklessly falsely reporting that all human research subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for late-life depression studies,” according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-rutherford-bret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">case summary</a>&nbsp;from the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) published today.</p>



<p>As&nbsp;<em>The Transmitter</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/ethics/exclusive-shake-up-at-top-psychiatric-institute-following-suicide-in-clinical-trial/">previously reported</a>, a suicide that occurred during one of Rutherford’s trials in 2021 was followed by a suspension of his research a few months later. The U.S. Office of Human Research Protections subsequently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/health/columbia-drug-trials-suicide.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">halted</a>&nbsp;all federally funded research involving human participants at the institute in June 2023 and launched a review of its research practices.</p>



<span id="more-130163"></span>



<p>The ORI’s findings detail how in five published papers, Rutherford reported that 45 research participants were eligible for clinical studies, when in fact they were taking antidepressants or other medications that should have excluded them from participation. Rutherford also included 15 participants who took medications during a 28-day washout period before the trial when they were not supposed to be taking the medications, and he reported full washout periods for 8 participants who underwent shorter periods.</p>



<p>The false reporting affected “the reported clinical research methods and results” of the five articles, the ORI’s finding stated. Three of the articles have been retracted, and the other two have been corrected.&nbsp;<em>The Transmitter</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/retraction/flawed-protocol-for-levodopa-clinical-trial-brings-retractions/">previously reported</a>&nbsp;on the corrections and two of the retractions, which reference protocol violations in a clinical trial of whether levodopa, a drug for Parkinson’s disease, could help older adults with depression.</p>



<p>The third retraction, of a&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-00860-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&nbsp;about a levodopa trial published in&nbsp;<em>Neuropsychopharmacology</em>, appeared in March. The retraction&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-024-01851-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notice</a>&nbsp;stated that the authors had retracted the article “because they have found deviations from the approved protocols supplying data for this analysis.”</p>



<p>Rutherford agreed to a three-year ban on U.S. government funding, effective 27 September 2024, followed by a three-year period of supervision for any research conducted with funding from the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the National Institutes of Health.</p>



<p>Rutherford did not respond to&nbsp;<em>The Transmitter</em>’s request for comment.</p>

                <p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Disclaimer:</span></span></strong></em><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Gender is a self-described characteristic, whilst sex is biologically determined. The term ‘women’ can refer to either or both definitions, and this may vary according to the study cited. At Women in Neuroscience UK, we tackle both sexism and gender biases in neuroscience, by covering topics of sex/gender discrimination in neuroscience workplaces and sex differences in neurological conditions. Our current activities primarily support female-identifying neuroscientists but we actively encourage people of all gender identities to our community. We believe everyone can benefit from learning and peer support towards more diverse and inclusive neuroscience.</span></span></em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite growing movements toward equality, women continue to face barriers in society and in neuroscience spaces. From skewed representation to unequal pay, this piece aims to expose injustices facing women in neuroscience and calls for action towards a fairer, more inclusive future.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Underrepresentation in senior roles</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women are awarded over half of bachelor’s and master’s degrees in neuroscience worldwide. At the postdoctoral level, there is an equal split between men and women (Euraxess, 2018). Yet, women are not fairly represented at senior career stages; for example, less than 14% of tenured neuroscience faculty in the US are female (Sibener et al., 2022) and men account for around 75% of professors in Europe (Gibney, 2022).</span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_d7da42db74b14c49a07c7bbf6426cc59~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_988,h_679,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Figure 1. Proportion (%) of men and women in a typical academic career, students and academic staff, EU-28, 1999-2016 |Source: She Figures 2018 and 2015 (Euraxess 2019)."></figure>
<p>While men and women may possess identical educational backgrounds, statistically, men are more likely to progress in their career paths more quickly, leading to a disproportional underrepresentation of women in senior roles. Some contributing factors include unconscious gender biases, sexual harassment and the pressure to take on home duties. Women are more likely than men to take on primary carer roles for children and the elderly (including people with dementia), resulting in less time to invest in their careers (Sharma et al., 2016). Furthermore, women who have children are less likely to be promoted compared to men who have children (NCT, 2022). </p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_08c57ca2dcb140d583ee52eb7ecdf4ab~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_918,h_690,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p>Furthermore, male academics tend to receive greater recognition from their university, be more respected by their students, and obtain administrative assistance more easily (Greene et al., 2010). In other words, the underrepresentation of women is not a matter of competence or aptitude, but rather a number of barriers that reduce the likelihood of women being promoted or hired for higher-earning positions – this phenomenon is referred to as the ‘<span style="color: #BF7DA7;">glass ceiling</span>’.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><em><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Reasons for underrepresentation of women in senior roles:</span></span></strong></em></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Sexism in the workplace and its broad detriments</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The </span></span><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">authority gap</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> impacts women across workplaces, due to harmful and ongoing sexist stereotypes and biases. Women are more likely to be interrupted, talked over, and not taken seriously by their male co-workers. Attempts by women to overcome these barriers, by being confident or assertive, can instead be viewed as aggressive and abrasive (Doyle-Morris, 2021). </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_32641de1d81c47cfb97fd7b369ebaf0f~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_986,h_661,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women are nearly three times more likely than men to be sexually harassed at work (Kearl, Johns, &amp; Raj, 2019), and 1 in 7 of these women opt to change jobs (Kearl, Johns, &amp; Raj, 2019). According to a study, approximately 78% of female STEM undergraduate students have experienced some form of sexual harassment in the previous year (Leaper &amp; Starr, 2018). As a consequence, women may feel uncomfortable in their work or study environment and be discouraged from investing time and effort in their careers. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gender pay gap: hiring</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Male faculty members tend to hire 10-40% fewer women than female faculty members (Sheltzer &amp; Smith, 2014). This can, in part, be attributed to conscious and unconscious gender bias, as well as the prospect of maternity leave, which discourages men from hiring young, and/or newlywed, women or cause them to lose their jobs (Topping, 2015). The percentage of women hired decreases further if the male faculty is high achieving (Sheltzer &amp; Smith, 2014). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Female academics also tend to be allocated more teaching and service roles (Greene et al., 2010), which was considered to be one of the departmental obstacles to recruiting and hiring women faculty.</span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With reduced employment opportunities and visibility in the field, women face greater barriers to progressing their careers, becoming high achievers and reaching their full potential. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gender pay gap: grant funding</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are clear disparities in the allocation of grant funding. In dementia research, for example, women make up 60% of researchers in the UK but are only awarded 37% of grants (Alzheimer’s Research UK, 2022). This could result in female researchers struggling to afford high cost experiments and high-impact factor journals to publish their work, leading them to opt for lower-visibility outlets and resulting in the underrepresentation of women authors in high-impact journals. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Underrepresentation in journals</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">A 2022 study (Son &amp; Bell, 2022) looked at 119,592 manuscript submissions by scientists before, and during, the pandemic. The study concluded that women contribute fewer manuscripts than men for all world regions, for both the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods, although there is a slow increase. Before the lockdown in 2020, female authors made up 16.5% of submitted manuscripts. During the pandemic, the rate of increase slowed, but we still saw a 2.3% rise (to 18.8%) in the number of manuscripts submitted by female scientists. However, in most countries, except for China, South Korea, and Taiwan, the number of female first authors has seen a decline in recent years (Son &amp; Bell, 2022). Fewer women in senior roles and leading research projects, along with gender biases in grant funding and article reviewing may contribute to fewer female first and last authors.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In addition, female scientists are significantly less likely to be cited, particularly in articles published by high-impact journals, and they are more likely to report that their contributions were underestimated by the team (Ross et al., 2022).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Imposter syndrome in an environment that was not built for women</span></span></strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_dc0b20a5c55242eea53aa99c488cd729~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_756,h_850,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lack of self-confidence can be detrimental to women’s career advancement in several ways. Compared to men, female applicants are less inclined to apply for positions when they do not meet all of the criteria because of self-doubt (Mohr, 2014). This lack of confidence also contributes to the pay gap, with women being less likely to ask for a raise, often due to fear of backlash from not conforming to society’s stereotype. Lack of self-confidence is also thought to contribute to underrepresentation in high-profile journals. A survey, completed by over 4,800 scientists, found that only 37% of women reported submitting papers to Nature, Science, and PNAS, compared with almost 49% of men (Chawla, 2023). It was concluded that women tended to only submit their best work to high-profile journals, whereas men were more likely to submit papers of lower quality or novelty. In addition, men were more likely to cite their own work than women who, in contrast, tend to underrate their contributions to academic papers (Chawla, 2023).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, a meta-analysis of clinical journal articles concluded that papers with a male first or last author were more likely to present their own  findings in a positive light within titles and abstracts, relative to articles with female first and last authors. This was particularly prominent in journals with a higher impact rating. Presenting research findings more positively was also correlated with a greater number of article citations (Lerchenmueller, Sorenson &amp; Jena, 2019).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Many women report feeling intimidated (Clarke, 2022) entering male-dominated spaces due to the aforementioned factors, such as sexual harassment and discrimination, reducing chances of speaking out and/or seeking support in cases of workplace harassment. When an individual feels doubtful and like they don’t belong in a space, this is often described as ‘imposter syndrome’,</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> &quot;The frequent feeling of not deserving one&apos;s success, and of being a failure despite a sustained record of achievements&quot;, as per Cambridge Dictionary. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">A recent meta-analysis, combining data from over 42,000 participants and 108 studies, found that women consistently scored higher than men in measures of impostor syndrome. This sex disparity did not reduce over time, despite gradual increases in female representation at more senior career stages and some positive advancements in societal views.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Altogether, this increases the likelihood of women leaving neuroscience workspaces in a vicious cycle.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lack of recognition</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women often do not receive the recognition and visibility they deserve. Less than 6% of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureates are women, despite making up a substantial fraction (33%) of researchers worldwide (UNESCO, 2021) and having made groundbreaking discoveries. There have even been instances of female researchers who have had their research plagiarised, and as a result, received no credit for it. One great example is </span></span><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://sruk.org.uk/lack-of-sleep-alcoholic-fermentation-and-other-untold-discoveries-by-maria-manasseina/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Manasseina</a></span></span></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, a pioneer neuroscientist, specialising in the impacts of prolonged sleep deprivation. Prior to that, she worked in a lab at the Polytechnic University of Vienna where she investigated the role of yeast in alcoholic fermentation. 25 years later, the male scientist, Eduard Buchner, published a very similar paper to hers replicating the same results, without crediting her work. In 1907, Buchner won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Manasseina’s name was obliterated (WINEU, 2017). </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gender pay gap: salary</span></span></strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_e04f6fae88f140e990e63967cdabf36b~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_974,h_802,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite the UK achieving a high parity score of 0.789, according to the World Economic Forum (Pal, Piaget and Zahidi, 2024), a clear pay gap remains. On average, female full-time workers are paid 10.7% less than their male counterparts. and it is estimated that the gender pay gap will not close until 2051 (Fawcett Society, 2023). The pay gap also extends to race, with black women earning almost 25% less than white women, which is a result of systemic racism. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One factor that contributes to the overall gender pay gap is the underrepresentation of women in senior roles, however there also lies pay disparities between men and women doing the same jobs. In the medical field, for example, the mean annual income for a male GP between 2016 and 2017 was £93,760, while female GPs of the same level were paid just £75,671, which is a 19% difference (Russel, 2020). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Of women who, despite societal pressures, pursue a raise, approximately 15% are successful, relative to 20% of their male counterparts (Artz, Goodall &amp; Oswald, 2018). Pay gaps have the potential to significantly impact mental health during the cost of living crisis, especially in the case of single mothers. A study by the charity Mind estimates that 74% of women in England and Wales feel that their mental health has suffered from the rising cost of living (Nicholls, 2023; Rosseninsky, 2024).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Underrepresentation in clinical trials</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Historically, the female body has been grossly understudied. Back in ancient Greece, physicians believed uteruses were able to ‘wander’ around the body and cause a wide range of neurological symptoms such as anxiety, headaches, and tremors – they named this condition hysteria (Tasca et al., 2012). This was used by clinicians as an excuse to dismiss symptoms of female patients and, therefore, prioritise men’s health. Nowadays, while we have an increasing understanding of female anatomy, we still see sex and gender discrepancies in women’s health, treatment and ongoing research.  </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_56e901e0dd9b47edb868212019494552~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_768,h_589,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">From 1977 to 1993, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guideline was in effect, prohibiting most women of childbearing age from taking part in clinical trials. This guideline followed the thalidomide scandal, to protect women from possible side effects and to prevent birth defects in their children (NIH, 2020). However, this meant many medications and treatments were released to the public without undergoing clinical testing on women, resulting in unfavourable side effects and outcomes for women. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Currently, clinical trials supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandate the inclusion of female participants, but privately funded trials have no such requirements. Additionally, NIH funding trends reveal a greater financial commitment to conditions predominantly impacting males (Mirin, 2021).  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In clinical and preclinical trials today, women often continue to make up less than half of participants. In dementia research, women constitute 58% of participants, despite making up 64% of dementia patients (Pinho-Gomes et al., 2022). Furthermore, only 1 in 6 of the rodents featured in pre-clinical research are female (Brookshire, 2019). Female mice have been thought to display greater variability than male mice due to hormonal fluctuations as per their oestrous cycle. Some scientists claim that female mice require more funds and labour to mitigate the effects caused by the oestrous cycle, which has proven to be a major impediment to the inclusion of female subjects in research.  However, more recent research seems to suggest that male rodents are just as variable as their female counterparts (Kaluve, Le &amp; Graham, 2022). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The historic, and to an extent continued, exclusion or underrepresentation of women in animal and human clinical trials, and the lack of sex-specific analysis, is of great concern. With less data on treatment impacts on women, we have poorer evidence-based healthcare for women and greater risks of poorly understood adverse effects for women from treatments.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Two-thirds of people with dementia are female, but due to a lack of research, we don’t know why this is and whether there are sex-specific disease pathways (Alzheimer’s Research UK, 2022). With limited research, women’s health is so poorly understood that doctors more frequently misdiagnose their female patients: women are 50% more likely than men to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack (BHF, 2016) and 33% after a stroke (Newman-Toker et al., 2014), both of which can be life-threatening. Women also report waiting longer than 10 months after their first GP visit to receive a brain tumour diagnosis, when early diagnosis and treatment are essential for a good prognosis (Dusenbery, 2018). On the other hand, women are more likely to be diagnosed with mental disorders such as depression (Sundbom et al., 2017). They are overprescribed antidepressants, despite having identical depression symptom scores as their male counterparts, which results in unwanted mild to severe side effects for women (Leonard &amp; Biggers, 2021). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, women are at a much higher risk of overdosing on prescribed drugs due to incorrect dosage, stemming from lack of research and female underrepresentation in clinical trials. Moreover, over 90% of human trials do not report sex-specific outcomes and side effects, which could be key to improving understanding and treatment of womens’ health (Martinkova et al., 2021). Each year, it is estimated that 40,000 to 80,000 people die as a result of diagnostic errors in the US alone (Dusenbery, 2018). This is a major issue that must be addressed to prevent further unnecessary deaths in the future. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Final thoughts</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The world of neuroscience is often more difficult for women, especially when dealing with neurological conditions, as individuals or as carers, but also as neuroscience researchers. For most of history, science has been done by men for men, while women have been perceived as the secondary sex. Consequently, women are expected to work harder and confront deeply ingrained societal constructs to climb the career ladder. In spite of all that, neuroscience is slowly evolving and becoming more inclusive towards women. Women now have platforms, like WiNUK, to voice their concerns as well as to share their stories and inspire other fellow scientists, and we hope that things will only get better for researchers, their environments, and their work. It is fantastic to see grant funds being developed to support sex-stratified neuroscience research, for example: </span></span><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://www.alz.org/research/for_researchers/grants/types-of-grants/aarg-d" target="_blank">AARG-D Research Grant| Alzheimer&apos;s Association</a></span></span></u><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">.</span></span></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> With specific funding pots, the increasing interest in women’s health, and efforts like WiNUK working towards closing the gender gap in neuroscience senior career positions, we hope to see a future of neuroscience free from sexism.</span></span></p>

                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Lauren Cadwallader, Open Research Manager, PLOS</p>



<p>The latest version of PLOS&rsquo; Open Science Indicators (OSI) dataset has been released, extending to six and a half years&rsquo; worth of data. The dataset now covers 141,864 articles published from January 1st 2018 to June 30th 2024, offering insights into Open Science practices over time for both PLOS publications and a set of comparable articles from other publishers.</p>

<p>This release includes the latest results for data and code sharing, and preprint posting. For preliminary rates of study registration, and protocol sharing, check out the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21687686.v7">June 2024</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21687686.v4">September 2023</a> releases, respectively.</p>



<p>As well as tracking changes over time, the dataset allows us to focus on different Open Science practices and how these vary by discipline, geography, or between PLOS and other publishers. But it also allows us to delve into how different Open Science practices may be connected. In the rest of this post we demonstrate some ways in which the OSI data can be explored with a view to multiple Open Science practices, raising some questions and possible interpretations. <strong>We would love to hear your thoughts on this post or how you have used the OSI dataset to explore Open Science practices.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are researchers sharing everything they potentially could?</h3>



<p>One important aspect of the OSI dataset is the determination of whether an article <em>generates</em> an Open Science output. All articles could generate a preprint but not all (96%) of PLOS articles generate data, and 37% generate code &ndash; as determined by DataSeer&rsquo;s algorithms. Understanding whether an article generated an output means that we can put the sharing of outputs into context. In this blog we start to explore sharing rates in the context of generation rates, as well as possible correlations between different Open Science practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we only look at practices individually then we get one view of how Open Science is being carried out. For example, Figure 2 below looks at how code, preprint and data sharing rates change in 2 year increments for PLOS articles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="392" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig2-1024x392.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22522" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig2-1024x392.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig2-300x115.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig2-768x294.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig2-1536x588.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig2-2048x784.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 2: Proportion of articles generating and sharing code, data or preprints for PLOS articles in 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024 (first 6 months only). The segment of code and data that fall into the &ldquo;not shared&rdquo; category includes articles that cannot share code/data for ethical or legal reasons but may make it available via access requests.</em></p>



<p>If we consider how many outputs an article is sharing compared to how many were generated, then a different view of Open Science practice emerges. In Figure 3 we can observe that for PLOS, the percentage of articles sharing all outputs that <em>could be shared</em> remained the same in 2022 to 2024, while the percentage of articles sharing at least one of these three outputs has grown. This finding is not evident for the PLOS results in Figure 2, which show very little change in sharing rates of code and data, for those generating it, and preprints.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="401" height="222" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22523" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig3.png 401w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Blog-fig3-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 3: Proportion of articles sharing all, some or none of the Open Science outputs generated by the article for PLOS and Comparators in 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024 (first 6 months only).</em></p>



<p>Comparators on the other hand show growth over time in both the segment of articles sharing everything that could be shared, and the segment sharing at least one output.These rates are still lower than the rates at&nbsp; PLOS &ndash; and the PLOS rates also have room for growth &ndash; suggesting that many opportunities remain for publishers to support researchers in carrying out Open Science practices.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who are the leading adopters of Open Science practices?</h3>



<p>There is an interesting segment of articles in the OSI dataset, which correspond to what one could call &ldquo;leading adopters&rdquo; of Open Science practices: those sharing all the outputs that could be shared, as measured by OSIs (14% of articles published in the first half of 2024). Taking a deeper look at the articles that generate all three outputs (preprints, data and code), what proportion of these share, and how this changes over time also reveals some patterns. Figure 4 below shows this for PLOS articles in 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024. Since 2018:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The percentage of articles sharing only data and code, which the dataset can also reveal are highly correlated, has remained relatively stable</li>



<li>The percentage of articles just sharing data and preprints increased between 2018 and 2020 but then stays relatively stable</li>



<li>The percentage of articles sharing all three generated outputs increased from 2018 to 2020 and again to 2022</li>



<li>The percentage of articles sharing only one output has decreased from 2018 to 2020 and again to 2022</li>



<li>The percentage of articles not sharing any outputs has remained relatively stable</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="419" height="257" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/blog-fig4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22524" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/blog-fig4.png 419w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/blog-fig4-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /></figure>



<p><em>Figure 4: Breakdown of the types of outputs shared, for PLOS articles generating data, code and preprints, by year.</em></p>



<p>What might this be telling us? What questions does it raise? Researchers are sharing more outputs over time, yes, but we already know this. The more interesting questions are: how and why are researchers adopting more Open Science practices? Have there been lasting effects of global events since 2018 on sharing practices (preprinting, for example, accelerated during the pandemic and has since plateaued)?&nbsp; Or is it a case of incremental adoption? The way in which adoption of practices spreads, how different practices relate to one another, and differ across disciplines and geographies are all interesting topics for those of us who are championing the adoption of Open Science practices.</p>



<p>The observations above are preliminary and based only on quantitative data, but combining them with a deeper understanding of the causes of these differences as well as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16171">effects of Open Science practices</a> could reveal more opportunities to support authors in becoming&nbsp; leading Open Science adopters. These are questions we are continuing to explore at PLOS, and we welcome feedback from and collaboration with others who are doing the same.</p>

<p>Karen Rech, a hematopathologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., was reading a case report about a rare disease when she recognized the patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the authors of the paper were affiliated with the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Fargo, the patient in the report had gone to Mayo for care, and Rech had made the pathology diagnosis. But the article, “<a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/229917-a-diagnostic-dilemma-and-classification-conundrum-atypical-histiocytic-neoplasm-presenting-as-a-calvarial-mass#">A Diagnostic Dilemma and Classification Conundrum: Atypical Histiocytic Neoplasm Presenting as a Calvarial Mass</a>,” published in <em>Cureus</em> in February, didn’t mention or credit Rech or her colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The ability to make such a unique diagnosis is a direct result of my translational research in histiocytic neoplasms,” Rech wrote in an email to the journal in April. After she made the pathology diagnosis, a hematologist colleague saw the patient, and a group of specialists discussed the case and came to a consensus diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130161"></span>



<p>The North Dakota physicians, who had referred the patient to Mayo, were able to access the Mayo physicians’ clinical notes, laboratory data and pathology reports through the electronic medical record and used the information to produce the case report, Rech wrote. She identified incorrect statements about pathology in the article, too, wording that had come from a Mayo hematology fellow’s clinical note.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The case report indisputably represents plagiarism,” Rech wrote. “As such, it should be retracted to maintain the integrity of the medical literature.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, the journal’s editors agreed with Rech. But after the authors of the paper objected and the editors asked their institutions to investigate, the journal decided not to retract the article. It remains intact, without any notice. The article has received no citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">recently paused</a> indexing new content from <em>Cureus</em> for quality concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In May, Graham Parker-Finger, director of publishing and customer success for <em>Cureus</em>, responded to Rech’s email. He told her the journals’ editor in chief “has determined that this article must be retracted due to plagiarism, the presence of several incorrect statements and the seemingly intentional omission of the pathologists from the author list.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal would retract the article “by the end of the week,” Parker-Finger wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But four days later, Parker-Finger wrote to Rech and Laura Nichols, the senior author of the paper and an internal medicine physician at Sanford Health and the University of North Dakota:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the circumstances and details presented by both parties in this dispute, the journal has elected not to proceed with immediate retraction and instead request that formal investigations by each of your institutions be conducted in order to resolve this matter. Upon reviewing the results of both investigations, the journal will take the action deemed appropriate in light of the facts presented.</p>



<p>When Rech reminded Parker-Finger of the reasons for retracting the paper he had sent a few days before, he responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Upon further consideration, the journal is treating this only as a disputed authorship at this time. Should investigations by your respective institutions reveal otherwise, we will determine the proper course of action which may include correction or retraction. However, it is not Springer Nature or Cureus policy to intervene and pick sides in authorship disputes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In July, Parker-Finger informed Rech <em>Cureus</em> editors had reviewed reports on the dispute from Mayo and Sanford and “have determined that no further action will be taken” on the article. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Upon careful review, and taking both reports into consideration, we have determined that the allegations of plagiarism and scientific inaccuracy lack sufficient merit to warrant editorial action such as a correction or retraction.The journal now considers this matter to be closed. Thank you again for your patience and cooperation in this matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Nichols told us she stands by her work and its academic integrity. “When this issue surfaced, we fully cooperated with the journal on their comprehensive inquiry,” she said. “The result of the investigation uncovered no evidence of plagiarism or any academic misconduct, and the article was not retracted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter to the journal editors that she also sent to Rech, Nichols wrote she and her coauthors were “significantly involved in the care and workup of the patient that was the subject of the article.” The team had reached out to the pathology department at Mayo to collaborate on the article but “we did not connect with them,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Any physician or practitioner who has cared for the patient may write up a case report as information within the medical chart is considered data and not published literature,” Nichols wrote. She also noted the patient had given permission for the authors to publish the case report. “The patient’s private health information is her information, and she has agency to choose with whom and how her information is shared.” </p>



<p>“Although the author team agrees that in the spirit of collaboration and collegiality, additional attempts should have been made to connect with the other physicians, we unequivocally state that no plagiarism took place,” Nichols wrote. She suggested “exploring the possibility of a correction to the current article with the addition of an acknowledgement of the outside institution physicians.”</p>



<p>In response to our request for comment, Parker-Finger said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As a result of the concerns raised, the journal requested institutions investigate and provide their assessment to us. Upon careful review and after taking the reports from Mayo Clinic and Sanford Health into consideration, it was determined that allegations of plagiarism and scientific inaccuracy lacked sufficient merit to warrant editorial action, such as a correction or retraction. The Cureus Editors-in-Chief determined that no further action was warranted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rech left a comment on the <em>Cureus</em> web page for the article describing what happened. “It is detrimental to medical progress in rare diseases when novel findings based on the translational research of experts are published with errors by non-experts,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When Cureus allowed non-experts to publish on a rare histiocytic neoplasm, they introduced inaccurate information into the literature that is detrimental to medical progress. Further, why would they allow someone to take credit for other physicians’ expertise? A patient searching for an expert in the field will be led to the wrong institution based on this article. We need to advocate for patients with rare diseases, not exploit them for a quick publication.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/james-prev-150x150-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/james-prev-150x150-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-128705"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Studnicki</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The authors of three papers about abortion Sage retracted earlier this year have sued the publisher, alleging the company pulled the articles “for pretextual and discriminatory reasons.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, Sage <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/06/papers-used-by-judge-to-justify-abortion-pill-suspension-retracted/">retracted three articles</a> from <em>Health Services Research and Managerial Epidemiology</em> “because of undeclared conflicts of interest and after expert reviewers found that the studies demonstrate a lack of scientific rigor that invalidates or renders unreliable the authors’ conclusions,” according to the publisher’s <a href="https://perspectivesblog.sagepub.com/blog/note-from-sage-on-retractions-in-health-services-research-and-managerial-epidemiology">statement</a> at the time. Sage also removed the paper’s lead author from the editorial board of the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-publisher-retracts-studies-cited-by-texas-judge-suspending-abortion-pills-2024-02-06/">cited two of the articles</a> last year in his decision to suspend approval of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation#:~:text=Mifepristone%20is%20a%20drug%20that,of%20the%20last%20menstrual%20period).">mifepristone</a>, a drug used in medical abortions.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130152"></span>



<p>Sage’s actions “violated California contract, tort, and civil rights law,” according to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10z_WsdnfzzhJ49u0UFG7awQSomp8LB5h/view?usp=sharing">lawsuit</a>, filed Thursday in California’s Ventura County Superior Court. The authors also allege the retractions have caused “enormous and incalculable harm” to their professional reputations, and “they are now being treated as pariahs.”</p>



<p>Their lawsuit seeks to compel Sage to enter arbitration of their claims, as required by the publishing agreements the authors signed with the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawyers for the authors claim Sage has “engaged in a months-long campaign of cat-and-mouse negotiations apparently designed to delay arbitration and pressure the Authors into waiving their discovery rights as a condition of arbitrating.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage declined to comment on the pending litigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Studnicki, the lead author of the three papers, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/06/papers-used-by-judge-to-justify-abortion-pill-suspension-retracted/">previously told Retraction Watch</a> the retractions were “a blatant attempt to discredit excellent research which is incongruent with a preferred abortion narrative.” When we asked Studnicki, also vice president and director of data analytics at the pro-life <a href="https://lozierinstitute.org/adf-consovoy-mccarthy-sue-academic-publisher-for-politically-motivated-retractions/">Charlotte Lozier Institute</a>, for comment on the suit, and what he and his coauthors hoped to gain from arbitration, he referred us to the “Demand for Arbitration” attached as Exhibit J to the petition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that document, the authors allege Sage “did not articulate any scientific basis or legitimate editorial policy for retracting the Articles,” and thus breached its publishing agreements in doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retractions “were also an act of invidious discrimination,” the authors allege, as the publisher “applied inconsistent retraction standards to the Authors based on Sage&#8217;s perception of the Authors&#8217; pro-life affiliations,” in violation of California’s anti-discrimination law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The demand for arbitration states the authors are entitled to monetary relief for the harm to their reputations. “[T]he only way to make the Authors whole is to grant injunctive relief requiring Sage to comply with the plain terms of its Agreements by rescinding its retractions,” the suit states.</p>



<p><em>Health Services Research and Managerial Epidemiology, </em>is no longer accepting new submissions, according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/HME">its website</a>. A Sage spokesperson did not immediately answer our query about when and why the journal closed submissions.</p>

                <p>This coming <strong>Tuesday, October 8, 2024</strong>, the entire arXiv staff will be attending an in person all-staff meeting. Because all editorial staff will be participating in this professional development, it will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This brief change will only affect the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As the full arXiv staff gathers together for a full day of team-building and project planning, announcements will be slightly deferred.</p>
<p>As you plan your submissions to arXiv in the next few days, please be aware of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tuesday, October 8, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Monday, October 7, 2024, and before 14:00ET Wednesday October 9, 2024 will be announced on Wednesday October 9, 2024 20:00ET.</li>
</ul>
<p>To stay up to date on arXiv news and changes to the announcement schedule, subscribe to <a href="http://blog.arxiv.org/">the arXiv blog</a> or follow us on social (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=arxiv">Twitter/X</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arxiv">LinkedIn</a>) for timely updates.</p>

                WIRED tried 3D-printed steaks that you can’t buy anywhere yet. But reducing food to a technological problem leaves a bitter taste, and delivers all the joy of licking a catering catalog.

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/psychedelics-from-ancient-rituals-to-modern-medicine">Psychedelics: From Ancient Rituals to Modern Medicine</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine a world where ancient shamans and modern-day scientists found a common ground towards exploring the intricacies and workings of the human mind. Psychedelics, substances known for their profound effects on consciousness, have woven through human history from their applications in sacred rituals to cutting-edge research. While the use of psychoactive substances for medicinal or spiritual practices stretches across decades, the first study investigating the effects of psychedelics in a clinical context was documented in the 20th century. Today, psychedelics are once again in the spotlight, showing promise as treatments for mental health conditions, and offering new insights into the human mind. This fascinating class of substances consists of compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, Ayahuasca, Mescaline, DMT (Dimethyltryptamine), and more! But, have you ever wondered how these substances were discovered? Well, let&apos;s dive into that.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Case of the Curious Chemist</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the bustling labs of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals in Basel, Switzerland during the late 1930s, the air was filled with scents of chemicals and the ever-present hum of scientific inquiry. Albert Hofmann, a chemist passionate about uncovering the mysteries of nature’s compounds, embarked on a journey to synthesize new substances from ergot, a fungus known for its medicinal value. What was his goal? It was to synthesize compounds that could treat migraines and circulatory distress. Meanwhile, Hofmann’s work led to the advent of LSD-25. Although initially this didn’t seem interesting to researchers and was put aside for some time, in 1943 something extraordinary happened! As the day was winding down, Hofmann accidentally absorbed a small amount of LSD-25 through his fingertips. Suddenly, his perception of the lab transformed. Colors around him became incredibly vibrant, patterns danced before his eyes. Totally unaware of the cause of this experience, he called it a <em>cosmic sensation</em>.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Intrigued by his accidental discovery, Hofmann explored the effects of LSD-25 more deliberately. Ingesting a dose higher than what he had before, Hofmann felt a sense of anticipation mixed with trepidation. Soon, unable to stay still, he embarked on a bicycle ride back home, described as an intense and enlightening journey. As he pedalled through the quiet streets of Basel, the world around him seemed to have shifted into a kaleidoscope of colors and patterns. Sounds became more profound, and his thoughts flew freely, weaving intricate connections between ideas and emotions. The mere act of riding a bicycle became an exploration of consciousness! This little trip of exploration highlighted LSD-25 as a potential substance for chemical curiosity and as a tool for understanding the workings of the human brain.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Rippling through time</strong></em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hofmann’s discovery marked the beginning of a brand-new era in both science and culture. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, psychedelics gained a ton of popularity, not only in scientific research but also within the counterculture movement. Researchers explored their potential in psychotherapy, creativity enhancement, and spiritual practices. However, societal fears and political pressure eventually led to the regulation and prohibition of these substances by the late 1980s. Thus, it wasn’t until recent years that psychedelics experienced a resurgence in scientific research, exhibiting new insights into mental health and delving into consciousness. Even though these compounds have already shown tremendous potential effects, neural circuitry and correlates underlying responses evoked by these compounds were only recently elucidated.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>How do psychedelics rewire consciousness at the neural level?</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD-25, and DMT work their magic by interacting with a specific subset of neuronal receptors, known as serotonin type 2 (5HT-2A) receptors. 5HT-2A receptors are localized abundantly in the prefrontal cortex, a brain area responsible for higher-order cognitive functions such as complex thinking and perception. Upon binding a protein called Gq/11, a signaling cascade is activated inside the neuron which subsequently triggers the phospholipase C, (PLC) enzyme. This enzyme breaks down a molecule in the cell membrane and produces inositol phosphate (IP3) and DAG. The former leads to calcium release from storage sites, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). These molecules work together to change the activity of a neuron by influencing how the neuron communicates with other neurons. As a result, the brain experiences increased connectivity between different regions, leading to vivid imagery, altered perception, and profound cognitive shifts that regulate the psychedelic experience.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Psychedelics: From recreation to therapy</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1960s, <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>, co-founder of Apple, explored LSD-25 during his search for meaning and creativity. He described his psychedelic experience as a transformative one, claiming that exposure to psychedelics has opened up his mind to new ways of thinking and playing a pivotal role in shaping his innovative vision for technology. Jobs credited these experiences with helping him approach challenges at the organization with a unique perspective, ultimately contributing to the groundbreaking products that revolutionized the tech industry. His story beautifully illustrates how psychedelics can inspire creativity and innovation in profound ways.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highlighting a story of hope, <strong>Kari Gleiser</strong>, a patient struggling with treatment-resistant depression, found solace in psilocybin-assisted therapy. After years of battling dark thoughts, she participated in a clinical trial at Johns Hopkins University. Under the guidance of therapists, Kari’s psilocybin sessions led to profound insights and emotional breakthroughs. The once-overwhelming weight of depression was lifted, giving her a renewed sense of hope and connection. Her story is one of many that illustrate the potential of psychedelics to offer healing where traditional treatments have not worked. These stories underscore the diverse impact of psychedelics: from inspiring creativity and personal growth to providing profound therapeutic effects and relief.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As science, innovation, and medicine continue to undergo breakthroughs it becomes tremendously important for scientists, clinicians as well as policymakers in conjunction with the public to actively engage in open, informed discussions about the potential of psychedelics. With careful research and responsible applications, these substances could become valuable tools in our ongoing effort to understand and improve the human mind, offering hope to millions across the globe.</p>
