              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">A chemical imbalance doesn’t explain depression. So what does?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">You’d be forgiven for thinking that depression has a simple explanation.</p>



<p>The same mantra — that the mood disorder comes from a chemical imbalance in the brain — is repeated in doctors’ offices, medical textbooks and pharmaceutical advertisements. Those ads tell us that depression can be eased by tweaking the chemicals that are off-kilter in the brain. The only problem — and it’s a big one — is that this explanation isn’t true.</p>



<p>The phrase “chemical imbalance” is too vague to be true or false; it doesn’t mean much of anything when it comes to the brain and all its complexity. Serotonin, the chemical messenger often tied to depression, is not the one key thing that explains depression. The same goes for other brain chemicals.</p>





<p>The hard truth is that despite decades of sophisticated research, we still don’t understand what depression is. There are no clear descriptions of it, and no obvious signs of it in the brain or blood.</p>



<p>The reasons we’re in this position are as complex as the disease itself. Commonly used measures of depression, created decades ago, neglect some important symptoms and overemphasize others, particularly among certain groups of people. Even if depression could be measured perfectly, the disorder exists amid myriad levels of complexity, from biological confluences of minuscule molecules in the brain all the way out to the influences of the world at large. Countless combinations of genetics, personality, history and life circumstances may all conspire to create the disorder in any one person. No wonder the science is stuck.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why a simple “chemical imbalance” explanation holds appeal, even if it’s false, says Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. What causes depression is nuanced, he says — “not something that can easily be captured in a slogan or buzzword.”</p>



<p>So here, up front, is your fair warning: There will be no satisfying wrap-up at the end of this story. You will not come away with a scientific explanation for depression, because one does not exist. But there is a way forward for depression researchers, Aftab says. It requires grappling with nuances, complexity and imperfect data.</p>



<p>Those hard examinations are under way. “There’s been some really interesting and exciting scientific and philosophical work,” Aftab says. That forward motion, however slow, gives him hope and may ultimately benefit the millions of people around the world weighed down by depression.</p>



<h4>How is depression measured?</h4>





<p>Many people who feel depressed go into a doctor’s office and get assessed with a checklist. “Yes” to trouble sleeping, “yes” to weight loss and “yes” to a depressed mood would all yield points that get tallied into a cumulative score. A high enough score may get someone a diagnosis. The process seems straightforward. But it’s not. “Even basic issues regarding measurement of depression are actually still quite open for debate,” Aftab says.</p>



<p>That’s why there are dozens of methods to assess depression, including the standard description set by the fifth edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, or DSM-5. This manual is meant to standardize categories of illness.</p>



<p>Variety in measurement is a real problem for the field and points to the lack of understanding of the disease itself, says Eiko Fried, a clinical psychologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Current ways of measuring depression “leave you with a really impoverished, tiny look,” Fried says.</p>



<p>Scales can miss important symptoms, leaving people out. “Mental pain,” for instance, was described by patients with depression and their caregivers as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32711710/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an important feature of the illness</a>, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em>. Yet the term doesn’t show up on standard depression measurements.</p>



<p>One reason for the trouble is that the experience of depression is, by its nature, deeply personal, says clinical psychologist Ioana Alina Cristea of the University of Pavia in Italy. Individual patient complaints are often the best tool for diagnosing the disorder, she says. “We can never let these elements of subjectivity go.”</p>



<p>In the middle of the 20th century, depression was diagnosed through subjective conversation and psychoanalysis, and considered by some to be an illness of the soul. In 1960, psychiatrist Max Hamilton attempted to course-correct toward objectivity. Working at the University of Leeds in England, he published a depression scale. Today, that scale, known by its acronyms HAM-D or HRSD, is one of the most widely used depression screening tools, often used in studies measuring depression and evaluating the promise of possible treatments.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is depressed?</strong></h3>



<p>According to data from 2020, an estimated 21 million adults in the United States have had a major depressive episode in the last year, putting the overall prevalence at 8.4 percent. Rates are notably higher among females, people ages 18 to 25 and people who reported belonging to two or more races. But the widely varied scales used to diagnose depression may not accurately capture the true rates among some populations.</p>

<p>“It’s a great scheme for a scale that was made in 1960,” Fried says. Since the HRSD was published, “we have put a man on the moon, invented the internet and created powerful computers small enough to fit in people’s pockets,” Fried and his colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-022-00050-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in April in <em>Nature Reviews Psychology</em>. Yet this 60-year-old tool remains a gold standard.</p>



<p>Hamilton developed his scale by observing patients who had already been diagnosed with depression. They exhibited symptoms such as weight loss and slowed speech. But those mixtures of symptoms don’t apply to everyone with depression, nor do they capture nuance in symptoms.</p>



<p>To spot these nuances, Fried <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016503271631312X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked at 52 depression symptoms</a> across seven different scales for depression, including Hamilton’s scale. On average, each symptom appeared in three of the seven scales. A whopping 40 percent of the symptoms appeared in only one scale, Fried reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Affective Disorders</em>. The only specific symptom common to all seven scales? “Sad mood.”</p>



<p>In a study that examined depression symptoms reported by 3,703 people, Fried and Randolph Nesse, an evolutionary psychiatrist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4397113/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,030 unique symptom profiles</a>. Roughly 14 percent of participants had combinations of symptoms that were not shared with anyone else, the researchers reported in 2015 in the <em>Journal of Affective Disorders</em>.</p>



<p>Before reliable thermometers, the concept of temperature was murky. How do you understand the science of hot and cold without the tools to measure it? “You don’t,” Fried says. “You make a terrible measurement, and you have a terrible theory of what it is.” Depression presents a similar challenge, he says. Without good measurements, how can you possibly diagnose depression, determine whether symptoms get better with treatments or even prevent it in the first place?</p>



<h4>Depression differs by gender, race and culture</h4>



<p>The story gets murkier when considering who these depression scales were made for. Symptoms differ among groups of people, making the diagnosis even less relevant for certain groups.</p>

<h3>Depression symptoms measured by seven scales</h3>



<p>Seven common rating tools for depression measure a wide variety of symptoms. When researchers reviewed the 52 symptoms measured by these scales, only one specific symptom appeared in all seven — sad mood.</p>

<p>Behavioral researcher Leslie Adams of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health studies depression in Black men. “It’s clear that [depression] is negatively impacting their work lives, social lives and relationships. But they’re not being diagnosed at the same rate” as other groups, she says. For instance, white people have a lifetime risk of major depression disorder of almost 18 percent; Black people’s <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/482214" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifetime risk is 10.4 percent</a>, researchers reported in 2007 in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>. This discrepancy led Adams to ask: “Could there be a problem with diagnostic tools?”</p>



<p>Turns out, there is. Black men with depression have <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11137-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several characteristics that common scales miss</a>, such as feelings of internal conflict, not communicating with others and feeling the burdens of societal pressure, Adams and colleagues reported in 2021 in<em> BMC Public Health</em>. A lot of depression measurements are based on questions that don’t capture these symptoms, Adams says. “ ‘Are you very sad?’ ‘Are you crying?’ Some people do not emote in the same way,” she says. “You may be missing things.”</p>



<p>American Indian women living in the Southeast United States also experience symptoms that aren’t adequately caught by the scales, Adams and her team found in a separate study. These women also reported experiences that do not necessarily signal depression for them but generally do for wider populations.</p>



<p>On common scales, “there are some items that really do not capture the experience of depression for these groups,” Adams says. For instance, a common question asks how well someone agrees with the sentence: “I felt everything I did was an effort.” That “can mean a lot of things, and it’s not necessarily tied to depression,” Adams says. The same goes for items such as, “People dislike me.” A person of color faced with racism and marginalization might agree with that, regardless of depression, she says.</p>



<p>Our ways to measure depression capture only a tiny slice of the big picture. The same can be said about our understanding of what’s happening in the brain.</p>



<h4>The flawed serotonin hypothesis</h4>



<p>Serotonin came into the spotlight in part because of the serendipitous discovery of drugs that affected serotonin receptors, called selective serotonin re­uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. After getting its start in the late 1960s, the “serotonin hypothesis” flourished in the late ’90s, as advertisers ran commercials that told viewers that SSRIs fixed the serotonin deficit that can accompany depression. These messages changed the way people talked and thought about depression. Having a simple biological explanation helped some people and their doctors, in part by easing the shame some people felt for not being able to snap out of it on their own. It gave doctors ways to talk with people about the mood disorder.</p>



<p>But it was a simplified picture. A recent review of evidence, published in July in <em>Molecular Psychiatry</em>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finds no</a> consistent data supporting the idea that low serotonin causes depression. Some headlines declared that the study was a grand takedown of the serotonin hypothesis. To depression researchers, the findings weren’t a surprise. Many had already realized this simple description wasn’t helpful.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of data suggesting that serotonin, and other chemical messengers such as dopamine and norepinephrine, are somehow involved in depression, including a study by neuropharmacologist Gitte Moos Knudsen of the University of Copenhagen. She and colleagues recently found that 17 people who were in the midst of a depressive episode released, on average, <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(22)01704-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less serotonin</a> in certain brain areas than 20&nbsp;people who weren’t depressed. The study is small, but it’s one of the first to look at serotonin release in living human brains of people with depression.</p>



<p>But Knudsen cautions that those results, published in October in <em>Biological Psychiatry</em>, don’t mean that depression is fully caused by low serotonin levels. “It’s easy to defer to simple explanations,” she says.</p>



<p>SSRIs essentially form a molecular blockade, stopping serotonin from being reabsorbed into nerve cells and keeping the levels high between the cells. Those high levels are thought to influence nerve cell activity in ways that help people feel better.</p>



<p>Because the drugs can ease symptoms in about half of people with depression, it seemed to make sense that depression was caused by problems with serotonin. But just because a treatment works by doing something doesn’t mean the disease works in the opposite way. That’s <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mood-swings/202210/has-the-serotonin-hypothesis-been-debunked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backward logic</a>, psychiatrist Nassir Ghaemi of Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston wrote in October in a <em>Psychology Today</em> essay. Aspirin can ease a headache, but a headache isn’t caused by low aspirin.</p>



<p>“We think we have a much more nuanced picture of what depression is today,” Knudsen says. The trouble is figuring out the many details. “We need to be honest with patients, to say that we don’t know everything about this,” she says.</p>



<p>The brain contains seven distinct classes of receptors that sense serotonin. That’s not even accounting for sensors for other messengers such as dopamine and norepinephrine. And these receptors sit on a wide variety of nerve cells, some that send signals when they sense serotonin, some that dampen signals. And serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine are just a few of dozens of chemicals that carry information throughout a multitude of interconnected brain circuits. This complexity is so great that it renders the phrase “chemical imbalance” meaningless.</p>



<p>Overly simple claims — low serotonin causes depression, or low serotonin isn’t involved — serve only to keep us stymied, Aftab says. “[It] just keeps up that unhelpful binary.”</p>

<h3>How treatment helps depression patients</h3>



<p>A large study called STAR*D enrolled more than 4,000 people with depression across the United States and offered a window into how well treatment works. In the study, volunteers who didn’t respond to one treatment were switched to a second and so on.

<h4>Depression research can’t ignore the world</h4>



<p>In the 1990s, Aftab says, depression researchers got intensely focused on the brain. “They were trying to find the broken part of the brain that causes depression.” That limited view “really hurt depression research,” Aftab says. In the last 10&nbsp;years or so, “there’s a general recognition that that sort of mind-set is not going to give us the answers.”</p>



<p>Reducing depression to specific problems of biology in the brain didn’t work, Cristea says. “If you were a doctor 10 years ago, the dream was that the neuroscience would give us the markers. We would look at the markers and say, ‘OK. You [get] this drug. You, this kind of therapy.’ But it hasn’t happened.” Part of that, she says, is because depression is an “existentially complicated disorder” that’s tough to simplify, quantify and study in a lab.</p>



<p>Our friendships, our loves, our setbacks and our stress can all influence our health. Take a recent study of first-year doctors in the United States. The more these doctors worked, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2210365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the higher the rate of depression</a>, scientists reported in October in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Similar trends exist <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8866969/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for caregivers of people with dementia</a> and health care workers who kept emergency departments open during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their high-stress experiences may have prompted depression in some way.</p>



<p>“Depression is linked to the state of the world — and there is no denying it,” Aftab says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>What depression scales don’t ask</h3>



<p>In a concept mapping study, <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11137-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">descriptions of depression symptoms</a> provided by Black men and key individuals supporting Black men’s health, including Black women and doctors, were clustered into six categories: physical states, emotional states, diminished drive, communication with others, internal conflict and social pressures. Communication with others and internal conflict were each asked about in only one of three commonly used depression assessments studied. Social pressures weren’t reflected in any of the three assessments.</p>



<h5>Reflected in three assessments</h5>



<p><strong>Physical states:</strong> Descriptions in this category included high blood pressure, self-harm or suicidal behavior, binge eating, insomnia, heart palpitations and weight loss and/or gain.</p>



<p><strong>Emotional states:</strong> Descriptions in this category included not being able to “get up and go,” a lack of motivation, anger, fatigue, hopelessness, frustration, worry, bursts of crying, low self-esteem, feeling stuck and feeling out of control.</p>



<p><strong>Diminished drive:</strong> This category included descriptions of an untidy appearance, the inability to complete tasks and life goals, not being able to provide for family and excessive substance use, such as marijuana, cigarettes and alcohol.</p>



<h5>Reflected in one assessment</h5>



<p><strong>Communication with others:</strong> Descriptions in this category included not being able to communicate properly, including ignoring emails and phone calls, isolation from others, withdrawal from everyday activities, volatile behavior toward others, blunted emotional expression and difficulty maintaining romantic relationships.</p>



<p><strong>Internal conflict:</strong> This category included having a pessimistic outlook, feeling guilty, feeling unqualified, feeling attacked or defensive, feeling helpless in the face of aging, and a heightened sense of fear or dread.</p>



<h5>Not reflected in the assessments</h5>



<p><strong>Social pressures:</strong> Descriptions in this category included not being able to keep up appearances, fear of unknown consequences of today’s political environment, adherence to cultural norms of success and power, a lack of work/life balance, seeking happiness through accumulated materials and increased attendance at religious institutions.</p>
</div>



<p>Today’s research on depression ought to be more pluralistic, Adams says. “There are so many factors at play that we can’t just rest on one solution,” she says. Research from neuroscience and genetics has helped identify brain circuits, chemical messengers, cell types, molecules and genes that all may be involved in the disorder. But researchers aren’t satisfied with that. “There is other evidence that remains unexplored,” Adams says. “With our neuro­science advances, there should be similar advances in public health and psychiatric work.”</p>



<p>That’s happening. For her part, Adams and colleagues have just begun a study looking at moment-to-moment stressors in the lives of Black adolescents, ages 12 to 18, as measured by cell phone questionnaires. Responses, she hopes, will yield clues about depression and risk of suicide.</p>



<p>Other researchers are trying to fit together all of these different ways of seeing the problem. Fried, for example, is developing new concepts of depression that acknowledge the interacting systems. You tug on one aspect of it — using an antidepressant for instance, or changing sleep patterns — and see how the rest of the system reacts.</p>



<p>Approaches like these recognize the complexity of the problem and aim to figure out ways to handle it. We will never have a simple explanation for depression; we are now learning that one cannot possibly exist. That may sound like cold comfort to people in depression’s grip. But seeing the challenge with clear eyes may be the thing that moves us forward.</p>

<h2>What you think you know about depression is probably wrong</h2>



<p>We’ve all heard that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, but science shows that the truth is much more complex.</p>


<div id="rank-math-faq" class="rank-math-block">
<div class="rank-math-list ">
<div id="faq-question-1675876026737" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>What is the serotonin hypothesis of depression?</strong></h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>The serotonin hypothesis says that depression is caused by not enough of a chemical messenger called serotonin in the brain. A related idea is that brain chemicals are out of balance.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1675876053842" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>Why did it become popular?</strong></h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Drugs called SSRIs were advertised as ways to treat depression by fixing the serotonin deficit. These drugs ease symptoms for roughly half of people with depression.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1675876067534" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>Why is the serotonin hypothesis of depression wrong?</strong></h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>It is too simple a picture. There are no clear descriptions of depression, and no obvious signs of it in the brain or blood. All sorts of factors influence depression, ranging from a myriad of minuscule molecules in the brain to events in a person’s life.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1675876079921" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>What factors need to be considered when studying depression?</strong></h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Symptoms of depression vary widely from person to person, and common depression scales can miss important symptoms. Signs of depression also vary among different groups of people, and can be influenced by race, gender and culture. What’s more, our friendships, our loves, our setbacks and our stress can all influence our mental health.</p>

<p>The U.S. Office of Research Integrity, the agency that oversees research misconduct investigations for work funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a new permanent director after a year and a half without one.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://researchintegrity.gwu.edu/about">Sheila Garrity</a>, currently associate vice president for research integrity and research integrity officer at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., will start as ORI’s next permanent director the week of March 26, according to an internal memo from Rachel Levine, the Biden Administration’s Assistant Secretary for Health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garrity previously was director of the division of research integrity at Johns Hopkins University, where she worked for more than 20 years. She also was a founding member and the first president of the Association for Research Integrity Officers (ARIO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Levine’s memo described Garrity as “a leader in the fields of research integrity and the responsible conduct of research education,” and asked staff to “join me in welcoming Sheila to the OASH family and in thanking Wanda Jones for the incredible job she has done in running ORI while we conducted our candidate search.”</p>



<span id="more-126531"></span>



<p>The ORI has often been without a permanent director in its 30-plus year history, and <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/meet-directors">Jones</a>, deputy director and associate director of research and scientific integrity for the agency, has served multiple stints as its acting director in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s last permanent director, Elisabeth (Lis) Handley, filled the role <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/11/us-government-watchdog-gets-new-director/">from 2019</a> until <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/07/us-federal-watchdog-loses-director-to-another-government-role/">June 2021</a>, when she became principal deputy assistant secretary for health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Handley’s tenure, ORI had been without a permanent director since 2017, when Kathy Partin <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/20/director-u-s-hhs-office-research-integrity-temporarily-removed-post/">left the role</a> she had filled since 2015. Partin <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/01/former-director-of-u-s-research-watchdog-agency-moves-to-nih/">now serves</a> as the NIH’s intramural research integrity officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s heartening to see ORI move in the direction of a permanent director,” said <a href="https://csl.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/gunsalus">C.K. Gunsalus</a>, director of the National Center for Principled Leadership &amp; Research Ethics (NCPRE) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and a longtime member of the research integrity community. (Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit, The Center for Scientific Integrity, has partnered with NCPRE, and our cofounders have co-authored <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2675025">an editorial in <em>JAMA</em></a> with Gunsalus.) She told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It’s been so long since there was one that the agency seems to have lost its momentum and lost its way. I wish her all the best and hope with all her connections and experience she can revitalize an office that has an important role to play. The office needs revitalization in terms of refocusing its mission and restaffing and rebuilding its relationships of trust in the community.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last year, ORI <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/24/us-federal-research-watchdog-wants-your-input/">asked for input</a> on potential revisions to its regulations. Two major organizations, one of them the ARIO which Garrity helped to found, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/report-on-research-compliance-volume-19-2745472/">submitted a letter</a> that recommended, among other things, that ORI refine “the scope of inquiries/investigations and the circumstances under which an inquiry or investigation may be closed,” which the organizations said had become “overly broad.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoos-tool-kit-national-park">Cockatoos can tell when they need more than one tool to swipe a snack</a></h4>

              
                <p>Forget screwdrivers or drills. A stick and a straw make for a great cockatoo tool kit.</p>



<p>Some Goffin’s cockatoos (<em>Cacatua goffiniana</em>)<a href="#_msocom_2"> </a><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00057-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know whether they need to have more than one tool in claw</a> to topple&nbsp;an out-of-reach cashew, researchers report February 10 in <em>Current Biology</em>. By recognizing that two items are necessary to access the snack, the birds join chimpanzees as the only nonhuman animals known to use tools as a set.</p>



<p>The study is a fascinating example of what cockatoos are capable of, says Anne Clark, a behavioral ecologist at Binghamton University in New York, who was not involved in the study. A mental awareness that people often attribute to our close primate relatives can also pop up elsewhere in the animal kingdom.</p>





<p>A variety of animals including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/hawaiian-crows-ace-tool-user-test">crows</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/sea-otters-use-rocks-tools-arent-related">otters</a> use tools but don’t deploy multiple objects together as a kit (<em>SN: 9/14/16</em>; <em>SN: 3/21/17</em>). Chimpanzees from the Republic of Congo’s Noubalé-Ndoki National Park, on the other hand, recognize the need for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chimps-show-skill-termite-fishing">both a sharp stick to break into termite mounds and a fishing stick</a> to scoop up an insect feast (<em>SN: 10/19/04</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers knew wild cockatoos could use <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01111-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three different sticks to break open fruit</a> in their native range of Indonesia. But it was unclear whether the birds might recognize the sticks as a set or instead as a chain of single tools that became necessary as new problems arose, says evolutionary biologist Antonio Osuna Mascaró of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna.</p>



<p>Osuna Mascaró and colleagues first tested whether the cockatoos could learn to smack loose a cashew placed inside a clear box and behind a thin paper barrier, akin to a chimpanzee’s hunt for termites. Six out of 10 cockatoos reliably knocked the nut out of the box using a pointy stick to poke through the membrane and a plastic straw to fish for the cashew.</p>



<p>Two birds managed the task in less than 35 seconds on their first try. Both — a male named Figaro and a female named Fini — are experienced tool users, Osuna Mascaró says. </p>



<p>Figaro, Fini and three&nbsp;fellow cockatoos were more likely to use both stick and straw only when the box had a paper barrier inside. If the team removed the barrier, the birds selected the straw instead of the stick as their tool. </p>



<p>Even when the birds had to walk or fly to reach the box, the birds brought along both tools every time the box had a barrier. If there was no paper, the cockatoos usually brought only one,&nbsp;a sign the cockatoos recognized when they needed their entire tool kit to swipe a snack.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch how Figaro the cockatoo uses a tool kit to nab a nut | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rbZKpwdCRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some captive Goffin’s cockatoos, including this one named Figaro, learned to use a sharp stick to poke through a thin piece of paper, allowing them to then insert a longer straw to knock free a cashew. Here, Figaro grabs both tools needed before flying up to the box — a sign that he recognized both tools as part of a set needed to complete the job. Chimpanzees, which use a pair of sticks to fish for termites, are the only other nonhuman animal known to use tools as a set.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Three of the birds even learned to put the stick inside the straw to carry both at the same time. That made for more efficient transport, meaning the birds didn’t have to make two trips and waste energy. Two birds, Kiwi and Pippin, transported both tools together every time the box had a barrier. Kiwi rarely brought along both tools if there wasn’t paper, and Pippin did so half as often.</p>





<p>Trading off which tools to bring may have to do with strength. After Figaro learned to combine transport, he grabbed both tools in 16 out of 18 trials. That may be because he’s one of the stronger birds in the group, Osuna Mascaró says. For him, grabbing both tools at once isn’t a big deal. Kiwi and Pippin, on the other hand, are weaker than Figaro.</p>



<p>Cockatoos raised in the lab probably display more abilities than a wild bird might use on an average day, Clark says. “Nevertheless, this means they can do it,” she says. “That doesn’t mean that the wild adult male … can do the same thing as Figaro. But he would have probably been capable of doing that had he been raised like Figaro.&#8221;</p>

We have a huge amount of data, particularly health data, and therefore, AI and its related themes are still trending. Collecting, saving, processing, managing, analyzing, and exploiting health data ensuring security, privacy, interoperability, etc. are interesting research topics in the digital health field. Although these topics have been researched for long time and they have significantly advanced, there are still many research gaps. Some examples could be developing AI models more understandable for non-experts (real users), incorporating real-time data collected in real-life scenarios, developing technological tools supporting in the personalization of treatments/therapies, etc. Regarding participatory health, there is currently a growing interest in patient experience, health equity, and privacy when technology is applied to the health domain. Finally, new technologies such as those used in Meta-verse enable innovative health interventions, especially in psychotherapy and patient education, that currently are demonstrating to have promising benefits. Digital twins, avatars, virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, etc. have been used in health research, especially in rehabilitation and education.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-microraptor-hawk-fossil-foot">This dinosaur might have used its feet to snag prey in midair like modern hawks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modern birds evolved from dinosaurs, but it’s not clear <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-birds-could-achieve-liftoff">how well birds’ ancient dino ancestors could fly</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/16</em>). Now, a look at the fossilized feet of one nonavian dinosaur suggests that it may have hunted on the wing, like some hawks today.</p>



<p>The crow-sized <em>Microraptor</em> had toe pads <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35039-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very similar to those of modern raptors</a> that can hunt in the air, researchers report December 20 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. That means the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microraptor-dinosaur-fossil-molting-feathers-songbirds">feathered, four-winged dinosaur</a> probably used its feet to catch flying prey too, paleobiologist Michael Pittman of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and colleagues say (<em>SN: 7/16/20</em>).</p>





<p>Other researchers caution that toe pads alone aren’t enough to declare <em>Microraptor</em> an aerial hunter. But if the claim holds up, such a hunting style would reinforce <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221004310#bib1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a debated hypothesis</a> that powered flight evolved <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220309994#fig4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple times</a> among dinosaurs, a feat once attributed solely to birds.</p>



<p>Toe pads are bundles of scale-covered flesh on the undersides of dinosaur feet, similar to “toe beans” on dogs and cats. Because the pads are points where the living animal interacted with surfaces, toe pads give paleontologists a “sense of where the rubber meets the road,” says Alexander Dececchi, a paleontologist at Mount Marty University in Yankton, S.D., who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>These contact points can paint a clearer picture of an animal’s behavior by providing “details that the skeleton itself wouldn’t show,” says Thomas Holtz Jr., a dinosaur paleobiologist at the University of Maryland in College Park, who was also not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To investigate dinosaur toe pads, Pittman and colleagues turned to the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature in Linyi, China. It “has arguably the largest collection of feathered dinosaurs in the world, and, importantly, they haven’t been prepared extensively,” Pittman says. Many of these dinosaur skeletons are still surrounded by rock, which is where soft tissues can be preserved. Such a specimen “gives us the best chance of finding this wonderful soft tissue information,” he says.</p>

The toes are also covered in a layer of fluorescing scales along the top and sides of the foot.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121568">M. Pittman <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Communications</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Using special lasers that cause the otherwise <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/under-lasers-feathered-dino-shows-some-skin">nearly invisible soft tissue in the fossils to fluoresce</a>, the team found 12 specimens with exceptionally well-preserved toe pads among the thousands examined (<em>SN: 3/20/17</em>).</p>



<p>The team compared the fossil toe pads with those of 36 types of modern birds, whose toe pads vary with their lifestyle. Predatory birds, for example, have protruding toe pads with spiky scales for grasping prey, while ground birds that spend their time walking and running have flatter toe pads. The analysis showed that <em>Microraptor</em>’s toe pads and other aspects of the feet, like the shape of the toe joints and claws, are most like those of modern hawks. That similarity suggests that the dinosaur could hunt prey midair and on the ground like hawks do, the team says.</p>



<p>Other dinosaurs, like the feathered <em>Anchiornis,</em> had flatter toe pads and straighter claws, suggesting a terrestrial lifestyle. That&#8217;s in line with ideas about this dinosaur being a poor flier, Pittman says. </p>

Pittman <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Communications</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The idea that <em>Microraptor</em> hunted like a hawk is consistent with other fossil evidence. One <em>Microraptor </em>fossil has been found with a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1117727108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bird in its stomach</a>, and <em>Microraptor</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/2159/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skeletal</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2205476119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soft tissue</a> anatomy suggest some powered flight capability.</p>



<p>There’s still more work to do to figure out how well the dinosaur may have flown. “<em>Microraptor</em> is not a bird, but a close relative. Just because it has feet like a predatory bird doesn’t necessarily mean it must be catching prey in the exact same way,” Pittman says. But <em>Microraptor</em>’s hawklike lifestyle “is a strong possibility,” he adds.</p>





<p>Flight could have been useful to <em>Microraptor</em> when hunting, even if it couldn’t stack up to today&#8217;s fliers. Dececchi speculates that <em>Microraptor</em>’s <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2205476119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anatomy</a> probably prevented it from outflying birds, but may have helped it surprise otherwise out-of-reach prey, including flying and gliding animals.</p>



<p>“You only have to be fast or aerobatic enough to catch other things in your environment,” Holtz says. “So, it’s not improbable that [<em>Microraptor</em> was] catching things in the air on occasion.”</p>



<p>Other paleontologists are more skeptical that <em>Microraptor</em> hunted on the wing. “It would be a bit of a stretch to me to suggest that <em>Microraptor</em> was pursuing prey in an aerial context,” says Albert Chen, a paleobiologist at the University of Cambridge. The new findings inform only “what the foot was used for.”</p>



<p>Alternative hypotheses, such as a completely or partially terrestrial hunting style, could fit the data too, Holtz says, but the “feet are definitely playing a major role in their prey capture,” whether on the ground or in the air.</p>



<p>For now, the picture of <em>Microraptor</em>’s ecology remains fuzzy, but as lasers continue to increase the picture&#8217;s resolution, our understanding of dinosaur flight may reach new heights.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hominids-stone-tools-kenya-butcher-animals-earlier">Hominids used stone tool kits to butcher animals earlier than once thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly 3 million years ago, hominids employed stone tool kits to butcher hippos and pound plants along what’s now the shores of Kenya’s Lake Victoria, researchers say.</p>



<p>Evidence of those food preparation activities pushes back hominids’ use of these tool kits, known as Oldowan implements, by roughly 300,000 years, say paleoanthropologist Thomas Plummer of Queen’s College, City University of New York and colleagues. That makes these finds possibly the oldest known stone tools.</p>



<p>Several dating techniques place discoveries at the Kenyan site, known as Nyayanga, at between around 2.6 million and 3 million years old. Based on where artifacts lay in dated sediment layers, these finds are probably close to about 2.9 million years old, the scientists report in the Feb. 10 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Until now, the oldest Oldowan tools <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-genus-earliest-stone-tool-artifacts-ethiopia-contested">dated to roughly 2.6 million years ago</a> at an Ethiopian site more than 1,200 kilometers north of Nyayanga (<em>SN: 6/3/19)</em>. Excavations at another site in Kenya, called Lomekwi 3, have yielded <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-stone-tools-unearthed-kenya">large, irregularly shaped rocks&nbsp;dating to about 3.3 million years ago</a> (<em>SN: 5/20/15</em>). But claims that these finds, which include some sharp edges, represent the oldest known stone tools are controversial.</p>



<p>Similarities of the Nyayanga artifacts to those found at sites dating to as late as around 1.7 million years ago “reinforce the long trajectory of Oldowan technology in the early stages of human evolution,” says archaeologist Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo of Rice University in Houston and the University of Alcalá in Madrid. He did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Skeletal remains of at least three hippos unearthed near a total of 56 stone artifacts at Nyayanga display butchery marks, the investigators say. Wear patterns on another 30 stone tools from Nyayanga indicate that these items were used to cut, scrape and pound animal tissue and a variety of plants. And antelope fossils found at Nyayanga display damage from hominids removing meat with sharp stones and crushing bones with large stones to remove marrow.</p>

Plummer/Homa Peninsula Paleoanthropology Project</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>These discoveries are among 330 Oldowan artifacts and 1,776 animal bones unearthed at Nyayanga from 2015 through 2017. Oldowan finds included three parts of an ancient tool kit — rounded hammerstones, angular or oval cores and sharp-edged flakes. Toolmakers struck a core held in one hand with a hammerstone held in the other hand, splitting off flakes that could be used to cut or scrape.</p>



<p>Whoever wielded stone tools at the Kenya site close to 3 million years ago “had access to a well-balanced diet for hunter-gatherers,” says coauthor Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.</p>





<p>The evolutionary identity of ancient Nyayanga toolmakers remains a mystery. Plummer’s group unearthed two large, peg-shaped molars belonging to <em>Paranthropus</em>, a big-jawed, small-brained hominid line that inhabited eastern and southern parts of Africa until around 1 million years ago. The Nyayanga teeth are the oldest known <em>Paranthropus</em> fossils.</p>



<p>But there is no way to confirm that <em>Paranthropus</em> made and used the newly recovered stone tools. Individuals who died at Nyayanga and left behind their fossilized teeth were not necessarily part of groups that periodically butchered hippos there, Domínguez-Rodrigo says.</p>



<p>Members of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-jaw-may-hold-clues-origins-human-genus">the <em>Homo</em> genus appeared in East Africa as early as around 2.8 million years ago</a> and could have made Oldowan tools at Nyayanga, says archaeologist Sileshi Semaw of the National Research Center for Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain (<em>SN: 3/4/15)</em>. But <em>Paranthropus</em> can’t be discounted as a toolmaker. A large male <em>Paranthropus</em> skull discovered in 1959, dubbed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-hominid-species-nutcracker-man-stone-tools">Nutcracker Man</a>, lay near Oldowan artifacts dated to 1.89 million years ago, says Semaw, who was not part of Plummer’s group (<em>SN: 3/3/20</em>).</p>



<p>Previous discoveries indicated that Oldowan toolmakers eventually occupied much of Africa, Asia and Europe, either via the spread of toolmaking groups or through independent inventions.</p>



<p>Discoveries at Nyayanga fit a current consensus that stone-tool making must have begun shortly after hominids evolved substantially smaller canine teeth around 5 million years ago, says archaeologist John Shea of Stony Brook University in New York, who was not involved in the new study. Stone tools did the work formerly performed by big canines, including slicing prey carcasses, mashing edible plants and helping individuals communicate anger or dominance over others, Shea suspects.</p>



<p>If that tool-crafting timeline is correct, then even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lucys-kind-used-stone-tools-butcher-animals"><em>Australopithecus afarensis</em>, known for Lucy’s famous partial skeleton, might have made and used stone tools</a> by around 3.4 million years ago (<em>SN: 8/11/10</em>).</p>



<p>Any way you slice it, Oldowan finds at Nyayanga now provide the earliest hard evidence of stone tools.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/historys-deadliest-mass-extinction-ocean-life">In the wake of history’s deadliest mass extinction, ocean life may have flourished</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following the most severe known mass extinction in Earth’s history, vibrant marine ecosystems may have <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf1622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recovered within just a million years</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 10 <em>Science</em>. That’s millions of years faster than previously thought. The evidence, which lies in a diverse trove of pristine fossils discovered near the city of Guiyang in South China, may represent the early foundations of today’s ocean-dwelling ecosystems.</p>



<p>The conventional story was that the ocean was kind of dead for millions of years after this mass extinction, says paleontologist Peter Roopnarine of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, who was not involved in the research. “Well, that’s not true. The ocean [was] very much alive.”</p>





<p>The Great Dying, or Permian-Triassic mass extinction, occurred around 251.9 million years ago, at the end of the Permian Period, after a series of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying">massive volcanic eruptions</a> (<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>).</p>



<p>“The oceans warmed significantly, and there&#8217;s evidence for acidification, deoxygenation [causing widespread dead zones], as well as poisoning,” says Roopnarine. “There [were] a lot of toxic elements like sulfur entering into parts of the ocean.”</p>



<p>Life in the seas suffered. More than 80 percent of marine species went extinct. Some researchers have even proposed that entire trophic levels — castes in an ecosystem’s food web — <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have vanished</a>.</p>



<p>Figuring out how long life took to fully recover in the wake of all that loss has been challenging. In 2010, researchers studying fossils from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luoping biota</a> in China proposed that complex marine ecosystems fully rebounded within 10 million years. Later, other fossil finds, such as the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paris biota</a> in the western United States and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chaohu biota</a> in China, led scientists to suggest that marine ecosystems reestablished themselves within just 3 million years.</p>



<p>Then in 2015, a serendipitous discovery narrowed the gap again. Paleontologist Xu Dai, then an undergraduate student at the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan, was studying rocks from the early Triassic during a field trip near the city of Guiyang, when he split open a piece of black shale. Within the rock, he discovered a surprisingly well-preserved fossil of what would later be identified as a primitive lobster.</p>



<p>The arthropod’s immaculate condition sparked a series of return trips. From 2015 to 2019, Dai, now at the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France, and his colleagues uncovered a bricolage of fossilized life: Predatory fish as long as baseball bats. Ammonoids in swirled shells. Eel-like conodonts. Early shrimps. Sponges. Bivalves. Fossilized poo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="199" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020923_NO_permian_inline.jpg" alt="Aphoto of a fossilized coelacanths, a type of bony fish." class="wp-image-3121766" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020923_NO_permian_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020923_NO_permian_inline-330x97.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3121766">Fossilized coelacanths (one shown here), a type of bony fish, are the largest macrofossils yet found in the Guiyang biota.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121766">Dai <em>et al</em>/<em>Science</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And the prizes kept coming. Both under and within the Guiyang biota, Dai and his colleagues discovered beds of volcanic ash. An analysis of the amounts of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">uranium and lead</a> in the ash revealed that the Guiyang biota contained fossils from roughly 250.7 to 250.8 million years ago (<em>SN: 5/2/22</em>). The dating was further supported by the types of fossils found and by an analysis of the different forms of carbon in the rocks.</p>



<p>Finding a potpourri of life of this age suggests that marine ecosystems rebounded quickly after the Great Dying, within just 1 million years or so, Dai says.</p>





<p>Alternatively, it may indicate that the extinction event failed to wipe out entire trophic levels, says paleontologist William Foster from the University of Hamburg in Germany, who was not involved in the study. “You have this really environmentally stressful world, but some former marine ecosystems survive.”</p>



<p>Regardless, it seems clear that these ecosystems were hardy. Due to the motion of tectonic plates, the community preserved in the Guiyang biota was located in the tropics during the early Triassic. At that time, the temperature of the sea surface was nearly 35⁰ Celsius, and past research had suggested many organisms may have migrated away to escape the heat. But, the discovery of the Guiyang biota challenges that, Foster says. Sea creatures “are tolerating it somehow, they&#8217;re adapting.”</p>



<p>According to Dai, the fossils may be evidence that the roots of today’s marine ecosystems took hold shortly after the Great Dying. “These groups are related to modern fish, lobsters and shrimps, their ancestors,” he says. “The oldest time we can find similar seafood to today is [in the time of] the Guiyang biota.”</p>



<p>But Roopnarine is skeptical. It remains to be seen exactly how the Guiyang biota connects to today’s ecosystems, he says. The fossil assemblage could represent an ephemeral collective of life rather than a stable community, he adds, pointing out that ammonoids and conodonts went extinct.</p>



<p>Further work will help resolve the many questions unearthed with the Guiyang biota, Dai says. He and his colleagues plan to head back into the field this summer for the first time since 2019. When asked if he’ll be keeping his eyes peeled for another lobster, he responds: “Of course.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orca-mom-sons-favoritism-killer-whale">Orca moms baby their adult sons. That favoritism pays off — eventually</a></h4>

              
                <p>Among some killer whale moms, lifelong feeding for adult sons but not daughters could be a long-term investment play. The delayed payoff? Greater grandmotherly glory.</p>



<p>Females in a quirky population of killer whales off the Pacific Coast of North America let their grown mama’s boys share fish that mom catches. Biologists have known that this pampering continues throughout a son’s life, which can last decades. Grown daughters, often feeding their own offspring, however, don’t get such a bonus.</p>





<p>Scrutinizing decades of data has now revealed <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01994-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what moms sacrifice</a> to lavish a lifetime of food on a son, researchers report February 8 in <em>Current Biology</em>. A mother’s yearly chance of successfully weaning a calf drops by about half after she has a son, says behavioral ecologist Michael Weiss of the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor, Wash.</p>



<p>For the moms, “it&#8217;s a huge, huge cost that they&#8217;re taking on,” Weiss says. It “emphasizes kind of the uniqueness and the intensity of this mother-son bond in killer whales.” For creatures that bear their young in a series, he says, this finding is “our first kind of direct evidence of any animal showing lifetime parental investment.”</p>



<p>These killer whales off the coast of Washington State and British Columbia, in “the southern resident” population of <em>Orcinus orca</em>, don’t migrate. Instead they specialize in feeding year-round on the region’s fish, such as big chinook salmon.</p>



<p>When moms catch a fish, “they do this huge head jerk, and one half of the fish stays in the mouth and the other half kind of trails behind them as they swim on,” Weiss says. A son swimming with her can then grab that other half. “It’s not the son coming up and grabbing the fish out of her mouth,” he says.</p>



<p>The son’s company looks consensual to Weiss. Mothers and sons “spend a lot of time kind of floating at the surface together … just kind of enjoying each other&#8217;s company.” Whale watchers need to take care reading interpretations into behavior, he says, but his “intuition from watching them is more about the mom wanting to provide for the son.”</p>



<p>Weiss doesn’t think the decline in new births after producing a son comes from any lack of opportunity to mate. “These whales are really social,” he says. “They&#8217;re usually in quite large groups, and usually with at least one sexually mature male around.” When watching them from drones, “we see that social behavior in these whales often involves a lot of sexual behavior,” he says. Nevertheless, all those halved fishes may not give a mom enough nutrition for the demands of whale pregnancy.</p>



<p>Mom’s grandchild tally however can make up for her own limited reproduction as she coddles her sons, the whale records show. Sons don’t have to parent. They just deliver sperm to the right address. &nbsp;Plus, the longer males live, the better, Weiss says. For a few years, genetics suggested that the two oldest males in the southern resident population were siring more than half the new calves. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Female killer whales, however, face more constraints. Killer whale pregnancies last some 18 months. So a Casanova whale’s sister gets preoccupied for a long time producing just one wrinkly not-so-little darling and then nurturing it to independence.</p>



<p>Female killer whales do have a chance to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-whales-follow-postmenopausal-leaders">help later generations survive</a>, because the species is &nbsp;among the few nonhuman mammals that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-whales-grandmas-and-what-men-want-evolutionary-biologists-consider-menopause">experience menopause</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/15; SN: 8/19/13</em>). (Females can stop reproducing in their 30s or 40s, but can live into their 80s).</p>



<p>Whether moms in other killer whale populations also routinely and consequentially serve dinner for grown sons isn’t an easy question to answer. Weiss wonders whether the same male whales in another place, perhaps with more abundant fish, would still reduce their mothers&#8217;&nbsp; success at later births.</p>



<p>No other killer whale population’s records can match the depth of the ones Weiss used, says cetacean biologist Eve Jourdain of the University of Oslo. Her research focuses on killer whales around Norway that follow the seasonal movements of herring and other food bonanzas.</p>



<p>Jourdain doesn’t recall moms flinging fish, but she watches the whales herding local herring into big fish balls of swimming dinner. Which they share. So there may be other kinds of food-based bonding yet to be analyzed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fingerprints-form-mystery">How fingerprints form was a mystery — until now</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have finally figured out how those arches, loops and whorls formed on your fingertips.</p>



<p>While in the womb, fingerprint-defining ridges expand outward in waves starting from three different points on each fingertip. The raised skin arises in a striped pattern thanks <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.01.015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to interactions between three molecules</a> that follow what’s known as a Turing pattern, researchers report February 9 in <em>Cell</em>. How those ridges spread from their starting sites — and merge — determines the overarching fingerprint shape.</p>





<p>Fingerprints are unique and last for a lifetime. They’ve been used to identify individuals since the 1800s. Several theories have been put forth to explain how fingerprints form, including spontaneous skin folding, molecular signaling and the idea that ridge pattern may follow blood vessel arrangements.</p>



<p>Scientists knew that the ridges that characterize fingerprints begin to form as downward growths into the skin, like trenches. Over the few weeks that follow, the quickly multiplying cells in the trenches start growing upward, resulting in thickened bands of skin.</p>



<p>Since budding fingerprint ridges and developing hair follicles have similar downward structures, researchers in the new study compared cells from the two locations. The team found that both sites share some types of signaling molecules — messengers that transfer information between cells — including three known as WNT, EDAR and BMP. Further experiments revealed that WNT tells cells to multiply, forming ridges in the skin, and to produce EDAR, which in turn further boosts WNT activity. BMP thwarts these actions.</p>



<p>To examine how these signaling molecules might interact to form patterns, the team adjusted the molecules’ levels in mice. Mice don’t have fingerprints, but their toes have striped ridges in the skin comparable to human prints. “We turn a dial — or molecule — up and down, and we see the way the pattern changes,” says developmental biologist Denis Headon of the University of Edinburgh.</p>



<p>Increasing EDAR resulted in thicker, more spaced-out ridges, while decreasing it led to spots rather than stripes. The opposite occurred with BMP, since it hinders EDAR production.</p>



<p>That switch between stripes and spots is a signature change seen in systems governed by Turing reaction-diffusion, Headon says. This mathematical theory, proposed in the 1950s by British mathematician Alan Turing, describes how chemicals interact and spread to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-patterns-great-and-small">create patterns seen in nature</a> (<em>SN: 7/2/10</em>). Though, when tested, it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pigment-pas-de-deux-puts-stripes-zebrafish">explains only some patterns</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/14</em>).</p>



<p>Mouse digits, however, are too tiny to give rise to the elaborate shapes seen in human fingerprints. So, the researchers used computer models to simulate a Turing pattern spreading from the three previously known ridge initiation sites on the fingertip: the center of the finger pad, under the nail and at the joint’s crease nearest the fingertip.</p>





<p>By altering the relative timing, location and angle of these starting points, the team could create each of the three most common fingerprint patterns — arches, loops and whorls — and even rarer ones. Arches, for instance, can form when finger pad ridges get a slow start, allowing ridges originating from the crease and under the nail to occupy more space.</p>



<p>“It’s a very well-done study,” says developmental and stem cell biologist Sarah Millar, director of the Black Family Stem Cell Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p>



<p>Controlled competition between molecules also determines hair follicle distribution, says Millar, who was not involved in the work. The new study, she says, “shows that the formation of fingerprints follows along some basic themes that have already been worked out for other types of patterns that we see in the skin.”</p>



<p>Millar notes that people with gene mutations that affect WNT and EDAR have skin abnormalities. “The idea that those molecules might be involved in fingerprint formation was floating around,” she says.</p>



<p>Overall, Headon says, the team aims to aid formation of skin structures, like sweat glands, when they’re not developing properly in the womb, and maybe even after birth.</p>



<p>“What we want to do, in broader terms, is understand how the skin matures.”</p>

                <p>The dwarf planet Quaoar has a ring that is too big for its metaphorical fingers. While all other rings in the solar system lie within or near a mathematically determined distance of their parent bodies, Quaoar’s ring is much farther out.</p>

<p>Quaoar is an icy body about half the size of Pluto that’s located in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-discovery-solar-system-planets-space">Kuiper Belt at the solar system’s edge</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/22). </em>At such a great distance from Earth, it’s hard to get a clear picture of the world.</p>



<p>So Morgado and colleagues watched Quaoar block the light from a distant star, a phenomenon called a stellar occultation. The timing of the star winking in and out of view can reveal details about Quaoar, like its size and whether it has an atmosphere.</p>



<p>The researchers took data from occultations from 2018 to 2020, observed from all over the world, including Namibia, Australia and Grenada, as well as space. There was no sign that Quaoar had an atmosphere. But surprisingly, there was a ring. The finding makes Quaoar just the third dwarf planet or asteroid in the solar system known to have a ring, after the asteroid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icy-rings-found-around-tiny-space-rock">Chariklo</a> and the dwarf planet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oddball-dwarf-planet-haumea-has-ring">Haumea</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/14</em>; <em>SN: 10/11/17</em>).</p>



<p>Even more surprisingly, “the ring is not where we expect,” Morgado says.</p>

<h2>Far-out ring</h2>



<p>In this illustration, dwarf planet Haumea and asteroid Chariklo both have rings (white) that are close to their Roche limits (yellow), to the best of astronomers’ understanding. Quaoar, in contrast, has a ring that is clearly well beyond its Roche limit, an imaginary line beyond which rings aren’t thought to be stable.</p>

<p>Known rings around other objects lie within or near what’s called the Roche limit, an invisible line where the gravitational force of the main body peters out. Inside the limit, that force can rip a moon to shreds, turning it into a ring. Outside, the gravity between smaller particles is stronger than that from the main body, and rings will coalesce into one or several moons.</p>



<p>“We always think of [the Roche limit] as straightforward,” Morgado says. “One side is a moon forming, the other side is a ring stable. And now this limit is not a limit.”</p>



<p>For Quaoar’s far-out ring, there are a few possible explanations, Morgado says. Maybe the observers caught the ring at just the right moment, right before it turns into a moon. But that lucky timing seems unlikely, he notes.</p>



<p>Maybe Quaoar’s known moon, Weywot, or some other unseen moon contributes gravity that holds the ring stable somehow. Or maybe the ring’s particles are colliding in such a way that they avoid sticking together and clumping into moons.</p>



<p>The particles would have to be particularly bouncy for that to work, “like a ring of those bouncy balls from toy stores,” says planetary scientist David Jewitt of UCLA, who was not involved in the new work.</p>



<p>The observation is solid, says Jewitt, who helped discover the first objects in the Kuiper Belt in the 1990s. But there’s no way to know yet which of the explanations is correct, if any, in part because there are no theoretical predictions for such far-out rings to compare with Quaoar’s situation.</p>



<p>That’s par for the course when it comes to the Kuiper Belt. “Everything in the Kuiper Belt, basically, has been discovered, not predicted,” Jewitt says. “It’s the opposite of the classical model of science where people predict things and then confirm or reject them. People discover stuff by surprise, and everyone scrambles to explain it.”</p>



<p>More observations of Quaoar, or more discoveries of seemingly misplaced rings elsewhere in the solar system, could help reveal what’s going on.</p>



<p>“I have no doubt that in the near future a lot of people will start working with Quaoar to try to get this answer,” Morgado says.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Manal Helal will talk about a paper &quot;miRe2e: A Full End-to-End Deep Model Based on Transformers for Prediction of Pre-miRNAs&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA sequences with key roles in the regulation of
gene expression at post-transcriptional level in different species. Accurate
prediction of novel miRNAs is needed due to their importance in many biological
processes and their associations with complicated diseases in humans. Many
machine learning approaches were proposed in the last decade for this purpose,
but requiring handcrafted features extraction to identify possible de novo
miRNAs. More recently, the emergence of deep learning (DL) has allowed the
automatic feature extraction, learning relevant representations by themselves.
However, the state-of-art deep models require complex pre-processing of the
input sequences and prediction of their secondary structure to reach an
acceptable performance.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>In this work, we present miRe2e, the first full end-to-end DL model for
pre-miRNA prediction. This model is based on Transformers, a neural
architecture that uses attention mechanisms to infer global dependencies
between inputs and outputs. It is capable of receiving the raw genome-wide data
as input, without any pre-processing nor feature engineering. After a training
stage with known pre-miRNAs, hairpin and non-harpin sequences, it can identify
all the pre-miRNA sequences within a genome. The model has been validated
through several experimental setups using the human genome, and it was compared
with state-of-the-art algorithms obtaining 10 times better performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-algae-phytoplankton-symbiosis-backstab">Some ‘friendly’ bacteria backstab their algal pals. Now we know why</a></h4>

              
                <p>The photosynthesizing plankton <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em> has a dramatic relationship with its bacterial frenemies. These duplicitous bugs help <em>E. huxleyi</em> in exchange for nutrients until it becomes more convenient to murder and eat their hosts. Now, scientists have figured out how these treacherous bacteria decide to turn from friend to foe.</p>



<p>One species of these bacteria appears <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to keep tabs on health-related chemicals</a> produced by <em>E. huxleyi</em>, researchers report January 24 in <em>eLife. </em>The bacteria maintain their friendly facade until their hosts age and weaken, striking as soon as the vulnerable algae can’t afford to keep bribing them with nutrients. The finding could help explain how massive algal blooms come to an end.</p>





<p>The bacteria is “first establishing what we call the ‘first handshake,’” says marine microbiologist Assaf Vardi of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. “Then it will shift into a pathogen.”</p>



<p><em>E. huxleyi</em>’s partnership with these bacteria, which belong to a group called Roseobacter, might be best described as a love-hate relationship. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phytoplanktons-response-climate-change-has-its-ups-and-downs">single-celled alga</a> can’t produce the B vitamins it needs on its own, so it offers up nutrients to lure in Roseobacter that can (<em>SN: 7/8/16</em>). The trade is win-win — at least until the bacteria decide they’d be better off slaying and devouring their algal hosts than sticking around in peaceful coexistence.</p>



<p>Sometimes called the “Jekyll-and-Hyde” trait, this kind of bacterial backstabbery shows up everywhere from animal guts to the open seas. But it wasn’t clear before how Roseobacter decide it’s the right moment to murder <em>E. huxleyi</em>.<br><br>Vardi’s team exposed a type of Roseobacter that lives with <em>E. huxleyi</em> to chemicals taken from algae that were either young and growing or old and stagnant. The team also introduced the bacteria to extra doses of a certain health-signaling algal chemical.Looking at which genes the bacteria activated in the different experiments revealed how and why they switched from friend to foe.</p>



<p>The bacteria kill their algal pals when exposed to high concentrations of a sulfur-containing chemical called DMSP, the researchers found. <em>E. huxleyi </em>leaks more and more DMSP as it ages. This eventually cues its duplicitous microbial partners to go rogue, kill their aging host, and kick their genes for nutrient-grabbing proteins and flagella — whiplike tails used to swim — into overdrive.</p>



<p>It’s an “eat-and-run strategy,” says Noa Barak-Gavish, a microbiologist at ETH Zurich. “You eat up whatever you can and then swim away to avoid competition … [and] to find alternative hosts.”</p>



<p>DMSP isn’t the only figure in this deadly chemical calculus. <em>E. huxleyi</em> can sate its companion’s bloodlust with a bribe of benzoate, a nutrient that Roseobacter can use but most bacteria can’t.</p>



<p>While it’s clearer now what drives the bacteria to kill their hosts, their murder weapon remains a mystery. Vardi says his group has some hunches to follow up on.</p>



<p>This kind of frenemies relationship could be a key factor in controlling the boom and bust of massive algal blooms if other phytoplankton and bacteria have a similar dynamic, says Mary Ann Moran of the University of Georgia in Athens, who was not involved in the study. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forecasting-toxic-algae-blooms">Algal blooms can be toxic</a> (<em>SN: 8/28/18</em>). But they also “fix” enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into biomass and are a major source of organic carbon to the ocean.</p>

<p>“Phytoplankton fix half of all the carbon on the planet, and probably 20 percent to 50 percent of what they fix … actually goes right to bacteria,” she says. So if this kind of relationship controls how carbon flows through the ocean, &#8220;that is something that we would really like to understand.”</p>

<p>Eric Ross was listening to a <a href="https://www.thecarlatreport.com/blogs/2-the-carlat-psychiatry-podcast">popular psychiatry podcast</a> one day last spring when &#8220;some pretty remarkable&#8221; research findings caught his attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A team of researchers in Egypt had shown that adding a cheap diabetes drug—metformin—to antidepressant therapy nearly doubled the treatment&#8217;s efficacy in people with moderate to severe depression. That meant the drug worked better than electric shock therapy,&nbsp; an option <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(03)12705-5.pdf">when antidepressants fail</a>. It was a breakthrough.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought, you know, wow, this is something that I&#8217;m comfortable prescribing that could make a huge difference for my patients,&#8221; said Ross, who at the time was doing his residency in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>



<p>But when he looked up <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-020-00878-7">the study</a>, he discovered several oddities. For instance, the number of patients who experienced an adverse event differed by exactly one for 17 out of 18 single events like fatigue or bloating. That seemed unlikely to have occurred by chance. And all of the scores of statistical tests the authors had done turned out just the way they would have wanted, a dream that rarely comes true in biomedical sciences.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126524"></span>



<p>Perhaps most damningly, many of the numbers in the paper showed a glaring similarity to the numbers in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.13731">a clinical trial</a> of another add-on drug that the authors had published—as if they had been &#8220;rather sloppily copy-pasted&#8221; with a digit changed here and there, Ross later wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That study also had impressive results, suggesting that in just a couple of years, the Egyptian researchers had discovered two treatments—metformin and cilostazol—that outperformed electric shock therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To Ross, there was no doubt the data was fake, although the corresponding author of the papers, Mahmoud S. Abdallah, a lecturer in clinical pharmacy at the University of Sadat City, vehemently denies this.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was fired up,&#8221; Ross, now an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont, told Retraction Watch. &#8220;I was really mad because this is the kind of thing that can immediately affect patient care.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">He decided to share his suspicions with the journals that had published the two studies, <em>Neurotherapeutics</em> and <em>CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Research misconduct is damaging in any field, but I am particularly disturbed by these articles,&#8221; he told them in an email from March 1, 2022, that Retraction Watch has seen. &#8220;Besides its harms to the research community, a fabricated clinical trial with clinically actionable conclusions has the potential to do real and immediate harm to patients.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cilostazol, for instance, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16838/cilostazol-oral/details">may cause</a> heart problems and stomach bleeding; metformin <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11285-7061/metformin-oral/metformin-oral/details">is not free of side effects</a> either. Whether or not the drugs work against depression, they can still cause harm.</p>



<p>A first-time sleuth, Ross also pointed to other studies by Abdallah that struck him as suspicious:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Most unfortunately, the corresponding author appears to be a serial fabulist: he has previously published papers with all the same odd tics (&gt;80% remission rate, multiples of ten evaluated/enrolled, identical numbers of patients discontinuing treatment, no loss to follow-up, and every outcome turning out perfectly) on pentoxifylline for depression (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30205379/) and metformin for rheumatoid arthritis (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33773207/).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In September, <em>Neurotherapeutics</em> pulled the first paper, &#8220;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-020-00878-7">The Antidiabetic Metformin as an Adjunct to Antidepressants in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Proof-of-Concept, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial</a>.&#8221; It has been cited 27 times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s web of Science.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-022-01291-y">retraction note</a> stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The response from the authors to these concerns has shown that there are serious issues with the ethical oversight, the reporting and the availability of audited data for this clinical trial. The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented. All authors disagree with this retraction.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Abdallah denied Ross&#8217; accusations of data fabrication. He added, &#8220;The journal retraction decision is based on speculations without any evidence that we have violated ethical oversight.&#8221;</p>



<p>Abdallah shared his correspondence with the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and Springer Nature, the publisher of <em>Neurotherapeutics</em>, in which he argued at length against the concerns about his research and also threatened legal action &#8220;to protect our reputation.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, no action has been taken on the cilostazol paper—&#8221;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.13731">Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study of the phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor cilostazol as an adjunctive to antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder</a>&#8220;—which has been cited three times.</p>



<p>Ross said he was told in January by Wiley, the publisher of<em> CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics</em>, that it would contact him &#8220;when there is progress.&#8221; In response to a request for comment we sent to the journal&#8217;s editorial office and its <a href="https://www.neurology.pitt.edu/people/xiaoming-hu-md">editor-in-chief</a>, a Wiley spokesperson said:</p>

<p>We are grateful to Dr. Ross for bringing this concern to our attention. We have initiated an investigation into these articles in accordance with COPE guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been almost a year at this point since I originally raised the issue,&#8221; said Ross. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this was one where it took a lot of, you know, complex sleuthing, like doing statistical analysis or anything like that, to be very suspicious about these papers. So I certainly would have hoped it would have been done a lot sooner.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/plos-and-plan-s/">PLOS and Plan S – We’ve got you covered!</a></h4>

              
                <p>As a <a href="https://plos.org/about/">fully Open Access (OA) publisher</a> since our founding, PLOS meets or exceeds all Plan S requirements and recommendations. In fact, we always have! That won&rsquo;t change as cOAlition S <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/coalition-s-confirms-the-end-of-its-financial-support-for-open-access-publishing-under-transformative-arrangements-after-2024/">moves forward with the next phase of Plan S implementation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A quick refresher: What is Plan S again? And what is its current status?</h2>



<p>Plan S requires that any research supported by one of the more than 25 <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/plan-s-funders-implementation/">signatory funders</a> be made available under an Open Access copyright license without delay or embargo&mdash;either in a fully Open Access (OA) journal, or by posting to a fully Open Access repository. To support these requirements, the cOAlition members agree that grants may be used to pay publication fees if needed.</p>



<p>Recently, cOAlition S reaffirmed their timeline for full implementation of Plan S. The policy, which began in January 2021, will come into full effect as planned in December 2024. Notably, in the recent announcement, cOAlition S confirmed plans to end support for &ldquo;<a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/plan-s-compliant-transformative-journals/">transformative agreements</a>&rdquo; at the end of 2024 as part of their larger effort to encourage Open Access. Transformative agreements facilitate a path to Open Access publishing in certain hybrid or subscription journals that intend to move to a fully Open Access model. By the 2024 deadline, authors may not be able to use grants to fund publications in journals still operating a hybrid model. <strong>As PLOS is and always has been a fully OA publisher, this will not affect APC funding or institutional deals for PLOS authors.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>While full implementation is still almost two years in the future, it&rsquo;s exciting to see the program moving forward. PLOS is very supportive of the next steps outlined by the cOAlition, and we are already prepared for this new phase of Plan S! Read on for more detail on how PLOS meets or exceeds Plan-S requirements.</p>



<h2>PLOS is Plan-S-ready&mdash;and then some!</h2>



<h4>Journal standards and Open licensing</h4>



<p>In order to qualify as an approved publication venue, Plan S requires that publishers and platforms meet certain standards for quality and ethics, transparent editorial guidelines, and of course, OA licensing and author copyright retention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At PLOS, everything we publish is Open, and always has been. We were founded in 2001 as an Open Access advocacy organization, and began publishing research in 2003 under a CC BY license. We are a <a href="https://oaspa.org/about/history/">founding member of OASPA</a>, and a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/10/oa-weeks-past/">co-founder of OA week</a>. Each of our journals upholds the very highest standards for scientific and research ethics, and are longstanding members of <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">COPE</a>.</p>



<h4>Transparent journal metrics and publication cost details</h4>



<p>Another key requirement of Plan S relates to transparent journal metrics, fair publication fees, and clarity around how Article Processing Charges (APCs) are allocated. Qualifying journals are also required to offer fully documented fee waiver and discount programs for authors based in lower- or middle- income countries, and those with demonstrable needs.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/price-transparency-update-2021">read our most recent journal statistics and cost details</a> on the Official PLOS Blog. We offer <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/">full waivers and discounts</a> to researchers based in Research4Life countries, as well as needs-based fee assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as important, we&rsquo;re working to make Open Access more equitable overall by moving beyond APCs. We&rsquo;ve established&nbsp; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-series">APC-alternative funding models</a> that help put OA publication within reach for all, whether funded by Plan S signatories or not. And because we&rsquo;re fully Open, our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">institutional partner agreements</a> will remain Plan S compliant, even after the transitional period ends in 2024.</p>



<h4>Technical specifications</h4>



<p>Plan S includes technical requirements to support discoverability, preservation, and meta-analysis, beginning with detailed machine-readable, and non-proprietary metadata. <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/">OpenAIRE</a> compliance and full text machine-readable downloads are both strongly encouraged. In addition, long-term preservation is of course required, and self-archiving recommended. Plan S also requires persistent digital identifiers for publications and strongly recommends identifiers for authors as well.</p>



<p><strong>PLOS journals offer all of these features! </strong>Authors can rest easy when submitting to PLOS, knowing their published articles will automatically be backed by high-quality JATS metadata, LOCKSS archiving, and be accessible in a downloadable version of our <a href="https://github.com/PLOS/allofplos">full corpus</a>. PLOS journals assign unique DOIs to all of our articles, with sub-DOIs to identify and link figures and Published Peer Review History. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/credit/">ORCID</a> is required for all corresponding authors, and is available to coauthors and reviewers as well. We also use the CRediT taxonomy to acknowledge each authors&rsquo; unique contribution to the work.</p>



<h4>Accessible data</h4>



<p>While not required, Plan S strongly recommends openly accessible data in line with ethical considerations, as well as links to data, code, and other supporting documentation.</p>



<p>For almost a decade, PLOS&rsquo; <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">sensible data policy</a> has required that the data underlying each study be made publicly available, so long as it does not pose a risk to vulnerable populations or patient privacy. Plus, we are experimenting with new tools to make data sharing and reuse easy and more visible. Our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">Accessible Data</a> feature highlights links to data repositories on our article pages, so readers can easily find and retrieve datasets associated with PLOS articles while our <a href="https://plos.org/dryad-data/">Dryad integration</a> for <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> enables data repository deposition through the Editorial Manager submissions system.</p>



<h2>Looking ahead to full Plan S implementation</h2>



<p>All this means that Plan-S-funded authors can submit to <a href="https://plos.org/your-journal-options/">any of our 12 journals</a> with confidence, now or after 2024, knowing that their articles will be Plan S compliant with no additional effort on their part. And, that any publication fees will be eligible for funding support, either through a PLOS partner institution, or through their Plan S funder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-hologram-physics-twisted-light">Physicists stored data in quantum holograms made of twisted light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Particles of twisted light that have been entangled using quantum mechanics offer a new approach to dense and secure data storage.</p>



<p>Holograms that produce 3-D images and serve as security features on credit cards are usually made with patterns laid down with beams of laser light. In recent years, physicists have found ways to create holograms with entangled photons instead. Now there is, literally, a new twist to the technology.</p>



<p>Entangled photons that travel in corkscrew paths have resulted in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/ac078Ye1I8b11c7329660e49f22a782a1ca503b66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holograms that offer the possibility of dense and ultrasecure data encryption</a>, researchers report in a study to appear in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>





<p>Light can move in a variety of ways, including the up-and-down and side-to-side patterns of polarized light. But when it carries a type of rotation known as orbital angular momentum, it can also propagate in spirals that resemble twisted rotini pasta.</p>



<p>Like any other photons, the twisted versions can be entangled so that they essentially act as one entity. Something that affects one of an entangled photon pair instantly affects the other, even if they are very far apart.</p>



<p>In previous experiments, researchers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-communication-takes-new-twist">sent data through the air in entangled pairs of twisted photons</a> (<em>SN: 8/5/15</em>). The approach should allow high-speed data transmission because light can come with different amounts of twist, with each twist serving as a different channel of communication.</p>



<p>Now the same approach has been applied to record data in holograms. Instead of transmitting information on multiple, twisted light channels, photon pairs with different amounts of twist create distinct sets of data in a single hologram. The more orbital angular momentum states involved, each with different amounts of twist, the more data researchers can pack into a hologram.</p>



<p>In addition to cramming more data into holograms, increasing the variety of twists used to record the data boosts security. Anyone who wants to read the information out needs to know, or guess, how the light that recorded it was twisted.</p>



<p>For a hologram relying on two types of twist, says physicist Xiangdong Zhang of the Beijing Institute of Technology, you would have to pick the right combination of the twists from about 80 possibilities to decode the data. Bumping that up to combinations of seven distinct twists leads to millions of possibilities. That, Zhang says, “should be enough to ensure our quantum holographic encryption system has enough security level.”</p>





<p>The researchers demonstrated their technique by encoding words and letters in holograms and reading the data back out again with twisted light. Although the researchers produced images from the holographic data, says physicist Hugo Defienne of the Paris Institute of Nanosciences, the storage itself should not be confused with holographic images.</p>



<p>Defienne, who was not involved with the new research, says that other quantum holography schemes, such as his efforts with polarized photons, produce direct images of objects including microscopic structures.</p>



<p>“[Their] idea there is very different . . . from our approach in this sense,” Defrienne says. “They’re using holography to store information,” rather than creating the familiar 3-D images that most people associate with holograms.</p>



<p>The twisted light data storage that Zhang and his colleagues demonstrated is slow, requiring nearly 20 minutes to decode an image of the acronym “BIT,” for the Beijing Institute of Technology where the experiments were performed. And the security that the researchers have demonstrated is still relatively low because they included only up to six forms of twisted light in their experiments.</p>



<p>Zhang is confident that both limitations can be overcome with technical improvements. “We think that our technology has potential application in quantum information encryption,” he says, “especially quantum image encryption.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammals-groups-longevity-genetics">Mammals that live in groups may live longer, longevity research suggests</a></h4>

              
                <p>For mammals, one secret to a long life may be spending it living with friends and family.</p>



<p>An analysis of the life spans and social lives of nearly 1,000 mammal species shows that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35869-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">species that live in groups, such as horses and chimpanzees, tend to live longer</a> than solitary beasts, like weasels and hedgehogs. The finding suggests that life span and social traits are evolutionarily entwined in mammals, researchers report January 31 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>The maximum life span of mammals ranges widely. The shortest-lived shrews, for example, survive about two years, while bowhead whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) can reach <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bowhead-whales-may-unlock-secrets-long-healthy-life">roughly 200 years of age</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>1/6/15</em>).</p>



<p>When evolutionary biologist Xuming Zhou of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing was studying the longest-lived mammals to understand the evolution of longevity, he took particular note of naked mole-rats (<em>Heterocephalus glaber</em>). The rodents are exceptionally long-lived, sometimes reaching over 30 years of age. They also live in huge, complex, subterranean societies. In contrast, other rodents like golden hamsters (<em>Mesocricetus auratus</em>), which are solitary, live to only about four years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some previous research on specific mammal species showed an effect of social behavior on longevity, Zhou says. For instance, female chacma baboons (<em>Papio ursinus</em>) with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210007219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong, stable social bonds live longer</a> than females without them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhou and his colleagues decided to see if there were any links between longevity and social habits shared across a wide range of mammal species.</p>



<p>The researchers compiled information from the scientific literature on the social organization of 974 mammal species. They then split these species into three categories: solitary, pair-living and group-living. When the researchers compared these three groups with data on the mammals’ known longevity, they found that group-living mammals tended to live longer than the solitary species — roughly 22 years compared with nearly 12 years in solitary mammals.</p>



<p>Zhou and his colleagues then accounted for body mass — bigger mammals tend to live longer than smaller ones — and the effect of social bonds held. A stark example comes from shrews and bats. Both are similarly tiny mammals, but the loner shrews live only a few years, while some far more social bat species can live for 30 or 40 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were so surprised, because individuals who live in groups also face a lot of costs, such as competition for potential mating partners and food,” Zhou says. Frequent social contact in group settings can also encourage the spread of infectious disease.</p>





<p>But there are benefits to living in a group too, he says, such as banding together for protection against predators. Living together may also reduce the risk of starvation if, for instance, group members increase foraging efficiency by finding and gathering food together. These factors may allow social mammals to live longer.</p>



<p>The evolution of a long life may also be more likely in group-living species: Living in a group allows animals to potentially aid the survival of their family members, which carry their genes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist Laurent Keller of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland lauds the study for the sheer size of the sampling effort. “But it would have been useful to be a bit more precise about different levels of sociality.” There are more variations of social organization within the three categories used in the study, he says, and the relative degree of sociality could influence any patterns you see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, fine tuning the social categories “is not an easy task,” Keller notes.</p>



<p>To get an idea of how genes might produce the link between longevity and group living, Zhou and his team took brain tissue samples from 94 mammal species and analyzed the transcriptome — the full complement of RNA — giving insights into different genes’ activity levels. This can reveal whether genes are turned on or off, or how much protein the genes may be instructing cells to produce.</p>



<p>The researchers found 31 genes whose relative activity levels were correlated with both longevity and one of the three prescribed social categories. Many of these genes appear to have roles in the immune system, which may have importance when countering pathogens spreading through the social group. Other genes were associated with hormone regulation, including some thought to influence social behaviors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In studying these genes in more detail, Zhou envisions uncovering more about how mammals’ social habits and life spans have evolved together.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Indexing: </strong>The original journal was indexed in Scopus, initially under the original (shorter) name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2021, the number of papers indexed that year under the journal’s original name reached 131. However, the majority – if not all – came from the hijacked journal. (Retraction Watch has<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/19/can-journals-get-hijacked-apparently-yes/"> written</a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/12/meet-the-hijacked-journal-that-keeps-rising-from-the-ashes/"> several</a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/09/01/how-did-content-from-a-hijacked-journal-end-up-in-one-of-the-worlds-most-used-databases/"> times</a> about hijacked journals successfully indexing papers in well-respected databases such as Clarivate’s Web of Science or Scopus, which many universities and countries use as a measure of quality.)</p>



<p>Once the legitimate journal staffers learned of the problem, they created a new profile in Scopus using their new, longer title. But the hijackers succeeded in indexing unauthorized papers there as well, as indicated by the titles of these papers being irrelevant to linguistics. (Hijacked journals tend to ignore subject matter or manuscript quality in their aim to publish as many papers as possible.)</p>



<p>Since June 2021, when the old-title journal was under investigation in Scopus, the unauthorized content of the hijacked <em>Linguistica Antverpiensia</em> was indexed seven times to the new profile of the journal in Scopus, for a total of 14 papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, the hijackers did it twice. In May, the hijacked journal indexed the paper “Subtitles of sex toy advertisements: Sexual expressions and translation techniques,” and in October, seven new papers were indexed, all of them co-authored by Russian and Kazakhstani authors (see screenshot below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In comparison, during this period the legitimate journal only once indexed 19 papers published in 2021.</p>

<p>All unauthorized<em> </em>articles from 2021 and 2022 no longer appear to be indexed in Scopus under the title of the legitimate journal.</p>



<p><strong>Spillover effects: </strong>Ten papers published in the hijacked <em>Linguistica Antverpiensia</em> were included in<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/16/who-covid-19-library-contains-hundreds-of-papers-from-hijacked-journals/"> a World Health Organization (WHO) database of papers about COVID-19</a> until they were eventually removedThe legitimate journal did take legal steps and the hijackers deleted all information from the original website hivt.be. But later they registered a new<a href="http://upa-editions.com/index.php/LANS-TTS"> web domain</a> hijacking <em>Linguistica Antverpiensia, New Series – Themes in Translation Studies</em> – and thus the scam continues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/turkey-syria-earthquake">What to know about Turkey’s recent devastating earthquake</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the early morning of February 6, a devastating magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck southern Turkey, near the border with Syria. Numerous aftershocks followed, the strongest nearly rivaling the power of the main quake, at magnitude 7.5. By evening, the death toll had climbed to more than 3,700 across both countries, according to Reuters, and was expected to continue to rise.</p>



<p>Most of Turkey sits on a small tectonic plate that is sandwiched between two slowly colliding behemoths: the vast Eurasian Plate to the north and the Arabian Plate to the south. As those two plates push together, Turkey is being squeezed out sideways, like a watermelon seed snapped between two fingers, says seismologist Susan Hough of the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>





<p>The entire country is hemmed in by strike-slip, or sideways-sliding, fault zones: the North Anatolian Fault that runs roughly parallel to the Black Sea, and the East Anatolian Fault, near the border with Syria. As a result, Turkey is highly seismically active. Even so, Monday’s quake, which occurred on the East Anatolian Fault, was the strongest to strike the region since 1939, when a magnitude 7.8 quake killed 30,000 people.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> talked with Hough, who is based in Pasadena, Calif., about the quake, its aftershocks and building codes. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: You </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SeismoSue/status/1622411773382115330" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>say on Twitter</strong></a><strong> that this was a powerful quake for a strike-slip fault. Can you explain?</strong><br><br><strong>Hough</strong>: The world has seen bigger earthquakes. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">Subduction zones generate the biggest earthquakes</a>, as much as magnitude 9 (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). But quakes close to magnitude 8 are not common on strike-slip faults. But because they’re on land and tend to be shallow, you can get severe … shaking close to the fault that’s moving.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Some of the aftershocks were very strong, at magnitudes 7.5 and 6.7. Is that unusual?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hough</strong>: As with a lot of things, there’s what’s expected on average, and there’s what’s possible. On average, the largest aftershocks are a full unit smaller than the main shock. But that’s just average; for any individual main shock, the largest aftershock can have a lot of variability.</p>



<p>The other thing people noted was the distance [between the main shock and some aftershocks over a hundred kilometers away]. Aftershock as a term isn’t precise. What is an aftershock isn’t something that seismologists are always clear on. The fault that produced the main shock is 200 kilometers long, and that’s going to change the stress in a lot of areas. Mostly it releases stress, but it does increase stress in some areas. So you can get aftershocks along that fault, but also some distance away. It’s a little bit unusual, but not unheard of.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: People have wondered whether Monday’s magnitude 3 earthquake near Buffalo, N.Y., might be related.</strong></p>





<p><strong>Hough</strong>: A magnitude 7.8 quake generates [seismic] waves that you can record all around Earth, so it’s technically disrupting every point on Earth. So it’s not a completely outlandish idea, but it’s statistically exceedingly unlikely. Maybe if a seismic wave passed through a fault that was just ready to go in just the right way, it’s possible.</p>



<p>An interesting [and completely separate] idea is that you might get earthquakes around the perimeter of the Great Lakes [such as near Buffalo] because as the lake levels go up and down, you’re stressing the Earth’s crust, putting weight on one side or the other. That’s a source of stress that could give you these pretty small quakes.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: The images emerging from this deadly disaster are devastating.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hough</strong>: It’s hard to watch. And it hammers home the importance of building codes. One of the problems that any place is up against is that building codes improve over time, and you’ve always got the problem of older structures. It’s really expensive to retrofit. I expect that earthquake engineers will be looking at the damage, and it will illuminate where the vulnerabilities are [in the area]. The hope is that with proper engineering, we can make the built environment safe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-recognize-photo-self-aware">Fish can recognize themselves in photos, further evidence they may be self-aware</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some fish can recognize their own faces in photos and mirrors, an ability usually attributed to humans and other animals considered particularly brainy, such as chimpanzees, scientists report. Finding the ability in fish suggests that self-awareness may be far more widespread among animals than scientists once thought.</p>



<p>“It is believed widely that the animals that have larger brains will be more intelligent than animals of the small brain,” such as fish, says animal sociologist Masanori Kohda of Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan. It may be time to rethink that assumption, Kohda says.</p>





<p>Kohda’s previous research showed that bluestreak cleaner wrasses can pass the mirror test, a controversial cognitive assessment that purportedly reveals self-awareness, or the ability to be the object of one’s own thoughts. The test involves exposing an animal to a mirror and then surreptitiously putting a mark on the animal’s face or body to see if they will notice it on their reflection and try to touch it on their body. Previously only a handful of large-brained species, including chimpanzees and other great apes, dolphins, elephants and magpies, have passed the test.</p>



<p>In a new study, cleaner fish that passed the mirror test were then able to distinguish their own faces from those of other cleaner fish in still photographs. This suggests that the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2208420120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fish identify themselves</a> the same way humans are thought to — by forming a mental image of one’s face, Kohda and colleagues report February 6 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>“I think it’s truly remarkable that they can do this,” says primatologist Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta who was not involved in the research. “I think it’s an incredible study.”</p>



<p>De Waal is quick to point out that failing the mirror test should not be considered evidence of a lack of self-awareness. Still, scientists have struggled to understand why some species that are known to have complex cognitive abilities, such as monkeys and ravens, have not passed. Researchers have also questioned whether the test is appropriate for species like dogs that rely more on scent, or like pigs that may not care enough about a mark on their bodies to try to touch it.</p>



<p>The mixed results in other animals make it all the more astonishing that a small fish can pass. In their first mirror test studies, published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, Kohda’s team exposed wild-caught cleaner fish in separate tanks to mirrors for a week. The researchers then injected brown dye just beneath the scales on the fish’s throats, making a mark that resembles the parasites these fish eat off the skin of larger fish in the wild. When the marked fish saw themselves in a mirror, they began striking their throats on rocks or sand in the bottom of the tank, apparently trying to scrape off the marks.</p>



<p>In the new study, 10 fish that passed the mirror test were then shown a photo of their own face and a photo of an unfamiliar cleaner fish face. All the fish acted aggressively toward the unfamiliar photo, as if it were a stranger, but were not aggressive toward the photo of their own face.</p>



<p>When another eight fish that had spent a week with a mirror but had not previously been marked were shown a photo of their own face with a brown mark on the throat, six of them began scraping their throats just like the fish that passed the mirror test. But they did not scrape when shown a photo of another fish with a mark.</p>





<p>Animals that recognize their reflection in the mirror most likely first learn to identify themselves by seeing that the movement of the animal in the mirror matches their own movement, researchers think. Because the cleaner fish were also able to recognize their own faces in still images, they, and possibly other animals that have passed the mirror test, may be able to identify themselves by developing a mental image of their own face that they can compare to what they see in the mirror or photos, the authors say.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a great next step,” says comparative cognitive psychologist Jennifer Vonk of Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., who wasn’t involved in the study. But she would like to see more research before drawing conclusions about what’s being represented in the mind of a nonverbal being like a fish. “As with most other studies, it still leaves some room for further follow-up.”</p>



<p>Kohda’s lab has more experiments planned to continue to probe what’s going on in the brain of the cleaner fish, and to try the new photo-recognition method on another popular research fish, the three-spined stickleback (<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em>).</p>



<p>Animal behaviorist Jonathan Balcombe, author of the book<em> What a Fish Knows</em>, is already convinced, describing the new study as “robust and quite brilliant.” People shouldn’t be surprised that fish could be self-aware given that they have already been shown to have complex behavior including tool use, planning and collaboration, Balcombe says. “It’s time we stopped thinking of fishes as somehow lesser members of the vertebrate pantheon.”</p>

                <p>2022 was the year of generative AI models: DALL-E 2, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, and Imagen all showed that it’s possible to generate grounded, photorealistic images. These generative AIs are instances of conditional <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">denoising diffusion probabilistic models</a>, or DDPMs. Despite these flashy applications, DDPMs have thus far had little impact on neuroscience.</p>

<p>I want to change that! I think DDPMs are very cool models. Not only can they be used to generate oil paintings of cute sloth birthday parties, but they’re also useful, general-purpose generative models: tractable, and easy to train. Perhaps surprisingly, they’re also related to a lot of common models in neuroscience, like hierarchical Bayesian predictive coding models and Hopfield networks. They contain a lot of interesting ideas about how the brain might implement complex generative models, and I think they would benefit from being studied from a neuroscience perspective.</p>



<p>I wrote this article both for neuroscientists who want to keep up with the latest in ML, and for ML practitioners who are curious about neuroscience. First, I give a high-level overview of diffusion models, how to train them and how they compare and contrast to other generative models. I won’t get into the math but I’ll give references to tutorial introductions if you’re interested in that. I’ll discuss current applications in neuroscience, and speculate about some potential future applications. Finally, I’ll relate the structure of DDPMs to some common neuroscience models like Hopfield networks and Bayesian predictive coding. Let’s get started!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How DDPMs work</h2>



<p>DD<strong>PM</strong>s are generative <strong>P</strong>robability <strong>M</strong>odels: they learn a complex probability distribution p(<strong>x<sub>0</sub></strong>) from empirical data. Here <strong>x</strong> is a D-dimensional vector representing an image, sounds, time series, graphs, etc. To generate a new sample from a learned <strong>D</strong>DPM, you repeatedly apply a <strong>D</strong>enoiser – a deep neural network like a U-Net or a transformer – to noise vectors. Think of these noise vectors as the latent variables of the model. At the end of the process, a sample is generated. It’s a little bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">pareidolia</a> (seeing faces in clouds): if I present a bunch of noise stimuli (e.g. clouds) to a human, and ask them what they see, they’ll generate a probability distribution over familiar things (e.g. faces). This process thus maps noise to a learned probability distribution.</p>

<p>But how do you learn a DDPM? Rather than repeat all the math from other excellent tutorials, I will to give you a flavour of why DDPMs are built the way they are, how they’re trained, and give you a bit of wayfinding so you can learn independently.</p>

Data is on the left, noise on the right. We learn a denoising DNN <strong>μ</strong>(x<sub>t</sub>, t). From Kevin Murphy’s book.</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Training D<strong>D</strong>PMs involves two <strong>d</strong>iffusion processes. First, a word of warning: the diagram that you will see in every DDPM paper to illustrate these processes, by convention, has samples on the left (<strong>x</strong><sub>0</sub>), and noise on the right (<strong>x</strong><sub>T</sub>). I think that’s very confusing, because usually we’re going from noise to sample (right to left), and the diagram breaks expectations about how you should read it, so watch out for that.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>forward</strong> process first (left to right): Take any probability distribution and add a little bit of normal noise to it, while also rescaling it; if you repeat this process enough times, you will obtain a normal distribution. This is a consequence of the central limit theorem. This process is Markovian (q(x<sub>T</sub>) = <strong>Π</strong> q(x<sub>t</sub>|x<sub>t-1</sub>) q(x<sub>0</sub>)). Each of the probability distributions in this expression has a simple Gaussian functional form, save for q(x<sub>0</sub>).</p>



<p>Our goal is to learn the <strong>reverse</strong> process: going from noise to samples, right to left. We write another Markov chain, p(x<sub>0</sub>) = <strong>Π</strong> p(x<sub>t-1</sub>|x<sub>t</sub>) p(x<sub>T</sub>). If we want p(x<sub>0</sub>) to approximate q(x<sub>0</sub>), the diffusion kernel p(x<sub>t-1</sub>|x<sub>t</sub>) has to be different for different x<sub>t</sub>: it has to be a biased diffusion process, otherwise we’d just turn noise into noise. We keep the same functional form for the diffusion kernel – a normal distribution – but we make its mean depend on x<sub>t</sub> via a deep neural network <span style="text-align: start"><strong>μ</strong></span>(x<sub>t</sub>, t).</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem like we’ve accomplished much thus far, but here comes the magic: you can write down an expression for the likelihood of different samples (q(x<sub>0</sub>)) in terms of ratios of p’s and q’s. You can lower-bound these expressions using Jensen’s inequality – the ELBO, or evidence lower bound, the same trick used in VAEs – and now you’ve got an expression involving the KL divergences of different Gaussian distributions. All of these KL divergences can be calculated symbolically, a bunch of stuff cancels out, you’re left with a really simple expression for the ELBO. It turns out you can then optimize using this straightforward algorithm:</p>

<p>Here, ϵ(x) is a deep neural network (a U-Net or transformer) that takes a sample and predicts the noise that was added into it: the denoiser. The DDPM learning algorithm holds in five lines of pseudo-code. It’s quite accessible for us mere mortals: you can code and train a DDPM in an afternoon. Yet, the structure of a DDPM is quite rich, and it is very flexible. That’s a big reason why I find DDPMs so interesting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sampling</h3>



<p>Sampling is done by running the learned denoising process many times, starting from noise samples p(x<sub>T</sub>). You denoise, add a little bit of noise, denoise, add a little bit of noise, etc. until you have a sample. That can be pretty slow, but there are strategies to accelerate. The most common is probably DDIM (the I is for implicit), which removes the continuous addition of noise with a modified sampling chain. With DDIM, you only take one noise sample p(x<sub>T</sub>), and the rest of the chain is deterministic. It’s possible to take DDIM samples from a vanilla-trained DDPM; you can reduce the number of sampling steps from, say, 1024, down to a more manageable 16 or so without much loss in sample quality. Because DDIM sampling is deterministic after the initial noise injection, it preserves the latent structure of the model, so you can use it for things like latent space interpolation.</p>

<p>So far I’ve focused on unconditional DDPMs, but it’s just as easy to build a conditional DDPM. The most common way to condition during training and generation is to take the conditioning information, pass it through an MLP, and let it bias the denoiser every denoising iteration. The timestep <em>t</em> is also embedded in this way. Biasing can be done by changing the mean and scale of different feature maps of the U-Net, or by biasing attentional blocks. This mechanism is very flexible; to take a specific example, <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion">latent diffusion</a>, which drives Stable Diffusion, can condition on:</p>



<ul>
<li>text via a dense CLIP-based embedding</li>



<li>one-hot encoded image categories</li>



<li>segmentation masks</li>



<li>other images (e.g. for image-to-image translation or upsampling)</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional way of conditioning DDPMs only at generation time. This late-binding is a bit of a mindfuck so bear with me or skip to the next section. The DDPM likelihood (reverse chain) can be multiplied with other distributions (e.g. priors) easily. Because each diffusion step moves the distribution only a little, it turns out that multiplying by a prior ends up only changing the mean of each diffusion step (see Appendix Table 1 in Sohl-Dickstein 2015). That means you can add a late-bound generation “penalty” (the log of the prior) to bias the generation. This trick is used in both <a href="https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion">classifier-guided diffusion</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598">classifier-free guided diffusion</a> to improve visual quality of generation. Basically, they bias the generation process away from low-quality, easily confusable images towards canonical, visually striking poses.</p>

<p>This late binding opens up many possibilities: sometimes you need to generate images which are just slightly off of the image manifold. Here I show a toy example of using a late-bound critic to make a batch of samples more easily discriminable from each other. I trained a vanilla DDPM on Google Fonts to generate lowercase letters. Next, I used the intermediate layer of an AlexNet to generate a confusion matrix to determine how likely AlexNet is to confuse these letters (see <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010522">Janini et al. 2022</a> for background information). Then I nudged the generation so that letters are less confusable according to this critic, creating a modified font with improved readability in peripheral vision. This kind of late binding is very hard to do with other types of deep generative models.</p>

<p>It can be hard to keep track of all the deep generative architectures and all their plusses and minuses: when should you use one versus another? DDPMs are frequently used in lieu of a GAN or a VAE. Compared with GANs:</p>



<ul>
<li>DDPM samples, like those from GANs, can be of very high visual (or auditory…) quality</li>



<li>DDPMs can sample from the actual distribution of the data; GANs can suffer from mode collapse</li>



<li>It’s really easy to train a DDPM, unlike a GAN which can suffer from instability</li>



<li>You can calculate a likelihood lower bound for a given sample in a DDPM, unlike a GAN</li>



<li>However, DDPMs are slower to sample (though tricks like DDIM help)</li>
</ul>



<p>DDPMs are quite similar under the hood to hierarchical VAEs. Compared with vanilla VAEs however, DDPM samples are sharper.</p>



<p>Another thing that differentiates DDPMs is that they have some unusual capabilities out of the box. That means that, for instance, they can denoise images out of the box. Upsampling, inpainting and outpainting are also straightforward.</p>



<p>They do have one big drawback compared to GANs and VAEs: the latent space of a vanilla DDPM has the same dimensionality as the data (e.g. the number of pixels). This is different than GANs or VAEs which typically have compressed latents. For some applications, compression is the whole point: <a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/07/26/dimensionality-reduction-in-neural-data-analysis/">see my previous post on dimensionality reduction in neuroscience</a>. A notable exception to this rule is <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion">latent diffusion</a>, which uses a complex pipeline involving a VQ-GAN in addition to diffusion in the compressed space; but technically, it’s not the diffusion model that learns the compressed latent, it’s the GAN. That being said, as discussed above, while DDPMs don’t have compressed latents, they do have high-dimensional latents which can be manipulated and interpolated.</p>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> DDPMs are easy to train, they generate high-quality samples, and they have some unusual properties which allow them to be used in interesting scenarios. However, they don’t have compressed latents, so we can’t use them for dimensionality reduction. That’s unfortunate for us neuroscientists because we love dimensionality reduction. So what can we use them for?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are they good for (in neuroscience)?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Generating brain-data-conditioned samples</h3>



<p>There are neuroscience applications which require generating high-quality samples. Brain decoding is a good example: you attempt to back out what a person saw (or imagined, or even dreamt) from the pattern of their brain activity. Ideally, you’d like to generate natural-looking samples. Two recent papers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06956">Chen et al. 2022</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.abstract">Takagi &amp; Nishimoto 2022</a>), which <a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/01/01/2022-in-review-neuroai-comes-of-age/">I reported on in the last post</a>, demonstrate these ideas. They mapped fMRI data to the latents of a latent diffusion model to decode images from the brain. You could imagine doing this with single neuron data as well (e.g <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aav9436">Bashivan et al. 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419303915">Ponce et al. 2019</a>).</p>

(2022).</figcaption></figure>



<p>This Brain DALL-E idea is very cool, but you might think it’s a curiosity rather than a practical idea. However, there’s a domain where generating good, brain-conditioned samples is essential. Patients with ALS or brainstem strokes can end up in a locked-in state, where they’re unable to communicate despite remaining fully conscious. This was eloquently documented in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly">The Diving Bell And The Butterfly</a>, which was dictated, letter by letter, through a series of eyeblinks by the author Jean-Dominique Bauby. It’s been recently demonstrated that we can an invasive brain-computer interface can directly read attempted speech from a patient’s brain. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2027540">Moses et al. (2021)</a> demonstrated decoding brain activity in speech-motor cortex in a locked-in patient, classifying attempted spoken words and displaying them on a screen, thus allowing the patient to communicate.</p>



<p>You could imagine pushing this idea forward by making a custom voice box for the locked-in patient. First, capture a patient’s voice and intonation in a generative model, similar to the recent <a href="https://valle-demo.github.io/">VALL-E</a> (VALL-E is a VQ-VAE, but you could also do this with a DDPM). In the case of a neurodegenerative disease, it should be possible to record a patient’s voice after the diagnosis but before being locked-in. Then one could create a voice-box BCI that sounds like the patient’s own voice, which can be deployed once the patient is unable to communicate. It sounds like science-fiction, but I don’t think this is far off.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">MRI, medical images and data augmentation</h3>



<p>We’ve seen a number of papers applying DDPMs to medical imaging and MRI data. This is less neuroscience-proper and more neurology, but you can see how these ideas could be adapted and used as neuroscience tooling. Consider a compressed sensing scenario, where one wants to infer images from sparse measurements, for example to accelerate an MRI or PET scan. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03623">It’s easy to rig up a conditional diffusion model that takes, for example, an undersampled k-space representation of an MRI and spits out a plausible corresponding brain image</a>. Not only are these images visually plausible, they come with their own error bars! It’s indeed possible to run the diffusion process several times to get multiple samples from the posterior and figure out where the model is certain of its reconstruction and where the model is just spitballing. A related application is in denoising images, whether these images are MRIs, PET scans or microscopy images (including 2p-imaging).</p>



<p>Because we can evaluate the likelihood of an image through a diffusion model, we can do <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9857019/">anomaly detection</a>, for instance to determine whether there’s a tumour in an MRI. Another application area is label-efficient segmentation. The image-space diffusion process means that the network must learn foreground/background relationships or object boundaries implicitly (this is a bit of foreshadowing for our section on how DDPMs are brain-like). <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SlxSY2UZQT">Baranchuk et al. (2022)</a> show how you can use this to do label-efficient segmentation, which could be expanded to medical images or MRIs, which are normally extremely expensive to annotate.</p>



<p>Indeed, data augmentation is something that DDPMs excel at. Learn an unconditional generative model for segmentation masks, learn a conditional generative model for an MRI, and you’ve got yourself a sequence of models that can generate fake (segmentation, MRI) pairs, which you can then use for downstream classification, defining biomarkers, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why DDPMs might be a little brain-like</h2>



<p>We’ve covered sober applications of DDPMs for neuroscience. If DDPMs become just another tool in the toolbox of neuroscience, that’s a win for neuroscience. However, I’d like to go further and claim that DDPMs might be a little brain-like. This is still highly speculative (read: half-baked), but I think there’s a real opportunity to use DDPMs as a wedge to build new neuroAI models of the brain. I’m putting this out there not as a fully worked-out proposal but to make the community aware of the opportunity and find potential collaborators.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hierarchical Bayesian predictive coding</h3>



<p>Let’s consider the current state of visual neuroAI. Convolutional neural networks trained for image classification on ImageNet have been the de facto default models of the ventral stream of the visual cortex – V1, V2, V4 and IT – over the last decade. Self-supervised models have recently been shown to be just as good as supervised CNNs at explaining the ventral stream, and are more biologically plausible (<a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/12/31/2021-in-review-unsupervised-brain-models/">see previous post on this subject</a>). However, we know many ways in which the ventral stream is different than feedforward neural nets trained with supervised or self-supervised learning. Here are 4 facts we need to reconcile with the ventral stream:</p>



<ol>
<li>The ventral stream has feedforward, recurrent and feedback connections, while CNNs only have feedforward connections</li>



<li>The ventral stream (and all of the brain) is noisy, CNNs are deterministic</li>



<li>The ventral stream is involved in visual imagery during waking, and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1234330">in dreams</a>; I have no idea how to get a CNN to dream</li>



<li>The ventral stream and humans as a whole <a href="http://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/bayesianbook.html">seem to act <em>as though</em> vision is Bayesian</a>; it’s not clear to me that CNNs do the same kind of Bayesian inference</li>
</ol>



<p>We can add more features to a basic CNN to better match the ventral stream. For instance, recurrent connections allow computations to unfold in time. While there’s nothing wrong with empirically motivated additions to CNNs, it’d be nice for additions to be more theoretically grounded.</p>



<p>Prior to CNNs taking over the study of the ventral stream, a dominant view of the visual cortex was as a hierarchical Bayesian inference machine. A prototypical example is the proposal of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12868647/">Mumford and Lee</a> (2003):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Mumford and Lee’s model, the brain is Bayesian (point 4), it contains a generative model (point 3), and inference of the contents of an image from noisy measurements from the retina involves recurrent noisy algorithms (points 1 and 2). These recurrent noisy algorithms include particle filtering, loopy belief propagation, or MCMC. There was some early progress in scaling up this idea: the <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/18/7/1527/7065/A-Fast-Learning-Algorithm-for-Deep-Belief-Nets">restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) papers</a> from Bengio &amp; Hinton from the late 2000’s cite Mumford &amp; Lee. However, the idea fizzled as discriminative approaches to classification became popular. Generative approaches are currently not competitive in explaining the ventral stream compared to other image-computable models (<a href="http://www.brain-score.org/">Brain-Score</a> and the like; see also <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=i_xiyGq6FNT">Conwell et al. 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014196118">Zhuang et al. 2021</a>).</p>



<p>I think there’s an opportunity to resurrect and modernize this class of models using DDPMs. The most straightforward mapping to the ventral stream is to think of the first half of the denoising U-Net as equivalent to a feedforward pass up the ventral stream, the second half as a backward pass; the multiple iterations of the denoiser correspond to recurrent activity. The information communicated at every denoising step back to V1 is the delta between an image and its projection on the image manifold at this point in the process, producing a nice link to predictive coding models.</p>



<p>Regardless of the exact way in which we embody these ideas, DDPMs give us access to a lot of new machinery to work with, in both discrete &amp; continuous formulations. That’s on top of related ideas of denoising score matching on probabilistic graphic models and related progress in hierarchical VAEs (see Kevin Murphy’s book for more on these subjects).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Content addressable memories and the hippocampus</h3>



<p>DDPMs are also related to ideas about content addressable memories and the hippocampus. Consider the famous <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hopfield_network">Hopfield network</a>, a recurrent neural network which stores discrete memories inside of its weights. It can retrieve memories at will as the steady state of recurrent activity: starting from an incomplete pattern, it can complete the pattern by repeated application of a simple rule. Such a content-addressable memory is often a core component of computational models of the hippocampus, for instance the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742031388X#sec4.3.20.2">Tolman-Eichenbaum machine</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png"><img data-attachment-id="8156" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2023/02/06/denoising-diffusion-models-for-neuroscience/untitled-7-3/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png" data-orig-size="472,331" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="untitled-7" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=472" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=472" alt="" class="wp-image-8156" srcset="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png 472w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=150 150w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/untitled-7.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hopfield networks can fill in missing information to retrieve partial memories; so can DDPMs. <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/">From this excellent blog post</a> on modern Hopfield networks.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I like to think of DDPMs as continuous content-addressable memories. Corrupted images can be retrieved by the repeated application of the denoiser. Importantly, the network stores continuous memories: instead of representing discrete memories (mixture of Dirac deltas) like a Hopfield network, they represent an ensemble of memories (continuous distribution). DDPMs can recover from different corruptions, including additive noise and masking.</p>



<p>Lest we think that this analogy is a bit vacuous, DDPMs are capable of complex tasks traditionally ascribed to the hippocampus. A striking example is the recent work from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11495">Harvey et al. 2022</a>, who showed that you could train a DDPM to generate hour-long videos. They took videos of a car driving in a virtual environment, and let the DDPM learn conditional generation, for example predicting the next frame in a sequence from the previous 4. By repeating this process with different temporal horizons, the model could generate hour-long videos of a car driving through the town, starting from a random location hallucinated by unconditional sampling (<a href="https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/2022/05/20/flexible-diffusion-modeling-of-long-videos/">see samples here</a>).</p>

From Harvey et al. (2022)</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s really quite striking that this simple model learned to generate complex sequences from scratch. In fact, it’s possible to map back hallucinated sequences to locations within the virtual town where the sequence was generated, and in most cases, the sequences are spatially coherent. Occasionally, the denoiser gets confused and warps to a different part of the map, relying on landmarks to do its thing. I think it’s really interesting how the generative task learned by the DDPM coaxes it to memorize and navigate through an environment, and how this could relate to the hippocampus’ role in navigation and memory.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">As separate objects of study</h3>



<p>I hope to have convinced you that DDPMs are sufficiently analogous to the brain to advance the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03718">neuroAI research programme</a>. However, if it turns out, after careful study, that these machines are mechanistically quite different than the brain (Marr’s level 3), they might still contain some insights about the brain’s goals and potential algorithmic solutions (Marr’s levels 1 and 2). I think that neuroAI and AI itself would benefit from studying how DDPMs work and what they’re capable of. There are some really interesting potential insights into human visual cognition lurking inside these models.</p>

From <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SlxSY2UZQT">Baranchuk et al. (2022)</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For example, I’ve mentioned previously that DDPMs are useful for unsupervised segmentation. As part of their objective to model the distribution of natural images, they perform what appears to be implicit, approximate segmentation, propagating information about object relationships across long distances, all in the service of generating spatially coherent images. This opens up a number of follow-up questions, for example, are DDPMs susceptible to foreground/background illusions, like Kanisza squares? Can they solve Mooney images? More generally, do they follow Gestalt rules? We can take <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/5zf4s/">recent criticisms of feedforward CNNs as models of vision</a> as compendia of interesting phenomena that should be investigated in DDPMs.</p>



<p>Of key importance in these investigations is carefully controlling the natural image dataset DDPMs are trained on. ImageNet is not representative of what’s ecologically relevant to primates: it has too many dogs and not enough faces and body parts. Using ImageNet might be acceptable when the task is just a means to an end (e.g. learning good general-purpose features in a self-supervised manner), but not when the task is learning the manifold of images. We should carefully comparatively study DDPM behaviour trained on ImageNet or LAION vs. ecologically motivated datasets, e.g. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2011417118">EcoSet</a> and <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/opmi/article/doi/10.1162/opmi_a_00039/97495/SAYCam-A-Large-Longitudinal-Audiovisual-Dataset">SAYCam</a>.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>DDPMs are a class of conditional generative models that have found widespread use in generating images, sounds and time series. They strike a nice balance between complexity of implementation, flexibility, ease of sampling and evaluation. They may be useful in neuroscience where we need to generate fake data – for semi-supervised learning or for decoding. However, there’s a wider and more speculative horizon of possible links to neuroscience: hierarchical Bayesian models and content-addressable memories. It’ll be really interesting to break these models apart and figure out how they really work.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/green-infrastructure-inequity">Many plans for green infrastructure risk leaving vulnerable people out</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve noticed more lush medians and plant-covered roofs in cities, it’s not your imagination.</p>



<p>Incorporating more natural elements in urban landscapes is a growing management solution for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">the planet’s increasing climate hazards</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). Rain gardens, green roofs and landscaped drainage ditches are all examples of what’s known as green infrastructure, and are used to manage stormwater and mitigate risks like flooding and extreme heat. These strategies sometimes double as a community resource, such as a recreational space.</p>





<p>But a major problem with green infrastructure is that the planning processes for the projects often fail to consider equity and inclusion, says Timon McPhearson, an urban ecologist and director of the Urban Systems Lab in New York City, which researches how to build more equitable, resilient and sustainable cities. Without an eye on equity, plans might exclude those most vulnerable to climate disasters, which typically include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-united-nations-ipcc-report-people-nature">low-income communities or minority groups</a> (<em>SN: 2/28/22</em>).</p>



<p>There has been talk of fostering equity and inclusion in urban planning for some time, McPhearson says, but he wanted to know if there had been any follow-through. After analyzing 122 formal plans from 20 major U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Detroit and Sacramento, he and colleagues found that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204622002407#f0010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most government-affiliated green infrastructure plans are falling short</a>. The researchers focused on plans produced or directly supervised by city governments, as non-profit organizations tend to be more inclusive, the study says.</p>



<p>Over 90 percent of plans didn’t use inclusive processes to design or implement green infrastructure projects, meaning communities targeted for upgrades often didn’t have a chance to weigh in with their needs throughout the process. What’s more, only 10 percent of plans identified causes of inequality and vulnerability in their communities. That matters because without acknowledging the roots of injustices, planners are unable to potentially address them in future projects. And only around 13 percent of plans even defined equity or justice, the researchers report in the January <em>Landscape and Urban Planning</em>.</p>



<p>Such inadequate plans can perpetuate existing inequalities that are part of an “ongoing legacy of historically racist policies,” McPhearson says, including <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited access to heat- and pollution-relieving green spaces</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479721006149?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proper stormwater management</a>.</p>



<p>“We have an opportunity with green infrastructure to invest in a way that can help solve multiple urban problems,” McPhearson says. “But only if we focus it in the places where there is the most need.”</p>



<p>One reason behind poor urban planning practices is a lack of recognition that infrastructure can be harmful, says Yvette Lopez-Ledesma, the senior director for community-led conservation at The Wilderness Society in Los Angeles, who wasn’t involved in the study. For instance, when cities build stormwater channels but not bridges, locals are left without a way to safely cross. City planners also often lack the training and education to implement more inclusive methods.</p>



<p>But there’s hope. The researchers identified three areas that need more work. First, city planners need to clearly define equity and justice in planning documents to help guide their work. They also need to change planning practices to focus on inclusion by keeping communities informed and supporting their participation throughout the planning, decision-making and implementation processes. And plans need to address current and potential causes of inequality: For example, acknowledging <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/immigrants-pave-way-gentrification-black-neighborhoods">sources of gentrification</a> and identifying <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508036/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how green infrastructure could contribute to gentrification</a> further if officials aren’t careful (<em>SN: 4/18/19</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“If equity isn&#8217;t centered in your plans, then inequity is,” Lopez-Ledesma says. “You could be doing more harm.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prioritize-family-self-pandemic">We prioritize family over self, and that has real-world implications</a></h4>

              
                <p>A focus on family might be the key to personal well-being.</p>



<p>Surveys in the social sciences, such as those measuring happiness or health, tend to focus on the smallest unit: the individual. But two new studies, each surveying over 10,000 people worldwide, show that primary unit of analysis may need scaling up. One study suggests that people adhere to public health guidelines less to protect themselves than their loved ones. And the other study provides an explanation for why that may be the case: People the world over prioritize family happiness over their own.</p>





<p>Neither research team defined the term “family,” instead allowing respondents to interpret the term as they saw fit. As such, the results suggest that the exact nature of family, whether nuclear, blood-related or extended, does not matter.</p>



<p>The findings have important implications for society, says Karen Bogenschneider, a family policy expert at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was not involved with either study. That’s because policy makers occasionally rely on research findings to develop programs such as those aimed at reducing substance abuse or inequality. When researchers frame societal issues in terms of the individual or community, so too do policy makers. And those programs may be less effective as a result.</p>



<p>For instance, several studies in the past couple decades have shown that including family members in addiction treatment programs <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1533256X.2020.1870287" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowers the addict’s risk of relapse and improves family relationships</a>.</p>



<p>Moreover, these studies challenge the assumption that individualism has turned <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-catholic-church-may-have-helped-spark-western-individualism">the self into the most important unit of survival</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/19</em>).</p>



<h4>Family bonds drove individuals to adopt pandemic-related health behaviors</h4>



<p>The idea that policy makers can target family to change behavior comes as no surprise to Martha Newson, an anthropologist at Kent University in England. For years, Newson has studied <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-studies-explore-why-ordinary-people-turn-terrorist">a concept known as fusion</a>, where an individual becomes so enmeshed in a larger social unit that she or he is willing to sacrifice personal well-being, or even survival, for the group (<em>SN: 6/23/16</em>).</p>



<p>At the onset of the pandemic, Newson and her team began studying how social fusion might be influencing behavior around the world during the pandemic. </p>





<p>From March to May 2020, over 13,000 participants from 122 countries were shown a sequence of five pictures, each with two circles, one for the self and the other for a given group such as family, country or all of humankind. In the first picture, the circles are far apart, but in subsequent pictures they grow closer and closer together until they fully overlap. Participants had to select one of the five pictures to indicate their level of fusion with the group. A participant had to select the fully overlapping circles to be considered fused to the group.</p>



<p>Participants also filled out scales to indicate how much they had performed a given public health action, such as social distancing or masking, in the previous week.</p>



<p>Participants who were fused to family were overrepresented among those reporting <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add3715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong adherence to public health guidelines</a>, Newson and colleagues reported January 13 in <em>Science Advances. </em>For instance, despite representing roughly a quarter of the participant pool, participants with strong family bonds constituted three-quarters of those who reported following social distancing guidelines. And almost half of participants with strong family bonds reported frequent handwashing compared with about one-third of participants with weaker family bonds.</p>



<p>Humans evolved in small-scale societies, Newson says. “When we have crises … these smaller units remain very important.”</p>



<h4>On average, people value family happiness more than their own</h4>



<p>Meanwhile, another group of researchers had begun to question the widely accepted belief that many happy individuals sum up to a happy society. That idea originated in the West, and has often been treated as universal, says Kuba Krys, a cross-cultural psychologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.</p>



<p>But research over the years has indicated that non-Westerners may not value personal happiness as much as people in the West. For instance, outside the West, people tend to see <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness as more interdependent</a>, or grounded in harmony and balance with others, than independent, or grounded in the self<em>.</em></p>



<p>If happiness exists at least partially outside the individual, then Krys and his team wondered what unit researchers should study. They looked to family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team had roughly 13,000 participants from 49 countries indicate how much the perfect or ideal person would agree with statements in two commonly used surveys of well-being. Statements appeared both in the standard “I” framing and in a new family framing. For instance, participants reflected on how the ideal person would respond to both the statements, “In most ways, my life is close to ideal” and “In most ways, the life of my family is close to ideal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly half of the participants valued family well-being over personal well-being, while less than a third preferred their own happiness, the team reports in an upcoming paper in the <em>Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology</em>. Moreover, participants in even the most individualistic countries, including the United States, valued family, on average, more than self.</p>

<h3>Family first</h3>



<p>Cultural psychologists asked roughly 13,000 people from 49 countries to reflect on their ideal happiness. On average, people worldwide idealized family happiness over personal happiness, the team found. This pattern held true even in the individualistic United States, where almost half of the 446 total participants prioritized family over self.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The word “family” has become associated with conservativism, Krys says. But family remains central to people’s lives, regardless of geography or political affiliation. “The shape of family has changed but family as an idea, as a basic unit, has not changed,” he says. “I would advise progressives … not to be afraid of touching on family topics.”</p>



<p>Bogenschneider’s research backs up this point. In a study of more than 200 state legislators, she and colleagues found that while abortion and same-sex marriage remain highly polarized, policy makers tend to view other family issues, such as those involving domestic violence, juvenile crime or teen pregnancy, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32969679/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as largely bipartisan</a>.</p>



<p>This suggests that issues that aren’t typically centered around family, such as climate change or inequality, could be framed in terms of family to garner wider support, Bogenschneider says. Researchers who are seeking to translate their findings into policy and advocates who are advancing particular causes could, she adds, “elevate policy makers’ interest in those issues by focusing on families and family contributions.”</p>

<p>Anna Abalkina noticed something odd about a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcop.22664">psychology paper</a> on the “modern problems of youth extremism”: The corresponding author was affiliated with a university in Russia, but his email address had a domain name from India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The unusual domain name was part of a pattern Abalkina, of the Freie Universität Berlin, noticed in hundreds of papers that seemed to have been produced by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">paper</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/09/physics-publisher-retracting-nearly-500-likely-paper-mill-papers/">mills</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six of those papers, including the one on youth extremism, had been published in the <em>Journal of Community Psychology</em>, a Wiley title. Dorothy Bishop, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, conducted a detailed review of the six articles, along with the published referee reports and editorial correspondence on Publons, to see if anything else about them was amiss.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126509"></span>



<p>Bishop and Abalkina, who partners with us on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journals Checker</a><em>, </em>published their findings in a PsyAviv <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/2yf8z/">preprint</a> posted Sept. 5, 2022.</p>



<p>The six papers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcop.22664">were</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcop.22533">published</a> in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22597">2021</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22707">2022</a> and have received a total of five citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Topics included <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcop.22684">the psychology of human beings within urban environments</a>, and ways people <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22683">might exploit public opinion to manage their social lives</a>.</p>



<p>Besides the fishy email domains, other red flags in the articles included a disorganized structure that made it hard to follow the experiments described, and no attention to ethical review even of experiments involving human subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All six papers had serious flaws; we judged that none would be published if proper peer review and editorial scrutiny had taken place,” Abalkina and Bishop write.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Abalkina and Bishop submitted their preprint to the <em>Journal of Community Psychology</em> prior to posting it to PsyArxiv, as what they called a “stress test” to determine if their work would also be posted with little oversight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the contrary, they received a desk rejection from Michael B. Blank, the journal’s editor in chief. Blank, of the University of Pennsylvania, justified the rejection, in an email obtained by <em>Retraction Watch</em>, with a single sentence: “This is a weak paper based on cursory review of six publications.”</p>



<p>Three days after the preprint was posted, Michael Streeter, Wiley’s Director for Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics, wrote to Abalkina and Bishop to introduce himself and acknowledge the issues they raised. He promised a full investigation, adding: “We are grateful for your ongoing commitment to uphold the integrity of the scholarly record.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The journal retracted all six articles on January 28, citing Abalkina and Bishop’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notices are identical, except for inserting the different online publication dates of the various articles. A representative notice stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The above article published online on May 15, 2021 in Wiley Online Library (<a href="http://wileyonlinelibrary.com/">wileyonlinelibrary.com</a>), has been retracted by agreement between the Editor, Michael Blank, and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. Following publication, concerns were raised by a third party.1 Further investigation by the publisher revealed concerns about authorship and peer review. The Editor has determined that the article does not meet the required scholarly standards of the journal, and has therefore taken the decision to retract the article. The authors have been informed of this decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Writing to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, Bishop noted that Wiley’s retraction in January – based on information provided in September &#8212; was speedy: “this is a relatively prompt response compared to what we often see.”</p>



<p>She added, however, that this prompt redress does not resolve the question of how fraudulent papers appeared in the journal in the first place. She credited open peer review with enabling her and Abalkina to prove the fraud, as they could identify suspicious email addresses and also examine the published records of peer review to identify issues.</p>



<p>Blank and Streeter have not replied to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We wondered how Wiley informed the authors of the decision to retract, given that none of their email addresses worked when we attempted to contact them, and many author’s identities appear to be dubious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As part of our retraction process, which is aligned with COPE guidelines, we attempted to reach all corresponding and co-authors to communicate the retraction decision. Emails were sent on December 23, 2022 to email addresses in our submission system for the journal. We did not receive a reply from any of the authors that we contacted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The information that we found online for the authors does not match what is published in the articles. Sometimes the discrepancies are minor, such as a different middle initial. In other cases, we could not find any online presence for the authors at all.</p>

<h4>On the rise</h4>



<p><em>A thinning, accelerating ice stream in Greenland’s interior could contribute nearly 16 millimeters to global sea level rise by 2100, more than six times as much as previously thought, <strong>Nikk Ogasa</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-hinterlands-leaking-ice">Greenland is hemorrhaging ice</a>” (</em>SN: 12/17/22 &amp; 12/31/22, p. 7<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Leslie Hruby </strong>wondered how local sea levels will be affected as an ice sheet melts and the land underneath rebounds.</p>



<p>“The immense weight of the ice can depress the Earth’s crust, just like a heavy object placed on a soft mattress,” <strong>Ogasa</strong> says. When the ice retreats, the unburdened ground rises back up. What’s more, as the ice loses mass, its gravitational pull on the nearby ocean also wanes. When polar ice retreats, these changes can compound to lower the local sea level but raise the sea level farther off. “Projections indicate that sea level rise will be most severe along the coastal areas farthest from the polar regions, such as South and Southeast Asia,” <strong>Ogasa</strong> says. “These regions are home to large, low-income populations who bear the least responsibility for climate change, but they will face the worst of it.”</p>





<h4>Keeping ethics in mind</h4>



<p><em>In the lab, brain implants can translate internal speech into external signals, technology that could help people who are unable to speak or type, <strong>Laura Sanders</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-reads-peoples-thoughts">Brain implants ‘read’ thoughts</a>” (</em>SN: 12/17/22 &amp; 12/31/22, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>J Morley</strong> rejoiced that the technology might one day help people but worried about what it means for privacy.</p>



<p><strong>Morley</strong> raises a common concern. In 2020, <em>Science News</em> asked readers about their views on brain technology that can read — and perhaps influence — brain activity. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics">Concerns about privacy</a> rose to the top of the list (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 24</em>).</p>





<p><strong>Sanders</strong> says many of the scientists she spoke to in her reporting emphasized the flip side. “They feel a moral imperative to move research forward so that they can help people by restoring the ability to communicate, for instance, or relieving symptoms of a distressing mental illness,” she says. “It’s a complex area that defies simple black-and-white thinking; there is room here for lots of different perspectives and priorities.”</p>

<h3>Back to life</h3>



<p>A species of clam called <em>Cymatioa cooki </em>(shown below) that scientists thought had been extinct for about 30,000 years was found alive off the coast of California, <strong>Allison Gasparini</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clam-presumed-extinct-found-alive">Clam discovery resurrects a long-dead species</a>” (<em>SN: 12/17/22 &amp; 12/31/22, p. 4</em>). “This is what I love about science,” Facebook user<strong> Debra Chugg </strong>wrote. “There’s always the ‘unexpected’ out there that can rewrite our learning. [Every day], there’s the possibility of yet another wonderful discovery.”</p>

<h4>Just wondering</h4>



<p>Science News <em>readers often ask questions that are unrelated to our journalism but are fascinating nonetheless. We’re indulging our nerdy impulses to try to answer those questions.</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Steve Ostrom</strong> asked if the James Webb Space Telescope needs to be pointed in a particular direction to look for the first generation of stars after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>“To get a glimpse of the first stars, JWST needs a clear view beyond our galaxy, so it must not be pointed at the Milky Way’s center or at any impenetrable walls of dust in our galaxy,” says associate news editor <strong>Christopher Crockett</strong>, who has a Ph.D. in astronomy. “But the direction itself doesn’t matter.”</p>



<p>This is because the Big Bang happened everywhere all at once, <strong>Crockett</strong> says. “It is less of a place in space and more of an event imprinted everywhere if we look far enough out.”</p>



<p>Think of it this way: Roughly 13 billion years ago, a first generation of stars was coming to life all around Earth’s current location in space. Back then, if someone stood where we are now, they might have seen brand-new stars forming in all directions. Fast forward to the present, and it’s kind of the same idea, <strong>Crockett</strong> says. Look in one direction with JWST, and you might see a bunch of first- generation stars that were once relatively close to Earth’s current location. Turn the telescope around, and you might see another bunch of first-gen stars.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean that the first stars were born everywhere at the exact same moment, <strong>Crockett</strong> says. The first stars were born over millions of years due to local variations in things like the density and temperature of hydrogen clouds. It was “an epoch when conditions throughout the universe were finally right to allow hydrogen clouds to collapse and ignite fusion for the first time.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/so-much-is-lost-when-fossil-treasures-go-private">So much is lost when fossil treasures go private</a></h4>

              
                <p>I don’t remember exactly which dinosaurs I saw when I first visited Chicago’s Field Museum as a child, but I’ll never forget the thrill of seeing the gigantic skeletons striding forth out of the past. Since then, I’ve seen many other fossilized dinos at many other museums, and the thrill remains the same.</p>



<p>This issue’s cover story investigates <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sale-t-rex-fossil-big-loss-science-dinosaur">the soaring popularity of museum-quality dinosaur fossils as collectibles</a>, with highbrow auction houses like Christie’s selling off <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> skeletons as if they’re pieces of art. As earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling reports, Stan the <em>T. rex</em>, a skeleton discovered on private land in South Dakota, sold for an eye-popping $31.8 million in 2020, and a <em>T. rex</em> skull went for $6.1 million last December.</p>





<p>Stan disappeared after it was auctioned off. Last year, it was revealed that the United Arab Emirates is the owner and intends to place Stan in a new natural history museum. The fossil trade is nothing new, but most museums can’t compete at these price points. And though many countries regulate fossil sales, loopholes abound.</p>



<p>With each fossil that disappears from public view, science — and the public — loses. Scientists fear that new finds could go straight to private owners without being properly studied. With so few <em>T. rex</em> fossils unearthed, each specimen holds tremendous scientific value.</p>



<p>Fortunately for us dinophiles, museums do have <em>T. rex</em> skeletons on display and in their collections. The Field Museum houses Sue, whose $8.36 million purchase in 1997 was underwritten by corporations and academic institutions. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., is home to a <em>T. rex</em> discovered in Montana in 1988. Because the fossil was found on federal land, it avoided the auction block and now chomps on an unlucky <em>Triceratops</em> in the museum’s recently renovated fossil hall.</p>



<p>In this issue, we also explore another source of frustration in science: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3121623">Our limited understanding of depression</a>. The often-debilitating disorder affects millions of people worldwide. But despite decades of effort, scientists still can’t describe how it works or what causes it. The familiar “chemical imbalance” theory doesn’t fully capture what’s going on in the brain, let alone the influence of external factors like gender, race and culture. How an individual experiences depression also depends on where they live and how they experience the world around them.</p>



<p>Researchers are seeking not only a better grasp on what’s happening inside the brain, but also how internal and external factors interact. One barrier to moving the science forward is that different researchers rely on different definitions of depression and different methods of assessing whether a person is depressed. As neuroscience and senior writer Laura Sanders notes, it’s like trying to figure out the science of temperature without a thermometer. </p>



<p>It’s an extraordinary challenge, and one that researchers may not solve in their lifetimes. But I’m grateful that they’re trying to discover the roots of a malady that plagues so many.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-animal-collaboration-dolphins-brazil">Here are 3 people-animal collaborations besides dolphins and Brazilians</a></h4>

              
                <p>We’ve all heard that dogs are a man’s best friend, but our canine companions don’t make up the entirety of humankind’s friend circle. Humans have cooperated with wild animals throughout our evolutionary history, forming reciprocally beneficial relationships known to biologists as mutualisms.</p>



<p>One particularly piscine partnership that made headlines recently can be found in Brazil, where fishers catch nets full of fish with the aid of the local bottlenosed dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus gephyreus</em>). </p>



<p>This team-up started over a century ago, probably when fishers first noticed that the presence of dolphins was a clue that fish were hiding in the murky water, says Mauricio Cantor, a behavioral ecologist at Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute in Newport.</p>





<p>“The dolphins are really good at detecting fish and herding them toward the coast,” he says, “and the fishers are really good at trapping the fish with their net.” Once the fish are mostly secured in the net, the dolphins are sure to snag a few for themselves.</p>



<p>In a study published January 30 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, Cantor and colleagues used long-term data to show that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207739120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dolphins and fishers respond to cues from the other</a>, and without experienced partners who know the right dance steps, the routine falls apart. “This is a really remarkable and impressive study,” says Pat Shipman, an anthropologist at Penn State University who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>This fishing partnership is an important part of the cultural identity of both the fishers and the dolphins, but Cantor and his colleagues’ work shows that <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the practice is in decline</a>. And among human-animal partnerships, it’s not alone. “Most of the historical cases are declining or already gone,” Cantor says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given their rarity and charm, let’s take a look at some of the other known examples of human-animal cooperation.</p>



<h4>People used to team up with orcas to hunt whales in southeastern Australia</h4>



<p>The bottlenosed isn’t the only dolphin that humans have formed beneficial arrangements with. In the 1800s, several hunters began working with a pod of orcas (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) to catch large whales. At Twofold Bay in southeastern Australia, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279302786992694#:~:text=These%20sources%20indicate%20that%20cooperative,beyond%20the%20acquisition%20of%20food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some orcas would find and harass a whale to tire it out, while others swam to alert whaling crews</a> (made up of Aboriginal Australians and Scottish immigrants) that they’d found prey.</p>





<p>Once the whalers arrived and harpooned the whale, they let the orcas eat the tongue — a delicacy in the killer whale culinary world — before taking the rest for themselves.</p>



<p>While the dolphins and fishers in Brazil were chasing the same prey — schools of migratory mullet (<em>Mugil liza</em>) — the orcas and whalers were mostly after different things. The key similarity, Cantor says, is that there’s enough prey for everyone, so that no competition arises to spoil the partnership.</p>



<p>This relationship ultimately ended when some settlers killed two orcas, which drove the cooperative pod away from the bay, seemingly never to hunt with humans again.</p>



<h4>These birds guide people to honey in Africa</h4>



<p>Sometimes, a name says it all. Such is the case for the greater honeyguide (<em>Indicator indicator</em>), which has been labeled in both English and Latin based on its most famous trait. These birds live in sub-Saharan Africa, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-birds-communicate-collaborate">cooperate with local honey hunters</a> to gain access to succulent beeswax (<em>SN: 7/21/16</em>).</p>



<p>Birds, like humans, don’t like to be stung by bees, so a honeyguide that’s hankering for beeswax will chirp at a person to signal that they should follow. The <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(22)01398-7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeyguide then leads the hunters to a bee nest</a> and lets them do the dirty work of harvesting it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1440" height="810" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline.jpg" alt="A greater honeyguide, a small bird with a tan body, dark brown wings and head, and a red beak, looks to the right" class="wp-image-3121599" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline.jpg 1440w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-1030x580.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020323_di_human-animal-collabs_inline-1380x776.jpg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3121599">In search of beeswax, the greater honeyguide (<em>Indicator indicator</em>) helps humans in Africa locate bee nests full of honey.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121599">Michael Heyns/Wikimedia Commons (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:CC-BY-SA-4.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like with orcas, honeyguides and humans are after different parts of the prize: Humans want the honey, while the birds want the wax. Honeyguides are so helpful for finding bee nests that the Borana people of East Africa blow a special whistle called a “fuulido<em>”</em> to summon them when it’s time for a honey hunt.</p>



<p>Similar to the dolphins in Brazil, the relationship with honeyguides is an important part of many African cultures. Legend even has it that a scorned honeyguide, if denied beeswax on prior hunts, will lead the hunters not to delicious honey but instead into the jaws of a dangerous predator, like a lion.</p>



<h4>Wolves and people were once on the same side when hunting big game</h4>



<p>To see the most extreme outcome of human-animal partnership, take a look at 39 percent of the country’s beds, couches and backyards. That’s about how many households in the United States own a dog. But it turns out a canine doesn’t have to be domesticated to get along with humans; Indigenous stories from peoples in North America describe cooperating with gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) to hunt big game like elk and mammoths.</p>



<p>The wolves would run down the prey until it tired, and humans would make the kill once they caught up. Because these prey items were so massive (like the large schools of mullet), it didn’t matter that <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-ethnobiology/volume-35/issue-2/etbi-35-02-262-285.1/Relationships-Between-Indigenous-American-Peoples-and-Wolves-1--Wolves/10.2993/etbi-35-02-262-285.1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans and wolves were after the same thing</a> — there was plenty to go around.</p>



<p>Though this furry friendship doesn’t exist anymore, wolves are still important in many Indigenous cultures. Some even still continue the practice of leaving some meat for the wolves after a hunt.</p>



<p>Though human-animal partnerships are rare and on the decline, they “give us an illustration of how positive our human interactions can be with nature,” Cantor says.</p>



<p>For Shipman, the urge to engage with other animals is a defining trait of humanity. “It’s in some ways as fundamental to humans,” she says, “as being bipedal.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/plos-price-transparency-update-2021/">PLOS Price Transparency Update 2021</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework 2021</h2>



<p><br>We encourage researchers to give transparent insight into their work for the benefit of community understanding and assessment and we want to give you the same insight into ours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the ways we do this is through the Plan S <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a>. PLOS has participated in the framework since its pilot phase in 2020<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> and we&rsquo;re pleased to once again <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">share our reporting</a> here to give our community insight into how our publication fees are used to support journal activities and operational costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Price Transparency data 2021</strong></p>



<p>Publishers completing the framework divide their Article Processing Charge (APC), per journal, into eight different services (you can find a description of these services in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/our-commitment-to-price-transparency/">last year&rsquo;s post</a>). Data for the framework is reported at the end of the following year meaning the data in the table below reflects our publication fee breakdown for the year 2021 based on the APC for a Research Article in each journal. You can find our full report from the framework in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BqQr6mGb8jedOX_ozavNT6IrfcWND1Kn/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=116331873531812821923&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Isn&rsquo;t PLOS moving beyond the APC?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! We recognize APCs are an imperfect solution for truly equitable Open Access opportunities and we&rsquo;ve been working with institutions to establish new models of Open Access support. Each of our journals offers APC-alternative models that can significantly reduce or entirely eliminate APCs for authors. In time, we believe we can entirely eliminate APCs &mdash; but there is more work ahead of us yet. By the close of 2021, PLOS had signed partnerships with 93 institutions and we&rsquo;re continuing to make this a priority. To give you a peek at our most recent data, those <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">partnerships nearly doubled in 2022</a> to include 181 institutions across 26 countries. We hope future iterations of the framework will enable us to represent this data alongside APCs. In the meantime, keep an eye on our blog for more announcements and updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>PLOS Computational Biology</td><td>PLOS Genetics</td><td>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</td><td>PLOS Pathogens</td><td>PLOS Biology</td><td>PLOS Medicine</td><td>PLOS ONE</td></tr><tr><td>2021 APC price</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$2,420</td><td>$2,575</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$1,749</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for journal and community development</td><td>10%</td><td>12%</td><td>10%</td><td>11%</td><td>24%</td><td>23%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price from submission to first decision</td><td>12%</td><td>13%</td><td>10%</td><td>12%</td><td>26%</td><td>24%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for peer review management</td><td>13%</td><td>13%</td><td>10%</td><td>14%</td><td>20%</td><td>17%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services from acceptance to publication</td><td>21%</td><td>19%</td><td>18%</td><td>21%</td><td>9%</td><td>11%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services after publication</td><td>8%</td><td>7%</td><td>6%</td><td>8%</td><td>3%</td><td>4%</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for platform development</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>15%</td><td>8%</td><td>2%</td><td>7%</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for sales &amp; marketing to customers or of articles</td><td>18%</td><td>18%</td><td>21%</td><td>15%</td><td>13%</td><td>15%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for author and customer support</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td><td>10%</td><td>2%</td><td>3%</td><td>8%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Differences in journal editorial structures and services drive variance in the percentages of the APC value allocated to each category. For PLOS, this difference is most apparent in&nbsp; <em>PLOS Biology</em>, <em>PLOS Medicine,</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em> which rely on in-house editorial teams. More detail on the operational differences of PLOS&rsquo; editorial models can be found in our original<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/"> transparency post</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may also remember 2021 as the year <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">PLOS launched new journals</a><em>. </em>Publication fee breakdown for those journals will be provided in the following year&rsquo;s report to reflect their first full year of publishing activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Comparisons to our 2020 data</strong></p>



<p>This year, we&rsquo;ve made adjustments to more accurately distribute costs previously reported in the &lsquo;Platform development&rsquo; category. Maintaining digital services that support peer review and article assessment, as well as marketing have been allocated accordingly. (The &ldquo;Platform Development&rdquo; category was introduced to the framework last year.) We&rsquo;ve also reported upper and lower bounds of institutional membership costs for our Community Action Publishing (CAP) model<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup>. CAP is a collective-action model for <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine </em>which equitably distributes the cost of highly selective publishing based on <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">several factors</a> to institutional members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there is also a natural fluctuation in the allocation of costs over time to provide further resources to specific areas of journal development. For <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em> for example, our shift to CAP required slightly higher spend to set up &lsquo;sales and marketing&rsquo; infrastructure that will enable us to expand institutional partnerships that eliminate author fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Investing in our communities</strong></p>



<p>As a nonprofit organization, our organizational activities are developed with the sole purpose of meeting the needs of researchers and reinvesting in the scholarly community in ways that support and further our <a href="https://plos.org/about/">mission</a>.</p>



<p>Many of those activities go beyond the breakdown you see here. Our highly regarded publishing ethics team works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards across the scholarly community, as well as developing policies and processes to further research integrity at our journals. We aim to help researchers increase the visibility and impact of their work by connecting authors to publication opportunities and career-building tools like our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/">Peer Review</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/">Writing Centers</a>, and through dedicated media promotion of their published articles. Staff across the organization are also passionately involved in researching, developing and implementing <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science practices</a> at scale, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">partnering with organizations</a> around the world to better understand researchers&rsquo; needs in order to make participation in the research ecosystem more transparent, efficient, and fair across all demographics, geographies, and disciplines.</p>



<p>For more information about our finances, PLOS provides an annual update on our <a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/">financial overview page</a>. We&rsquo;ve also shared our pricing information for our emerging business models in our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/faqs/">FAQs</a>. And of course, we&rsquo;ll always share updates on our work and important milestones like this one through our blogs network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-muscles-fold-mimosa-leaf">How plant ‘muscles’ fold up a mimosa leaf fast</a></h4>

              
                <p>Call them plant motors. Or plant muscles. Tiny bulges of specialized cells in a mimosa plant can fold its feathery leaflets together in seconds, then relax — and do it again.</p>



<p>A new look at these bulges on the <em>Mimosa pudica</em> plant has revealed more details of how a leaf manages its unusually fast folding, says biomechanist David Sleboda of the University of California, Irvine. “I think that these particular organs are really cool because their motion is reversible,” he says. “[W]hen people see plant motion that is reversible, it feels much more similar to animal motion.”</p>





<p>Scientists have already worked out the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.12.013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic chemistry that drives a little mimosa motor</a>, or pulvinus, he and colleagues write in a paper slated for the Feb. 6<em>&nbsp;Current Biology</em>. When a deer hoof or something else scary jostles a leaf, potassium and some other ions shift from one part of a pulvinus toward another. Water follows the swoosh of ions. Cells that lose water deflate and sag while those on the other side bloat. Distortions in multiple pulvini make the halves of a feathery leaf fold toward each other, like an invisible hand gently closing a book.</p>

<p>Instead of studying chemistry, Sleboda and colleagues looked at microscopic structural details in pulvinus cells that help create such useful distortions, he reported January 7 at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in Austin, Texas. One feature that makes plant-muscle cells bloat more efficiently is reinforcement with microscopic fibrils. They work like corsets, keeping cells from bulging out in all directions. Instead, the corset directs much of the swelling along the axis that will fold up the leaf halves.</p>



<p>Also, pulvinus cells that need to bulge fast have what look like wrinkles of easily expandable tissue for inrushing water, plus special highly porous zones called pit fields. The pits look as if water could sluice through easily in a tickled-leaf emergency. Cell arrangement itself looks specialized for expanding and shrinking. A pulvinus cross section reveals a pattern “like the bellows of a concertina,” Sleboda said.</p>

<p>The widespread <em>M. pudica</em>, or sensitive plant, is one of the better-known leaf flexors. Yet clusters of other plants in the same family, the legumes, also move their leaves, says botanist Thainara Policarpo Mendes of Universidade Estadual Paulista in Botucatu, Brazil. Some relatives close fast like <em>M. pudica</em>, but many are slower. What she also thinks about, though, is why leaves close at all. People have proposed a variety of advantages: discouraging animals from grazing on a plant that suddenly looks more sticklike, or even helping a plant lose less heat on very cold nights. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sleboda too can reel off proposed hypotheses but remains skeptical of all of them. “There’s not a ton of research,” he says. That, however, is fine with him. “My favorite thing about sensitive plants’ leaf closing,” he says, “is that we don’t know why they do it.”</p>

<p><strong>Early man in America takes a step backward</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/early-man-america-takes-step-backward"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 27, 1973 </p>



<p>“Early Americans lived among and hunted mammoth, camel, extinct horse and bison as far back as 15,000&nbsp;years. Now there is mounting evidence for a second breakthrough that will push the history of man in America back to 30,000 years — and possibly further.”</p>



<h4>Update<a id="_msocom_1"></a></h4>



<p>The question of when humans first set foot in the Americas is still hotly debated. Recent fossil and archaeological evidence suggests the first inhabitants arrived tens of thousands of years ago. For instance, humanlike <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">footprints in New Mexico date to about 20,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/21, p. 12</em>). And stone tools found in a cave <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">hint that humans resided in Mexico roughly 30,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 16</em>). Some archaeologists argue that stones caked with mastodon bone residue that were found in California were tools used by humans or their close relatives around 130,000&nbsp;years ago, although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stones-mastodon-bones-debate-america-first-settlers">that claim remains controversial</a> (<em>SN Online: 12/4/20</em>). Pinning down the timeline of human settlement could reveal how people spread across North and South America.</p>
