<p>Following an investigation into possible paper mill activities, the journal <em>Cureus</em> has barred a doctor in Pakistan from publishing more papers &#8220;out of an abundance of caution,&#8221; Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The journal investigated Satish Kumar, an internist at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical College in Karachi, after a tipster accused him of selling authorship of scientific papers to scientists who did not participate in the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tipster, who wishes to remain anonymous to avoid backlash from the authors of these papers, sent <em>Cureus</em> WhatsApp messages from a group called &#8220;research Match Residency.&#8221; There, a user named ”SSS” sent paper titles and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Whatsapp-group-mentioning-payment-scaled.jpg">offered author slots on manuscripts</a>. Many of the articles were slated for publication in <em>Cureus</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128901"></span>



<p>The tipster also shared the WhatsApp messages with Retraction Watch, telling us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have known Dr. Satesh Kumar for a couple of years and previously had his contact information saved in my phone. Upon his online advertisements in various WhatsApp groups, I recognized the name already saved in my phone from our prior communication.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Graham Parker, director of Publishing and Customer Success at <em>Cureus</em>, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We conducted a thorough investigation and were unable to confirm these allegations. However, the circumstantial evidence presented to the journal was, out of an abundance of caution, enough to warrant the rejection of any in-progress article submissions that involved Dr. Kumar. Additionally, Dr. Kumar&#8217;s Cureus account was permanently suspended.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Several of the paper titles advertised in the WhatsApp group match papers in <em>Cureus</em>, according to screenshots and a video shared with Retraction Watch. Satish Kumar (spelled Satesh Kumar in two of the articles) is listed as an author on all of the papers, which include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/217975-cardio-oncology-managing-cardiovascular-complications-of-cancer-therapies#!/">Cardio-Oncology: Managing Cardiovascular Complications of Cancer Therapies</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/217920-insulin-resistance-and-coronary-artery-disease-untangling-the-web-of-endocrine-cardiac-connections#!/">Insulin Resistance and coronary Artery Disease: Untangling the Web of Endocrine-Cardiac Connections</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/220192-thyroid-and-its-ripple-effect-impact-on-cardiac-structure-function-and-outcomes#!/">Thyroid Dysfunction and its Ripple Effect: Impact on Cardiac Structure, Function, and Outcomes</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/215147-challenges-and-opportunities-in-developing-tailored-pain-management-strategies-for-liver-patients#!/">Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Tailored Pain Management Strategies for Liver Patients</a></li>
</ul>



<p>However, Parker stated that the journal did not find &#8220;irrefutable proof&#8221; authorship slots were &#8220;sold on any articles submitted to or published in Cureus.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All authors that were questioned stated they had no knowledge of any such activity and extensive working materials were produced showing the collaborative work by the authors. As a result, the journal found no basis for retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to the findings of the investigation, Kumar told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I certainly deny all allegations for which i have provided all the material and proof to Cureus and Mr parker in cureus. There is no single proof where they can prove i am included in any of such allegations. I have all materials and i am open to arrange and speak on call as well to give more explanation. I have already provided all materials to Mr Parker and [Cureus reviewer] Prof guistino Varassi. I am more than ready to provide an explanation and evidences to you as well considering, i am innocent and have no such involvement.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, Kumar refused to go on the record during a subsequent call with Retraction Watch.&nbsp;Later, he wrote by email: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I sent emails to journal that if they dont have anything proven, they should unban me, however i can&#8217;t force someone to do because they are the owner of their journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The tipster also accused Kumar of using AI to author at least a portion of six of his more recent papers, which the tipster checked using the app GPT Zero, a tool that has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10519776/">proven accurate</a> at flagging machine-generated medical text. Based on the abstracts of these papers, the use of AI varied from 65% to 97%.</p>



<p>On March 7, Parker wrote in an email to the tipster:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;d like to once again thank you for your dedication to scientific integrity and fairness. We have conducted a thorough review regarding potential use of generative AI tools in Satesh Kumar&#8217;s articles and are unable to make a conclusive determination. ZeroGPT, GPTZero and similar tools cannot be relied upon in this regard as they have been shown to produce many false positives (perhaps most famously indicating that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/">United States Constitution was written by AI</a>), but they also do not distinguish between generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) and proofreading tools such as Grammarly.</p>



<p>As a result, we do not intend to take any further action regarding these articles. However, Dr. Kumar&#8217;s account will remain permanently suspended out of an abundance of caution, as the journal no longer wishes to work with him in any capacity. Thanks again for your time and energy on this.</p>

The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin.

<p>Every research study involves numerous potential outcomes and conclusions, as researchers employ diverse analytical approaches when interpreting empirical data. Recognizing the variability in these methods, my colleagues from the University of Innsbruck, Stanford University, and Dartmouth College, along with myself, have established the Global Analytical Robustness Initiative.</p>

<p>The primary goal of this initiative is to enhance analytical standards within the behavioral and social sciences, thereby boosting the reliability and transparency of research outcomes. The team&rsquo;s plan is to have 100 studies examined by around 500 experts for analytical robustness and create an open database that makes transparent the correlation between the analytical paths taken in empirical work and the results presented in the research.</p>

<p>The project will enable researchers to identify and respond to the corresponding problems and challenges. On this basis, the Global Analytical Robustness Initiative aims to issue recommendations on how to increase analytical robustness and train scientists to use the most robust analytical methodologies. &ldquo;In this way, we hope to strengthen the reliability of future empirical results and, ultimately, foster trust in science.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-brain-menstrual-cycle-and-female-sex-hormones-acknowledging-sex-bias-in-neuroimaging-research">The brain, menstrual cycle and female sex hormones: acknowledging sex bias in neuroimaging research</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Disclaimer: WiNUK acknowledges that the menstrual cycle is not a gender-specific experience. Throughout this blog, people who experience the hormone changes of the menstrual cycle are referred to as the ‘female sex’ or ‘female’, and those who were assigned female at birth.</em></p>
<hr><h5>What is the menstrual cycle?</h5><p>The menstrual cycle is the ~28 day hormone cycle females have to regulate the shedding and build up of the uterus lining. The hormones that fluctuate are oestrogen, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. Fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone are the most prominent,  lasting for the majority of the cycle, with oestrogen peaking during the follicular phase until ovulation and progesterone increasing during the luteal phase as the lining builds, and dropping when the lining sheds. </p>
<blockquote>"Even in people without PMDD, peak progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle are associated with increases in negative mood"</blockquote><h5>How can these hormones affect the brain?</h5><p>As these changes are so long-lasting and distinct, with oestrogen levels rising 8-fold and progesterone levels 80-fold during the ~28 day cycle (1), it has been hypothesised that people who experience these hormone changes will have marked differences in brain function and behaviour during these times. Indeed, many  report emotional changes, increased irritability and decreased self-esteem during their cycle. Furthermore, people who take hormonal contraception may experience similar mood disturbances. But how do sex hormones have such a profound effect on our emotions? It is all down to the distribution of sex hormone receptors in the brain. Progesterone binds to receptors located in the amygdala, a brain region responsible for a range of emotional responses, such as anxiety, social understanding (interpreting social cues), and fear. Progesterone has been implicated in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that is associated with emotional dysregulation during the luteal phase (when progesterone peaks) (2). Even in people without PMDD, peak progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle are associated with increases in negative mood (3). Progesterone can easily cross the blood brain barrier and can even accumulate in brain tissue to beyond levels found in the blood. Moreover, progesterone also has a role in stress regulation. During periods of stress, it can be converted to cortisol, the primary stress hormone (4) maintaining the actions of the sympathetic nervous system (the branch of the nervous system responsible for staying in high alert during situations of prolonged stress). </p>

<p>Other areas of the brain have sex hormone receptors too. The hippocampus is rich in sex hormone receptors and is also highly plastic, meaning it can be structurally altered in response to stimuli such as hormones. Indeed, oestrogen has been found to modulate structural plasticity in the hippocampus (5), having important implications in learning and memory. The hippocampus is also responsible for long term memory storage which can have significant implications on emotion - such as how a fond childhood memory might make us happy and reminiscent, or a negative one fearful and anxious.</p>
<blockquote>"Only 0.5% of neuroimaging studies consider the effects of sex hormones and hormone transition phases on the brain"</blockquote>
<p>Studies on the hippocampus have shown conflicting responses to sex hormones; some suggest there is a significant increase in grey matter in this region during the peak oestrogen portion of the menstrual cycle (6, 7), while others find no such result and lean towards the effect of progesterone on cycle stage-dependent changes in hippocampal volume (3). </p>
<h5>The gap in research on female sex hormones and neuroimaging</h5><p>Unfortunately, the scarcity and vagueness of research on the effect of female sex hormones in the brain is in part due to the long-standing bias towards males in neuroscientific research. In recent years, researchers have been encouraged to include both sexes in their experiments, whether it is on humans or rodents. Despite this leading to an increase in female representation in sample populations, the majority of research does not then analyse sex differences - as few as 5% of papers in neuroscience and psychiatry published in 2019 included ‘optimal analysis of possible sex differences’ (8). This emphasises a very pressing issue in neuroscience research. If we aren’t including females in our sample populations and are not analysing sex differences as a variable within research, we most certainly are not taking into account sex-dependent hormone cycles. This is evident in neuroimaging, with only 0.5% of neuroimaging studies considering the effects of sex hormones and hormone transition phases on the brain (9). It is even more alarming that this has only been flagged in the past couple years, when oral contraceptives have been readily prescribed since the 1960’s. </p>
<h5>The future of sex hormone and neuroendocrine research</h5><p>Current trends, largely driven by female neuroscientists, are to provide more clarity on the effect of the menstrual cycle on brain structure and behaviour. The overarching flaw of most neuroimaging studies evaluating the effect of the menstrual cycle on the brain is that they only observe a snapshot of the cycle. To improve our understanding of brain changes across the full 28 days, imaging experiments need to visualise the brain at a range of time points. When neuroimaging takes into account the day-to-day hormone fluctuations over the breadth of the menstrual cycle, we can begin to see just how the brain is altered over this period of time. A number of studies by the Jacobs Lab (University of California, Santa Barbara) have done just that, looking at how oestrogen and progesterone affect functional brain networks of an individual across a 30-day cycle (10).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that people are becoming more aware of the sex bias in research, attention is turning to the long-dismissed importance of sex differences in neuroscience. Soon we may uncover answers as to why females make up two thirds of people with Alzheimer’s, how to help those suffering from PMDD, and other interesting differences.</p>

<p>Human cell lines represent key reagents for many research laboratories. Cell lines are often the first models that researchers choose for experiments such as gene manipulation and drug testing, as they are relatively accessible and inexpensive, particularly compared with mouse and other animal models. </p>



<p>However, cell lines also are prone to contamination by other faster growing cell lines. As a result,&nbsp; many human cell lines purported to represent particular tumor types have been found by genetic testing to be contaminated by other cancer cells. This potential for confusion poses a serious problem for researchers who want to study a particular cancer type but end up using cells from an unrelated disease.</p>



<p>Our team studies <a href="https://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/5/4/e202101203">wrongly identified nucleotide sequence reagents in cancer research</a>, such as PCR primers and gene knockdown reagents. Recently in the context of an undergraduate student project, we decided to also check the identities of cell lines in a small group of papers on the human gene <em>miR-145</em>, which codes for a microRNA. We <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.582220v1">found</a> wrongly identified nucleotide sequences and cell lines in numerous articles about <em>miR-145</em>, but also what appeared to be five misspelled identifiers of contaminated cell lines. </p>



<span id="more-128885"></span>



<p>This issue isn’t new – some cell line identifiers are known to be misspelled, although little has been written about such misspellings. We decided to study these apparent misspellings, and eventually found 23 published human cell line identifiers that were not recognised as cell lines in the most comprehensive cell line knowledgebase, <a href="https://www.cellosaurus.org/">Cellosaurus</a>. We then studied eight of these non-verifiable (NV) cell line identifiers <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.582220v1">in detail across 420 papers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While all eight NV identifiers likely represent misspellings in at least some papers, we also found that seven of the eight NV cell line identifiers seemed to be taking on new identities as independent cell lines. How did we separate identifier misspellings from seemingly independent cell lines? NV cell line identifiers were described as misspellings where they were only used alternately with similarly named human cell line(s), such that the misspelled identifier was never directly connected with any similarly-named cell line. </p>



<p>In contrast, NV cell line identifiers were indicated to represent independent cell lines if they were used without mentions of any similarly named human cell line; if an NV and similarly named human cell line was included in any list of cell lines studied; if results for both cell lines were shown in the same experiment(s); and/or&nbsp; if both cell line identifiers were directly connected in the text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We determined that more than half of the 420 papers appeared to refer to at least one NV identifier as an independent cell line. However, we could not find any published descriptions of how these cell lines were first established. Some authors claimed to have produced genetic profiles for three NV cell lines, but we could not find such profiles for these cell lines, either in publications describing NV cell lines or elsewhere. Six NV cell lines were claimed to have been sourced from large cell line repositories such as ATCC, but we could not find any of these NV identifiers or cell lines in the claimed repository catalogues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why should we be concerned by NV cell lines? As the problem of cell line contamination has shown, cell line identities underpin the results of experiments conducted with these models. The inability to independently verify cell lines raises doubts about&nbsp; the significance of associated results, how these results might be reproduced, and even which experiments were conducted in the first place. While researchers seem unlikely to source NV cell lines for their own experiments (as we could not find them in claimed repositories), they could still risk wasting time and money by following up results from NV cell lines using cell lines that they already have on hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Descriptions of NV cell lines call for a zero-tolerance approach to misspelled cell line identifiers and pairing the names of all published cell lines with their corresponding <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/18/how-a-typo-in-a-catalog-number-led-to-the-correction-of-a-scientific-paper-and-what-we-can-learn-from-that/">Research Resource Identifiers</a> (<a href="https://www.rrids.org/">RRIDs</a>). In the meantime, as we have advised for nucleotide sequence identities, researchers should check the identities of any cell lines that they don’t recognize before planning any future experiments. Simple checks could avoid wasting time on cell lines that might be found on wanted posters, but not in Cellosaurus.</p>

                Farmers in hot, arid regions are turning to low-cost solar pumps to irrigate their fields, eliminating the need for expensive fossil fuels and boosting crop production.

                <p>In a <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/">Tablet Magazine</a> article titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-gaza-health-ministry-fakes-casualty-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How the Gaza Ministry of Health Fakes Casualty Numbers</a>&#8221; posted on March 6, 2024, Professor of Statistics and Data Science <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ajw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abraham Wyner</a> from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania argues that statistical analysis of the casualty numbers reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health is &#8220;highly suggestive that a process unconnected or loosely connected to reality was used to report the numbers&#8221;.</p>



<p>In the post, he shows the following plot </p>

<p>which he describes as revealing &#8220;an extremely regular increase in casualties over the period&#8221; and from which he concludes that &#8220;this regularity is almost surely not real.&#8221; </p>



<p>Wyner&#8217;s plot shows cumulative reported deaths over a period of 15 days from October 26, 2023 to November 10, 2023. The individual reported deaths per day are plotted below. These numbers have a mean of 270 and a standard deviation of 42.25:</p>

<p>The coefficient of determination for the points in this plot is <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.233. However, the coefficient of determination for the points shown in Wyner&#8217;s plot is <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.999. Why does the same data look &#8220;extremely regular&#8221; one way, and much less regular another way? <br><br>If we denote the deaths per day by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7B15%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7B15%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7B15%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="x_1,&#92;ldots,x_{15}" class="latex" />, then the plot Wyner shows is of the cumulative deaths <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3Dx_1%2Cy_2%3Dx_1%2Bx_2%2Cy_3+%3D+x_1%2Bx_2%2Bx_3%2C%5Cldots%2C+y_n%3Dx_1%2B%5Ccdots%2Bx_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3Dx_1%2Cy_2%3Dx_1%2Bx_2%2Cy_3+%3D+x_1%2Bx_2%2Bx_3%2C%5Cldots%2C+y_n%3Dx_1%2B%5Ccdots%2Bx_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3Dx_1%2Cy_2%3Dx_1%2Bx_2%2Cy_3+%3D+x_1%2Bx_2%2Bx_3%2C%5Cldots%2C+y_n%3Dx_1%2B%5Ccdots%2Bx_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y_1=x_1,y_2=x_1+x_2,y_3 = x_1+x_2+x_3,&#92;ldots, y_n=x_1+&#92;cdots+x_n" class="latex" />.

Intuitively<em>, R<sup>2</sup></em> is a numerical proxy for what one perceives as &#8220;regular increase&#8221;. </p>



<p>In the plots above,  the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Bres%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Bres%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Bres%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="SS_{&#92;mbox{res}}" class="latex" /> are roughly the same, however <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Btot%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Btot%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=SS_%7B%5Cmbox%7Btot%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=545454&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="SS_{&#92;mbox{tot}}" class="latex" /> is much, <em>much</em>, higher for the <em>y<sub>i</sub></em> in comparison to the <em>x<sub>i</sub></em>. This is always true when transforming data into cumulative sums, and is such a strong effect, that simulating reported deaths with a mean of 270 but increasing the variance ten-fold to 17,850, still yields an &#8220;extremely regular increase&#8221;, with <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.99:</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">On Sept. 2, 2021, a professor at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, emailed a biochemistry journal asking to correct a paper she had published the previous year. An experiment had “unintentionally” been omitted from a figure, <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/isabella-grumbach">Isabella Grumbach</a> explained, and a comparison of experimental groups contained “a minor error in the degree of statistical significance.” A correction ensued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the problems with the article, “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31711984/">Inhibition of CaMKII in mitochondria preserves endothelial barrier function after irradiation,</a>” appear to have been more deep-rooted than the email suggested. An anonymous commenter on PubPeer had first <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B9CF167BD697C8F000E02ECC74F52B">raised concerns</a> about the article, which had appeared in <em>Free Radical Biology and Medicine (FRBM),</em> in July 2021, more than a year after it was published. The commenter claimed error bars between two figures were vastly different, even though they were meant to be related data points. </p>



<span id="more-128890"></span>



<p>Grumbach, the corresponding author of the paper, promised to investigate. A month later, she wrote to Rafael Radi, an editor<em> </em>at the journal,<em> </em>saying she had omitted an experiment from the paper by mistake, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-Re_-Your-manuscript-FRBM_2019_1387_R1-has-been-accepted.pdf">according to documents Retraction Watch obtained</a> through a public records request. But, she noted, “the data interpretation or overall conclusion<em> </em>from these data are not impacted by this error.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach, who is <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/isabella-grumbach">interim chair of internal medicine</a> at the Carver College of Medicine at the University of Iowa, said the repeated analysis had strengthened the paper’s conclusions and requested a corrigendum. The correction was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34587565/">published in November 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that didn’t make the problem go away. Within a month of the correction, another comment appeared on PubPeer claiming the revision didn’t explain the errors the first comment had flagged. Again, the commenter requested the authors share the raw data. This time the authors did not respond to the post.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Then, in January 2022, a sleuth <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lFKLBxBk7cv8KhQFh6PvrYZ_SBtI5Emc/view?usp=sharing">contacted the editor-in-chief of <em>FRBM</em></a>, Kelvin J. A. Davies, claiming:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All figure in this paper have data and statistic method that is manipulated or falsified. Paper say &#8220;independent experiment&#8221; but honestly data not from independent experiment. Actually data show replicate reading of same sample from same experiment. This false statistic analysis make very small error bar so statistic significance is reached. If data points from independent experiment analyze then there is big variation and no statistic significance so major conclusions of paper not valid.</p>



<p>Check original data and see how statistic falsified to reach desired conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email was appended with the comments from PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month later, the chair of the journal’s ethics committee, Giovanni E. Mann, wrote to Grumbach saying the committee had reviewed the case following the sleuth’s email. Mann noted the authors did not respond directly to the commenter’s request for raw data. He also flagged statistical concerns and added, “We do need to see the individual data points on which these figures and statistics were based.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach said she would perform a comprehensive review and prepare a reply to the queries. In her email, she also wrote, “we have seen a very unusual increase in activities regarding the manuscripts from a select group of investigators in the Dept. of Internal Medicine.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach did not respond to our queries about the “unusual increase in activities.” She is listed as an author on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=grumbach">two other papers</a> that were called out on PubPeer around the same time. One was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35131484/">issued an erratum</a> and another <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.v63retraction1">an expression of concern</a>, both related to the inclusion of duplicate data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of <em>FRBM</em>, said the editors were not aware of the PubPeer comments before the sleuth’s email, and made the decision to publish a correction “based on mistakes raised by the author.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In April 2022, Grumbach <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iDBEony7DBlwjyJm1NlaQWvA4Dt_VYrw/view?usp=sharing">officially requested to retract the paper</a>, which has been cited 14 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. She told Davies: “I analyzed these data and inaccurately pasted the data into the analysis software, leading to an incorrect grouping of the data. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please advise me on the next steps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice, published online in May 2022, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Authors and Editor-in-Chief.</p>



<p>Some of the data presented in Figure 6C, F and G of the above-titled paper were reported incorrectly in the published article. After being contacted by the Journal, the authors discovered an unintentional error in how the original data were analyzed that could affect the accuracy of the subsequent analysis. The raw data were incorrectly grouped in the analysis software, thereby altering the comparisons. Therefore the authors wish to retract the paper and will recollect and reanalyze the data appropriately. The authors apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice added that the authors would “recollect and reanalyze the data appropriately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach declined to be interviewed for this story but a spokesperson passed on a statement from her:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I take research integrity very seriously, which is why I asked for a retraction of this paper when I realized there were errors in the data and analysis after I had submitted an erratum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since its retraction, the paper has also been included among the references in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.317869">another paper by the group</a>, although that “manuscript was drafted and submitted for initial review before the retraction,” according to the university spokesperson.</p>

                <p><strong>Meghna Solanki explores the life and work of Rita Levi-Montalcini, a 'trailblazer' in the field of neuroscience, renowned for her discovery of nerve growth factor.</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong>"...let us continue to honour her memory by fostering an inclusive environment where all scientists...can thrive and make meaningful contributions...</strong><strong>"</strong></blockquote><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_7d01c048ee0f4fc9a1348a51b16eda16~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_240,h_361,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Rita Levi Montalcini (cnr.it)" ></figure><p>In the archives of neuroscience, Rita Levi-Montalcini's name shines brightly as a beacon of innovation, resilience, and gender equality. Born on April 22nd, 1909, in Turin, Italy, Rita defied societal norms and overcame numerous obstacles to become one of the most influential neuroscientists of the 20th century. Her remarkable journey and groundbreaking discoveries not only revolutionised our understanding of the nervous system, but also inspired generations of female scientists to pursue their passions, despite adversities. </p>

<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini's early years were marked by a fierce determination to pursue her scientific interests in a male-dominated field: "At 20, I realised that I could not possibly adjust to a feminine role as conceived by my father and asked him permission to engage in a professional career." Despite facing opposition from her traditional family, she pursued her education, obtaining a degree in Medicine and Surgery from the University of Turin in 1936. However, her journey as a female scientist was fraught with challenges: discrimination and prejudice against women in academia were rampant, yet Rita refused to be deterred. She persevered, determined to make her mark in the scientific world. She published the groundbreaking paper titled "Effects of mouse tumour transplantation on the nervous system" in 1951, which laid the foundation for her later work on nerve growth factor.</p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_6e0d56cb98b2413881b3b3aabe005225~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_253,h_363,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Rita Levi-Montalcini receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1986 (imsvintagephotos.com)" ></figure><p>One of Rita Levi-Montalcini's most significant contributions to neuroscience was her discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the early 1950s, alongside colleague Stanley Cohen. Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered NGF using a pioneering method, which involved studying the effects of mouse tumour transplantation on the nervous system. She observed that the tumours stimulated the growth of nearby nerve fibres, which led to the identification and isolation of NGF. This groundbreaking discovery - for which she and Stanley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986 -  fundamentally transformed our understanding of how nerve cells develop, grow and function, laying a foundation for modern neuroscience. NGF's role in promoting the survival and growth of neurones paved the way for countless studies relating to neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. </p>
<blockquote><strong>"Her life story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of diversity and inclusion"</strong></blockquote>
<p>Beyond her scientific achievements, Rita Levi-Montalcini's legacy as a woman in neuroscience is equally profound. She shattered glass ceilings and paved the way for future generations of female scientists to thrive in a field historically dominated by men. Through her tenacity, brilliance, and unwavering dedication to her craft, she inspired countless women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Her life story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of diversity and inclusion in scientific research, highlighting the invaluable contributions that women can make to advancing our understanding of the world.</p>

<p>In addition to her scientific endeavours, Rita Levi-Montalcini was a fervent advocate for education, gender equality, and social justice. She used her platform and influence to champion causes close to her heart, tirelessly advocating for the rights and empowerment of women in STEM fields. Her philanthropic efforts, including the establishment of the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation, continue to support scientific research and education initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the scientific community.</p>

<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini's contributions to neuroscience, and as a woman in STEM, are nothing short of extraordinary. Her groundbreaking discoveries, unwavering determination, and advocacy for gender equality have not only advanced our scientific knowledge, but also inspired countless individuals, particularly women, to pursue careers in science and medicine around the world. As we celebrate her legacy, let us continue to honour her memory by fostering an inclusive environment where all scientists, regardless of gender, can thrive and make meaningful contributions to advancing human knowledge and understanding by breaking barriers and stereotypes along the way.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>.

We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. This is the fourth blog in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/">5-part series.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Dr. David Blumenthal, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit&auml;t, Faculty of Engineering, Department Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering</p>



<p>Disease association databases (DisGeNET [1], OMIM [2], DrugBank [3], etc.) containing disease-gene, disease-symptom, or disease-drug links are used extensively in various subfields of data-centric biomedicine. However, in such databases, diseases are annotated using our current mainly organ- or symptom-based disease definitions (UMLS concept unique identifiers (CUIs), MONDO identifiers, ICD-10 codes, etc.), which are often umbrella terms for several yet unknown causal molecular mechanisms with similar phenotypic effects [4]. Consequently, widely used large-scale disease association databases are systematically biased towards reproducing our current disease ontologies and are hence of limited use for data-driven precision medicine approaches which aim at a more fine-grained understanding of disease subtypes [5].</p>



<p>In view of this bias, one option would be to simply not use large-scale disease association databases for data-centric precision medicine. However, given the vast amount of aggregated knowledge contained therein, this is very unsatisfactory. In the proposed project, we will hence aim at salvaging large-scale disease association databases for precision medicine by disentangling the associations for ill-defined umbrella disease terms into subsets of associations for which there is solid evidence that they indeed describe endotypes corresponding to disjoint molecular mechanisms.</p>



<p>Consider the example of DisGeNET &ndash; an extremely widely used database containing associations between diseases and genes and disease and genetic variants. In DisGeNET, diseases are annotated using UMLS CUIs and disease links are defined mainly via aggregation of the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Yet, for mechanistically ill-defined &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; CUIs that do not correspond to distinct molecular mechanisms, the underlying aggregated GWAS were most likely investigating patients suffering from distinct unknown disease subtypes. In DisGeNET, genetic associations for all of these different subtypes are merged under the set of associations for the umbrella CUI.</p>



<p>In the proposed project, our aim is to develop a network-based computational approach to reverse such unspecific aggregations, which affect virtually any large-scale disease association database. As input, the envisaged algorithm will accept a set of (at least two) disease association databases containing different types of association data (e.g., disease-gene and disease-symptom associations) and a potentially ill-defined disease term D contained in all input databases. As output, it will return subsets of the term&rsquo;s associations in the input databases and a P-value which quantifies the evidence that these subsets indeed contain associations corresponding to distinct (possibly unknown) subtypes of the input disease D. Instead of starting with the unspecific associations for disease D, downstream precision medicine approaches can then make use of the uncovered subsets, potentially leading to more specific and promising hypotheses about molecular mechanisms driving complex diseases.</p>

<p>Following criticism from scientists around the world, a virology journal has retracted a paper describing the first test in humans of an Iran-made vaccine against COVID-19.</p>



<p>Iran licensed the home-grown Noora vaccine for emergency use in 2022 and has <a href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1101482/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85%DB%8C-%DB%B2-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85">reportedly administered millions</a> of doses to its citizens. The country’s health authorities say the shot is <a href="https://dolat.ir/detail/391516">94% effective</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The now-retracted paper, published in 2022 in the <em>Journal of Medical Virology</em>, was the only report on the clinical development of the vaccine to have appeared in an international journal. The article has been cited 10 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<span id="more-128882"></span>



<p>In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28731">a commentary</a> last year in the same journal, <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=2934">Donald Forthal</a>, chief of infectious diseases at the University of California, Irvine, raised several concerns about the article, titled “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28097">Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant receptor-binding domain-based protein subunit vaccine (Noora vaccine<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) against COVID-19 in adults: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported in October, Forthal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/26/publisher-looking-into-covid-vaccine-paper-with-serious-flaws/">questioned the efficacy</a> of the vaccine and expressed surprise “a manuscript containing so many serious flaws would have been accepted for publication following peer review, and given these issues, a retraction may be in order.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s editor-in-chief, Shou-Jiang Gao, said at the time the paper had undergone two rounds of “rigorously [sic] review by experts of the field” before it was published. The authors had responded to Forthal’s critique, Gao told us, and their response had “already undergone 3 rounds of review, each with 2 reviewers”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The last decision was made on October 24, 2023 and deadline for submitting the revision is November 23, 2023. So, we are waiting for the authors to submit the last revision before accepting and publishing it. This should fully address the issues that are raised.  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the response was never published. Meanwhile, in January, <a href="https://westernsydneydiabetes.com.au/staff-profiles/gideon-meyerowitz-katz/">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, an epidemiologist in Australia, flagged <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/179DB7875D6760293758F6CBD3900D#3">additional problems</a> in the paper on PubPeer, including several “impossible” and “contradictory” numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 2, the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.29509">announced</a> the paper had been retracted, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction has been agreed due to concerns raised by third parties regarding issues with the data presented in the article. Several inconsistencies concerning the information provided about the analyzed subjects were additionally identified. Furthermore, the authors failed to disclose the presence of potential conflicts of interest that may have affected the interpretation of the results presented. Accordingly, the editors consider the conclusions of this manuscript to be invalid. The authors have been informed of the decision to retract but did not agree with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corresponding author Hassan Abolghasemi of Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, in Tehran, told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Retraction of our article was a political decision not a scientific decision because there was a pressure on journal based on [apartheid] scientific issue. Our response to the comment never accepted by [PubPeer] and journal to be published.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Two days after the retraction, another group of researchers published <a href="https://iji.sums.ac.ir/article_49904.html">a study</a> in mice comparing the effect of four COVID-19 vaccines used in Iran.</p>



<p>“Our results indicate significant immunogenicity and neutralization efficacy induced by PastoCovac Plus and Sinopharm, but not by Noora and SpikoGen,” the team wrote in the article, which cited the now-retracted paper. “This suggests the need for additional comparative assessment of the potency and efficacy of these four vaccines in vaccinated subjects.”</p>

<p>A group of 10 members of the editorial board of <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> have resigned to protest the journal’s failure to respond to allegations of data fabrication.</p>



<p>Last week, in an email obtained by Retraction Watch, the editors wrote to Tovah Aronin, the managing editor of the journal, regarding “concerns about the publication of fraudulent research in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth and BMC Women’s Health in 2023.”</p>



<p>The allegations about two papers had been sent to the journal on Jan. 29, 2024, by Ben Mol, an obstetrician-gynecologist who has <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research">earned a reputation as a sleuth</a> for his efforts to clean up the literature in the field:</p>



<span id="more-128874"></span>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05728-w">Comparative study between oxytocin and combination of tranexamic acid and ethamsylate in reducing intra-operative bleeding during emergency and elective cesarean section after 38 weeks of normal pregnancy</a>,” published in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</li>



<li>“<a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-023-02549-z">Oxytocin versus a combination of tranexamic acid and ethamsylate in reducing intraoperative bleeding during abdominal myomectomy: a randomized clinical trial</a>,” published in BMC Women’s Health</li>
</ul>



<p>Mol told the editors he was puzzled by, among other things, the mean ages of the women in both studies, which contrasted sharply with data in other papers from the same period in the same medical center. <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/jim.thornton">Jim Thornton</a>, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Nottingham in the UK, left a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E44334B9748976BD99706983134EA1">similar comment</a> about one of the papers on PubPeer.</p>



<p>Mohamed Abdelmonem Kamel of Fayoum University in Egypt, the corresponding author of both papers, has not responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The editors said Mol’s evidence:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>strongly suggests this research is fabricated. While some issues are concerning, such as a zero loss to follow up, which is almost impossible in a real-world study, other issues, such as the indication for Caesarean section in a myomectomy paper, are extremely worrying.</p>



<p>Given the seriousness of the allegations, we would have expected the journal to respond immediately by placing a note of concern on these papers and asking the authors for their original data so that an investigation could be carried out. However, the journal has not even replied to Prof Mol (who is himself a leading clinical trialist in maternity care).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We cannot continue to serve on the editorial board of BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth unless the journal responds to serious, substantiated allegations of research fraud. Fraudulent research endangers women and babies by supporting ineffective treatments. We cannot allow this to go unchallenged and therefore feel that we cannot continue to serve as members of the editorial board. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>They left the door open to reversing themselves:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We would be happy to rejoin the Editorial Board if there is a strong and immediate response to raise concerns about the published manuscripts, and to retract papers where research fraud is proven. In addition, we believe that authors of proven fraudulent research should be banned from future submissions to the journal and from serving on the editorial board. For now, we can no longer justify being an editor of BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth.</p>



<p>We have long supported BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, submitting our own research and facilitating peer review of others’ research. It devalues our research and that of the majority of authors to allow fraudulent research to remain in the public domain unchallenged. We urge you to act to preserve the integrity of the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Aronin told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to assure you that investigations of Ben Mol’s accusations are ongoing. We have been remiss in proper communication with the Editorial Board regarding these accusations and our investigations and we are planning on sending communications to them soon, and I hope that we will be able to reassure them that there is no need to resign.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Mol, he has so far flagged nearly 900 papers, of which 155 have been retracted and 72 have received expressions of concern. Most of the rest are in limbo, with no known outcome. Mol added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have flagged only 10% of what should be flagged. The big problem is the lack of response from the field.</p>

<p>A Springer Nature journal has issued an expression of concern for a 16-year-old paper by Carlo Croce, the cancer researcher – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/26/law-firm-sues-osu-cancer-researcher-for-900000-in-unpaid-fees-following-failed-libel-suit/">and noted art collector</a> – at The Ohio State University three years after the publication had received a correction for problematic images and roughly 20 months after the news division at <em>Nature </em>reported on a pair of institutional investigations into problems with Croce’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/22/papers-in-croce-case-with-blatantly-obvious-problems-still-arent-retracted-after-misconduct-investigation-sleuth/">we and others have reported</a>, those investigations concluded Croce had not committed misconduct but had overlooked the misdeeds of others in his lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-024-02989-3">the notice</a> for the paper, “MicroRNA signatures of TRAIL resistance in human non-small cell lung cancer,” which <em>Oncogene </em>published in 2008:</p>



<span id="more-128872"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief would like to alert the readers that following the Correction [1] of this article [2] to address the concerns raised regarding the western blot loading controls presented in Figs. 4c and 7a, further issues have been noted:</p>



<p>The western blot loading controls presented in Figs. 4d and 7c appear highly similar.</p>



<p>The U6 panel of Fig. 3b appears highly similar to the U6 panel of Fig. 4c of another article from the same author group that was submitted and published within a similar time frame [3].</p>



<p>The western blot loading controls presented in Fig. 5b and the originally published version of Fig. 7a appear highly similar to the control lanes 1 and 2 (flipped horizontally) of Fig. 3a of [4], which as also submitted and published within a similar time frame.</p>



<p>The authors have stated that the images used in the other articles [3, 4] are incorrect, and are issuing Corrections to replace them with the appropriate data. However, due to the number of concerns raised, readers are advised to interpret the presented data with caution.</p>



<p>M. Garofalo has stated on behalf of all authors that they do not agree to this editorial expression of concern.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article has been cited 229 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, of which 20 have come since the correction (which itself has received two citations).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">David Sanders, a data sleuth and biologist at Purdue University who raised issues about the papers – and who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">successfully defended himself</a> in a defamation suit Croce launched against him – told us last week he first notified Oncogene about the problematic articles in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the correction appeared in January 2021, Sanders contacted the journal again with concerns about the statement, including:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Why is there no indication that there had been image duplication in the correction?  How do you know that Figures 5b and 6a are correct? </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five months later, he raised still more questions about the article – but never heard back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In violation of COPE rules, they have never contacted me about the resolution of this issue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sanders also pointed to evidence of plagiarism in the article, which OSU documents in one of its reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Springer Nature to explain the lag – and why the journal felt an expression of concern was more appropriate than retraction in this case. The response from a spokesperson:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After a careful and thorough investigation, the Editors concluded that publishing an Editorial Expression of Concern was the most appropriate editorial action to take.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Oncogene </em>has issued a double correction for another of Croce’s papers, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1209323#change-history">Fhit modulation of the Akt-survivin pathway in lung cancer cells: Fhit-tyrosine 114 (Y114) is essential</a>,” originally published in 2006.</p>

<p>An August 2023 report on research integrity by consulting firm KPMG, commissioned by an Australian government agency, contains a made-up reference, Retraction Watch has discovered.</p>



<p>Reference 139 of the report, “<a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/attachments/Committee/International-Policy-Scan-Report.pdf">International Research Integrity Policy Scan Final Report: Compilation of information about research integrity arrangements outside Australia</a>,” reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Gunsalus CK, Marcus AR, Oransky I, Stern JM. Institutional and individual factors that promote research integrity. In: Macrina FL, editor. Scientific Integrity: Text and Cases in Responsible Conduct of Research. 4th ed. Washington, DC: ASM Press; 2018. p. 53-82.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Scientific+Integrity:+Text+and+Cases+in+Responsible+Conduct+of+Research,+4th+Edition-p-9781683673514">book with that title</a> exists, but the four authors listed did not contribute a chapter, and the 2018 edition does not appear to contain a chapter with that title. We – Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky – have indeed <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2675025">published with CK Gunsalus</a>, but nothing resembling this reference.</p>



<span id="more-128866"></span>



<p>We spot-checked about 20 of the other references in the book, and while there are some punctuation errors, the rest of the citations we reviewed exist. So this seemed to be a single error of unclear provenance. We wanted to let KPMG know, and find out what they would do about it.</p>



<p>We contacted KPMG Australia’s press team on Jan. 28. They acknowledged receipt of our email the same day, but when we didn’t hear back a week later, we followed up. On Feb. 6, we sent some questions we wanted on-the-record answers to, and waited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although as journalists we prefer to speak directly with people involved, none of this was unusual in seeking comment from companies and government agencies.</p>



<p>On Feb. 12, we followed up to check on progress, and were told scheduling had been difficult, and that answers would be forthcoming. We followed up on Feb. 14 and received no response. We then followed up again on Feb. 18 to say we were getting the impression the company had decided not to respond but that we would be publishing soon.</p>



<p>We have not heard back since. Which is puzzling – if there’s a clumsy error in a single reference, why not just acknowledge that, explain it, and move on?</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), which commissioned the document, thanked us for raising the issue with them, and said the agency “will work with KPMG to correct the report.” The consulting firm had not yet contacted NHMRC, the spokesperson said.</p>
