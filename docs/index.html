<p>An article published last January in a physics journal attracted attention for its conclusion that–contrary to mainstream climate science–extreme weather events have not become more intense or more frequent as the temperature of the earth’s surface has increased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the journal’s editors have retracted the article after a post-publication review found “that the conclusions of the article were not supported by available evidence or data provided by the authors.”</p>



<p>In the abstract of “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-02243-9">A critical assessment of extreme events trends in times of global warming</a>,” published in <em>The European Physical Journal Plus</em>, the authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127761"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On the basis of observational data, the climate crisis that, according to many sources, we are experiencing today, is not evident yet.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That conclusion found favor on <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/121693729">social media</a>, as well as in <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/is-climate-change-driving-extreme-weather/"><em>The National Review,</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/science/climate-crisis-not-evident-yet-says-new-study-4737922"><em>The Epoch Times</em></a>, and other outlets, but articles in <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/sky-australian-no-evidence-climate-000042632.html"><em>The Guardian</em></a><em> </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32K66UE-1"><em>AFP</em></a><em> </em>quoted climate scientists who said the authors had “cherry-picked” the data they analyzed and the paper <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-09-scientists-urge-publisher-faulty-climate.html">should be retracted</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after the critical coverage was published, on Sept. 30, 2022, the journal added the following editor’s note to the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Readers are alerted that the conclusions reported in this manuscript are currently under dispute. The journal is investigating the issue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nearly a year later, on August 23, as <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/top-science-publisher-withdraws-flawed-115435891.html"><em>AFP</em> first reported</a>, the journal pulled the paper. According to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/s13360-023-04386-3">retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. Concerns were raised regarding the selection of the data, the analysis and the resulting conclusions of the article. The authors were invited to submit an addendum to the article, but post publication review of the concerns with the article and the submitted addendum concluded that the addendum was not suitable for publication and that the conclusions of the article were not supported by available evidence or data provided by the authors. In light of these concerns and based on the outcome of the post publication review, the Editors-in-Chief no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions reported in this article.</p>



<p>The authors disagree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first and corresponding author of the paper, <a href="https://www0.mi.infn.it/~alimonti/homepage/indexEn.htm">Gianluca Alimonti</a> of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare and Università degli Studi in Milan, Italy, has not yet responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature, the publisher of the journal where the paper appeared, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief of the <em>European Physical Journal Plus</em> have retracted this article. When they became aware of concerns, the Editors — with advice and assistance provided by Springer Nature Research Integrity Group — launched a thorough investigation following an established process in line with best-practice Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines. This process included a post-publication review by subject-matter experts of the article and an addendum submitted by the authors during the investigation.</p>



<p>After careful consideration and consultation with all parties involved, the Editors and publishers concluded that they no longer had confidence in the results and conclusions of the article. The addendum was not considered suitable for publication, and retraction was the most appropriate course of action in order to maintain the validity of the scientific record.</p>

<p>A study by two economists who found opening strip clubs or escort services caused sex crimes in the neighborhood to drop contains &#8220;fatal errors&#8221; and should be retracted, argues a group of past and current law enforcement officers, including three academics.</p>



<p>&#8220;None of us are prudes or even anti-strip club,&#8221; <a href="https://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/peter-moskos">Peter Moskos</a>, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City and a former Baltimore police officer, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMoskos/status/1692030498665562513">wrote in a thread</a> on X (formerly Twitter). &#8220;But if you claim strip clubs reduce sex crimes – and by 13 percent! – you&#8217;re delving into serious policy issues.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;This is very typical of academics getting out of their field. They have second-hand data. They crunch the numbers … They don&#8217;t know what the data mean.&#8221;</p>



<span id="more-127754"></span>



<p>The study, titled &#8220;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/132/641/147/6309337?redirectedFrom=fulltext">The Effect of Adult Entertainment Establishments on Sex Crime: Evidence from New York City</a>,&#8221; was published in July 2021 in <em>The Economic Journal</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We find that these businesses decrease sex crime by 13% per police precinct one week after the opening, and have no effect on other types of crime,&#8221; wrote <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/riccardociacci/home">Riccardo Ciacci</a>, of Universidad Pontificia Comillas, in Spain, and <a href="http://www.micaelasviatschi.com/">Maria Micaela Sviatschi</a>, of Princeton University, in their abstract.</p>



<p>What the data suggest, the duo speculated in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/07/06/sex-crimes-adult-entertainment-research/">an opinion piece</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em>, is that &#8220;Men otherwise inclined to commit assaults might instead spend more time in strip clubs or hiring escorts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Predictably, the findings drew a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strip-clubs-decline-sex-crimes-b1882759.html">bit</a> of <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90655307/princeton-university-study-strip-clubs-and-escort-services-may-help-reduce-sex-crimes">media</a> <a href="https://studyfinds.org/escort-services-strip-clubs-help-reduce-sex-crimes/">attention</a>. But in the view of Moskos and his colleagues – two former police officers turned academics and the commander of the crime-strategies unit in the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority Police Department – they should never have passed peer review.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As the four told the journal in an August 2021 email seen by Retraction Watch, after corresponding with the study authors, &#8220;ultimately we could not reconcile the study’s conclusions with the distinct limitations of its data.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the email, they pointed to three major concerns:</p>



<ul>
<li>The study relied on the date a business was registered with the state as a proxy for when it opened. But for strip clubs, licensing and inspections can lead to delays of months between registration and opening.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The study used <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page">NYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk</a> data as a proxy for sex crimes. These data have been <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data">heavily criticized</a>; Moskos and his colleagues claim that more than 94% &#8220;are records of people who were legally innocent of a crime at the time and place of the encounter.&#8221;&nbsp;</li>



<li>The study&#8217;s baseline data on strip clubs missed a number of establishments Moskos and his colleagues knew to exist. (They name-check several, including Wild Wild West, Corrado’s and Sweet Cherry.)</li>
</ul>



<p>In a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4528229">preprint</a> posted to SSRN this month and submitted for review to <em>Police Practice and Research</em>, they boiled it all down to this:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What the study has done is measure changes in police encounters with innocent people in the week after an entity has filed the paperwork necessary to start the processes that will eventually allow it to open a strip club.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But <em>The Economic Journal</em> apparently failed to get the point. In an email seen by Retraction Watch, Editor-in-Chief Francesco Lippi replied to the group:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal is open to considering comments on published papers. In the case of empirical papers, comments are expected to be based on systematic analyses of the data, highlighting differences between the results obtained in the original paper and in the new analysis.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;We said the data shouldn&#8217;t have been used in the first place, and their response was to suggest we re-analyze the data and point out differences,&#8221; <a href="https://brandondelpozo.com/">Brandon del Pozo</a>, the corresponding author on the preprint and an assistant professor at Brown University, told Retraction Watch. (Del Pozo is also a former police officer.)</p>



<p>Reached for comment, Lippi did not directly address the issue of the data being unfit to address the study’s hypothesis, but said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This criticism was based on a data analysis that used a small subsample of observations for which the authors were able to gather more precise measurements.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that he had not heard back after sending the email welcoming a re-analysis of the data. “As far as I am concerned, a serious (scientifically sound) confutation of the original thesis has not been given yet,” Lippi told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Del Pozo said that after failing to move forward with Lippi, he and his colleagues sent their concerns to the <em>Journal of Comments and Replications in Economics</em>. But the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>declined to publish them based on a response from the authors that we frankly found a little bewildering. They used an irrelevant case of a person buying an existing business from someone else to say we didn&#8217;t prove strip clubs don&#8217;t open on the day they are registered with the state. Then they said their robustness check, which used data that principally derives from the main dataset, showed similar results at the precinct-month level, so their results were good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ciacci told Retraction Watch in a brief email that the preprint contained &#8220;plenty of imprecise information about&#8221; his and Sviatschi&#8217;s paper:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is why at least two journals, to the best of my knowledge, decided not to publish that article. Indeed, we were contacted by JCRE (Journal of Comments and Replications in Economics) to reply to their paper. After reading our reply the Editors of JCRE opted to reject their article. Likewise, the Economic Journal decided to reject their article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ciacci, who said he was on vacation, did not reply to a follow-up email asking for specific comments on the arguments in the preprint. Sviatschi declined to comment, noting that she was “on maternity leave with my baby and no help.”</p>



<p>“And so it is,” Moskos wrote in his <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMoskos/status/1692030506894774745">punchy prose</a> on X.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And so it is. You have a peer-reviewed article saying all open up a titty bar and sex crimes go down! Big, if true. And all we can do, and we&#39;re pretty qualified people here on this issue — cops, professor, &amp; the chief crime analyst of the NYPD — is complain on twitter.</p>&mdash; Peter Moskos (@PeterMoskos) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMoskos/status/1692030506894774745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Update, 8/25/23, 1345 UTC: del Pozo tells us that &#8220;<em>Police Practice and Research</em> has peer reviewed, using reviewers with expertise in the data, our article and decided to publish it.&#8221;</p>

The technique could one day help improve self-driving vehicles&#8217; ability to navigate at night.<br><br>Thermal imaging, which is often used in night vision systems, works by detecting heat sources. The infrared images are blurry because of a phenomenon called ghosting. Heat from an object overwhelms any details about the object’s texture, much like turning on a light makes it difficult to decipher any etching on a lightbulb.</p>



<p>Theoretical physicist Fanglin Bao of Purdue University in West Lafeyette, Ind., and colleagues used a thermal camera that can distinguish between different wavelengths of infrared light. The researchers paired that camera with a computer program that uses AI to untangle information from the device to reveal the temperature, texture and type of material of objects in an image. This technique <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06174-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">painted bright, detailed images out of dark, nighttime scenes</a>, the team reports July 26 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>“There is no restriction of harsh weather conditions or nighttime scenarios,” says electrical engineer Muhammad Ali Farooq of the University of Galway in Ireland, who was not involved with the study. “You can get very good and very crisp data even in low-lighting conditions.”</p>



<p>The technique can also measure distance with about the same accuracy as current camera-based methods. This means it could be used in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/self-driving-cars-see-better-cameras-mimic-mantis-shrimp-vision">self-driving vehicles</a>, which have to know when to brake to avoid causing a wreck (<em>SN: 10/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>Current self-driving vehicles often gauge distance by bouncing signals off objects, similar to how sonar works. Many autonomous cars sending out signals could confuse one another. Because the new technique doesn’t need to send out a signal, it could be safer to scale up in a world with more self-driving cars, the researchers say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, the technology won’t be cruising through busy streets any time soon. The camera is hefty, about half a meter on each side and expensive — it costs upward of $1 million, Bao says. And capturing each image takes about a second, which is too slow for a self-driving vehicle that needs to respond to situations in real time.</p>



<p>Still, Bao looks forward to seeing versions of this technology might do for self-driving vehicles or robots in the future. “We humans have an evolutionary bias towards the light,” he says. “But it turns out AI can overcome this long-standing dichotomy between day and night.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-emperor-penguins-endangered-climate">Emperor penguins lost thousands of chicks to melting ice last year</a></h4>

              
                <p>Thousands of emperor penguins in western Antarctica lost their chicks last year, largely due to receding sea ice, satellite data suggest.</p>



<p>Over the last two years, sea ice has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-sea-ice-record-low-2023">reached record lows</a> around much of Antarctica (<em>SN: 7/5/23</em>). But while looking at satellite images in 2022, geographer Peter Fretwell noticed that ice in one area was melting especially early in the year. He and his colleagues wanted to measure the impact of this ice loss — in the Bellingshausen Sea off western Antarctica — on emperor penguins (<em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em>) in the region.</p>





<p>So the researchers looked at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emperor-penguin-poop-satellite-images-space-new-colonies">satellite images</a> of colonies to determine the fate of the breeding season (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>). Of the five colonies observed, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00927-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four probably lost all their chicks</a>, the team reports August 23 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>Emperor penguins rely on stable sea ice throughout their breeding season, which lasts from April to January. When an egg hatches, the newborn chick must fledge, losing its downy feathers to gain its waterproof coat.</p>



<p>In 2022, sea ice broke up before some colonies were finished fledging. Without waterproof feathers, fledging birds were unable to survive, Fretwell says. Of the youngsters from the 10,000 or so breeding pairs in the region, “we think about 850 of the chicks survived,” says Fretwell, of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, England.</p>

The colony there suffered three years of breeding failure from 2016 to 2018.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130624">Christopher Walton</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Penguin colonies can recover from a single failed breeding season, says Annie Schmidt, a seabird ecologist at Blue Point Conservation Science in Petaluma, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the new study. And the researchers looked at only a few emperor penguin colonies of the 62 throughout Antarctica.</p>



<p>Some of those other colonies have also experienced bad breeding seasons lately. On Antarctica’s Brunt Ice Shelf, the world’s second-largest emperor penguin colony at the time had <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/emperors-on-thin-ice-three-years-of-breeding-failure-at-halley-bay/4CA1A77971A4CD5D5CB823EBF338FAA9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three years of breeding failure</a> from 2016 to 2018 after storms broke up sea ice there, Fretwell and a colleague previously reported. Between breeding failure and mass emigration to another site, the colony all but disappeared.</p>



<p>Repeated, or more widespread, failure could threaten colonies and, eventually, emperor penguins as a whole.</p>



<p>The new study, documenting breeding failure across several colonies at once, “is the first observation that&#8217;s in line with the worst expectations of what could happen” as the Earth continues to warm, Schmidt says. “I’m concerned — it’s not a good sign.” Recent estimates predict that the changing climate and melting sea ice <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719309899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could cut emperor penguin populations by more than half</a> by 2100.</p>



<p>Despite that potentially grim outlook for emperor penguins, Fretwell still has hope. “If we can slow down global warming … we can turn around the fate of the emperor penguin,” he says. “But that window of opportunity is getting smaller, so we really have to act now.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2023/08/24/lets-be-more-idealistic-about-pragmatism-in-clinical-research/">Let’s be more idealistic about pragmatism in clinical research</a></h4>

              
                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/pragmatic-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Imagine, if you will, that you are developing a promising new drug which, judging by its performance in<em> in vitro</em> and animal studies, may extend the lives of patients with a certain type of cancer. Before you can launch this drug onto the market, you will need to show that, for its target population, it works as intended and its side effects are bearable. To do that, the design and conduct of clinical trials is essential. Broadly speaking, there are two approaches you can take when designing and conducting such trials.</p>
<p>The first approach involves running your trials under idealized (and thus artificial) circumstances, to test whether the medicine in question is at all capable of exerting its desired effects. You can create these circumstances by exercising strict control over what happens during the studies. Practically speaking, this could for example mean that you make sure to only recruit participants who satisfy a long list of carefully chosen selection criteria, to limit the research setting to university hospitals exclusively, and to define in detail how investigators should administer the investigational product. By doing so, you will generate data that provide an indication of the efficacy of that product.</p>
<p>Conversely, the second approach consists of carrying out your trials under conditions which reflect as closely as possible how the experimental agent would be applied in a real-life context, outside of a research environment. If you want to follow this approach, you may for instance decide to restrict the number of exclusion criteria to a minimum, to also rely on community hospitals for patient recruitment, and to leave it up to each investigator to choose how they employ said agent in their clinic. The trial results will then offer insights into the effectiveness of the therapy under investigation.</p>
<p>Studies that are set up according to the first approach are sometimes referred to as being <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g6694">‘explanatory’</a>, while those that are designed based on the second are often given the descriptor <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g6694">‘pragmatic’</a>. Although the two approaches, which are valid in their own right, are irreconcilable in theory, in practice many trials display both explanatory and pragmatic features. A useful tool was developed that allows for quantifying the degree of pragmatism a given trial exhibits: the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.h2147">PRECIS-2 instrument</a>. By scoring the study on a scale of one (very explanatory) to five (very pragmatic) across each of the nine distinct PRECIS-2 domains, its position on the pragmatic-explanatory continuum can be determined.</p>
<p>However, despite the availability of the PRECIS-2 instrument, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2022.08.007">multiple</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-018-1038-2">prior</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.3321">analyses</a> of trials undertaken in a variety of different medical fields have shown that many trialists use the term ‘pragmatic’ rather liberally, without properly justifying why their studies deserve to be labelled as such. We wanted to know whether that finding holds true in the oncology sphere as well. To test this, we searched the literature and subjected every trial we could find that investigated an antitumor treatment and that carried the ‘pragmatic’ tag to a full PRECIS-2 evaluation, extracting the necessary information from relevant study documents.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-023-01975-9">What we observed</a> was striking, but not surprising: in our sample of 42 supposedly pragmatic trials, the median total PRECIS-2 score at the individual trial level barely exceeded 3, corresponding to the midpoint of the PRECIS-2 scale. In other words, the median study included in our analysis turned out to be no more pragmatic than it was explanatory. Moreover, none of the studies we examined adequately explained why their use of the ‘pragmatic’ label was warranted, neglecting to report any PRECIS-2 scores whatsoever. Additionally, in a majority of cases, a complete PRECIS-2 assessment could not be performed, mainly due to the research setup not being described thoroughly enough in the source materials consulted.</p>
<p>Clearly, oncology trialists, just like their colleagues from other disciplines, lack understanding of what pragmatic trials are. The implications of this observation should not be understated: false claims of pragmatism can mislead readers into thinking that real-world patients will experience the same therapeutic outcomes as the trial participants, which is far from guaranteed, given the existence of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2015.09.2938">efficacy-effectiveness gap</a>. These claims may deceive decision-makers like payers and health technology assessors too, to whom pragmatic studies are <a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/cer-2016-0018">of particular interest</a>, owing to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2016.12.023">strength of the evidence</a> produced by those studies.</p>
<blockquote><p>What our work demonstrates is that we have to be more idealistic about pragmatism in clinical research by affirming that it is a multifaceted concept which encompasses all aspects of a trial’s organization.</p></blockquote>
<p>Journal editors and reviewers must play an active role in this regard and insist that sponsors who assert that they have conducted a pragmatic study substantiate their assertions by determining and publishing that study’s PRECIS-2 scores and the motivations underlying them, allowing for their independent validation by third parties. Only by taking resolute action to prevent the misuse of the ‘pragmatic’ identifier, can we avoid potentially harmful misunderstandings and misinterpretations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/one-device-transform-power-electical-grid-inverter">How one device could help transform our power grid</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">From Colorado to Washington, from Ohio to Pennsylvania, coal-fired power plants are shutting down. The United States is on track to retire half of its capacity to generate electricity from coal by 2026. That’s a remarkably fast decline from coal’s peak in 2011 — and a major step in the shift to clean energy and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/net-zero-carbon-emissions-climate">the fight against climate change</a>.</p>



<p>But there’s a surprising downside to retiring big, old power plants. These plants help maintain the power grid’s stability. As more of them go offline, something else must step up to do that job.</p>





<p>An electrical grid is a complex network involving systems that produce power, like a nuclear power plant or a wind turbine, and systems that store and transmit power, like batteries and transmission lines. A grid can stop functioning for any number of reasons, such as a tree falling on a power line or a heat wave overwhelming the system’s capacity. In the United States, electricity pulses through the grid like a heartbeat at a standard frequency of 60&nbsp;hertz. That frequency can shift if demand increases beyond supply or if something in the system like a large generator goes offline. Even a small interruption in that 60-hertz heartbeat can cause ripple effects that the grid struggles to recover from.</p>



<p>Large power plants are designed to help the grid be resilient to these ripple effects. The inertia of their spinning generators buys time in the event of an unexpected power outage, and they continuously adjust their power output based on the frequency in the grid, keeping everything stable. But a power grid that incorporates large amounts of renewable energy, such as from wind turbines and solar panels, works very differently. It relies on devices known as inverters to convert the direct current, or DC, electricity produced by wind and solar facilities into alternating current, or AC, electricity for the grid. And renewable energy systems involving inverters don’t behave like traditional power plants do. “We’re dealing with a completely different physical system,” says Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez, an electrical engineer at the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The rise of renewables</h3>



<p>More U.S. electricity is now coming from renewable sources. Grid-forming inverters will likely play a large role in getting the energy safely into the power grid.</p>

<p>So researchers have been looking for ways to keep the grid stable as large power plants are retired and renewable energy makes up a larger percentage of U.S. electricity generation. The answer may lie in a special type of inverter, known as grid-forming inverters. These pieces of electrical equipment, which range in size from smaller than a microwave to as big as a shipping container, are specially programmed to work at the interface between something that produces or stores power — like wind turbines, solar panels and batteries — and the grid. Crucially, they are able to control the flow of renewable energy into the grid quickly and responsively, in ways that mimic the control from large power plants.</p>



<p>By adding some grid-forming inverters into an existing power grid, engineers can help replace the functions that are lost when the big plants retire. Grid-forming inverters also have other advantages, such as automatically restarting a grid that has gone offline. That can make society more resilient to the power outages that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">come with extreme weather</a> fueled by climate change, such as heat waves and hurricanes (<em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 22</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Solar and wind see a boom</h3>



<p>The amount of U.S. electricity generated by solar and wind power has increased dramatically over the last decade.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is a grid-forming inverter?</h4>



<p>Think of a grid-forming inverter as a mother duck with a bunch of baby ducklings trailing after it, says Dominic Gross, an electrical engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. A grid-forming inverter can inject voltage into a grid and then adjust its fre­quency according to however much power is flowing through the system. Other sources of electricity flowing into the grid, the baby ducklings, can then synchronize with that grid-forming inverter, just as they did with the flow of electricity that pulsed from power stations.</p>



<p>That gives grid-forming inverters a key role in getting more renewable energy into the power grid. Manufacturers including General Electric, Siemens, Tesla and Hitachi already make these devices, and they have been used for decades in isolated power grids, such as on small islands. Today, their use is expanding rapidly around the world as big power companies turn to the devices to handle the boom in renewable energy.</p>



<p>Adding grid-forming capabilities into renewable energy power systems is an easy first step that can make a dramatic difference in building a robust grid for the future, says Julia Matevosyan, chief engineer at the Energy Systems Integration Group in Austin, Texas. “We really have this window of opportunity now,” she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The future power grid</h3>



<p>Coal-fired and natural gas power plants are the backbone of today’s U.S. electrical grid. Wind and solar farms play a smaller role and use grid-following inverters (orange) to get more intermittent electricity into the system. But grid-forming inverters (blue) could help make way for a future grid that relies primarily on renewable energy. In the grid of the future, every home could have solar panels, and electric vehicles would have bidirectional charging, allowing them to return energy to the grid.</p>

<p>If you have solar panels on your house, you probably have an inverter in your garage. Energy companies use similar inverters at wind and solar power farms to convert large amounts of DC&nbsp;electricity into AC electricity to feed into the grid. But most of those are what’s known as grid-<em>following</em> inverters. They are like the baby ducklings trailing after their mother — they can do a few things on their own but they aren’t capable of running the system like an adult duck can.</p>



<p>A grid-forming inverter, though, can sense the changes in the grid and respond in real time to adjust its frequency, which injects more or less power as needed to stabilize the grid. Florian Dörfler, an electrical engineer at ETH Zurich, compares a group of grid-forming inverters in a power grid to a bunch of spinning bicycle wheels connected by an elastic band. If one of the wheels starts to slow a bit for some reason, the elastic band will transfer momentum from the others and bring it back into synchrony with the group.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Who&#8217;s using grid-forming inverters?</h4>



<p>Grid-forming inverters aren’t entirely new; they have been used around the world for decades for certain purposes. In the United States, they are mostly in microgrids, small electric power systems supplying isolated areas such as islands or small facilities.</p>



<p>In the 2010s, for instance, a group of researchers and industry professionals built a microgrid that incorporated grid-forming inverters at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, Calif. The microgrid used rooftop solar panels, five wind turbines, a fuel cell and battery storage to create a self-contained power system that operated for daily use but could also keep running independently from the main power grid in the event of an outage — crucial to maintaining security. Other microgrids that use grid-forming inverters include a military base on the Hawaiian island of Kauai and the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius.</p>



<p>The challenge now is scaling up from those small, self-sustained systems to larger power grids that incorporate a lot of renewable energy. Several nations have begun this effort, adding grid-forming inverters into their systems.</p>



<p>Australia is perhaps the world leader, with three large renewable energy facilities incorporating grid-forming inverters that recently became operational and three more such facilities in the works, for a total of 480 megawatts of power. A couple of these are in South Australia, where wind power has boomed in recent years. In December, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency announced it was investing <a href="https://www.energy.gov.au/news-media/news/arena-backs-8-grid-scale-batteries-worth-27-billion#:~:text=The%20Australian%20Renewable%20Energy%20Agency,with%20grid%2Dforming%20inverter%20technology." target="_blank" rel="noopener">176 million Australian dollars</a> (about $118&nbsp;million) in eight more projects to produce renewable energy using grid-forming technologies. All together those eight projects are designed to generate 2 gigawatts of power — 10 times the nation’s grid-forming capacity to date and a “groundbreaking” step in the right direction, Matevosyan says.</p>



<p>The United Kingdom is also investing in five new projects, including a 300-megawatt facility in Scotland due to be completed in 2024. In contrast, the United States has done little at the national level to encourage the adoption of grid-forming inverters, even as renewable energy production has roughly doubled in the past decade and now accounts for more than 20 percent of the country’s electricity generation. “The U.S. is probably 10 years behind the curve,” Dörfler says.</p>



<p>That may be changing. The U.S. Department of Energy is funding a $25 million effort to work on how to get more grid-forming inverters into the U.S. power system. The consortium, known as UNIFI, for “universal interoperability for grid-forming inverters,” is in its second of five years of research. It is <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/73476.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led by the National Renewable Energy Laborator</a>y in Golden, Colo., along with the University of Texas at Austin and the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Grids on the edge</h3>



<p>Electrical grids are showing their age — and they’re especially vulnerable to the cascading effects that can come with extreme weather. Here’s a look at some recent events that pushed grids to their brink.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/082623_electical-grid_sidebar-675x450.jpg" alt="A photo of a Texas highway covered in snow from February 2021 when a deep freeze paralyzed the state's power grid." class="wp-image-3130509" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/082623_electical-grid_sidebar-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/082623_electical-grid_sidebar-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/082623_electical-grid_sidebar-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/082623_electical-grid_sidebar.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3130509">BRETT COOMER/<em>HOUSTON CHRONICLE</em> VIA AP</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>February 2021</strong><br>A deep freeze across much of Texas (shown above) paralyzed electrical equipment and took much of the state&#8217;s grid offline, leading to hundreds of deaths.</p>



<p><strong>September 2021</strong><br>Hurricane Ida knocked out power to more than 1 million people in Louisiana, in part because of transmission lines couldn&#8217;t withstand the hurricane&#8217;s wind speeds.</p>



<p><strong>May 2022</strong><br>An intense windstorm across Ontario and Quebec, Canada, toppled power lines and ultimately left nearly a million people without power.</p>



<p><strong>June 2022</strong><br>A failure at a West Texas power plant triggered more failures across Texas&#8217; grid, including knocking 1.7 gigawatts of solar power generation offline.</p>



<p><strong>January 202</strong>3<br>A surge in voltage shut down Pakistan&#8217;s national grid, leaving more than 200 million people without power.</p>



<p><strong>June 2023</strong><br>A heat dome over northern Mexico and Texas nearly pushed Mexico&#8217;s power demand to exceed its supply.</p>

<p>So far, UNIFI has focused on basic issues such as drawing up suggested guidelines for how companies should build grid-forming inverters. Up until now, manufacturers worldwide have been making their own kinds of grid-forming inverters with little to no coordination among them. In December, UNIFI released draft standards meant to serve as a first step toward a national grid code that includes technical specifications for equipment; a second, updated version is expected by the end of the year.</p>



<p>UNIFI recently brought a handful of grid-forming inverters, acquired from different manufacturers, to NREL’s Colorado laboratory. There researchers are testing them in a 1-megawatt power system to see how they fare working in the same grid. A similar UNIFI effort is testing the performance of a larger number of grid-forming inverters made by two different manufacturers in a 20-megawatt system on Kauai.</p>



<p>The goal is to see whether inverters from different manufacturers can be smoothly integrated into a large power grid, and how much programming work it will take to get them to play nicely with one another. “How do you make millions of these things work together, collaboratively, in a large-scale network systems context?” asks Gross, who works with UNIFI. Such tests are just early steps in getting the United States caught up with other countries that already have grid-forming inverters working in their large power grids.</p>



<p>UNIFI hopes to raise the profile of grid-forming inverters and provide guidance to what is currently a Wild West landscape of different companies that manufacture them. But it will have to move fast to make a difference. “We are literally talking about transforming the entire electricity sector in like 15 years,” says Ben Kroposki, director of the power systems engineering center at NREL and the organizational director for UNIFI. “It took 140, 150 years to build what we have today. And so that’s just a monumental shift in the electric power sector.”</p>



<p>Inverters in a typical home solar panel system can cost several thousand dollars, with the cost higher for industrial-scale systems. But grid-forming equipment isn’t necessarily more expensive to produce than grid-following equipment is. Manufacturers charge a bit more to cover their research and development costs, but the difference is minimal for the benefit gained, Matevosyan says. Even as some nations are incentivizing energy companies to put in grid-forming technologies, she says that anyone building grid components today should incorporate them as a matter of course. “It just makes sense to have them grid-forming,” she says. “You can future-proof it.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are the open questions?</h4>



<p>Even as grid-forming inverters are adopted, there are research questions yet to be answered. One challenge is that it’s not yet clear how many inverters in grids of the future will need to be grid-forming. Theoretical calculations suggest that some grids will operate just fine getting 60 to 70 percent of their power from renewable sources using grid-following inverters. But others might crash at just 20 percent and will need to have more grid-forming inverters in the mix, Gross says.</p>



<p>The number for any grid will depend on factors such as the grid’s age, stability and geometry. A densely interconnected network of power production facilities such as in Europe might need a much smaller percentage of grid-forming inverters than a long, strung-out network such as that along the Australian coast.</p>



<p>The U.S. power grid is actually three separate grids, in the eastern and western parts of the country and in Texas, all with varying inverter needs. And some power operators might choose to disconnect their coal- or gas-fired plants but retain some large nuclear or hydroelectric facilities, which would continue to support the synchrony of the grid and demand fewer grid-forming inverters.</p>

<p>Other research frontiers include figuring out new ways to diagnose and fix problems in the grid. A short circuit in a grid component, for example, can suddenly inject large amounts of current, a surge that traditional power plants can handle automatically by disconnecting the malfunctioning part. Grid-forming inverters cannot tolerate large spikes in current, making it harder to solve these problems in real time. “How to do so efficiently and safely is still a big research question,” says Rodrigo Henriquez-Auba, an electrical engineer in Mountain View, Calif., who works with UNIFI.</p>



<p>Some scientists, including Dörfler, are exploring how a power grid with a lot of grid-forming inverters could provide power in new ways. By taking extra steps to optimize how the inverters work together, researchers can move the system closer to what some describe as a virtual power plant — in which many small-scale renewable energy devices effectively function as a single traditional power plant. That might mean programming inverters to quickly draw power out of a battery and inject it to make the grid more robust to unexpected fluctuations. Machine learning techniques may help, by training inverters on real-world data to fine-tune operations.</p>



<p>Of course, there are many other challenges to building the grid of the future, such as figuring out better ways to store electricity from solar and wind farms, how to build the necessary transmission lines and how to speed up the connection of renewable power facilities to the grid, currently backlogged due to regulatory issues.</p>



<p>Hidalgo-Gonzalez says that the electrical grid of the future needs to be stronger and more resilient for everyone. Today’s U.S. power grid fosters a lot of societal inequities. It tends to be weak and less reliable, for example, in lower-income communities that are more vulnerable to extreme weather than it is in wealthier communities. In 2021, for instance, Hurricane Ida knocked out power to more than 1 million people in Louisiana, with some lower-income communities not getting it back for weeks.</p>



<p>Renewable energy, bolstered by grid-forming inverters, can play a big role in making the grid more resilient and equitable, Hidalgo-Gonzalez says. “We need to go really fast,” she says, “if we want to take climate change seriously.”</p>

<p>Nearly four years after a critic pointed out flaws in a paper about a controversial research tool involved in nearly 20 retractions, the owner of that instrument has lost the article after he failed to overcome the editors’ concerns about the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The owner is <a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/donald-e-morisky">Donald Morisky</a>, of the University of California, Los Angeles, whose name should be well-familiar to readers of Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morisky developed the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), then began charging researchers up to six-figure sums to license the use of the tool in their own studies. Those who didn’t sign agreements in advance were ordered to retract their papers that used the MMAS, pay Morisky’s company retroactively, or risk legal action. (We wrote about all this in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pay-or-retract-survey-creators-demands-money-rile-some-health-researchers"><em>Science</em></a> back in 2017. We also wrote about how Morisky and his former business partner, Steve Trubow, have been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/02/duo-that-used-legal-threats-to-force-scientists-to-pay-for-a-tool-face-off-in-court/">engaged in litigation</a> over ownership of a spin-off “widget” Trubow says belongs to him. That case <a href="https://casetext.com/case/morisky-v-mmas-research-llc-21">is ongoing</a>.)</p>



<span id="more-127750"></span>



<p>In fall 2021, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/20/publisher-investigating-paper-a-lucrative-scale-is-based-on-following-retraction-watch-reporting/">we reported</a> the <em>Journal of Clinical Hypertension</em> had launched an investigation into a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1751-7176.2008.07572.x">2008 paper</a> about medication adherence by Morisky and his colleagues. The article built on Morisky’s initial MMAS-4, expanding the instrument into its current form, the MMAS-8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in 2019, Michael Ortiz, of the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia, had identified flaws with the reported sensitivity and specificity of the MMAS-8 as reported in the article. Ortiz also noted that Morisky had neglected to disclose his financial interest in the MMAS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Ortiz, “the MMAS-8 scores may be no more accurate in detecting patients with uncontrolled [blood pressure], than tossing a coin to decide.”</p>



<p>Ortiz took his concerns to the journal, which effectively ignored him until April 2021, when it published <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jch.14353">a letter</a> in which he outlined his findings, the gist of which was:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In conclusion, the [sensitivity and specificity] and accuracy values reported in this paper are mathematically implausible. The [sensitivity and specificity] values are inconsistent with the patient data and they overstate the diagnostic properties of the MMAS-8. Unless these inconsistencies are resolved, it would appear that, based on the study results in Point 2 and the meta-analysis2 the MMAS-8 scores may be no more accurate in detecting patients with uncontrolled BP, than tossing a coin to decide.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Several months later, we learned that Wiley was investigating the matter. The fruit of that inquiry was slow-growing: Nearly two years after we reported on the investigation, the <em>JCH</em> has retracted Morisky’s paper, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jch.14718">stating</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The above article, published online on May 02, 2008 on Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the journal&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief, Dr. Ji-Guang Wang, and Wiley Periodicals LLC. Following publication, concerns were raised by a third party regarding the statistical analysis presented in the article. The Journal conducted an independent statistical review of the article and concluded that the results were misleading due to issues regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the medical adherence scale used. The authors responded to the Journal&#8217;s request to address the findings of the independent statistical review, but were unable to adequately address the concerns. As a result, the Journal no longer has confidence in the reported conclusions and is issuing this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article has been cited 1,889 times, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. Of those, 259 have come since October 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ortiz told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am&nbsp; disappointed that the Authors of Morisky et al 2008, failed to respond to my concerns in a timely manner. This situation was compounded by a Journal Editor who failed to follow Guidelines and then took more than two years to act to the Authors failure to respond to my concerns.</p>



<p>What will be even more interesting is how other articles ( that used the MMAS-8 to assess medication adherence) are treated.&nbsp; I have noted similar erroneous results&nbsp; in a number of articles. which claimed to have found similar Sensitivity &amp; Specificity results following the Morisky et al methods. &nbsp; I hope these authors consider withdrawing their articles</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What upsets me the most is the fact that a questionable instrument was used by so many intelligent researchers when all the signals pointed to a problem with the validity of the instrument.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Morisky did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trubow said the retraction was “not good publicity for the scales,” but that it wouldn’t affect Morisky’s copyright of the instrument. However, he noted, the news might be alarming to the drug companies that have cited the 2008 paper in their research about medication adherence for their products. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I know of at least 100 articles by PHARMA for BIG clinical trials for medications that used the article as the evidence basis for using the MMAS-8 to measure adherence. This is huge.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/india-chandrayaan-moon-landing">India’s successful moon landing follows recent failures by other countries</a></h4>

              
                <p>Space is hard, as the saying goes.</p>



<p>As humans have endeavored to launch themselves and their machines beyond Earth, that maxim has been proven again and again. Recent attempts to touch down on the moon — a feat first accomplished nearly 60 years ago by the former Soviet Union’s robotic Luna-9 probe — have been particularly fraught with failure.</p>



<p>But on August 23, an Indian spacecraft, for the first time, successfully landed on the surface of the moon.</p>





<p>The Chandrayaan-3 mission, which launched July 14, delivered the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover to the south pole of the moon, a region <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-moon-poles-ancient-volcano-eruption-water">thought to contain water ice</a> (<em>SN: 5/24/22</em>).</p>



<p>Such reservoirs of water ice would provide a crucial source of not only drinking water for any future lunar inhabitants but also hydrogen for fuel. This was the country’s second attempt at a lunar landing, following <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/india-moon-lander-vikram-isro">the crash of Chandrayaan-2’s lander in 2019</a> (<em>SN: 9/20/19</em>).</p>



<p>Vikram’s landing catapults India into a rarefied group of nations that have successfully made a “soft landing” — as opposed to an uncontrolled “hard landing” — on the moon: the United States, the former Soviet Union and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-landed-moon-missions-apollo-top-science-stories-2019-yir">China</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). The success of the mission, however, follows close on the heels of recent failures.</p>



<p>On August 19, Russia’s Luna-25 lander crashed into the moon. The car-sized spacecraft had been orbiting the moon for several days when, according to Russia’s space agency, communications were lost after the craft fired its engines during prelanding maneuvers. Luna-25 was bound for the vicinity of Boguslavsky crater near the moon’s south pole, where it would have studied the moon’s surface and tenuous atmosphere.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, on April 25, Japan’s Hakuto-R Mission 1 lander also crashed on the moon’s surface. According to ispace, the private company that developed the mission, the crash occurred because onboard software miscalculated the lander’s altitude above the lunar surface. The lander was slated to touch down in Atlas crater on the nearside of the moon and study lunar dust.</p>



<p>Despite its relative proximity of just under 400,000 kilometers, the moon is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/israel-moon-mission-spacecraft-crash">a challenging target for spacecraft seeking to land</a> (<em>SN: 4/11/19</em>). That’s in large part because our nearest celestial neighbor lacks an atmosphere.</p>



<p>The go-to mechanism for slowing down a descending object on Earth — a parachute — is therefore useless, says Dave Williams, a lunar and planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “The only way to slow yourself down is with rockets.” That’s where things get tricky, he says, since firing a rocket means controlling its orientation and thrust, among other things.</p>



<p>The moon’s gravity, while only roughly one-sixth that of Earth’s, is strong enough to have a deleterious effect on a crippled spacecraft in free fall, Williams says. (Spacecraft landing on a comet or asteroid have it easier because those bodies’ gravitational fields are generally so weak there’s little danger of a crash.)</p>



<p>There’s also the challenge of determining a safe landing site. An area that appears smooth as seen from orbit might in fact be littered with boulders or other obstacles, Williams says. A spacecraft’s software must be capable of evaluating the terrain on its own.</p>



<p>Relying on human operators back on Earth isn’t feasible, Williams says, because there’s too long a lag in communications due to the finite speed of light. “You’re always 2.5 seconds behind.”</p>





<p>Even so, the moon remains an appealing target, and on August 26, Japan will try again. The country’s space agency is slated to launch its Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, mission from the Tanegashima Space Center. No landing date has been announced, but if all goes well, the probe — designed as a technology demonstration — will eventually touch down near Shioli crater on the nearside of the moon.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dna-telomere-chromosomes-pangenome">The Y chromosome’s genetic puzzle is finally complete</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human Y chromosome, responsible for determining male sex, finally has gotten an end-to-end examination.</p>



<p>Researchers sequenced the chromosome, which contains many genes involved in sperm production and fertility, from a male of European descent. The new telomere-to-telomere, or tip-to-tip, construction <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06457-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adds more than 30 million DNA bases</a> to a previously assembled reference Y chromosome, the team reports online August 23 in <em>Nature</em>. It is the final piece of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-human-pangenome-biology-dna-diversity">human pangenome</a>, an effort to catalog all human DNA (<em>SN: 5/10/23</em>).</p>





<p>The Y chromosome is the smallest of the human chromosomes. “In the old time, people thought that it&#8217;s just a junkyard for human genomic material, and it only serves one purpose … to determine male sex,” says Yun-Fai Chris Lau, a human geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the work. Like comedian Rodney Dangerfield, the Y chromosome gets no respect, he says.</p>



<p>But it’s clear that the Y does more than determining male sex, Lau says. Some males lose the Y chromosome from some of their cells. The loss puts them <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/men-who-lose-y-chromosome-have-high-risk-cancer">at risk for cancer</a>, Alzheimer’s disease and other illnesses (<em>SN: 10/26/14</em>). Having a truly complete reference Y chromosome will allow researchers to better understand the role the chromosome plays in the body, he says.</p>



<p>Though small, the Y chromosome has intimidated many researchers because it has so many repetitive bits of DNA, says Adam Phillippy, a bioinformatics researcher at the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Md., who led the project.</p>



<p>There are repeated sequences of DNA letters, or bases — the information-carrying building blocks of DNA — laid end to end and stretching for millions of bases like seemingly endless rows of identical puzzle pieces. Some parts of the chromosome have the puzzle pieces inverted. And some stretches of DNA contain palindromes; the DNA letters read the same in both directions. Then there are multiple copies of individual genes.</p>



<p>All that repetition makes it difficult to tell exactly where in the puzzle a particular piece goes, so scientists saved those repeating parts for last, Phillippy says. “When you&#8217;re putting your puzzle back together again you always save the repetitive bits, like the grass or the trees or the sky, for the end.”</p>



<p>A separate study, also published online August 23 in <em>Nature</em>, sequenced the entire Y chromosome from 43 people, including 21 of African descent. That study found that the male sex chromosome can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06425-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vary in length</a> from person to person by millions of DNA bases, meaning that in some people, the chromosome has extra copies of some genes or other bits of DNA. For instance, males may have between 23 to 39 copies of TSPY genes, involved in sperm production, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Having complete Y chromosomes from multiple people helped Phillippy and colleagues clear up a mystery. The old reference chromosome had the TSPY2 gene located near one tip of the chromosome. But the telomere-to-telomere version showed it close to the centromere — the pinched-in part of the chromosome — and backward compared with the reference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We confirmed that it was correct in our assembly, so then we were just assuming that it was an error in the old assembly,” Phillippy says. But the second study showed that both versions were right. TSPY2 has jumped around on the chromosome. Some people have it at one location, while others have it at the other.</p>



<p>Having multiple copies of TSPY genes, and the varying location of TSPY2, may affect the genes’ activity and effect on sperm production, Lau says. Some previous studies have hinted that varying numbers of copies may affect fertility, while other studies have found no relationship. The more precise information from the new studies may help settle the debate, or at least give researchers more clues about how the genes influence sperm production, he says.</p>



<p>The new research may help scientists learn more about the evolution of the Y chromosome, Phillippy says. And eventually, studying its genes and their variants may lead to a better understanding of fertility and treatments for infertility, he says, but such medical applications are probably years away.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leaves-tropical-forests-photosynthesis-heat-limit">Some leaves in tropical forests may be getting too hot for photosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like people, leaves have their limits when it comes to heat.</p>



<p>Scientists first reported in 1864 that the leaves of some plants could survive up to 50° Celsius, only to perish beyond that threshold. More than 150 years later, researchers are making similar findings. In 2021, a study of 147 tropical tree species reported that the average temperature beyond which photosynthesis failed was <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pce.14060" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46.7° C</a>.</p>



<p>Now, in the upper canopies of Earth’s tropical forests, roughly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06391-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in every 10,000 leaves</a> experiences temperatures at least once a year that may be too high for photosynthesis, researchers report August 23 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>That might seem a paltry sum, but a photosynthetic breakdown could harm entire forests if climate change is not halted, the scientists warn. A rise of about 4 degrees C above current temperatures in tropical forests could potentially cause wide swaths of leaves to die en masse, simulations suggest. Still, the researchers acknowledge that the prediction comes with uncertainties. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One small possibility that we&#8217;re suggesting … is an incredibly dire tipping point” beyond which tropical forests perish, Christopher Doughty, an ecologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, said at an August 21 news briefing. But “there&#8217;s a lot we don’t know.”</p>



<p>When leaves get too hot, their photosynthetic machinery — proteins that convert light energy into sugars — breaks down. Keen to figure out whether tropical forests were approaching such a threshold, Doughty and colleagues obtained data collected by <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/ecosystem-spaceborne-thermal-radiometer-experiment-on-space-station-ecostress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECOSTRESS</a>, a thermal sensor aboard the International Space Station, which captures vegetation temperatures on Earth’s surface in 70-meter pixels<strong>. </strong>That’s about the area that two large tropical trees could fill.</p>



<p>The team compared the data with measurements from devices on the planet’s surface. These included an instrument in the Amazon, mounted 64 meters high on a tower, as well as swarms of sensors taped to the bottoms of leaves in Brazil, Puerto Rico, Panama and Australia.</p>



<p>The analysis revealed a mosaic of temperatures in forest canopies. During periods when forests were hot and their soils were dry, temperatures across the canopy could reach an average peak of 34° C. But there was variability; some tracts exceeded 40° C.</p>



<p>The comparison also revealed a detail unseen by ECOSTRESS — a scatter within the mosaic. Individual leaf temperatures varied in single forest tracts, with some leaves reaching temperatures that far exceeded the tract average. About 0.01 percent of the time, upper canopy leaves sweltered at temperatures above the 46.7° C threshold, the team found.</p>



<p>The researchers also analyzed data from leaf-warming experiments in Brazil, Puerto Rico and Australia. These experiments showed that each degree of ambient warming had a disproportionate impact on leaf temperatures. For example, when Amazon leaves were subjected to an additional 2 degrees C of ambient warming, maximum leaf temperatures rose from 42.8° to 50.9° C.</p>



<p>The team used the experimental data, along with the satellite and ground-based data, to simulate the future of tropical forests under climate change. Most forests could endure about 4 degrees C of warming above current levels before trees lose all their leaves, and potentially die, the simulations suggest. That amount of warming might be possible by 2100 in a worst-case scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions continue rising through the century, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Still, there’s a lot of uncertainty. That’s in part because the adaptive capabilities of different tree species and how the deaths of individual leaves impact a tree’s mortality aren’t well understood. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study may even overestimate vulnerability by “assuming that when leaves hit this critical temperature, they die,” says ecologist Christopher Still of Oregon State University in Corvallis. That’s possible, he says, but we don’t fully understand how long it takes various temperatures to kill different species’ leaves.</p>





<p>Predicting the future of these forests will also require more insights into what’s unfolding beneath the canopy, says ecologist Marielle Smith of Bangor University in Wales. “There is still a question mark over the role of small trees and understory leaves, which aren’t going to be as hot.”</p>



<p>Among tropical forests, the Amazon may be most vulnerable to the type of reckoning predicted by the researchers. “There’s more trees dying [there] now than there were 10 years ago or 20 years ago. We don’t see that in Africa,” Doughty said. That could be because “temperatures are a bit hotter … in the Amazon than in Africa.”</p>



<p>Some researchers have been warning for years that climate change and deforestation could trigger <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-tipping-trouble-climate-cerrado">large parts of the Amazon</a> to transform into savanna and shrubland (<em>SN: 6/16/23</em>).</p>



<p>“This is a glimpse into a potential tipping point. It’s not saying that the tropical forests are now going to be savannas tomorrow,” study coauthor and ecologist Joshua Fisher of Chapman University in Orange, Calif., said at the briefing. “We can now see this insight … and because we can see that, it means we can act.”</p>

<p>Two institutional investigations that concluded in 2016 and 2019 found scientific misconduct in multiple publications from the lab of a leading urologist at the University of California, San Francisco, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigations could not determine who had manipulated the published images of experimental data, but the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2019-RD-investigation-report.pdf">2019 report</a> concluded that Rajvir Dahiya, also director of the urology research center at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, “was senior/last author on all these publications and therefore responsible for the results.” Dahiya retired in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two investigation reports, which we obtained through a public records request, along with the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2014-inquiry-report.pdf">reports</a> from the preliminary <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2018-inquiry-report.pdf">inquiries</a> preceding the investigations, recommend notifying the journals that published eight papers of the issues identified. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/08/professor-emeritus-loses-fourth-paper-after-ucsf-va-investigation-five-years-after-other-retractions/">Four</a> have <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dDahiya%252c%2bRajvir">so far</a> been retracted, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/20/ucsf-va-investigation-finds-misconduct-in-highly-cited-pnas-paper/">one corrected</a>, and two marked with expressions of concern. One of those expressions of concern was published last month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In comments to Retraction Watch, Dahiya blamed the findings that research misconduct occurred in his lab on the age of the papers. He said the VA destroyed notebooks with original data that had been stored in a central facility after the required data retention period had lapsed: </p>



<span id="more-127745"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The major concern was that the original data was not found to address these concerns. On one hand, the VA/UCSF storage facility discarded all our original data, and on the other hand, the VA/UCSF committee wanted original data to address their concerns and thus blamed us that we fasified [sic] this data.&nbsp; We also carried out a series of new experiments to generate new original data to address all their concerns but they did not agree with the new data either.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2016-investigation-report.pdf">investigation report from 2016</a>, the committee called the overall lack of raw data or draft manuscripts and figures “puzzling,” and noted that Dahiya had said the lab began keeping digital copies of data in 2005.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya told the committee that the relevant lab notebooks were lost during laboratory moves. However, the report stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is no direct evidence for this occurring, and neither the former nor current ACOS [Associate Chief of Staff] for Research at the San Francisco VAMC has any record or recollection of such a loss.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The committee considered whether data may have been destroyed intentionally, but decided that because much of the lab’s data was lost, rather than data related only to the allegations of manipulation, the loss was “consistent with a chronic, general laxity of data management” rather than misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the committee concluded Dahiya had been “negligent in his duties as a laboratory director,” they did not believe his actions met the criteria for research misconduct due to recklessness:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is no clear evidence that his failure to maintain research records was done with the intention or knowledge that his behavior incurred the risk of data fabrication or falsification, i.e., scientific misconduct by members of his research group.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report determined that four of Dahiya’s publications “​​contain instances of data fabrication or falsification,” and recommended notifying the journals as one of four corrective actions. The committee also recommended that Dahiya “develop a systematic, comprehensive approach for data storage, including the archiving of original data, images, and laboratory notebooks,” and periodically audit his lab’s work for scientific integrity with a research integrity officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another recommendation that Dahiya should work with a research integrity officer to train his lab members in scientific integrity, the committee wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since no single individual was clearly responsible for this misconduct, it is likely that the instances of misconduct described in the four allegations represent the actions of multiple individuals over a period of years. This suggests that the research environment in the Respondent’s lab does not adequately foster or oversee ethically sound scientific practices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to the committee’s recommended actions, Bonnie S. Graham, the director of the San Francisco VA Health Care System, who certified the report, recommended a review of Dahiya’s “suitability … to function as a PI and/or to supervise research at the VA.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Dahiya’s employment timeline (<a href="https://archive.li/PP2BB#selection-2801.25-2801.146">archived</a> from the UCSF website before his emeritus status ended and the page became unavailable) nor his <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/zmg7k8elQ0SnUvFD788ycQ/projects">grant funding history</a> indicate that he ceased functioning as a PI. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The second investigation, concluded in 2019, identified manipulated data in six papers. Some of the flagged figures came from papers that had been included in the first investigation. The committee wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The manipulation of Western blot gels and splicing of gels have been pervasive in the Dahiya lab. … There are numerous examples of manipulation of data to make the results fit what was expected, for example, a blank space on a gel to represent a negative control that was not run.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to notifying the journals that had published the papers, the committee recommended that all lab members receive training on best practices for publishing figures, and that Dahiya “must audit data to be published from his laboratory and document that published figures are accurate until no longer determined necessary.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya “may not apply for external funding until these Corrective Actions are in place and documented,” the report stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report is dated Sept. 4, 2019, but the committee members did not sign it until January 2020. Dahiya retired that June. We asked him about the committee’s recommendations regarding data auditing and prohibition of applying for grants, and he told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The committee recommended that all the data from our lab must be submitted to the VAMC Chief of Staff for Research. We strictly followed all the guidelines recommended by the committee.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/07/ucsf-va-investigations-find-clear-evidence-misconduct-cancer-papers/">previously reported</a> on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/25/ucsf-va-letters-journals-offer-insight-misconduct-investigations/">letters</a> UCSF and the VA have sent to journals asking them to retract papers, and how one journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/16/when-it-takes-two-university-federal-agency-letters-and-five-years-for-a-journal-to-retract-a-paper/">took five years</a> to heed the request. That journal wasn’t the only one taking its time: Last month, the <em>British Journal of Cancer</em>, a Springer Nature title, placed an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-023-02365-0">expression of concern</a> on a paper flagged in the 2019 VA/UCSF report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The expression of concern highlights a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-018-0146-2">correction from 2018</a> that replaced a figure in the paper, and states that the VA/UCSF investigation “could not establish that the data in the replacement panels … corresponded to the data of the original experiments. … Readers should therefore interpret the results and conclusions presented with caution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya disagreed with the expression of concern. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On May 18th 2018, Dr. Hiroshi Hirata voluntarily proposed to replace Figure 4D as a correction and the Editor-in-chief and Scientific Publications Manager of Brit. J. Cancer agreed to go ahead with a correction of this figure.</p>



<p>Now on August 16th 2023 (after 5 years), the VA / UCSF investigation committee does not agree with this correction and forces Brit. J. Cancer to write this statement.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dahiya also forwarded us <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fwd_-_Request-for-correction-Br.-J.-Cancer-2014-1106_-1645-1654.pdf">an email chain</a> between Hirata and the journal, which began with a May 8, 2018 email in which Hirata wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I got Email [sic] from Dr Dahiya to contact you about correction [sic].</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The inquiry report with allegations about two figures in the paper, including the one that Hirata sought to correct, was dated Feb. 7, 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After going back and forth with detailed questions about the new figure, the journal’s scientific publications manager conveyed the editor in chief’s decision to publish a correction on May 18.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation report acknowledged the correction, but stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>without original data showing pictures (negative and positive) taken at the same time, we conclude intentional research misconduct occurred because the reuse of different frames of the same data to represent 2 conditions is research misconduct and this activity constitutes a significant departure from accepted research practices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the report’s proposed action to take on the paper did not seem to recommend contacting the journal over the corrected figure, but only to assess whether the journal should be notified of another figure showing a gel that had been spliced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature said that due to the “uncertainty around the data” in the corrected figure, the editor in chief of the journal felt the expression of concern “was the most appropriate editorial action to take.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the notice appearing nearly four years after the investigation report was finalized, the spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal became aware of the outcome of the institutional investigation during a period of significant transition while journal ownership transferred to Springer Nature and the previous Editor-in-Chief retired. Additionally, we spent some time attempting to contact some of the authors and, regretfully, together this led to some delays in our handling of the matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Only one of the eight papers that the investigations identified as containing manipulated data remains without some sort of notice:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p>Dahiya disagreed with all the retractions. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Other journals did not agree with the VA/UCSF investigation committee report and thus no further actions were taken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the journals that published our papers did not have any problems with our data. But the VA/UCSF investigation committee members forced these four journals to retract our papers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another preliminary inquiry, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2021-inquiry-report.pdf">completed in 2021</a>, determined the single allegation of falsified data it concerned did not warrant a full investigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-stomped-salutes-thunder-god-dance-floor">Pre-Inca people stomped salutes to their thunder god on a special dance floor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Roughly a century before the Inca empire came to power in A.D. 1400, blasts of human-produced thunder may have rumbled off a ridge high in the Andes Mountains.</p>



<p>New evidence indicates that people who lived there around 700 years ago stomped rhythmically on a special dance floor that amplified their pounding into a thunderous boom as they worshipped a thunder god.</p>



<p>Excavations at a high-altitude site in Peru called Viejo Sangayaico have revealed how members of a regional farming and herding group, the Chocorvos, constructed this reverberating platform, says archaeologist Kevin Lane of the University of Buenos Aires. Different layers of soil, ash and guano created a floor that absorbed shocks while emitting resonant sounds when people stomped on it. This ceremonial surface <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278416523000314" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked like a large drum</a> that groups of 20 to 25 people could have played with their feet, Lane reports in the September <em>Journal of Anthropological Archaeology</em>.</p>





<p>These findings, from a ridgetop ritual area that faces a nearby mountain peak, provide a rare glimpse of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-trumpets-played-eerie-notes">the role played by sound and dance in ancient societies</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/10</em>).</p>



<p>While working at Viejo Sangayaico in 2014, Lane’s team first noticed that one of two open-air platforms located in a ritual area sounded hollow when people walked on it.</p>



<p>A later excavation of part of the platform uncovered six sediment deposits consisting of various mixes of silty clay, sand, ash and other materials. Ashy layers within a section of guano from animals such as llamas and alpacas included small cavities that helped to generate drumlike sounds from the platform’s surface, Lane says.</p>



<p>His team acoustically tested the platform by stomping on it one at a time and in groups of two to four while measuring the noise produced. The same was done while a circle of four people stomp-danced across the platform.</p>



<p>The resulting sounds ranged in intensity from 60 to 80 decibels, roughly equivalent to between a loud conversation and a noisy restaurant, Lane says. Larger groups of Chocorvos dancers, possibly accompanied by singing and musical instruments, would have raised a much bigger racket.</p>



<p>Spanish historical documents describe Chocorvos beliefs in thunder, lightning, earthquake and water deities. Supernatural convictions may have inspired ancient ceremonies at Viejo Sangayaico that included stomp dancing aimed at emulating a thunder god’s signature blasts, Lane suggests. In line with that suggestion, remains of a possible temple near the percussive platform included pottery pieces displaying snake images that, in the local Quechua language, refer to water or rivers and, in some instances, lightning.</p>



<p>Pre-Inca stomp dancing may also have influenced a dance practiced by the Chorcovos and other Andean groups in the mid-1500s, after Spanish conquest of the Incas in 1532, Lane suspects. The Chorcovos had been subjects of the Inca Empire for most of its run. As part of a resistance movement against Spanish culture called <em>Taki Onqoy</em>, Andeans danced and trembled ecstatically in circles, possibly to evoke spirits of their traditional deities.</p>



<p>Finding another percussive platform along with artifacts related to water and lightning rituals at other ancient Andean sites would better support Lane’s argument that sound-amplifying platforms provided a way to honor a thunder god as part of broader ceremonial events, says anthropological archaeologist Kylie Quave. To that end, researchers can now excavate platforms at other sites to check for guano layers and other elements of drumlike dance floors, says Quave, of George Washington University in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Whether makers of the Viejo Sangayaico platform designed it to amplify sounds, Chocorvos people could have discovered the surface’s drumlike properties and then used it for ceremonial dancing, says Miriam Kolar, an archaeoacoustics researcher at Stanford University.</p>



<p>Evidence of other sound-altering structures has also been found at Andean sites older than Viejo Sangayaico, Kolar says. Conch-shell horns found in a ceremonial center at <a href="https://culturalacoustics.org/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a roughly 3,000-year-old site called Chavin de Huántar</a> could have produced a range of sounds, from nearly pure tones to loud roars, that were emphasized in ceremonially important passages and ventilation shafts, Kolar and colleagues have found.</p>





<p>People today who live near Viejo Sangayaico say that another ancient site in the area contains a similar platform that resonates underfoot. Lane and colleagues have yet to visit that site.</p>



<p>Finding more sound-amplifying platforms will depend on “having your ear attuned to how different parts of a site sound,” Lane says, “which is something that archaeologists rarely do.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/health-risks-persist-2-years-covid-19">Health risks can persist at least 2 years after COVID-19, new data suggest</a></h4>

              
                <p>The risk of experiencing such health issues as diabetes, fatigue or blood clots can persist for at least two years after a coronavirus infection, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>That finding is based on the health records of about 140,000 U.S. veterans infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic, compared with nearly 6 million more who did not test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Researchers used veterans’ new diagnoses of health issues, lab results and prescription records to identify health problems that emerged starting a month after getting COVID-19.</p>





<p>Even two years after their infections, people who had COVID-19 were at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02521-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher risk for many health issues</a> — ranging from heart disease to gastrointestinal problems, the team reports August 21 in <em>Nature Medicine.</em></p>



<p>Patients who were hospitalized during their initial COVID-19 cases were more likely to experience these health problems, the team found. But those with milder initial infections were still at higher risk for about one-third of the medical issues that the scientists analyzed, compared with people who didn’t test positive. As most COVID-19 cases are milder, this group represents a greater burden to the health care system, says Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at the Veterans Affairs Saint Louis Health Care System.</p>



<p>The most common problems align with common long COVID symptoms identified in other studies, such as fatigue, memory problems, loss of smell, blood clots, metabolic issues and gastrointestinal problems. For example, initially hospitalized patients were about 1.88 times as likely to experience acute gastritis, or stomach inflammation as those with no record of COVID-19 at two years after infection; non-hospitalized patients had a risk factor of 1.44 times.</p>



<p>“Long COVID represents a significant burden of disease and disability,” says Al-Aly, who is also affiliated with Washington University in Saint Louis. A coronavirus infection can “result in heart disease, result in brain problems,” and many other long-term risks which scientists are just beginning to understand.</p>



<p>While the patients in the study were predominantly male and older, the findings align with Upinder Singh’s experience seeing patients at Stanford University’s long COVID clinic. “This is an important set of data,” she says.</p>



<p>The findings also match patients’ experiences with persistent symptoms, says Lisa McCorkell, a long COVID patient and researcher at the Patient-Led Research Collaborative. In particular, she noted that autonomic nervous system issues, which can lead to symptoms like pain and fatigue, persisted for both groups of patients in the study and even increased over time for the non-hospitalized group. Many people with long COVID have also been diagnosed with this condition.</p>



<p>Al-Aly and colleagues examined 77 medical problems that may arise after an acute COVID-19 case. Two years after infection, COVID-19 patients who hadn’t been hospitalized for severe symptoms early on – about 120,000 of those in the study — remained at higher risk for 24 of the 77 issues, compared with people who hadn’t tested positive. Those who had been hospitalized were at higher risk for 50 of the 77 issues, suggesting that worse symptoms in the acute phase can contribute to a greater chance of long COVID.</p>



<p>Initially hospitalized patients also had higher risks of going to the hospital again or dying in the two years following their COVID-19 infections, the researchers found. These risks tapered off for people who had milder cases early on, as did some specific health risks, including low blood oxygen levels and memory problems.</p>



<p>Overall, Al-Aly and colleagues found that for every 1,000 people infected with the coronavirus, a cumulative 150 years of healthy life is lost due to these patient’s struggles with persistent symptoms. This finding demonstrates “how destructive long COVID can be,” McCorkell says. Other studies, such as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Census’ Household Pulse Survey</a>, similarly found that long COVID can severely restrict day-to-day life for many patients.<s></s></p>



<p>The study does have limitations. Because it used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/researchers-fill-the-gaps-long-covid-data">electronic health records</a>, only information available to the medical system can be analyzed (<em>SN: 11/28/22</em>). The researchers couldn’t assess some common long COVID symptoms that are not typically captured by doctor’s visits, such as post-exertional malaise (PEM). “When it comes to a symptom clinicians have never heard of before, like PEM, [health records don’t capture] the full picture,” says Jaime Seltzer, an expert on myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome who heads scientific and medical outreach with the advocacy group #MEAction. This chronic condition shares many symptoms with long COVID.</p>





<p>Seltzer also notes that the study may be skewed by its veteran population. About 90 percent of veteran records included were from men, while long COVID and other similar chronic conditions are more common among women. Some health issues that are more common for women with long COVID, such as long-term neurological and endocrine symptoms, may be underrepresented, she says.</p>



<p>The study also didn’t include people who may have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but failed to get a positive test result in early 2020, when tests were not widely available. In fact, many of the people included as controls could have “actually had COVID-19,” Singh says.</p>



<p>Despite the caveats, <a>with </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/expect-coronavirus-fall-endemic-variants">COVID-19 transmission rising again</a> in recent weeks, the study offers a reminder that “it’s still worth it to protect yourself,” Al-Aly says (<em>SN: 8/21/23</em>). Even a mild infection could lead to health problems in the months or years that follow.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stuart-pimm.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="133" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stuart-pimm.jpg?resize=133%2C200" alt="" class="wp-image-24038" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stuart Pimm</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>One of the world&#8217;s foremost conservation biologists is being accused of plagiarism and bullying by a former PhD student, Retraction Watch has learned. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The biologist, <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm">Stuart Pimm</a> of Duke University, strongly denies the charges, but he and his colleagues have acknowledged the existence of “closely related” work following an internal investigation by Duke.</p>



<p>The allegations surfaced late last month on X, formerly known as Twitter, in <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpalacio/status/1684955038156832769">a thread that quickly went viral</a>, garnering hundreds of thousands of views and drawing comments from a broad swath of scientists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the thread, <a href="https://rdpalacio.co/">Ruben Dario Palacio</a> claimed his former academic advisor &#8220;threatened to kick me out of Duke&#8221; to make him work faster. Palacio decided to change labs due to the alleged &#8220;bullying and harassment,&#8221; he said, and three months later, in April 2020, published his research as <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.064477v1">a preprint</a>. The article <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.13424">appeared</a> in the journal <em>Diversity and Distributions</em> in October 2021.</p>



<span id="more-127733"></span>



<p>But in November 2021, Pimm’s group published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259299">a paper</a> in <em>PLOS ONE</em> describing work that was &#8220;remarkably similar to mine, and I was not cited. It&#8217;s plagiarism,&#8221; Palacio wrote on X.</p>



<p>In an interview with Retraction Watch, he said he believes Pimm&#8217;s actions were meant as retribution.</p>



<p>&#8220;He wanted to retaliate against me for … having the balls to leave his lab because no one else had done it before, to my knowledge,&#8221; Palacio said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In support of his accusations, he has shared several emails with Retraction Watch, as well as a secret <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/last_interaction_with_Stuart.mp3">recording</a> of a conversation he had with Pimm before they parted ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pimm, a professor at Duke&#8217;s Nicholas School of the Environment, said Palacio&#8217;s allegations had &#8220;no merit&#8221; and that internal investigations at Duke had cleared him of the harassment charge and had not found research misconduct on his part.</p>



<p>&#8220;For Ruben to claim that ideas that have been developed for well over a decade in my lab and with many of our co-authors were his is patently silly,&#8221; Pimm told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>He also denied threatening to fire Palacio: &#8220;That&#8217;s not a decision that individual professors make in the U.S.&#8221;</p>



<p>The secretly taped conversation, however, reveals Pimm did repeatedly threaten to terminate his then-student and take away the research Palacio had been leading &#8212; promises he appears to have made good on.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Palacio first met Pimm in 2015, the year after he graduated from Icesi University in Cali, Colombia, with a bachelor&#8217;s in biology. He had helped organize a conference that Pimm attended as &#8220;one of the VIPs,&#8221; Palacio recalled. On field trips, Palacio volunteered as a bird guide, and the two biologists talked over several days. Eventually, Pimm suggested Palacio join him as a PhD student at Duke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palacio was impressed. The following year he traveled to Durham, North Carolina, with a Fulbright scholarship under his belt.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was just thrilled to be his student,&#8221; Palacio wrote on X.</p>



<p>At Duke, Palacio set to work on a project mapping the distribution of bird species. The research was meant to help the organization <a href="https://abcbirds.org/">American Bird Conservancy</a> do conservation work in Ecuador, Palacio said, and Pimm wanted him to use <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00798.x">a method Pimm had published</a> in 2008, known as a geospatial workflow. Essentially, this is a series of steps to follow to find out where a species lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pimm&#8217;s method relied on expert-drawn maps and had been <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12801">criticized</a> by other scientists. Palacio wasn&#8217;t happy with it. He suggested improving the protocol by creating a new workflow based instead on data of bird sightings. It took a long time to convince his then-advisor his idea was sound, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell Stuart like, hey, we can do better, we can do something much nicer than your old protocol,&#8221; Palacio said. &#8220;That took a lot of finesse, because, you know, his ego is like, over the sky.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;I have all the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/research-misconduct-email-exchanges.pdf">emails, very detailed</a>, showing how I came up with the idea, and how [Pimm] wasn&#8217;t even aware we could do this.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But the work on the new method dragged out, and they were running behind schedule, Palacio said. The delays created tension between the student and his professor. As Palacio explained to the assistant director of the school’s PhD programs in an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-email-to-Wiggins_2020-01-14.png">email from October 2019</a>, he felt “very anxious and stressed” by the pressure he alleged Pimm was putting on him.</p>



<p>One day, Palacio said, Pimm had invited him for lunch at the cafeteria where the school’s faculty eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I started walking with him and then he goes, ‘Ruben, you will never graduate with a PhD from Duke,’&#8221; Palacio recalled Pimm saying. &#8220;He&#8217;s like, ‘You don&#8217;t work hard enough. You need to put in 16, 18 hours a day of work.’&#8221;</p>



<p>When they sat down to eat, Palacio said, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t even swallow. And he was like, &#8216;Just remember that just with one email I send to Fulbright, I can terminate your scholarship.'&#8221;</p>



<p>After Palacio confronted Pimm about the high levels of stress he was experiencing, his advisor wrote in an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Part-of-email-from-Stuart-Pimm-dated-January-5-2020.jpg">email on January 5, 2020</a>,<strong> </strong>that Palacio had “played a ‘health card’ … which very strongly limits my options. Duke very clearly prohibits me from stressing you. So, were you to wish to remain in my programme, you would need to assert categorically that the progress I expect from you will not stress you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That progress “would likely involve very long days, seven days a week for at least the next three weeks,” Pimm wrote in the email. (This passage is part of a longer email that was pasted into in a harassment complaint Palacio filed with Duke. Palacio said he no longer has the full email after his Duke account was closed.)</p>



<p>Pimm declined to &#8220;make specific comments about Ruben&#8221; to Retraction Watch, but pointed out that, &#8220;I alone am not empowered to make the decision as to whether a student remains within Duke or retains a scholarship.&#8221; He added that he had &#8220;found the quality of [Palacio&#8217;s] work lacking.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the lunch with Pimm, Palacio decided he needed to change labs. He received help from university counselors to navigate the situation, which he said had left his mental health in tatters. He also complained about Pimm to Duke, but the school found no fault with the professor&#8217;s behavior, according to both Palacio and Pimm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pimm attracted controversy in the past for<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/11/21/i-dont-take-whores-in-taxis-casual-sexism-in-scientific-journal-leads-to-editors-note/"> using misogynistic language</a> in a book review, as we reported in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duke did not respond to phone calls or repeated emails requesting comments.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On January 7, 2020, Palacio met with his advisor to follow up on the email and discuss how to move forward. In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/last_interaction_with_Stuart.mp3">recording</a> of the conversation that Palacio made without Pimm&#8217;s knowledge and later shared with Duke, Pimm can be heard calling his student&#8217;s writing &#8220;inexcusably incompetent&#8221; and complaining that Palacio was two months behind on his work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pimm repeatedly threatened to terminate Palacio if he did not promptly deliver a number of updates on the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t handle that and turn around some results by this time tomorrow, then I will fire you,&#8221; he told his student. &#8220;If I fire you, I promise you it will look bad on you. Right? So I don&#8217;t want any more bloody excuses from you. If you can&#8217;t do that stuff on that kind of schedule, you need to resign.&#8221;</p>



<p>After Palacio explained that he already found a new advisor, the conversation returned to Palacio&#8217;s research. Pimm told his student that if he sent updated results within &#8220;a couple of days,&#8221; he would &#8220;get senior authorship&#8221; of the ensuing manuscript.</p>



<p>&#8220;Should you choose not to do that, I can promise you that I have the firepower with your former colleagues to recreate that stuff in a matter of a few days. And we will produce that work and we will publish it and you won&#8217;t have any say in that whatsoever,&#8221; Pimm said, continuing:</p>



<p>&#8220;So the other decision you need to make … is what you propose to do with that [research]. If you move that work forward at a pace that I find acceptable, then I will continue to let you lead it. If you don&#8217;t, I will simply take all of that stuff away and you&#8217;ll have to use the other ideas that you have in the community.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked about his threats to take away the research Palacio had been leading and publishing it without his former student, Pimm said: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his work. He was offered a project. He didn&#8217;t complete it. His work on that project was inadequate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Palacio was crying and shaking when he finally left Pimm&#8217;s office, he recalled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was probably one of the toughest times in my life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing with the PhDs. Like, your advisor has so much power over you and you feel helpless at the beginning.&#8221;</p>



<p>Responding to Palacio&#8217;s thread on X, a number of scientists expressed sympathy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;This sounds like a massive power abuse situation rather than &#8220;just&#8221; plagiarism. What&#8217;s the University doing now?&#8221; one<a href="https://twitter.com/HeidiBaya/status/1685532771538640896"> data scientist</a> asked, while <a href="https://twitter.com/D_Pattemore/status/1685026176828588032">an ecologist argued</a>:</p>



<p>&#8220;This type of bullying &amp; unethical behaviour is far too common in academia; we need to hear more stories like this. I too looked up to Pimm but later realised how lucky I was that I ended up at a different lab for my PhD.&#8221;</p>



<p>On X, Palacio also posted screenshots of <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpalacio/status/1684955078048837633/photo/2">an exchange</a> he had with one of Pimm&#8217;s coauthors, who told him: &#8220;I&#8217;m not proud of this, of the way &#8216;we&#8217; kicked you out and took your idea, and also because I never really said anything to the others involved.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The coauthor, whose name Palacio redacted, <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpalacio/status/1684955078048837633/photo/1">said</a> they had &#8220;alerted people about your [preprint], and Stuart Pimm explained that the methods were sufficiently different to still go ahead. I did not know at that time that you had left his group, that this was your project and that you were not involved in it.&#8221; (The identity of the coauthor is known to Retraction Watch, but they asked not to be named as they did not have full knowledge of the case, they said.) </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ryan Huang, a researcher in Pimm&#8217;s lab and first author of the <em>PLOS ONE</em> paper, also contested the plagiarism accusations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ruben did not make any contribution to our paper,&#8221; he told Retraction Watch. &#8220;The shared intellectual history of ideas accounts for the similarities Ruben uses as evidence for his claims.&#8221;</p>



<p>Huang said that while he had been aware of Palacio&#8217;s preprint, he had not read it &#8220;for the explicit purpose that I did not want to cross-contaminate ideas, but I also told Ruben that we would not cite a pre-print as it was not peer-reviewed.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the acknowledgments of his papers, Palacio thanked Pimm and Huang &#8220;for suggestions during the initial development of the geospatial workflow.&#8221; But he stood by his claim that the new method was his creation and said his preprint created &#8220;scientific precedence&#8221; and should have been cited.</p>



<p>Pimm and his coauthors, Palacio argued, &#8220;could have said, OK, we developed this workflow based on Palacio and colleagues, or we looked into Palacio and colleagues and we think their protocol is shit, so we came up with another one. That&#8217;s what you do in the sciences.&#8221;</p>



<p>Palacio said Duke investigated his research-misconduct complaint against Pimm, but that the school would not share its findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duke has <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/913283?form=fpf">drawn criticism</a> in the past for not responding adequately to cases <a href="https://cancerletter.com/free/20150109_1/">involving potential research misconduct</a>. Following <a href="https://cancerletter.com/free/20150109_1/">several incidents</a> at the university, in 2019 the U.S. National Institutes of Health suspended a number of grants to the institution due to concerns about “clinical research irregularities” that could affect patient safety. The same year, the university settled a lawsuit with the U.S. federal government for a <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/910871">record $112.5 million</a> after researchers were accused of using fake data in grant applications.</p>



<p>In an email concerning its investigation of Pimm, Duke told Palacio:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are not able to provide you with a report due to the confidentiality requirements of our policies; we can only provide the outcome, which was the comment added to the PlosOne [sic] publication noted below.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comment to which the statement refers was posted in April by Huang and Pimm under &#8220;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259299">Reader Comments</a>&#8221; on the <em>PLOS ONE</em> paper website. It has since disappeared, but Palacio <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpalacio/status/1684955038156832769/photo/1">posted a screenshot</a> of it on X.</p>



<p>Titled &#8220;Similar Work,&#8221; it read, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On behalf of the authors, we want to inform the readership and research community about a closely related journal article published shortly before ours.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comment also provided links to Palacio&#8217;s journal paper and the preprint. According to Pimm:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Ruben’s paper appeared three weeks before ours appeared and well after the final version of our paper had been accepted. As a courtesy, we agreed to notice his paper having been published and the university was happy with our doing that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never really seen anything like that before,&#8221; Palacio said about the “Similar Work” comment. He added that he has asked <em>PLOS ONE</em> to retract the paper and that the journal told him it would investigate his allegations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the publisher declined to comment on the specific case, but said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In principle, comments may be used to inform readers of related work that has not been cited in a PLOS article. Whether a comment would be a suitable [sic] for this purpose depends on case-specific details such as the relative publication date(s), the relationship of the related work to the PLOS publication, and whether the related work introduces editorial or ethics concerns that need to be addressed by a different means.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As for the missing comment, the spokesperson said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Based on PLOS records, the comment appears to have been removed in error due to a technical issue with the commenting system.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After leaving Pimm&#8217;s group, Palacio said, he completed his doctorate in 2022 at <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/clark">another lab</a> at Duke that he described as a &#8220;much better environment.&#8221; He is now back in Colombia heading the conservation non-profit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fundacionecotonos?locale=es_LA">Fundación Ecotonos</a> and is about to publish a &#8220;great paper&#8221; in a top ecology journal with his second advisor.</p>



<p>It was “sort of a happy ending for me,&#8221; he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-star-tidal-waves-astronomy">This extreme star might have huge tidal waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like ocean surf smashing on a sandy beach, enormous waves of plasma may crash onto the surface of one massive star.</p>



<p>The star is part of a pair, stretched and pulled by its companion’s gravity. That gravitational tug-of-war causes the star’s brightness to change drastically and rhythmically. Now, a computer simulation suggests that this steady heartbeat of starlight <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02036-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is caused by giant tidal waves undulating and breaking on the star’s surface</a>, researchers report August 10 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. The height of the waves could be up to three times the diameter of the sun.</p>





<p>“It’s quite rare to see these really kind of dramatic but transformative moments in action,” says astrophysicist Morgan MacLeod of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>



<p>The star system, dubbed MACHO 80.7443.1718, sits about 160,000 light-years away from Earth in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It hosts one visible star that is 35 times the mass of the sun and another unseen star of at least 10 solar masses. About once a month, as they orbit each other, they pass near enough that gravitational forces raise tides on both stars’ surfaces, scientists suspect, much the way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/matter-gravity-0">the moon tugs on Earth’s oceans</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/11</em>).</p>



<p>On the stars, though, that tug would be substantially more extreme. “Instead of being a few meters tall, [the tide] can be 10 percent of the diameter of the star” that’s visible, says astrophysicist Jim Fuller of Caltech, who was not part of the study. On a star as big as that visible star — about 24 times as wide as the sun — that corresponds to a tidal wave roughly 3.3 million kilometers tall.</p>



<p>The new study, Fuller says, “shows how complicated and interesting the dynamics get when you have an extreme system like this.”</p>



<p>Astronomers can’t see the shapes of these stars through a telescope, but they can track how the brighter star’s light changes over time. While the brightness of most known “heartbeat stars” changes by about a tenth of a percent, the brightness of this system changes by 20 percent.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stellar dance</h4>



<p>Roughly once a month, two stars about 160,000 light-years away from Earth pass close enough to one another that gravitational forces should raise tides in the plasma on both stars’ surfaces. A computer simulation (shown) suggests that the gravitational tug-of-war raises enormous tides in the plasma on the larger star&#8217;s surface.</p>

Loeb/<em>Nature Astronomy</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>MacLeod wanted to know how the dynamics of this star system lead to those visible changes. So he and Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb simulated how plasma moves on and between these stars as they orbit one another.</p>



<p>The waves can get big enough that they actually break and crash across the brighter star’s surface, the study suggests. When an ocean wave is far from shore, it’s a rolling, undulating wave. But as it comes closer to shore, it rises and collapses on itself. “Something kind of parallel is happening here,” MacLeod says. The top of the wave steepens, “gets out of phase with the bottom, and it folds over on itself, and it crashes.”</p>





<p>After it crashes on the stellar surface, he says, “debris that&#8217;s thrown off is fed into this atmosphere around the star,” like the foamy surf left behind on a beach. As the waves crash, energy is lost. That crashing, the study suggests, causes the stars’ orbits to shrink, meaning eventually these stars could collide and possibly merge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/expect-coronavirus-fall-endemic-variants">What should we expect from the coronavirus this fall?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across the United States, thousands of people with COVID-19 are being hospitalized each week and the number is steadily trending up — a sure sign that overall cases have also been on the rise.</p>



<p>Levels of detectable coronavirus in wastewater samples and the proportion of tests that come back positive have certainly been ticking up since June, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Both metrics indicate rising cases at the national level, albeit indirectly. It’s hard to get a good grasp of the start of new surges or know what’s happening within communities, in part because states are no longer required to report new cases, a result of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-ending-tests-vaccines-drugs-research">the U.S. public health emergency ending in May</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/23</em>).</p>





<p>We do know the worst of the pandemic is largely behind us. While the virus can, and does, still spread far and wide, its transmission isn’t the overwhelming crush that characterized the pandemic’s first years.</p>



<p>Amid a backdrop of ever-evolving variants — including a new version of omicron designated BA.2.86 that is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-tracks-new-lineage-virus-that-causes-covid-2023-08-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under close watch</a> from global and U.S. health agencies — most infections are now less deadly than the pandemic’s early days. Data from blood banks show that as of September 2022, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7222a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 96 percent of people in the United States had been vaccinated</a>, infected with the virus or both, which can help reduce the severity of future infections. And, a new booster shot — designed to target relatives of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-xbb15-kraken-omicron-variant-virus">a viral lineage dubbed XBB</a> — should be available at the end of September (<em>SN: 1/13/23</em>).</p>



<p>Even with those rays of hope, our future with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, is unclear. The virus is not going anywhere; new variants will continue to appear with varying degrees of infectiousness and severity. How many people might fall ill or die on average each year? We don’t know.</p>



<p>Answering that question requires the virus to have entered its endemic phase — when it regularly circulates at some baseline amount. Even then, endemic does not mean benign. In that phase, people will still get sick with COVID, some severely so. But far fewer will land in the hospital or die in a “normal” year than during the pandemic years.</p>



<p>To see if this fall — our fourth with COVID and the first without a public health emergency in place — could possibly be the start of the coronavirus’ endemic phase, <em>Science News </em>spoke with epidemiologist Aubree Gordon of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How are things different this fall than in previous years?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>One of the big differences … is that at this point pretty much everybody … has some sort of immunity against SARS-CoV-2.</p>



<p>A majority of people have hybrid immunity, meaning that most people in the United States, or a good chunk of them, have been not only vaccinated but had an infection. For a majority of people that did not choose to get vaccinated, most of those individuals have been infected a few times. And some of the people who were vaccinated have been infected a few times.</p>



<p>What that means is that we have a higher level of immunity against the virus. Obviously, that’s not preventing people from getting infected or reinfected. But it’s certainly helping to reduce the severity of those infections when they happen.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>What have we learned about what reinfections tend to look like?</strong></p>





<p><strong>Gordon:</strong> They tend to be a lot milder than a first infection. But severe reinfections still do occur. And when you talk about severe, you’re not only thinking about fatal infections, which are of course the most severe, but also infections that cause hospitalization or may cause long-term symptoms.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>A new booster this fall will replace the omicron variant with a new one. Is it important to get this booster?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>I think booster shots are definitely advised, particularly for individuals who are more likely to have severe disease.</p>



<p>I had really hoped that we would have arrived at a point where SARS-CoV-2 was looking like a seasonal coronavirus, one that causes symptoms of the common cold, and was therefore less severe than influenza. What we’re still seeing for SARS-CoV-2 is that it is more severe than flu. It’s still causing a lot more deaths on an annual basis than flu is causing. I’d say it’s not clear if we’ve gotten to the fully endemic level yet [when transmission falls into an average range from year to year].</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Where do you think we are on the spectrum between pandemic and endemic?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon:</strong> I think we’re getting pretty close to what endemic will look like. I don’t know if we’ll be fully at that level for this next season, or if it might take another season or two for us to get there.</p>



<p>I will say that I’m kind of hoping we’re not at the endemic level yet. At least based on last year, because there were a substantial number of deaths in the United States — 244,000 was the CDC estimate. It’s four or five times higher than a severe seasonal influenza season in the United States.</p>



<p>But [COVID disease severity] has been trending downward over the last many months. The hope would be that we continue to see that downward trend in the number of severe and fatal cases. If [COVID] had hit its endemic level, we would expect some season-to-season fluctuations, but it’d be fluctuating around that number rather than continuing a downward trend of being less and less severe.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Have researchers learned anything over the past year about what endemic might look like?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>I think we’re zeroing in on what endemic will look like. It’s, I think, become fairly clear that this is going to be a regular infection that people may get more often than flu. Maybe the virus will start changing less. For adults [who are more likely than kids to get severely ill], it is probably looking like it’s going to [be as dangerous as] influenza if not [more dangerous]. We will see for sure.</p>



<p>I had thought that everybody would need maybe a vaccination and then one or two infections to get at whatever the endemic level would be. It’s possible that you need a little bit broader immunity [to protect against more variants of the virus] and more exposures to hit that endemic level.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>What do you think experts might learn this fall?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>One thing that we’ll look at this fall is how different it is from last fall. Because if we’re still seeing a downward trajectory, then maybe we haven’t yet hit the endemic level. Or we may see something that looks quite similar to last fall, which would tell us that perhaps we’ve arrived at that endemic level.</p>



<p>There is season-to-season variability, there are differences in variants, and we have new variants arising, which will all contribute on a yearly basis to how severe the SARS-CoV-2 season is. We have that for flu. CDC estimates for recent flu seasons, excluding the pandemic ones, were anywhere from 12,000 to 52,000 deaths a year. That’s quite a bit of variability.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap">When Brant Robertson saw a new measurement of the distance to a familiar galaxy, he laughed out loud.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, the galaxy had been a contender for the most distant ever observed. In 2012, Robertson and colleagues used data from the Hubble Space Telescope to show that the galaxy’s light had shone across the universe from about 13.3 billion years ago — less than 400 million years into the universe’s existence.</p>



<p>Not everyone believed it. “We got a lot of flak,” recalls Robertson, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It seemed too implausible that it was at such a great distance.” It felt like he was going around claiming to have seen the Loch Ness monster.</p>





<p>But in September, the James Webb Space Telescope, JWST for short, aimed its massive mirror and sensitive spectrograph at the same galaxy and showed that Robertson and his colleagues were right. The galaxy’s light is indeed incredibly old, dating to just 390 million years after the Big Bang. It was like someone had drained the lake, and the monster was sitting there at the bottom.</p>



<p>And this galactic Nessie is not alone. So far, in its first year of observations, JWST has turned up thousands of distant galaxies dating to the early universe, many more than astronomers had expected. Some of those galaxies are brighter, more massive or more mature than astronomers would have thought. They are now scratching their heads trying to explain how the galaxies could have grown up so fast.</p>

<p>A lot of the extreme distances still need to be confirmed, but initial evidence suggests there’s reason to believe that many, if not most, of the galaxies really are that far away.</p>



<p>“I was expecting to find some galaxies at this [distance]. Some people were pessimistic; I wasn’t,” says Steven Finkelstein, an astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin. “But I was not this optimistic. I thought, ‘Yeah, yeah, we know what we’re going to see.’ And I was wrong.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Hubble Space Telescope&#8217;s distant galaxies</h4>



<p>For longtime galaxy hunters, JWST’s bounty may feel like déjà vu. In the 1990s, Hubble took a long, deep look at an apparently blank patch of sky, just to see what was there. The result was thousands of galaxies, some captured as they looked when the universe was only a billion years old.</p>



<p>Those galaxies looked mature, like they had already been through multiple rounds of supernova explosions and star formation. Thus, they were not the first to form in the universe, astronomers realized. The first galaxies must date even further back.</p>



<p>The hunt for those original galaxies was part of the motivation for building JWST, says astrophysicist Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado Boulder. “The reason we have JWST is, they launched Hubble and saw that the things in the early universe were very evolved,” she says. “They were like, ‘Wow! There are galaxies way earlier than we thought’ ” — even further back in time than Hubble can see.</p>



<p>Hubble wasn’t designed to see all the way back to the universe’s beginning. The telescope is sensitive to ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelengths of light. But by the time light from the universe’s early days reaches us, it has stretched all the way into infrared wavelengths that are longer than Hubble’s (or human) eyes can see. That’s because the universe is expanding; everything in it is moving away from everything else. And as light sources move away from us, their light stretches — the wavelengths of light grow longer, or redder.</p>





<p>The amount of stretching of that light, known as the redshift, is astronomers’ proxy for cosmic distance and age. The present-day universe is at redshift zero. A redshift of 1 corresponds to about 6 billion years after the Big Bang. A redshift of 4 is about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, and so on.</p>



<p>In 1995, redshift 4 was the furthest back that Hubble could detect. Over the next 20 years, upgrades to the telescope and new observing techniques pushed the frontier back to redshift 7, which corresponds to 800 million years after the Big Bang. In 2012, the galaxy that Robertson studied appeared at a possible, though at the time unconfirmed, redshift of 11.9. Later, a galaxy called GN-z11 clocked in at a redshift of 11.1, or 400 million years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>These tantalizing discoveries set off a search for even more distant galaxies. “This has kind of become a game in extragalactic astronomy, where everyone wants to find the highest redshift, most distant galaxy,” astrophysicist Jeyhan Kartaltepe of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York said in April in Minneapolis at an American Physical Society meeting. “Become the new record holder, right? It’s fun.”</p>



<p>By 2016, when GN-z11 was discovered, the hunt had stalled. Astronomers had wrung everything they could out of existing technology.</p>



<p>“It really requires JWST to push to even earlier times,” Kartaltepe said, “which we need to understand the very beginnings of galaxy formation.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why astronomers want to find early galaxies</h4>



<p>The quest to find the earliest galaxies is about more than just bragging rights. These galaxies could shed light on a key event in the universe’s infancy called reionization.</p>



<p>In the beginning, there was the Big Bang. After that initial cataclysm, the universe continued to expand and cool. After about 372,000 years, it had cooled enough for electrons, protons and neutrons to combine into hydrogen atoms. That hydrogen gas was diffuse and opaque, plunging the universe into what astronomers call the cosmic dark ages.</p>



<p>Sometime during these dark ages, the first stars formed and began to clump together into galaxies with the help of an invisible and still mysterious material known as dark matter. But because of the opacity of that neutral hydrogen, all astronomers can really observe is that the universe became transparent again at about 200 million years after the Big Bang, as hydrogen atoms lost their electrons.</p>



<p>“We know there was a transition where the hydrogen was reionized somehow,” Robertson says. Thanks to observations with Hubble and other telescopes, “we think galaxies are very likely the agents of that process,” he says. Light from the youngest, most massive stars in those early galaxies might have knocked electrons off atoms in the hydrogen gas between galaxies. “But how that process unfolds, we have relatively little information on,” Robertson says.</p>



<p>JWST can help fill in those details. Taking a census of the galaxies that were around during the era of reionization could help illuminate how it got started.</p>



<p>And so, astronomers were giddy with excitement when JWST launched on Christmas Day in 2021 and started collecting data about six months later.<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa"> The first images</a> were unveiled with great fanfare on July 12, 2022 (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 30</em>). But astronomers had to wait until the next day to download the rest of the data the telescope had acquired while getting up and running.</p>



<p>“We knew, somewhere, on some computer, our photons were sitting there, waiting for us to see them,” Kartaltepe said. “As soon as the data were released in July, we jumped on it and started analyzing.”</p>



<p>Astronomers sifted through the images like a cosmic Where’s Waldo, picking the reddest-looking candidate galaxies out of the pack.</p>



<p>Extremely distant candidates popped out quickly. In several different regions of the sky, JWST found little red dots corresponding to galaxies that appeared to be at astonishing redshifts: 10, 13, even 17. Some of the galaxies seemed small and dim, as expected. But others looked big and bright, suggesting they were heftier than astronomers would expect for such early galaxies.</p>



<p>“These galaxies, they’re just at phenomenal distances. It’s a little hard to swallow,” Robertson said in June in Cambridge, Mass., at the JWST First Light Conference. “But it’s really important to actually confirm the distances to these very, very distant galaxies, and then learn about their properties.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The most distant galaxy ever confirmed</h4>



<p>Most of the cosmic distances reported for JWST galaxies so far have been preliminary estimates based on data from the telescope’s cameras. The cameras scan broad areas of sky and use filters to let in certain wavelengths of light. These filters allow astronomers to estimate “photometric” redshifts.</p>



<p>But to know for sure how far away a galaxy really is, astronomers need to use JWST’s spectrograph. A redshift calculated from a galaxy’s full spectrum of light uses 1,000 data points compared with a photometric redshift’s seven data points.</p>



<p>“Until we have spectra, nothing is ironclad,” Nelson says.</p>



<p>As part of a project called the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or JADES, Robertson and colleagues collected spectra for four galaxies with photometric redshifts higher than 10 — likely close to the beginning of the era of reionization. One of the galaxies was the one Robertson studied in 2012. The distance of that galaxy, now known as JADES-GS-z11-0, was downgraded a bit, from a redshift of 11.9 to 11.58. But with one of the other galaxies, the team claimed a new record for most distant galaxy ever confirmed, with a redshift of 13.2, just 325 million years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>The spectra the team analyzed were detailed enough to reveal some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01921-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">properties of the galaxies</a>, Robertson and colleagues reported in April in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. They’re all about a hundredth the size and mass of the Milky Way, but they are forming stars at a comparable rate — a lot of stars for galaxies this small. All those newborn stars produce a lot of ionizing radiation, meaning it’s possible these galaxies could be some of the earliest agents of reionization, Robertson says.</p>



<p>JADES has since reported <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about 700 more galaxies</a> whose photometric redshifts place them at redshift 8 or greater, or less than 650 million years after the Big Bang, Robertson said at the June First Light meeting. Those galaxies’ distances still need to be confirmed, but the sheer numbers are amazing. “We’re really in a remarkable age,” Robertson said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Trusting JWST&#8217;s measurements</h4>



<p>The huge galaxy haul raises another question: How many of them are likely to be at such great distances?</p>



<p>A potential record-breaking galaxy called CEERS-93316 is a cautionary tale. The galaxy was identified in JWST images taken for the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science, or CEERS, survey. Those images put the galaxy at a photometric redshift of 16.4, or just 240 million years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>“That was higher redshift than we expected to see with CEERS,” says Finkelstein, the survey’s lead researcher. CEERS was designed to practice using JWST in its different observing modes and give astronomers some data to play with, not necessarily to set new records.</p>



<p>In its first chunk of data, CEERS contained a surprising number of apparently high-redshift galaxies. So Finkelstein and colleagues asked the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which operates JWST, for some extra telescope time to chase down the spectra of CEERS-93316, as well as a galaxy that Finkelstein had found with a photometric redshift of about 12. He named that galaxy Maisie’s Galaxy in honor of his daughter, because he found it on her ninth birthday. (Maisie didn’t mind that her dad had to work that day — “I got other birthday presents,” she says, though she did wish her galaxy was the potential record holder.)</p>



<p>When the spectral data came through, Finkelstein’s colleague Pablo Arrabal Haro, an astrophysicist at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab, based in Tucson, worked through the weekend to write up results before anyone else.</p>



<p>CEERS-93316’s 16.4 redshift turned out to be wrong. The galaxy was actually at a redshift of 4.9, putting it 1.2&nbsp;billion years after the Big Bang — practically modern compared with some of JWST’s other finds.</p>



<p>The galaxy’s photometric redshift was so high because of a weird coincidence. Light streaming from hydrogen in the galaxy was redshifted such that it looked like it jumped in brightness at a wavelength suggestive of the huge distance. But when the full spectrum came in, that single jump was revealed to be several separate peaks, suggesting a smaller redshift.</p>



<p>Maisie’s Galaxy, however, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost as distant as the photometric redshift implied</a>, Arrabal Haro and colleagues reported in a paper posted in March to arXiv.org. And in an April paper posted to arXiv.org, the team reported <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spectra for more than 30 other galaxies</a> with redshifts of roughly between 8 and 10. So photometric redshift estimates are generally reliable, Finkelstein says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Timeline of early galaxies</h3>



<p>JWST has detected many galaxies from the early universe (a few are shown on this timeline). These galaxies could shed light on reionization, the process that ended the cosmic dark ages, when the universe was shrouded in darkness. Some of these galaxies, the “universe breakers,” appear to be more massive than theory can explain.</p>

<p>“Although we have this notable failure case, that’s a pathological case,” he says. It’s “not devastating.”</p>



<p>That’s good news for JWST’s observing schedule: Astronomers won’t have to follow up with the full spectrum for every distant galaxy. They can believe that most of the redshifts are legit and save the extra effort of taking the full spectrum for the really interesting ones. “It is exciting that the photometric redshifts tend to hold up,” Robertson says. “It gives us some hope that some of these really distant things could be real.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Distant galaxies too bright to explain</h4>



<p>Another outcome of JWST analyses so far is that there are more bright galaxies around redshift 10 than expected. Galaxy brightness is an indicator of galaxy mass, and thus star abundance. The brighter the galaxy, the more stars it must have to produce all that light.</p>



<p>Galaxies are born in halos of dark matter, whose gravity pulls in and concentrates ordinary matter. Cosmologists know from simulations and theory how many dark matter halos the universe would have had when the first galaxies formed. They also have a decent idea of how massive those halos were in the universe’s first 500 million years and how much of that mass ended up in the form of hydrogen and helium, the raw material for making stars. Theoretically, if all that gas turned into stars, the largest a galaxy could get would be about 10 billion times the mass of the sun.</p>



<p>In reality, researchers expect early galaxies to be much less massive, because modern galaxies never convert all their gas into stars.</p>



<p>JWST has not turned up any galaxy near the theoretical upper limit. But it has found many more hefty early galaxies than predicted. The confirmed JADES galaxies weigh in at about 100 million solar masses, just 330 million years after the Big Bang. Some of the CEERS galaxies seem to have over a billion suns’ worth of stars as early as 450 million years after the Big Bang. Two galaxies discovered in another JWST survey, called COSMOS-Web, appear to be about 5 billion solar masses as early as 350 million years after the Big Bang, astronomer Caitlin Casey of the University of Texas at Austin said at the June First Light meeting.</p>



<p>“With these massive beacons, you can test the limits of how fast you can assemble that much matter in the short time between the Big Bang and the time that we’re observing them in,” she says.</p>



<p>What astronomers find from these galaxies could point to where our existing understanding of galaxy formation is wrong. Or researchers might discover that some of the galaxies’ light doesn’t come directly from stars but instead from the ionized gas in between stars that are actively forming, Casey says. That would mean the galaxies aren’t actually as massive as they look.</p>



<p>Finding out how early galaxies were put together is the first step to understanding our own galaxy, Robertson says. “That’s ultimately what drives a lot of galaxy formation research, is trying to understand how our home, the thing that’s important to us, the place that we live, came to be,” he says. “We’re never going to complete that full story without looking at how galaxies at redshift 10 were put together…. That’s the starting place for how we got here.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Breaking the universe &#8230; or not</h4>



<p>One set of galaxies has sparked debate over not just galaxy formation, but the theoretical foundations of the universe itself.</p>



<p>In February, Nelson and colleagues reported six galaxies spotted with CEERS that seem to have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">grown so big, so fast</a> that they directly challenge the standard theory of how structure forms in the universe (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 14</em>). These galaxies have photometric redshifts between about 7 and 9, meaning they grew up in the first 800 million years of the universe. But their stellar masses appear to rival or exceed that of the Milky Way, about 60 billion solar masses.</p>



<p>Nelson affectionately calls them the “universe breakers.” Nothing that massive should have been able to form that fast, she says. “As soon as we saw it, we were like, this is bananas.”</p>



<p>Barely enough ordinary matter is even believed to have existed back then to create the universe breakers, says astrophysicist Mike Boylan-Kolchin of the University of Texas at Austin. Regions where budding galaxies formed would have had to turn all their atoms into stars.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="455" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081223_galaxies_inline4.jpg" alt="Six distant galaxies (red dots, above) spotted by the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science, or CEERS." class="wp-image-3130158" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081223_galaxies_inline4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081223_galaxies_inline4-572x383.jpg 572w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081223_galaxies_inline4-673x450.jpg 673w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081223_galaxies_inline4-278x186.jpg 278w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130158">Six distant galaxies (red dots, above) spotted by the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science, or CEERS, survey appear to be too massive for standard cosmological theories to explain, though one of these “universe breakers” (top row, middle image) is not as distant as originally thought.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130158">NASA, ESA, CSA, I.

<p>“We have this reservoir of atoms,” he says. “Almost every single one of them has to be in stars or in galaxies” if the universe breakers are for real. “If these observations and their interpretation is correct … it’s very hard to accommodate them in our current models,” he says.</p>



<p>Over the last few months, theorists have come up with several ways to explain the universe breakers. One of the most dramatic options would be to add some extra dark energy, the mysterious substance that drives the universe to expand faster and faster, to the early universe, which would speed up all sorts of cosmic processes.</p>



<p>“That would go in the right direction here, in the sense that there’d be bigger reservoirs [of atoms] and maybe more of them at earlier times,” Boylan-Kolchin says. “These early dark energy models do predict faster evolution of structure at early times.”</p>



<p>More mundane options include super-compact early galaxies that could have converted all their gas into stars before the oldest stars had a chance to go supernova and blow it away. <em>S</em>uch efficient star formation <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/523/3/3201/7179993?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could explain the universe breakers without breaking the universe</a>, physicist Avishai Dekel of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and colleagues suggested in a paper published May 25 in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</em></p>



<p>And there’s still the question of whether the universe breakers’ masses and distances will hold up. A spectrum of one of them has already revealed it to be a galaxy at redshift 5.6 with an actively feeding black hole creating extra light — so not a universe breaker after all.</p>



<p>JWST’s second observing cycle began in July, and Nelson will take spectra of the rest of the universe breakers to find out if they are truly abounding with stars, filled with black holes or something else.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another group of astronomers will test JWST’s limits, hunting for galaxies at redshift 15 or greater. So by the telescope’s second birthday next summer, there may be new distance records.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recoiling-black-hole-gravitational-wave">Recoiling black holes could move at nearly one-tenth the speed of light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Collisions between black holes can launch newly melded cosmic sinkholes at speeds up to <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/9907aYe8M851ac75f7126235be144786cbb957515#:~:text=This%20spin%20sequence%20for%20s,10%%20the%20speed%20of%20light" data-type="URL" data-id="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/9907aYe8M851ac75f7126235be144786cbb957515#:~:text=This%20spin%20sequence%20for%20s,10%%20the%20speed%20of%20light" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly one-tenth the speed of light</a>, researchers report August 18 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. Moving that fast — about 28,500 kilometers per second — it would take about 13 seconds to complete the average trip from Earth to the moon. The findings may help researchers figure out how much energy can get released when black holes converge.</p>



<p>Black holes merge after coming so close together that they become ensnared in each other’s gravitational pull. The couple enters a cosmic waltz, spiraling ever tighter and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-gravitational-wave-black-hole">stirring up ripples in spacetime</a> known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">gravitational waves</a> (<em>SN: 6/28/23; SN: 1/21/21</em>).</p>





<p>If the pair’s convergence blows gravitational waves preferentially in one direction, then the emerging black hole will recoil in the opposite direction at high speed, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-gravitational-waves-kick-ligo-merger-spacetime">kickback from a gun</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Previous research had indicated the blowback from such twisting mergers could hurl black holes at up to about <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.231102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5,000 kilometers per second</a>. For the new study, astrophysicists Carlos Lousto and James Healy, of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, probed black hole interactions that were more head-on, akin to particles zipping towards each other in a particle accelerator.</p>



<p>The duo simulated more than 1,300 approaches. These included close flybys, direct collisions and everything in between. The mashups that almost didn’t happen — grazing collisions that still resulted in merging — produced the fastest recoiling black holes, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Such collisions might be possible with three or more black holes, Lousto says. “Two black holes orbiting in opposite directions around a larger black hole might eventually collide,” he explains, dispatching their descendant with the quickest of quick kicks.</p>

<p>The overall winning image depicts bright orange fruiting bodies growing on deadwood in the Australian rainforest and was taken by Cornelia Sattler from Macquarie University, Australia. The orange pore fungus was first observed in Madagascar but is now found throughout the world. Previous research has reported that invasive species, such as the European rabbit, root rot fungus and feral pigs, threaten 82% of Australian species at risk of extinction. As a result, Australia has particularly strict rules about bringing plants, animals, and organic matter into the country. Cornelia Sattler said: “Despite its innocent and beautiful appearance, the orange pore fungus is an invasive species that displaces other fungi and is spreading throughout the Australian rainforest. It is important to closely monitor this fungus, whose spores are often transported by humans, in order to safeguard the biodiversity of Australia.” Senior Editorial Board Member Arne Traulsen recommended the entry, saying: “Cornelia Sattler’s image allows us to peek into the world of fungi, organisms that are fascinating and yet underappreciated and understudied.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The runner-up for the ‘Research in action’ category captured a moment as researchers conduct a necropsy on a stranded humpback whale that, unfortunately, had passed away. Professor Paul Thompson from the University of Aberdeen in the UK, who submitted the photo taken by James Bunyan from Tracks Ecology explains, “Post whaling recovery of North Atlantic humpback whale populations has led to increases in sightings of this species in UK coastal waters, but this also raises the risk of entanglement in coastal waters. In May 2023, a young humpback whale became stranded in Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve in NE Scotland, drawing the attention of the scientific community. This site has been the focus of long-term photographic studies of harbour seals by the University of Aberdeen, most recently working in collaboration with Tracks Ecology to use UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) photography to identify and measure individual seals from this population. Colleagues from the University of Glasgow’s Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme conducted a necropsy of this whale, confirming drowning following entanglement was the most likely cause of death. This image was drawn from a series captured by UAV photography, documenting the necropsy and producing a 3-D model of the whale using photogrammetric techniques that were developed to study the size structure of the seal population.” This photo depicts researchers collaborating to further our understanding of the challenges faced by these magnificent creatures.</span></p>

Victor explains that “Professor Rummer leads Physioshark, a research team headquartered at James Cook University in Australia, that investigates the impact of climate change on the physiological performance of newborn sharks in tropical shark nurseries. These habitats typically occur in shallow waters and are therefore highly exposed to rising temperatures and lower oxygen concentrations. The Physioshark team is untangling the challenges newborn sharks face in such rapidly changing environmental conditions. Professor Rummer and her students have so far been able to show how despite the burden climate change  is placing on the physiology of young sharks, these are displaying an exceptional resilience to these changes, giving scientists hope that they will be able to adjust to a warming ocean.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The winning image of the &#8216;Paleoecology&#8217; category, submitted by Jordan Mallon from the Canadian Museum of Nature, has highlighted the incredible work<a href="https://ecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/palaeontology-in-a-pandemic-remote-research-on-dinosaur-eggs-and-embryos?channel_id=behind-the-paper"> a group of trans-Pacific palaeontologists completed remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Jordan&#8217;s submission showcases the team&#8217;s collaborative efforts in describing a remarkable discovery: a pair of hadrosauroid dinosaur eggs and embryos from China&#8217;s Upper Cretaceous red beds, dating back approximately 72 to 66 million years ago. Jordan comments, &#8220;The relatively small size of the eggs, and the unspecialized nature of the dinosaur embryos inside, suggest that the earliest hadrosaurs laid small eggs and hatched altricial young. More derived hadrosaurs eventually laid eggs nearly four times larger by volume and hatched correspondingly larger young. This digital image depicts an example of a &#8216;primitive&#8217; hadrosaur developing within the safety of its small egg expertly crafted by Wenyu Ren.&#8221; This image reminds us of the amazing wealth of information locked within fossils. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jasmina Wiemann from the Negaunee Integrative Research Center, Field Museum of Natural History, USA, entered the runner-up for the &#8216;Paleoecology&#8217; category. Through her microscope, Jasmina provides a view of an extracted diplodocid dinosaur blood vessel surrounded by preserved extracellular matrix containing remnants of cells that are approximately 150 million years old. Jasmina explains, &#8220;Once considered paradoxical, the preservation of fragile soft tissues is now known to be the result of the chemical transformation of original proteins, lipids, and sugars occurring during fossilization &#8211; allowing such fragile evidence of past life to survive over millions of years!&#8221;. The field of molecular paleobiology is important for reconstructing the physiology, relationships and behaviours of long-extinct species.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/13000-years-humans-fire-ecosystem-la-brea">Around 13,000 years ago, humans and fire changed LA’s ecosystem forever</a></h4>

              
                <p>By about 11,700 years ago, most large land mammals outside of Africa had gone extinct. Scientists have long debated whether these extinctions were primarily caused either by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/few-humans-were-needed-wipe-out-new-zealands-moa">human activities</a> or a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-flowers-died-out-arctic-so-did-mammoths">changing climate</a> as the last ice age came to a close (<em>SN: 11/13/14; SN: 2/6/14</em>).</p>



<p>A new study of the remains of animals trapped long ago in the La Brea tar pits, in what’s now Los Angeles, suggests both factors worked in concert to bring about the demise of the region’s megafauna. A warming, drying climate plus humans’ hunting and burning of the landscape led to large fires that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo3594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precipitated the end-Pleistocene die-offs</a> there around 13,000 years ago and forever changed the ecosystem, researchers report in the Aug. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The findings “reflect the reality of nature, which is that phenomena are rarely, if ever, driven by a single factor,” says Danielle Fraser, a paleoecologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>The type of “climate-human synergy” implicated in the demise of California’s biggest beasts may warn of dramatic upheaval in modern ecosystems subjected to ongoing human-caused climate change, the researchers say. Southern California, for instance, has warmed more than 2 degrees Celsius over the last century, a more rapid change than the area faced during that earlier time period.</p>

<p>In the new study, F. Robin O’Keefe, a paleontologist and evolutionary biologist at Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va., and colleagues were initially studying the remains of ancient carnivores that had become stuck and died in the asphalt seeps of La Brea, investigating how the animals had physically changed over many thousands of years. Then the researchers found evidence of an extinction event recorded in the tar pit fossil record.</p>



<p>“We had lots and lots of megafauna, and then suddenly they were gone,” O’Keefe says.</p>



<p>The team started gathering data on more species. In all, the researchers dated remains from 172 individuals from eight megafauna species from 10,000 to about 15,600 years ago.&nbsp;Included were extinct animals like saber-toothed cats (<em>Smilodon fatalis</em>), dire wolves (<em>Aenocyon dirus</em>) and ground sloths (<em>Paramylodon harlani</em>), and a single species that survived to today, the coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>). Sure enough, about 13,000 years ago, the seven of the eight megafaunal species all vanished from the tar pit fossil record, the team found.</p>



<p>To understand what was going on in the environment long ago, the researchers turned to sediment cores from nearby Lake Elsinore. The cores serve as a record of regional vegetation, climate and fire frequency changes over tens of thousands of years. O’Keefe and his colleagues also compared the extinction timing with computer modeling of human population growth on the continent built from a database of many thousands of radiocarbon dates of archaeological sites across North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sediment cores revealed that over the millennium preceding the extinction, the region warmed by 5.6 degrees Celsius and dried out. The area’s juniper and oak woodlands gave way to more drought and fire-tolerant plants. Shortly after this shift started, Southern California went through a 300-year-long period of intense fires, evidenced by a spike in charcoal in the lake records. The team’s modeling on human populations shows their numbers rapidly grew right before the burning started. That the population upswing so closely coincides with the fires suggests the two are linked.</p>



<p>What’s more, the changing climate and human activities not only precipitated the extinctions, the team found, but also converted the region’s woodlands into chaparral scrubland for good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>O’Keefe describes it as a feedback loop, noting that hunting herbivores also makes the ecosystem more fire prone as plants go uneaten. “You get this vicious cycle,” he says. “You add more people and it gets hotter and drier, and you&#8217;re killing more herbivores. So there&#8217;s more fuel [to burn].”</p>



<p>The seven megafauna species vanished from Southern California about 1,000 years before they did elsewhere in North America. Those other populations may have met a similar end, the researchers say. “There is evidence for a continent-wide event, not just in Southern California but across the continent right about at the same time,” O’Keefe says.</p>

<p>Sandra Brügger, a paleoecologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland who wasn’t involved in the research, notes that similarly rapid ecological transformations have been documented in the Mediterranean and a broader swathe of the U.S. West during the transition between the Pleistocene and the following Holocene Epoch.</p>



<p>The new findings not only provide a glimpse into the past but are also a “cautionary tale” relevant to the present and to the survival of modern biodiversity, says O’Keefe, pointing to recent large, intense fires in Hawaii, the U.S. West and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">Canada</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/23</em>). “So the parallels are certainly there. The one thing that&#8217;s different about today is that we know what happened before, and if we can learn something from that, maybe we can change our trajectory.”</p>
