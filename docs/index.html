<p>The mechanisms of limb regeneration in amphibians are fascinating and can help devise a plethora of methods in regenerative medicine and engineering. <i>Xenopus</i> and axolotl are the key models for studying limb regeneration, but other amphibians display different mechanisms and little is known on those. In this study, researchers chose to understand how it works in <em>Polypedates maculatus</em>, a species of tree frog commonly found in India, and used transcriptomics to analyze the gene expression of intact limbs and amputated limb blastemas in tadpoles and froglets.</p>
<p>They found that, when the tissue is wounded, the choice between healing and regeneration depends from a balance of several factors. In general, genes associated with inflammation led to a healing environment and do not support regeneration; on the contrary, a reduced inflammation promotes regeneration. Factors such as glycosaminoglycans, metalloproteinases, and methyl transferases, were found to be upregulated or downregulated to modulate this sort of switch mechanism and to stimulate and guide the migration of myeloid cells, which are required for regeneration, exploiting signalling pathways in ways that had not been reported in model amphibians.</p>
<p>The study confirms several conserved strategies of regeneration, but also finds differences in terms of factors and components involved in the process of limb regeneration, giving useful insights into the variety of molecules that can be involved in creating a regeneration-permissive environment potentially paving the way for new approaches for regenerative medicine.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-13206" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection.png" alt="" width="258" height="171" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection.png 797w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection-300x199.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection-768x511.png 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection-640x426.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" />Institutional objection to assisted dying is a debated subject, yet it is empirically understudied. It is important to understand institutional objection because it affects the experiences of patients seeking assisted dying and the impact of the particular regulatory context governing objections by institutions. This study was conducted in Victoria, that in 2019 was the first Australian state to permit voluntary assisted dying, and it investigates the impact of policy regarding institutional objection by focusing on the perspectives of family caregivers through semi-structured interviews.</p>
<p>The study involved 32 family caregivers and one patient who sought assisted dying. Participants reported institutional objection affecting eligibility assessments, medication access, and taking the medication or having it administered. Institutional objection occurred across health settings and was sometimes only inferred through context and interactions, rather than being explicitly stated. In terms of practical consequences, these objections resulted in delays, transfers, and attempts of dissuasion through pressure for palliative or other care. From a psychological point of view, participants also reported adverse emotional experiences and distrust of objecting institutions.</p>
<p>In an already procedurally challenging context, with a limited window in which patients have to apply, all the above points create a barrier in the assisted dying system. The authors argues that better regulation may be needed as Victoria’s existing policy approach appears to preference institutional positions over patient’s choice reinforcing existing power dynamics.</p>

<p>Biomedical image data often have complex patterns that are difficult for human experts to comprehend, making it challenging to develop reliable unambiguous diagnoses using these data. However, machine learning methods can help overcoming the issue.</p>
<p>In this article, the authors explore the potential of using a feature learning algorithm called Invariant Scattering Convolution Network or Wavelet scattering Network to extract features from retinal fundus images for glaucoma diagnosis. By applying a wavelet scattering network to the RIM-ONE DL image dataset, they were able to achieve a stage-wise decomposition process, simplifying and improving the interpretation of images, and extract features for glaucoma detection. The authors also examined the influence of wavelet scattering network parameter settings and 2-D channel image type on the detection correctness. They found that highly optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures achieved detection correctness up to 98%.</p>
<p>This work represents a departure from traditional methods of applying wavelet transform to pre-processed retinal fundus images and extracting handcrafted features from the decomposition results. Instead, their approach applied a wavelet scattering network directly to the images to extract features for glaucoma detection. This method may be a useful tool for developing cheap, simple, fast, and accurate healthcare solutions and further research will help to determine the versatility and reliability of this approach.</p>

To investigate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions for perinatal depression, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted.</p>
<p>A total of 31 studies with 5291 participants were included in the systematic review, and 26 studies with 4658 participants in the meta-analysis, with the majority of the studies conducted in high-income countries. The authors found that CBT-based interventions are effective, but also note that some studies were of low quality and had high levels of heterogeneity. The review identified the need for further investigation into the effectiveness of the interventions on secondary outcomes and highlighted the importance of establishing a minimum core data set to improve consistency of secondary outcome collection across trials. The study also highlighted the need to conduct trials with longer-term follow-up periods and to investigate important clinical moderators of effectiveness, such as the type of health professional delivering interventions.</p>
<p>The authors highlight the need for consistency in data collection and longer-term follow-up periods to improve the quality of the evidence base. Additionally, efforts should be made to investigate the effectiveness of interventions in low- and middle-income countries to ensure that effective treatments are accessible to all women experiencing perinatal depression.</p>

However, little is known about their use and perception. This study focuses on this aspects among young people in Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>The authors collected quantitative and open-text qualitative data through an annual cross-sectional survey of 596 young people aged 15-29 in Victoria, Australia, who reported menstruating in the past 6 months, and asked questions about their menstrual product use, use of reusable materials, product priorities, and preferences. The study found that among the participants, 37% had used a reusable product during their last menstrual period and further 11% had used one in the past. The most commonly used product was period underwear, followed by menstrual cups and reusable pads. However, 37% of participants reported not having enough information about reusable products, and this was particularly common among younger participants</p>
<p>In Victoria, the majority of people still use disposable products and there is a lack of information on menstrual products that fit specific needs. Therefore, the authors conclude that there is a need for greater education and access to reusable period products.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-paradoxes-quantum-states">Black holes resolve paradoxes by destroying quantum states</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS — </strong>Don’t try to do a quantum experiment near a black hole — its mere presence ruins all quantum states in its vicinity, researchers say.</p>



<p>The finding comes from a thought experiment that <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/M08.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pits the rules of quantum mechanics and black holes against each other</a>, physicists reported April 17 at a meeting of the American Physical Society. Any quantum experiment done near a black hole could set up a paradox, the researchers find, in which the black hole reveals information about its interior — something physics says is forbidden. The way around the paradox, the team reports, is if the black hole simply destroys any quantum states that come close.</p>





<p>That destruction could have implications for future theories of quantum gravity. These sought-after theories aim to unite quantum mechanics, the set of rules governing subatomic particles, and general relativity, which describes how mass moves on cosmic scales.</p>



<p>“The idea is to use properties of the [theories] that you understand, which [are] quantum mechanics and gravity, to probe aspects of the fundamental theory,” which is quantum gravity, says theoretical physicist Gautam Satishchandran of Princeton University.</p>



<p>Here’s how Satishchandran, along with theoretical physicists Daine Danielson and Robert Wald, both of the University of Chicago, did just that.</p>



<h4>A quantum experiment near a black hole creates a paradox</h4>



<p>First the team imagined a person, call her Alice, performing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-weirdness">famous double-slit experiment</a> in a lab orbiting a black hole (<em>SN: 11/5/10</em>). In this classic example of quantum physics, a scientist sends a particle, like an electron or a photon, toward a pair of slits in a solid barrier. If no one observes the particle’s progress, an interference pattern typical of waves appears on a screen on the other side of the barrier, as if the particle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-quantum-theory-particle-wave-double-slit-experiment">went through both slits at once</a> (<em>SN: 5/3/19</em>). But if someone, or some device, measures the particle’s path, it will register as having gone through one slit or the other. The particle’s quantum state of apparently being in two places at once collapses.</p>



<p>Then the team imagined another person, Bob, sitting just inside a black hole’s event horizon — the boundary beyond which not even light can escape the black hole’s gravity. Even though Bob <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-boundary">is doomed</a>, he can still make measurements (<em>SN: 5/16/14</em>). The laws of physics behave the same just inside the horizon as outside. “At the horizon, you wouldn’t even know you fell in,” Satishchandran says.</p>



<p>When Bob observes which slit Alice’s particle went through, the particle’s quantum state will collapse. That would also let Alice know Bob is there, messing up her experiment. But that’s a paradox — nothing done inside a black hole should affect the outside. By the laws of physics, Bob should not be able to communicate with Alice at all.</p>





<p>“The paradox is that black holes are a one-way street,” Satishchandran says. “Nothing done in the interior of a black hole can affect my experiment that I do in the exterior. But we just made up a scenario in which, definitely, the experiment will be affected.”</p>



<h4>The paradox is solved if the black hole acts like an ‘observer’</h4>



<p>The team then guessed at a possible solution to that paradox: The black hole itself forces the quantum state of Alice’s particle to collapse, whether Bob is there or not. “It must be that there’s an effect that no one has calculated in these theories that comes to the rescue,” Danielson says.</p>



<p>The rescue came from the fact that charged particles radiate, or emit light, when shaken. No matter how carefully Alice sets up her experiment, her particle will always emit a tiny amount of radiation as she moves it, the physicists showed. That radiation will have a different electromagnetic field depending on which way Alice’s particle went.</p>



<p>When the radiation crosses the black hole’s event horizon, the black hole will register that difference, effectively observing enough about the original particle to destroy its quantum state.</p>



<p>“The horizon actually ‘knows’ which way the particle went,” mathematically speaking, Satishchandran says. Alice blames the black hole for ruining her experiment, not Bob, and the paradox is resolved.</p>



<p>The team took the idea a step further. If Alice’s particle is a graviton, a particle of gravity, the same thing happens as if it were an electron. And if the horizon in question is not a black hole, but the cosmic horizon marking the edge of the visible universe, then Alice’s particle <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/M08.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will still collapse</a>, the team reported at the same meeting.</p>



<h4>Quantum gravity theories need to take all this into account</h4>



<p>The ultimate goal of this thought experiment is not to create a complete theory of quantum gravity, but more to sketch an outline that a possible future theory must fit into, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“We’re not in the business of building theories of quantum gravity,” Satishchandran says. “But we would like … to provide benchmarks, which hopefully tell us something more fundamental about what such theories look like.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear how to get from here to a complete theory, agrees physicist Alex Lupsasca of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, who was not involved in the study. But the idea that black holes can act as quantum observers is interesting on its own.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a true fact that has to be part of the eventual theory of quantum gravity,” he says. “But whether it’s a crucial clue that we’re gleaning along the way to the final theory of quantum gravity, or it’s just an interesting detour on the path to uncovering that theory, is unknown.”</p>

<p>Game theory is a mathematical framework used in economics to understand how  a contestant&#8217;s strategy in a competition over resources is determined by rational decisions regarding the strategy of opponents. Over the last century since game theory was first developed in mathematical language, it has been adapted for evolutionary and animal behavior contexts, and tested across a number of animal species with different types of competitive behaviors. The consensus has historically been that weaker animals tend to lose and that the timing of their decision to give up relies on how motivated they are to attain the resources they are fighting for. This highlights how winning and losing relies on both the perceived value of the resource and the skills of the contestants.</p>
<p>However, simplifying the model to” losers quit” neglects the fact that animals may adapt their fighting behavior and strategically gain advantages against the odds. For example, some animals have more aggressive personalities, independently of their opponent, while others  may use aggression strategically and exaggerate their strength to ward off opponents that are stronger than them. In order to better understand these competitive animal behaviors, we studied male Siamese fighting fish and found that they display both of these unexpected strategic behaviors: small males more readily engage relatively bigger opponents and flair their fins to overstate their size.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is likely that the behavior of these fish relies on a combination of motivated aggression and calculated strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aggression towards bigger opponents relies on the fish’s <a href="https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12983-021-00397-x">motivation to defend its territory</a> from greater threat. Therefore, fish show less aggressive behavior when their territory is negatively affected by acoustic noise, such as that imposed on aquatic environments by light human traffic. However, male Siamese fighting fish become more aggressive once they have built bubble-nests. Males build these nests to signal their preparedness for mating and to deposit fertilized eggs into them after mating. This increases their young&#8217;s survival, is attractive to the females and therefore highly beneficial to the males. To defend territory, especially territory with bubble-nests, males use elaborate displays to ward off intruders by displaying their size and aggressiveness, including lateral displays where they present their extended fins. Interestingly, the display of fins is used to exaggerate their strength by overstating their size, but this tactic can be <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347219301332">recognized by fish</a> during a fight. As a result, contestants progressively disregard the size-information from fin displays as the fight develops. This shows that male Siamese fighting fish can adjust their assessment of their opponent’s abilities and take them into account when fighting. Therefore, it is likely that the behavior of these fish relies on a combination of motivated aggression and calculated strategy.</p>
<p>In our recent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40850-022-00156-3">study published in <em>BMC Zoology</em></a> we decided to test this hypothesis by characterizing the modulators of fighting behavior in Siamese fighting fish in detail. First, we measured each individual’s aggression level against its mirror image on two separate instances to spot any baseline personality differences. We used this information to see whether the level of aggressiveness could predict the fish’s behavior during fights against other fish. Then, we examined each animal’s behavior during fights and how they were affected by their opponent’s size and behavior when compared to their own. In order to test the fish’s motivation to fight, we interrupted the fight at 5 and again at 10 minutes into the interaction and measured how fast fish re-engaged opponents.</p>
<p>Using a composite score of consistent aggressiveness measured from the repeated mirror fights, we found that individual personalities only affected early stages of the live fights but not decisions to attack opponents or retreat. As expected, smaller animals engaged bigger opponents faster and more aggressively, but could become submissive when ongoing attacks increased the risk of injury. In addition, fish used new information from ongoing behavior as well as their energy levels to decide whether to continue fighting, and whether to escalate or retreat, respectively. Finally, the motivation to defend resources, drives behaviors meant to achieve this in the least costly manner, like signalling their size and strength or submitting to attack. On the contrary, behaviors with potentially dangerous consequences- such as engaging opponents and attacking them – depended on informed decisions like the relative size or behavior of the opponent and the territory’s value.</p>
<blockquote><p>Decisions rely on personality differences, resource value and are adjustable to changes in own and opponent fighting performance during the contest.</p></blockquote>
<p>These strategies show that male Siamese fighting fish can make calculated decisions. However, contrary to most models used in economics, where strategic decisions are considered dependent largely on fixed assessments of opponents, in Siamese fighting fish we find that decisions rely on personality differences, resource value and are adjustable to changes in own and opponent fighting performance during the contest. The evaluation of resources follows long-standing expectations by evolutionary applications of game-theory, while the composite effects of personality and the use of flexible assessments are a developing field. We hope that similar approaches can help further develop accurate models of contest theory and that their future application in other help elucidate both archetypal mechanisms and phenotypic variation across the evolutionary scale.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fentanyl-deaths-children-teens-opioid">Fentanyl deaths have spiked among U.S. children and teens</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid, is killing a growing number of children and teens in the United States. &nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 1,500 kids under the age of 20 died from fentanyl in 2021, four times as many as in 2018, says epidemiologist Julie Gaither of the Yale School of Medicine, who will present the data May 1 at the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; The fentanyl deaths account for nearly all of the opioid-related deaths in this age group in 2021.</p>





<p>Fentanyl is a lab-made opioid used for pain treatment that is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin, making it lethal at a much smaller dose. The drug is also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/synthetic-prescription-opioids-deaths">manufactured and sold illegally</a> and is increasingly found contaminating counterfeit prescription drugs, or entirely replacing the drug a buyer expects to get (<em>SN: 5/1/18</em>).</p>



<p>“That’s primarily the story of what’s happening among teenagers,” says pediatrician and addiction provider Sarah Bagley of the Boston University Chobanian &amp; Avedisian School of Medicine. They intend to purchase and use one kind of drug or substance but unknowingly ingest fentanyl. “People are not anticipating that they are going to be exposed to fentanyl, and then they are, and that results in an overdose.”</p>



<p>Some of the signs that a person is experiencing an overdose include falling asleep, losing consciousness, gurgling or choking sounds and weak or no breathing.</p>



<p>“This change in the drug supply, where you just have a much more potent opioid, is really driving it all,” says Bagley, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Many of the fentanyl deaths among children and teens occurred at home and the vast majority were accidents, Gaither reports. “For smaller kids, kids who are mobile, they could be taking a drug that’s off the floor,” she says. There needs to be more education so that parents understand how lethal fentanyl is and that drugs “need to be kept out of proximity to a child.”</p>



<p>Gaither analyzed pediatric mortality data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1999 to 2021. The mortality rate from fentanyl soared more than 300 percent during that period, from 0.47 per 100,000 children to 1.92 per 100,000, she found. In 2021, 40 infants and 93 children 1 to 4 years of age died from fentanyl.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Deadly trend</h3>



<p>Opioid deaths in the United States have been rising since the late 1990s, as the drugs were more frequently prescribed. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl has increasingly been found in the illegal drug supply in the last decade. By 2017, more children under age 20 were dying from fentanyl than from other opioids, and those deaths have since spiked, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.</p>

<p>Fentanyl deaths have also been climbing for adults. More than 70,000 deaths in the United States were due to synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, in 2021, out of over <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">106,000 drug overdose fatalities</a> reported that year.</p>



<p>Naloxone, a medication that can reverse an opioid overdose, was <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-over-counter-naloxone-nasal-spray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved for the over-the-counter use</a> in March by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is expected to be available at a variety of stores in late summer. Some communities have been holding trainings on how to administer the medication, which comes as a nasal spray, and conclude by distributing naloxone to participants.</p>



<p>Sold under the brand name Narcan, the opioid antidote “is safe for kids of all ages,” Gaither says. If parents have the medication on hand, they can “reverse the effects of the opioids almost immediately.”</p>



<p>It’s important to also raise awareness of Narcan among teenagers, Bagley says. In conversations she’s had with teens, they have a lot of questions about how to keep their friends safe, “which is really wonderful.” Discussing overdoses with teens can include talking about an individual’s risk as well as “how do you take care of the people in your life you care about so much and respond if they’re in crisis.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former director of a cancer research center faked data and presented others’ published data and text as his own in four grant applications to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and one research record, according to a U.S. government watchdog.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/academics/faculty/johnny-j-he/">Johnny J. He</a>, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science (RFUMS) in Chicago, Ill., “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly falsifying, fabricating, and plagiarizing experimental data and text” published by other scientists, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-he-johnny-j">said today</a>.</p>



<p>He did not immediately respond to an email or phone call seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127006"></span>



<p>He <a href="https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/news/call-him-johnny-meet-the-new-director-of-the-center-for-cancer-cell-biology-immunology-and-infection/">started at RFUMS in 2020</a> as the director of the Center for Cancer Cell Biology, Immunology and Infection and the chair of the Discipline of Microbiology and Immunology. The <a href="https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/research/centers/centers-institutes-and-consortia/cancer-cell-biology-immunology-and-infection/">cancer research center</a> now lists another scientist as its director, but He remains among its members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He received nearly $15 million in NIH funding from 2000 to 2021, about $1.5 million of that total while at RFUMS. Before his current post, he was a professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI found that He took figures from published papers by other researchers and used them to represent his own data in NIH grant applications, sometimes cropping and splicing the images. He also plagiarized text from published articles, ORI said. None of the grant applications with plagiarized and faked data were funded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the agency and agreed to a three-year period of supervision for his research. During that time, He may not serve on any advisory committee, board, or peer review committee for the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the NIH.</p>



<p>We reached out to RFUMS for comment and received a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rosalind-Franklin-University-statement.pdf">statement</a> from Ronald S. Kaplan, the university’s executive vice president for research, which read in part: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The RFU Office of Research Integrity was alerted to allegations of research misconduct and conducted a thorough investigation, in strict accordance with university policies. The RFU investigation determined that research misconduct had taken place and promptly imposed appropriate sanctions and initiated the appropriate steps for remediation. RFU forwarded the investigation report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Research Integrity as required by university policies and federal regulations. HHS ORI made findings of research misconduct that have been recently published and are nearly identical to our findings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/findings-zoonomia-project-mammal-genomes">Here are 5 cool findings from a massive project on 240 mammal genomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have taken a deep dive into the wild world of mammalian evolution.</p>



<p>An international team of more than 100 researchers has <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn3943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed genetic information from 240 mammalian species</a>. Using the data, scientists can begin to answer questions about human disease, the brain, the arc of mammalian life on Earth and more.</p>



<p>Called the <a href="https://zoonomiaproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoonomia Project</a>, the research involved collecting DNA from species across mammals’ family tree, including an aardvark, human, fat-tailed dwarf lemur and a tapir, the team reports in 11 studies in the April 28 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“It’s a really nice survey of the mammals that are out there,” says Irene Gallego Romero, a human evolutionary geneticist at the University of Melbourne in Australia who was not a part of the work.</p>



<p>For every one of those mammals, scientists read out the slew of DNA “letters” that make up an animal’s genetic instruction book, or its genome, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2876-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work first described in 2020</a>. Then, the team lined up the text of each mammal’s book and looked for differences. Some text stayed nearly identical across all species examined, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Those spots, which have remained mostly unchanged across some 100 million years of evolution, may be parts of the genomes that are “doing something important,” geneticist Elinor Karlsson of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester said in an April 25 news briefing. Sections with lots of changes are interesting too, she says, and can offer clues about how a particular species may be adapting to its environment.</p>



<p>Karlsson recognizes that the 240 studied species, all placental mammals, represent just a tiny slice of living mammals — roughly 4 percent. And one animal not included “will annoy me to no end,” she said with a laugh. “For some reason, we couldn’t get a raccoon.”</p>



<p>But the team now has enough species to zero in on potentially essential bits of the mammalian genome, and to start to piece together new stories about mammals&#8217; evolution, including our own. Here are five findings that we thought were especially cool.</p>



<h4>1. A legendary sled dog’s genetic changes may have helped it survive in an extreme environment<strong>.</strong></h4>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="364" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-364x450.jpg" alt="A black and white photo of Balto the sled dog with a man in a fur jacket." class="wp-image-3124054" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-364x450.jpg 364w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-310x383.jpg 310w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-151x186.jpg 151w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-470x580.jpg 470w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-628x776.jpg 628w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124054">Balto the famous sled dog had genetic variants that may have helped him survive in 1920s Alaska.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124054">Brown Brothers/Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In 1925, a sled dog named Balto helped deliver diphtheria medicine to children in Nome, Alaska, a feat that made him famous. He was part of a dog population that had adapted to the region’s harsh conditions, scientists now propose. <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn5887" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An analysis of Balto’s DNA</a>, extracted from his remains, hints at what made these sled dogs so tough.</p>



<p>Balto most likely had an enhanced ability to digest starch and carried relatively few potentially damaging mutations, the researchers report. He was also less inbred than modern dogs — a sign that his population was genetically healthy.</p>





<p>Scientists also uncovered gene variants linked to bone and skin development. They can’t say for sure what advantages those variants offered, but it’s possible they gave Balto tough foot pads that helped him endure the cold and ice, says study coauthor Heather Jay Huson, an animal geneticist at Cornell University. “He was likely a very hardy dog.”</p>



<h4>2. Mammalian evolution ramped up well before the dinosaurs died out.</h4>



<p>The <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl8189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">origin of placental mammals may trace back to 102 million years ago</a>, one Zoonomia analysis suggests.</p>



<p>Scientists have long debated the timing of when mammalian evolution got underway. One traditional view is that the number of new mammalian species began to grow after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-asteroids-dinosaurs-impact-crater-nadir">an asteroid (or two</a>) hit Earth some 66 million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs (<em>SN: 8/22/22</em>).</p>



<p>But the new study supports a much longer timeline for different groups of mammals to arise. Instead, mammalian evolution may have kicked off around the time that the continents were breaking apart, and then continued over time, while <em>Spinosaurus</em> and <em>Oviraptor</em> still roamed Earth. Later, after the mass extinction event that marked the Cretaceous Period’s end, even more new mammalian species evolved.</p>



<p>While people may think mammals didn’t branch out until after the dinosaurs went extinct, “the data really suggest that they started to diverge earlier on,” Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at the Broad Institute and Uppsala University in Sweden, said in the news conference.</p>



<h4>3. Mammalian genomes could help identify genes that drive human cancer.</h4>



<p>In people with cancer, scientists can find mutations speckled through the genome. As cancers grow, these genetic changes tend to pile up. But it can be hard to know which mutations matter — which ones trigger or nudge along the disease. Data from the Zoonomia Project could help pinpoint which ones are important.</p>



<p>One of the new studies examined <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn2937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutations that occur in medulloblastoma</a>, a malignant brain tumor that mainly affects kids. The researchers looked for mutations in spots in the mammalian genome that don’t typically change. Because that DNA is shared across hundreds of mammal species, it’s likely essential for health, Gallego Romero says. Any disruptions could have big consequences — like cancer.</p>



<p>So a cancer mutation in these areas “is probably one of the ones to focus on,” says Gallego Romero, who wrote <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh0745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a commentary on the studies</a> in the same issue of <em>Science</em>. It could be one of the key genetic changes responsible for setting off the disease, she says. Homing in on these potentially problematic mutations could help scientists identify suspicious genes and figure out treatments.</p>



<h4>4. Some “jumping genes” may be more likely in meat eaters.</h4>



<p>Scientists have known for decades that some stretches of organisms’ genomes can hop from one location to another. Now, one Zoonomia study estimates just <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn1430" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how much of the genome is mobile among mammals</a>, and how an animal’s diet may come into play.</p>



<p>Among the hundreds of mammals analyzed, aardvark genomes were the most stuffed with “jumping genes,” researchers found. These mobile elements make up nearly 75 percent of the animal’s genome.</p>



<p>Meat-eating mammals also stood out. Compared with their noncarnivorous counterparts, meat eaters tended to accumulate more of one jumping gene type. “That was a little bit shocking to me,” says Nathan Upham, an evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved with the work, but also cowrote <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2209" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an accompanying commentary</a>.</p>



<p>It’s possible that predators somehow receive DNA from the prey they’re eating. That suggests that an animal’s ecology — in particular, what it eats — shapes the evolution of its genome, Upham says.</p>



<h4>5. Comparing the genomes of humans and other mammals might reveal secrets about the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Researchers have long sought what in our DNA sets us apart from other animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lining up mammals’ genomes and looking for regions in human DNA that have undergone lots of changes unearthed some clues. Those regions represent <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm1696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">areas that are evolving faster in humans than in other mammals&nbsp;</a>—&nbsp;and could hint at what makes us unique, researchers report in one Zoonomia study.</p>



<p>The scientists suggest that the human genome folds up in such a way that brings fast-changing regions physically close to genes involved in brain development, like two shoelace ends brought closer together when tying a knot. That proximity may ultimately dial up gene activity&nbsp;— perhaps changing how the human brain works.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, scientists don’t know exactly what such genomic alterations might do. But, Lindblad-Toh says, “it’s important to remember that what makes us human is not one change, but many, many changes.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worms-escape-tangle-knot-speed">These worms can escape tangled blobs in an instant. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like tiny, wriggling Houdinis, California blackworms are master escape artists. Groups of the worms work themselves into gnarly tangles but they can undo the knots in just tens of milliseconds. Now scientists have teased out how they do it.</p>



<p>Found in ponds and other standing water, California blackworms (<em>Lumbriculus variegatus</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-worm-blobs-behave-liquid-and-solid">interlace themselves into clumps</a> to control their temperature or conserve moisture (<em>SN: 1/11/19</em>). The worms are typically just a few centimeters long. Their clumps, which can contain anywhere from 5 to 50,000 worms, take minutes to weave. But when spooked by a potential predator, the worms are outta there in an instant.</p>





<p>Videos and ultrasound images helped scientists unravel the worms’ behavior. The tangling and loosening <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade7759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results from the different types of sinuous paths the worms take</a>, researchers report in the April 28 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>When the worms are in tangling mode, they do loop-de-loops in the clump, swimming in circular paths that only occasionally switch direction between clockwise and counterclockwise. To disentangle, the worms go into overdrive, frequently switching between clockwise and counterclockwise, often forming figure eights with their bodies. “It’s kind of like the worms have two gears,” — tangling or untangling — says applied mathematician Vishal Patil of Stanford University.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">California blackworms tangle their bodies around one another to form worm clumps, which can take many minutes. Despite the complexity of the knotted blobs, the worms can free themselves almost immediately in response to an unpleasant stimulus (in this case electrical stimulation from a nine-volt battery).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Patil and colleagues created computer simulations that re-created the worms’ elite escape skills. Simulated worms that rarely changed looping direction tangled into a blob, and those that often reversed course quickly exploded out of the knot. Those simulations helped confirm the mechanism behind the tangling and untangling.</p>



<p>Understanding how tangling and untangling works is relevant beyond worms — or this morning’s bedhead. Felt is made from tangled fibers, as are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-nest-sturdy-physics">birds’ nests</a> and a host of other materials (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>). Studying worm snarls might help scientists design tangled materials that can be tweaked. By changing the amount of tangle between fibers, scientists could adjust properties like the stiffness of a material.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/plos-response-to-the-national-institutes-of-health-request-for-information/">PLOS response to the National Institutes of Health Request for Information</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently requested feedback on its planned implementation of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) directive</a> to make all US federally funded research immediately publicly accessible. PLOS has been a longtime champion of making scholarly publications, and their underlying data, immediately available to the public, and we welcomed the opportunity to share our feedback. Below is our response to this request.</p>



<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>



<p>As a nonprofit Open Science publisher, PLOS aims to ensure that Open Science is practicable for the entire scholarly community, and that the reward system of science appropriately acknowledges and honors Open Science practices as contributing to a common good. We wish to express our enthusiastic support for the vision articulated in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">OSTP memo of August 25 2022</a> and our appreciation of the NIH&rsquo;s thoughtful steps toward realizing that vision. We appreciate <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-091.html">the opportunity</a> to share our perspective on the NIH&rsquo;s plan to enhance access to the results of research, and improve equity in scholarly publishing for authors and readers alike.</p>



<p>The rapid dissemination and widespread availability of research and underlying data through Open Science is key to meeting major challenges&mdash;from the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic to the climate crisis&mdash;with effective, evidence-based solutions grounded in rigorous reproducible science. We see Openness as more than the ability to read research articles. Openness includes unrestricted access to the tools and information necessary to understand research results in context, to verify and reproduce results, and to reuse data and methods. True Openness also means equitable opportunities for publication and participation in the peer review process.</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>How to best ensure equity in publication opportunities for NIH-supported investigators.</strong></li></ol>



<p>We believe that equitable access to Open publishing opportunities requires a shift away from a volumetric &lsquo;pay per publication&rsquo; model reliant on Article Processing Charges (APCs). APCs have demonstrated that Open Access is viable&mdash;but they are exclusionary and they create incentives for publishers to increase volume or price. Waivers, while a useful stop-gap, are not a sustainable solution.</p>



<p>Instead, we should work together to evolve new models based on partnership, collaboration, and community. Already, publishers, including PLOS, are experimenting with new ways to finance Open Access, including <a href="https://plos.org/publish/community-action-publishing-for-authors/">Community Action Publishing,</a> Subscribe to Open programs, and more.</p>



<p>In the short term, and in parallel with developing and honing new solutions, we can implement simple changes to better meet author and stakeholder needs.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Establish funding mechanisms specifically for research dissemination. Researchers shouldn&rsquo;t have to choose between using their grant to pay a publication fee, or to conduct more experiments.</li><li>Aggregate funding for publication services fees through a university library or similar body, rather than allocating small amounts through individual research grants. Centralizing administrative functions increases efficiency, reduces the administrative burden on individual researchers and the administrative costs to publishers, and makes it possible to more fairly distribute the cost of publication, putting Open Access within reach for more of the research community.</li></ol>



<p>In the US, libraries and consortia have shown that they are open to testing new methods, and that these types of partnership can be effective both in increasing transparency, and addressing cost inflation.</p>



<ol type="1" start="2"><li><strong>Steps for improving equity in access and accessibility of publications.</strong></li></ol>



<p>PLOS supports the NIH&rsquo;s efforts to increase and accelerate access to publicly funded research. Eliminating the embargo will meaningfully benefit researchers, practitioners, and patients alike, and is reasonable and feasible for publishers as well. PLOS has always deposited research with indexing and archiving services as soon as possible following publications.</p>



<p>We also appreciate the emphasis placed on machine readability, which is essential to discoverability, reuse, and reanalysis. However, because the NIH policy provides for access alone, without the legal right to reuse that true <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Open Access licensing</a> provides, its utility is limited&mdash;especially in this era of big data and rich text data mining. Reuse and redistribution are key to maximizing the reach and impact of research.</p>



<p>Equally vital to reproducibility is ensuring access to research outputs other than articles, such as data and methods documentation, including study designs, code, and protocols. The NIH can help to drive change in this area by encouraging, reinforcing, and rewarding the sharing of a broader range of research outputs in line with best practices for reproducibility, transparency, and inclusivity, in the grant application process.</p>



<ol type="1" start="3"><li><strong>Methods for monitoring evolving costs and impacts on affected communities.</strong></li></ol>



<p>The expectation of transparency in pricing policy will encourage continued experimentation with more equitable scholarly communications business models, helping to drive positive change.</p>



<p>In the short term, we recommend that the NIH take advantage of the considerable public information on pricing already available, by aligning with established systems (like those of Coalition S). Gathering similar information independently in a new system will create additional administrative tasks and unnecessary expense.</p>



<p>In developing any new monitoring or measurement frameworks, it&rsquo;s crucial to recognize that individual article fees are not an essential part of an Open system. Future monitoring efforts must be structured in a way that allows for the evolution of business models, which is key to increasing equity in publication opportunities. In order to be successfully adopted, any new monitoring framework must also be broadly applicable beyond the NIH, or the US context alone.</p>



<ol type="1" start="4"><li><strong>Early input on considerations to increase findability and transparency of research.</strong></li></ol>



<p>The development and consistent application of shared metadata standards is key to discoverability and credibility. We encourage the NIH to invest and participate in community-based metadata initiatives in order to build systems that work for all, and to prioritize systems with the broadest potential impact, focusing on utility and reuse with the aim of increasing system-wide efficiency and accelerating scientific advancement.</p>



<p>To be effective, metadata and persistent identifiers (PIDs) must be interoperable and follow some level of standardization. Therefore the NIH should recognize the benefits of making specific recommendations in this area, to accelerate harmonization around emerging standards adopted by the scientific community. In developing guidelines for grantees and publishers, the NIH should:</p>



<ul><li>Specify clear and detailed metadata standards and provide recommendations about which PIDs to use to describe diverse research artifacts and the links between them, both in a machine-readable way at scale, and as human readers accessing individual research elements.</li><li>Set expectations for PIDs and metadata to understand the individual contributions of authors, editors, and peer reviewers, and provide a digital infrastructure to support credit for all contributions.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Although Open Access has made great strides over the past two decades, the majority of research outputs are still not accessible, either because they are behind a paywall (according to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265545">recent analysis</a> of Web of Science and Dimensions data, 53-56% of published research remains closed), or because they have not been shared at all (e.g. datasets, protocols, negative and null results).</p>



<p>In order to actively move away from paywalled research, we need to change the reward system of science, ensuring that researchers receive meaningful credit and recognition for all kinds of contributions. This includes both acknowledgement for a wider variety of research creation and assessment roles, from protocol development through peer review, and a more representative range of research outputs, including information that contextualizes research articles and enables reproducibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccines-antibodies-rsv-virus">Here’s what we know about upcoming vaccines and antibodies against RSV</a></h4>

              
                <p>Finally, researchers may have ways to combat a deadly respiratory illness.</p>



<p>The disease is not the flu or COVID-19, but respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.</p>



<p>The virus was first identified in 1957 in Baltimore, but it has probably been around for millennia, says Jim Boonyaratanakornkit, a virologist and transplant immunologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. “It’s always been a plague for the very young and the very old,” he says.</p>



<p>In Europe, people age 60 and older may soon get some protection against the virus. An advisory committee recommended April 26 that a vaccine against RSV made by the pharmaceutical giant GSK should be approved for use. That decision will go to the European Commission for final approval.</p>





<p>No RSV vaccine has been approved in the United States. And there are no specific antiviral medications to combat RSV, and only one preventive treatment — a monoclonal antibody — is reserved for a small number of babies at high risk of severe disease. But that could soon change. Several companies now have clinical trial data suggesting that their various vaccine candidates or lab-made monoclonal antibodies can protect against RSV’s worst consequences.</p>



<p>Those treatments are geared, in part, toward the youngest children. People of all ages can contract the virus, but it tends to hit the youngest the hardest. In 2019, RSV caused an estimated 33 million infections worldwide in children ages 5 and younger. About 3.6 million children were hospitalized and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00478-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 100,000 died</a>, researchers reported last year in the <em>Lancet</em>. Their calculations revealed that RSV causes 1 in every 28 deaths of children 28-days- to 6-months-old.</p>



<p>“This is why we should care,” Penny Heaton of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a company owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson, said April 4 at the World Vaccine Congress, held in Washington D.C. Vaccines and antibodies might be able to prevent some of those deaths. “This is the amazing impact that … RSV vaccines [and] monoclonal antibodies … can have on the health of children globally.”</p>



<p>But it’s not just the 5-and-under crowd who will benefit. Their grandparents, great-grandparents and other older adults could soon get RSV shots. That could mean an easing of the burden of RSV in the two groups hit hardest by the virus.</p>



<p>Two companies — GSK, formerly GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer — are close to getting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for their RSV vaccines. Moderna isn’t far behind with an mRNA-based RSV vaccine. Meanwhile, Danish company Bavarian Nordic expects results from a clinical trial soon for its vaccine, and several other companies also have RSV vaccines in the works.</p>





<p>Other companies are developing monoclonal antibodies to give to babies and infants as preventives against RSV. Those lab-made antibodies aren’t vaccines, but a dose given before the start of RSV season may temporarily protect vulnerable babies from becoming very sick if they get infected.</p>



<p>There are so many options on the horizon that Janssen decided to bow out. “As we looked across our portfolio, and we looked across the RSV landscape,” Heaton said, “we have made the decision to discontinue our RSV program,” and to stop a late-stage clinical trial. The company also <a href="https://www.janssen.com/janssen-provides-portfolio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced the decision</a> in March, saying it wanted to focus on unmet medical needs. RSV, it seems, may soon no longer fit that bill.</p>



<p>For now, the virus is still very much a problem. Usually, RSV season starts in October and peaks in December or January — at least in the United States. It generally ends in April.</p>



<p>The virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">almost vanished</a> in the winter of 2020–21. In that first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, RSV-positive PCR tests never rose above 3 percent — the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s threshold for an epidemic. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, RSV positivity rates peaked each season at about 13 to 16 percent. &nbsp;RSV’s disappearance was thanks mostly to precautions, including social distancing and mask-wearing, put in place against COVID-19.</p>



<p>But the virus rebounded, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7214a1.htm?s_cid=mm7214a1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appearing in the summer of 2021</a>, researchers report April 7 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. That year RSV season shifted, starting in May. It hit its zenith in July and ended in January 2022.</p>



<p>The 2022–23 RSV season shifted closer to the prepandemic pattern but was still early. The 2022 season started in June and peaked in November with a positivity rate of 19 percent. &nbsp;The season ended sometime between December and February, depending on which part of the country you live in. This latest RSV season hit kids hard, overwhelming children’s hospitals in some places.</p>



<p>No one knows when the next RSV season will begin. But some of the vaccines and treatments in development could be ready for deployment this fall, potentially reducing the number of doctor visits, hospitalizations and deaths from the infections.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of the vaccine and treatment candidates.</p>



<h4>What is in the vaccines?</h4>



<p>Three companies — Pfizer, GSK and Moderna — have based their vaccines on one of RSV&#8217;s proteins. That protein, called the F protein, sits on the virus’s outer membrane and helps it fuse to human cells. The F protein is a shapeshifter. Before fusion, it looks like a rounded knob. After fusion, it resembles a needle or pointy tower.</p>

Researchers discovered a decade ago that the F protein has a knobby shape (illustrated at left) before the virus fuses with a cell. After fusion, the protein takes on a pointier shape (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123907">Jason McLellan</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A decade ago, researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health figured out that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1243283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">locking the protein into its prefusion knob state</a> causes the immune system to react more strongly than to the virus’ shapeshifting form. All three companies use some version of the F protein locked in the prefusion state in their vaccines. Pfizer described the nitty-gritty <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ade6422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details of making this stabilized F protein</a> April 6 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Pfizer and GSK’s vaccines contain the protein itself. Moderna’s candidate, like its COVID-19 vaccine, is an mRNA vaccine that tells the body to produce the protein.</p>



<p>Bavarian Nordic is taking a different approach. The company makes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine">a vaccine that works against both smallpox and mpox</a>, formerly called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-ebola-monkeypox-mpox-polio-hepatitis-bird-flu-2022">monkeypox</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/22</em>). That vaccine is live vaccinia virus, a pox virus that has been engineered so that it can’t replicate well in the body. Many vaccines, including those against flu, measles and chicken pox are also such live attenuated, or weakened, viruses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For its RSV vaccine, Bavarian Nordic engineered the vaccinia virus to <a href="https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/what-we-do/pipeline/rsv.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make five of RSV’s proteins</a>, including the F protein. At the World Vaccine Congress, one person asked whether such a hybrid virus might give protection against RSV, mpox and smallpox. But the company has no data yet to suggest the vaccine would protect against all three, Peter Costa, Bavarian Nordic’s U.S. medical affairs regional lead, said April 5 during a session in which multiple companies presented data on RSV vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.</p>



<p>Another company, Codagenix, is working with the RSV virus itself, tinkering with its genetic instruction book to make the virus unable to cause disease. For its vaccine, the company’s researchers introduced more than 1,000 mutations in one gene to slow replication of the virus, says Jeffrey Fu, the company’s chief business officer. Those mutations change the virus’s RNA but don’t alter the amino acids in its proteins.</p>



<p>“We’re able to design viruses … that look identical or nearly identical to the real virus,” Fu told me. Because the virus replicates slowly, it doesn’t cause disease but stimulates an immune reaction. The vaccine will be given as nose drops, unlike the other vaccines, which are given as shots.</p>



<p>Codagenix plans to start testing its vaccine’s safety at a low dose in healthy 5-year-olds this spring. If safe, the company wants to gradually increase the dose as well as begin testing the vaccine candidate in younger children, working down to 6-month-olds. </p>



<p>Pfizer’s vaccine is being tested for its ability to protect newborns, babies and older adults. The rest of the companies&#8217; vaccines are for use in older adults.</p>



<h4>How well do the RSV vaccines work in newborns and babies?</h4>



<p>Only Pfizer is testing a vaccine to protect newborns. And it doesn’t give shots to babies. Instead, the company gave its vaccine candidate to more than 7,300 healthy pregnant women age 49 or younger. The idea is that the mother will produce antibodies against RSV that will transfer through the placenta to the baby. Those antibodies would give babies temporary protection against the virus in the especially vulnerable first six months of life.</p>



<p>Most children get infected with RSV by the time they are 2 years old. The disease may be just a coldlike illness for many kids, with a runny nose, decrease in appetite and a cough. But wheezing or difficulty breathing can also occur, and very young infants might pause breathing for more than 10 seconds. RSV can also lead to more severe illnesses including bronchitis and pneumonia.</p>



<p>Pfizer’s strategy to protect babies from these consequences of RSV seems to have worked. In the 90 days after birth, six infants born to moms who got the vaccine had severe RSV lung infections requiring medical attention. In the placebo group, 33 babies had severe lung infections. That’s a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2216480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine efficacy of 81.8 percent</a>, researchers report April 5 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Over time, that vaccine efficacy slipped a bit as mothers&#8217; antibodies wore out. Within six months after birth, 19 babies of mothers in the vaccine group and 62 infants of mothers in the placebo group developed severe lung infections, a vaccine efficacy of about 69 percent.</p>



<p>The vaccine didn’t meet statistical criteria for preventing less-severe lung infections, but there were about half the number of such infections in babies whose mothers got the vaccine compared with babies whose mothers got a placebo. Within 90 days after birth, 24 infants in the vaccinated-mom group and 56 in the placebo group got lung infections. That’s roughly 57 percent efficacy. That efficacy against less-severe lung infections also slipped slightly, to 51 percent, within 180 days of birth.</p>



<p>The vaccine kept babies out of the hospital too. In the first 90 days of life, the vaccine’s efficacy was almost 68 percent at preventing hospitalization, falling to about 57 percent efficacy within 180 days of birth.</p>



<p>Like the COVID vaccines and most vaccines for respiratory illnesses, the vaccine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">wasn’t great at preventing infection</a> (<em>SN: 5/29/22</em>). The vaccine’s efficacy against any RSV illness requiring medical attention was about 39 percent in the first three months of life and 38 percent in the six months after birth.</p>



<p>As for safety, there weren’t side effects beyond what researchers expected; some pain at the injection site, some muscle aches. “This was a maternal trial, so obviously moms were tired [and] had headaches. You can see that from the placebo numbers,” Barbara Pahud, the clinical lead for Pfizer’s ongoing study, said at the vaccine congress. No serious safety concerns caused by the vaccine appeared during the trial in either mothers or babies.</p>



<p>Pfizer is continuing to follow the children and will have two years’ worth of data to present ahead of an FDA meeting to discuss the vaccine’s approval in August, she said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Protecting babies</h3>



<p>Giving an RSV vaccine to pregnant women helped protect those women&#8217;s infants from severe RSV lung infections that required medical attention. Antibodies transferred from the vaccinated mothers were most effective in the first 90 days after birth. The vaccine&#8217;s efficacy was 81 percent in that period. As babies&#8217; bodies broke down the antibodies, the vaccine&#8217;s efficacy waned a bit, but was still more than 69 percent effective six months after birth.</p>

<p>Codagenix has data from lab animal studies suggesting its vaccine can trigger the production of protective antibodies. But its trial in children is just getting started, and there are no results to report yet.</p>



<h4>Do monoclonal antibodies help protect newborns and babies?</h4>



<p>Giving monoclonal antibodies to newborns and babies might help against RSV too. Like antibodies passed from mothers to babies, lab-made antibodies targeted against the virus’s F protein are showing some signs of success at protecting infants against RSV.</p>



<p>One monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, was approved by the FDA in 1998. But that antibody is used only for babies at the highest risk of severe illness from RSV. That includes babies born prematurely, those with a chronic lung condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia and infants with certain heart conditions. That’s only a fraction of the babies born in the United States each year. And palivizumab isn’t available in most of the low- and middle-income countries where the virus is the biggest problem, Codagenix’s Fu says.</p>



<p>What’s more, palivizumab doesn’t last long. Vulnerable babies need an injection every month during RSV season. And at more than $1,800 per dose, the medication is expensive.</p>



<p>Some companies have been working on more potent, longer-lasting monoclonal antibodies for use in babies and infants. Sanofi and AstraZeneca teamed up to make one called nirsevimab. That antibody was approved for use in the European Union and the United Kingdom in November. It is being considered for approval in the United States.</p>



<p>In a clinical trial, about 2,000 newborns got an injection of nirsevimab and about 1,000 babies got a placebo. Through 150 days after getting the shot, the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2214773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antibody’s efficacy against hospitalization was 76.8 percent</a>, researchers report April 5 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em></p>



<p>Merck also has a long-lasting monoclonal antibody being <a href="https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/trial/nct04938830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested in clinical trials</a>. Results from those studies aren’t yet available.</p>



<h4>Do the vaccines protect older people?</h4>



<p>Babies, toddlers and preschoolers are perhaps the population that people worry most about when it comes to RSV, but the virus hits older people hard too.</p>



<p>In the United States alone, between 60,000 and 160,000 older adults are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/high-risk/older-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospitalized with RSV each year</a>, and 6,000 to 10,000 die, the CDC estimates. <br><br>In 2019, an estimated <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irv.13031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.2 million people</a> ages 60 or older caught RSV in high-income countries, researchers reported last year in <em>Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses.</em> Of the 5.2 million cases, 470,000 people landed in the hospital, with about 33,000 of those dying, the researchers estimate. The study looked only at high-income countries, including the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan and some European countries. But if the kid data are any indication, the death rate for older folks may have been much higher had people in low- and middle-income countries been included. </p>



<p>“This is a relatively unrecognized infection in adult populations,” Edward Walsh, an infectious diseases doctor at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said April 5 at the World Vaccine Congress.</p>



<p>Walsh was one of the lead researchers testing Pfizer’s vaccine for older adults. He and colleagues conducted a large trial involving more than 34,000 people ages 60 and older in Argentina, Canada, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa and the United States. Half got Pfizer’s vaccine candidate, and half got a placebo.</p>



<p>The trial started in August 2021. Though RSV reemerged to infect a lot of children that year, it didn’t come back in prepandemic numbers in older adults, especially not in the over-60 crowd, Walsh said. “They continued to stay away from grandchildren, stay away from crowds and wear masks,” preventing transmission.</p>



<p>Walsh told me later that he and colleagues found only 16 percent of prepandemic numbers of infections in older adults in the Rochester area during the study period. With such low numbers of infections, “we were very nervous that [the trial] wasn’t going to show us anything.”</p>



<p>The Rochester area was just one of 240 sites in the study. With the information collected from each site, the researchers had enough data to calculate the vaccine’s efficacy. The researchers considered different levels of severity based on whether the virus infected the lungs and how many symptoms, such as cough, wheezing or shortness of breath, that participants reported.</p>



<p>In the placebo group, 14 participants developed lung infections with three or more symptoms. Only two participants who got the vaccine developed that level of illness for an <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2213836" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficacy of 85.7 percent</a>, Walsh and colleagues report April 5 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Against RSV lung infections with two or more symptoms, the vaccine had an efficacy of 66.7 percent, with 33 cases in the placebo group and 11 in the vaccine group.</p>



<p>Those efficacy numbers are lower but similar to those reported by GSK on February 16 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. But results from the vaccine trials are not directly comparable because they were conducted in different countries and used different measurements.</p>



<p>GSK tested its vaccine on about 25,000 participants age 60 and over from 17 countries across five continents. In the trial, seven people who got the company’s vaccine and 40 who got a placebo developed RSV lung infections with two or more symptoms lasting at least 24 hours. That is an <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2209604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficacy of 82.6 percent</a>. The European Medicines Agency&#8217;s committee for human medicines&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/first-vaccine-protect-older-adults-respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv-infection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended the vaccine for approval</a>&nbsp;on the strength of those data.</p>



<p>Moderna hasn’t yet published results from its vaccine trial in a scientific or medical journal, but it issued a <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Announces-mRNA-1345-an-Investigational-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-RSV-Vaccine-Has-Met-Primary-Efficacy-Endpoints-in-Phase-3-Trial-in-Older-Adults/default.aspx#:~:text=Following%20review%20by%20an%20independent,by%20two%20or%20more%20symptoms." target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> in January with the numbers. The company gave its vaccine or a placebo to about 37,000 adults ages 60 and older in 22 countries. Only nine people in the vaccine group got lung infections with two or more symptoms compared with 55 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 83.7 percent.</p>



<p>Bavarian Nordic gave healthy 18- to 50-year-olds a shot of vaccine or placebo and then purposely gave them RSV in a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-first-human-challenge-trial-covid-19">human challenge trial</a> (<em>SN: 2/18/21</em>). The vaccine prevented symptomatic infections with <a href="https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/investor/news/news.aspx?news=6393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">79 percent efficacy</a>, the company reported in a press release in 2021. But that was among healthy younger adults who have less risk of severe complications than elderly people do.</p>



<p>Bavarian Nordic also conducted a clinical trial in the United States and Germany of 20,000 people age 60 and older. Results of the study should be available later this year, Costa said.</p>



<p>Without masking and social distancing, RSV probably isn’t going to disappear again. As for the new vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, they probably won’t stop RSV’s spread. But they may at least protect the most vulnerable among us against the virus’s worst effects.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">On January 16, inspectors from an environmental agency in western Colombia made some <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Link-1.pdf">troubling findings</a>. At a U.S.-funded facility supposed to be doing cutting-edge malaria research, researchers were keeping dozens of monkeys in dirty cages in poorly ventilated, over-lit enclosures. Several animals were smeared with feces. Some looked sick, and one was missing an eye. A fetid smell hung in the air. On the floor of a cage, a baby monkey lay dead.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t the first time <a href="https://inmuno.co/cic/es/fucep-fundacion-centro-de-primates/">Fundación Centro de Primates</a> (FUCEP) had run afoul of local authorities. In 2021, inspectors had turned up signs of “animal abuse” at the facility, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Centro+Internacional+De+Vacunas/@3.3031825,-76.4831794,175m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x8e309fbfada906ab:0x178c01c2d29f66d0!8m2!3d3.3034494!4d-76.4821417!16s%2Fg%2F11c205xq21">located</a> a few miles from the city of Cali, and found no veterinarian on site. Perhaps more damning, the researchers in charge did not have the permits required to experiment on or keep lab animals.</p>



<p>But the problems may run even deeper. According to an 18-months investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a U.S.-based animal-rights group, FUCEP&#8217;s parent organization, <a href="https://inmuno.co/cic/es/consorcio-2/">Caucaseco Scientific Research Consortium</a>, apparently also conducted research in people without valid ethics approvals. These allegations have not previously been described in the media.</p>



<span id="more-127001"></span>



<p>The consortium, which is run by Colombian husband-and-wife team Myriam Arévalo-Herrera and Sócrates Herrera, has received more than $17 million from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2003, along with other international funding, according to PETA.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about this married couple and their three kids who handle this consortium that they are portraying as if it were, let&#8217;s say, like a university campus with several schools, like independent and all, but it&#8217;s all the same business, managed with the same people,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthmagnoliamartinezpena">Magnolia Martínez</a> of PETA, who led the investigation.</p>



<p>A Google Maps <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Centro+Internacional+De+Vacunas/@3.3031825,-76.4831794,175m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x8e309fbfada906ab:0x178c01c2d29f66d0!8m2!3d3.3034494!4d-76.4821417!16s%2Fg%2F11c205xq21">aerial photo</a> of the consortium&#8217;s <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LINK-3.pdf">self-described &#8220;campus&#8221;</a> shows several buildings in a wooded area. One is a big house in a neat garden with a circular driveway, a swimming pool and some smaller structures. A former Caucaseco employee who spoke on condition of anonymity told Retraction Watch this was the residence of Herrera and Arévalo-Herrera. It was known as “la mansion,” the person said, and was usually off limits to the consortium’s staffers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Arévalo-Herrera nor Herrera responded to requests for comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">NIH every year provides <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105736">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in contracts or grants to foreign organizations for animal research. Although this funding comes with several requirements, such as meeting certain animal-welfare policies, NIH relies on self-reported information from award recipients to ensure compliance. According to a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105736.pdf">new report</a> from the U.S. Government Accountability Office:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>NIH does not take steps, such as conducting site visits or requiring third-party verification, to ascertain the reliability of this information. As a result, NIH may be missing opportunities to identify and respond to possible instances of noncompliance with animal care and use standards at foreign research facilities.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In December, Martínez sent <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LINK-2.pdf">a letter</a> to the NIH with a detailed summary of her findings. We reached out to the agency in March for comments and were told:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All animals used in NIH-funded research are protected by laws, regulations, and policies to ensure the greatest commitment to animal welfare.

And the Colombian comptroller general said in a letter obtained by PETA that an audit of the government agency that funded the couple’s research for decades will <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LINK-5.pdf">take into account the “alleged irregularities”</a> at FUCEP.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The debacle at Caucaseco has been <a href="https://www.elpais.com.co/cali/monos-decomisados-a-centro-de-investigacion-caucaseco-siguen-en-cuarentena-cvc.html">covered</a> extensively in Colombia, but has received only <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/01/nih-gave-millions-to-researchers-accused-of-vax-development-scam/">scant</a> <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2023/02/10/exclusive-colombia-shuts-down-u-s-taxpayer-funded-lab-torturing-monkeys-research/">media</a> attention in the United States. Many of PETA&#8217;s <a href="https://headlines.peta.org/cruel-colombian-organizations/">findings</a> appear on its website, where the group has also published comprehensive documentation obtained through freedom-of-information requests to both public and private agencies in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What has not received media attention until now is PETA&#8217;s allegation that at least two dozen scientific publications coauthored by the Colombian research duo could be affected by fraud. Martínez said the papers cite research approvals by ethics committees – institutional review boards (IRBs) and institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) – that don&#8217;t seem to exist.</p>



<p>The articles appear in several journals, including <em>Nature Communications</em>, <em>Redox Biology</em>, <em>Vaccine</em>, <em>PLOS One</em>, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases </em>and others. Martínez said she contacted all the journals, describing her findings and highlighting the affected papers. In her emails, which Retraction Watch has seen, she wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Among the multiple troubling findings that PETA’s investigation documented are the lack of properly established IRB and IACUC. According to the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, there are no records of IRBs operating within the organizations controlled by Herrera and Arévalo. Also, [the researchers] have failed to produce any records related to a propely [sic] established and functional IACUC. Other findings have to do with violations of Colombian animal welfare laws and other regulations; discrepancies between salaries reported to NIAID [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases] and salaries actually paid to staff involved in NIAID-funded activities; apparent illegal capture of Aotus monkeys; dubious incorporation and management practices; unsupported statements in Herrera’s NIAID grant applications; alleged failures to comply with biosafety standards that resulted in an employee being infected multiple times with the malaria parasite; and alleged lack of scientific integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After PETA released its investigation, more ex-employees of Herrera and Arévalo have come forward with grave allegations such as how they were instructed to fill out blank informed consent forms in preparation for a potential audit and how in many cases it was impossible to know whose human samples they were handling since they lacked labels. According to these allegations, Herrera and Arévalo were not meeting basic standards of research with humans either.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Not all of the journals responded, although some promised to investigate.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/redox-biology/editorial-board/michael-davies-dphil">Michael Davies</a>, scientific integrity and ethics editor of <em>Redox Biology</em>, which in 2018 published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231718302556?via%3Dihub">a study</a> coauthored by the Colombian researchers, told Martínez in an email on March 30 that the journal agreed &#8220;that this case is very serious&#8221;:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have examined the paper that was published in Redox Biology and this does not appear to directly involve samples from the primate colony, but we take the comments regarding the alleged mishandled of human samples and manipulated data extremely seriously, and we would like to follow up on this aspect, as soon as we have more data on this aspect.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a follow-up email the next day, Davies added that the IRB problem:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>is a critical issue, but it is also one that we cannot easily assess on our own. So, as soon as you have any updates on this, please let us know, so that we can take the appropriate action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ripudaman Bains, team manager at <em>Nature Communications</em>, which published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29226-3">a clinical trial</a> by the Colombian researchers last year, told Martínez in an email from April 17:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following your original email, my colleagues and I (in consultation with the Springer Nature Research Integrity team) performed an extensive investigation into the concerns that you raised regarding the IRB approval for this study and, as is standard process in such instances, we raised these concerns with Dr Herrera and Dr Arévalo. We have established that the authors did acquire approval from Centro Internacional de Vacunas’.</p>



<p>We have also reviewed the study protocols relating to the published work and concluded that they were appropriately evaluated. As a result of our investigation, we will not be taking further action with respect to this paper.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Martínez shot back:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As I mentioned in my initial communication, there are no records of properly established and functional IRBs affiliated with the organizations controlled by Herrera and Arévalo, including Centro Internacional de Vacunas. Colombian officials confirmed this to PETA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bains then requested &#8220;the contact information for the Colombian officials&#8221; to &#8220;be able to liaise with them directly.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch emailed the <em>PLOS</em> journals for comments, but we have not heard back. Springer Nature, the publisher of <em>Nature Communications</em>, said it was looking into the case.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes <em>Vaccine</em> and <em>Redox Biology</em>, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We take these accusations seriously and are undertaking an in-depth investigation, but we cannot comment until the investigation is complete. If the allegations are upheld, we will take appropriate action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On January 19, Colombian authorities <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LINK-4.pdf">suspended all primate research</a> at Caucaseco.

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/iStock-869270600-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Pregnancy, childbirth and caring for an infant can be stressful. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61276-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One in five women</a> experience mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression, during their pregnancy or after giving birth. This can have very serious consequences for women, their infants and their families. It is critical that we identify women who are struggling with their mental health so that we can offer help and support.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg192/chapter/Recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidelines</a> set out by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England recommend that all women should be asked about their mental health when they attend their first appointment in pregnancy and again soon after they give birth. In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05518-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our new paper</a>, we used responses to three national maternity surveys in England to find out whether women are being asked in accordance with the guidelines.</p>
<p>Over 13,000 women who gave birth between 2014 and 2020 took part in our <a href="https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/maternity-surveys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveys</a>. Across the three surveys, we found that between 17% and 20% of these women were not asked about their mental health during pregnancy and between 12% and 26% were not asked after they gave birth. We also found that women from ethnic minority backgrounds were less likely to be asked about their mental health, when compared to white women. This is important because if certain groups of women are less likely to be asked, then these same groups of women are less likely to be identified as needing support and less likely to receive treatment.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we don’t ask, then we risk missing vulnerable women who can be helped.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why are some women not asked about their mental health? Studies have shown that there are <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02646838.2016.1188278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barriers</a> for healthcare professionals when it comes to talking to women about mental health. These include time constraints during maternity appointments, lack of training and confidence to talk to women about their mental health, not knowing how to support women with symptoms or how to get help for women who need further input. There may be <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/evaluation-of-ethnic-disparities-in-detection-of-depression-and-anxiety-in-primary-care-during-the-maternal-period-combined-analysis-of-routine-and-cohort-data/98B959EF09DDEBED21FCE66489C23C56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional barriers</a> for healthcare professionals when it comes to talking about mental health with women from ethnic minority backgrounds. These include difficulties with language and communication and concerns over how cultural beliefs might affect perceptions and conversations about mental health.</p>
<p>And why is it so important? If we don’t ask, then we don’t know how many women are suffering from mental health problems around the time of pregnancy or who these women are. We therefore don’t know the scope of the problem, how the problem affects different groups of women, or whether we have adequate services and resources to meet the needs of all women needing support. We know that <a href="https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/assets/downloads/mbrrace-uk/reports/maternal-report-2022/MBRRACE-UK_Maternal_MAIN_Report_2022_v10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maternal suicide</a> remains the leading direct cause of death over the first year following pregnancy. This is a startling reminder of the importance of recognizing women who need help, and this may start with a simple question. If we don’t ask, then we risk missing vulnerable women who can be helped.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pets-owners-bond-pandemic-stress">Pets and people bonded during the pandemic. But owners were still stressed and lonely</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you feel like you bonded with your pet during the pandemic, you’re not alone.</p>



<p>Cat and dog owners in the United States <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gradually grew closer to their pets during the first two years of COVID-19</a>. But these furry friends didn’t ease their humans’ overall stress or loneliness, despite owners citing their pets’ positive influences, researchers report April 26 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>“The one very clear message is that the human-animal relationship is very complicated,” says veterinary epidemiologist Hsin-Yi Weng of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>





<p>When the coronavirus outbreak began, Weng and colleagues recognized it as an unfortunate but unique opportunity to explore the dynamics of pet ownership during a large-scale, disruptive event. The team launched a survey around mid-2020 asking about people’s stress, loneliness and relationships with their pets. Participants reflected on their emotions before the pandemic (February 2020) and during lockdown (April to June 2020). Follow-up surveys in September 2020 and quarterly throughout 2021 captured information about the reopening and recovery phases, respectively.</p>



<p>Analyzing responses from more than 4,200 individuals, the team found that cat and dog owners felt they steadily bonded with their pets between the pre-pandemic and recovery phases. Spending more time at home and isolated from other people might explain those strengthened relationships, the researchers say.</p>



<p>But pets’ effects on mental health were a little fuzzier. Although the authors expected pets to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/six-ways-beat-chronic-stress">buffer stress</a> and loneliness, people with fluffy companions had similar loneliness levels — and sometimes even higher stress levels — compared with non–pet owners (<em>SN: 2/20/15</em>). The results did suggest though that having a pet buffered the loneliness related to romantic relationships, or lack thereof.</p>



<p>On average, people without pets reported the lowest amounts of stress while cat owners had the highest. Affording veterinary and everyday care, especially during lockdown, may have contributed to pet owners’ stress, the team suggests.</p>



<p>“There are two sides of having a pet,” Weng says. While they provide companionship, pets also add extra responsibilities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rosalind-franklin-dna-structure-watson-crick">What was Rosalind Franklin’s true role in the discovery of DNA’s double helix?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rosalind Franklin’s role in the discovery of the structure of DNA may have been different than previously believed. Franklin wasn’t the victim of data theft at the hands of James Watson and Francis Crick, say biographers of the famous duo. Instead, she collaborated and shared data with Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins.</p>



<p>Seventy years ago, a trio of scientific papers announcing the discovery of DNA’s double helix was published. Watson, Crick and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1962 for the finding. Franklin, a chemist and X-ray crystallographer, died of ovarian cancer before the prize was awarded and was not eligible to be included.</p>





<p>Many people have been outraged by accounts that Watson and Crick used Franklin’s unpublished data without her knowledge or consent in making their model of DNA’s molecular structure. What’s more, Franklin supposedly did not understand the significance of an X-ray diffraction image, taken by her graduate student, that came to be known as Photograph 51. Wilkins showed the image to Watson, who is said to have instantly recognized it as proof that DNA forms a double helix. And the rest is history.</p>



<p>Except that history is wrong, say Watson and Crick biographers Nathaniel Comfort and Matthew Cobb. Cobb is a zoologist at the University of Manchester in England, and Comfort, of Johns Hopkins University, is a historian of science and medicine. They uncovered historical documents among Franklin’s papers that they say should change the view of her contribution to the discovery.</p>



<p>Among the documents was an unpublished article from <em>Time</em> magazine depicting Watson and Crick as a team collaborating with Franklin and Wilkins, who were working as a pair. Overlooked letters and a program from a presentation to the United Kingdom’s Royal Society reinforced the idea that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01313-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franklin was a willing colleague who understood her data</a>. The researchers laid out their findings in a commentary in the April 27 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Cobb and Comfort talked with <em>Science News</em> about their new view of Franklin’s contributions. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Why did you decide to go through these documents?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> Matthew&#8217;s writing this biography of Crick, and I am writing a biography of Watson&#8230;. And we decided as a kind of pilgrimage to go and see the Franklin papers in person….</p>



<p>We weren&#8217;t expecting really anything other than just sort of a perfunctory visit when we sat down in this archive room together, and they pulled out the folders. We started going over them together, bouncing ideas back and forth saying, “Hey, what&#8217;s this?”</p>





<p>The sparks started flying, and that was when we found this magazine article from <em>Time</em> that was never published. It was a very rough draft that the author, named Joan Bruce, had sent to Franklin for fact-checking to make sure she got the science right.</p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> So what Nathaniel immediately picked up on in the Bruce article was the way that she presented the discovery. She presents it as being an equal piece of work — that the two groups, at King’s [College with Franklin and Wilkins] and at the Cavendish [Laboratory with Watson and Crick] in Cambridge, are effectively collaborating….</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not [the story] we&#8217;re used to hearing because the version we have is the dramatic Jim Watson version from his book <em>The Double Helix:</em> “Ha-ha! I stole their data!… Little did they know but I had it in my hands.” This is dramatic reconstruction.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> If it were this way [as in Bruce’s article], it actually gives the lie to Watson&#8217;s sensational account. And we know why — or at least I think I know why — Watson gave that sensational account.</p>



<p>The audience for <em>The Double Helix</em> was intended to be high school and college students who he wanted to get excited about science.… And I have lots of examples from that book where he stretches the truth, where he takes liberties, where he takes literary license. And I can show that as a pattern through the entire book. So it also fits with the style and tone of <em>The Double Helix</em>.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> <strong>Is there other evidence that Watson and Crick didn’t steal her data?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> &nbsp;What we have separately done by looking in real detail at the records — the interviews that Crick did in the ’60s and so on — is we’ve been able to reconstruct the process that [Watson and Crick] went through. Which, if you read their papers really carefully, actually says quite explicitly that they engaged in what they called a process of trial and error. So they knew roughly the size of the crystal of the DNA molecule. They knew the atoms that should be in there from the density. So they tried to fit this stuff into this size using chemical rules.</p>



<p>Then there’s this report [on X-ray diffraction data] that was written by the King’s researchers, Franklin and Wilkins, as part of their funding from the Medical Research Council. It was shared with other laboratories, including the head of the laboratory in Cambridge, Max Perutz [Crick’s boss]. And this is all known, so we haven’t discovered this. Watson and Crick used some of the numbers in there from Franklin and Wilkins as a kind of check on their random walk-through of possible structures….</p>



<p>This still looks like kind of underhand, right? Because they&#8217;ve been given this semi-official document. Then two things happened. Firstly, if you read their documents, it&#8217;s quite clear that they do explain that they had access to this document, and that they used it as a check on their models. So this fact is acknowledged at the time….</p>



<p>We then stumbled upon a letter from a Ph.D. student who was at King’s College, called Pauline Cowan, who was a friend of Crick&#8217;s…. So Cowan writes this letter asking him for help with something completely uninteresting. Then she says in passing, “Franklin and Gosling” — that&#8217;s Franklin&#8217;s Ph.D. student who took Photograph 51 — “are giving a seminar on their data.” This is in January 1953. “You can come along if you want. Here&#8217;s the details. But they say that they&#8217;re not really going to go into much detail. It&#8217;s for the general lab audience, and Perutz knows all the results anyway. So you might not want to bother coming.”</p>



<p>In other words, Franklin knows that Watson and Crick will have access to this informal report, and she doesn’t care. It’s all, “Hey, if you want it, that’s fine.” So that then shifts the optic away from they got this surreptitious access to this MRC report. So we’re back to this collaborative [picture]. Franklin doesn’t seem to be too bothered.</p>



<p>And then the final element … we found a program of a Royal Society exhibition…. This is two months after the publication of the papers. [In the program] is a brief summary of the structure of DNA signed by everybody, presented by Franklin.</p>



<p>It was like a school science fair. She’s standing there in front of a model explaining it to everybody, and all their names are on it. So this isn’t a race that’s been won by Watson and Crick. I mean, they did get there first, don’t get us wrong. But it wasn’t seen that way at the time. They could not have done it without the data from Franklin. And Wilkins. And everybody — at least at this stage in 1953 — is accepting that and seems okay with it.</p>



<p>Just like the Joan Bruce article said. So this changes the mood, right? We’re moving away from the Hollywood thriller that Watson wrote, where he’s sneaked some data. That version is really exciting. It’s just not true. [We’re moving] to something that’s much more collaborative, modern in some respects, about sharing data.</p>



<p>Today, we focus on Franklin because we’re currently interested in equality, women’s oppression, and so on. We’re also obsessed with DNA. But people weren’t back then. DNA wasn’t then what it is now. [People might think] how could Franklin not have been livid? This was the secret of life and she had had it taken away from her. But it wasn’t and she didn’t.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>Did Franklin understand the importance of her data?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> Franklin was very skilled at being able to move DNA between two forms; what’s called the A form, which is the crystalline form which gives really precise images, and what’s called the B form. That form is what you get if there’s much more water around the molecule kind of pulling it into a different shape. And it was very clear from her notes that she thought that the B form was basically the loss of order, that it was disintegrating….</p>

The image, dubbed Photograph 51, is said to have inspired James Watson to realize that DNA is a double helix.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123991">Science History Images / Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you study the double helix story, there’s this this kind of enigma, because there are these two forms, A and B.&nbsp; Franklin studies the A form … [but] it’s never been clear to anybody why she chose that form. And then we realized it’s because she’s a crystallographer. She’s a chemist. And if you’re a chemist, and you’re trying to find the crystalline structure of something, what are you going to look at? The crystal.</p>



<p>It’s easy in retrospect to get in a time machine and go back and whisper in her ear, “Hey, but what’s the inside of the cell like? It’s not very dry, you know. Maybe think about the other form.” But … you can’t do that. That’s against the rules….</p>



<p>Everybody who wants to favor Rosalind Franklin thinks that Watson and Crick were kind of sexist pigs who stole her data. The first bit of that description is probably accurate. The second bit isn’t. They certainly were pretty rude. But they did not steal the data.</p>



<p>This is the popular version of the story which we wanted to undermine. That this Photograph 51, which is the B form, is so striking that Watson, when he’s given a glimpse of it, can instantly realize its significance. According to the story he tells and people who are in favor of Franklin tell, this is the moment he steals her data.</p>



<p>But if you think about it for a minute, you think, “Well, why didn’t Franklin get it if it’s so obvious? This really smart woman who’s much smarter than Watson is about this aspect of science, but she doesn’t get it?” And the answer is very clear when you read her notes. She did get it and she didn’t care. She knew it was some kind of helix, but that was not the structure that interested her.</p>



<p>What [the popular story] does is it removes any agency from Franklin. People are inadvertently presenting her as a negative version, the version that Watson presents. She’s the heroine, but she hasn’t gotten it yet. Why hasn’t she got it? Well, the only implication is what Wilkins says; that she was stubborn and blinkered, which is just not true. So we’re trying to put her back at the center of the story, make her much more human than this harridan that Watson presents her as.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>Do we know if Franklin complained at the time about her data being stolen?</strong></p>



<p>So after the double helix [discovery], Franklin and Wilkins never question Watson and Crick, “How did you do this?” They never fall out with them. They never have a row. They never write anything. Either they were stupid and never asked the question, or they knew [that the data were shared fairly].</p>



<p>Then in [19]54, for example, Franklin’s going to the East Coast to go to this meeting on the West Coast that Watson’s going to as well. And so she writes to Watson, “Dear Jim, I gather you’re getting a car across the states. Can I come with you?” So she tried to hitch a ride on a transcontinental car journey with this man who supposedly had stolen life’s secret from under her nose. That doesn’t make sense.</p>



<p>She was on collegial terms — I don’t think she liked him — but she was on collegial terms with Jim…. They had extensive correspondence because they were in the same area of viral structure.</p>



<p>In the last two or three years of her life, she became very good friends with Crick and with his wife. They went on holiday together in Spain after a conference. After she had her first two operations for ovarian cancer, she went to the Cricks to convalesce. She would send Crick her draft articles and ask his advice. So she clearly didn’t think he was a pig who was going to steal all of that data.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>So they were just much more chill about the whole thing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> They were all much more chill. We look at this, one, through a feminist optic. We being the world. It’s an inverse version of <em>The Double Helix</em>. And, two, through the optic of what would it be like today to discover this? Clearly, you&#8217;d have competing labs, they would not talk to each other, and if one of them had these data, then they would behave exactly like Watson describes it.</p>



<p>But that was not the world of the 1950s. Partly because DNA was not DNA. It wasn&#8217;t clear that it was the genetic material [of life]. So it wasn&#8217;t a big deal.</p>



<p>On Franklin’s tomb there is no mention of DNA. What there is mention of is viruses. &nbsp;Because that&#8217;s the practical work that she was engaged in when she died. She had worked out the structure of the polio virus. DNA wasn&#8217;t a practical thing for another 20 years. Whereas the structure the polio virus, maybe that could save lives.</p>



<p>The way we see her is not how she was seen at the time. She was very famous. She got a page obituary in <em>Nature</em>, obituaries in Britain’s the <em>Times</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. So many of her American colleagues were utterly distraught when they discovered that she died [in 1958]. So you know, she was a very significant person, not just for DNA.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> Dr. Watson is still living. Have you spoken with him or anyone else who’s still around that could offer some insight?</p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> I&#8217;ve spoken with him many times, and he knows about this project. But he&#8217;s not in any [physical] shape right now to be able to comment on something like this. Believe me, I would love to, but it&#8217;s just not possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/native-language-shape-musical-ability">Native language might shape musical ability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Your mother tongue may modify your musical ability.</p>



<p>Speaking a native language that requires tones appears to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.03.067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost perception of melody, but at the cost of rhythm</a>, researchers report April 26 in <em>Current Biology</em>. The massive global study hints at how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-wires-native-language-neurons">language skills seep into other areas of cognition</a> (<em>SN: 3/29/23</em>).</p>



<p>Tonal languages use pitch to distinguish words that otherwise might sound the same. In Mandarin, for instance, mă means horse whereas mā means mother. Nontonal languages like Spanish sometimes include pitch changes to suggest emotion, for example, but not to change a word’s meaning.</p>





<p>As a Mandarin speaker and flutist, Jingxuan Liu wondered about the crossover between language and music. While studying psychology as an undergraduate at Duke University, Liu helped analyze the musical abilities of nearly half a million people from 203 countries. Her colleagues had launched an online game in which participants completed several musical tasks, including identifying matching melodies at different pitches and finding beat tracks that fit songs’ rhythms.</p>



<p>On average, native speakers of the 19 represented tonal languages were better at the melody task compared with speakers of 29 nontonal languages. And the effect wasn’t small — a tonal first language enhanced melodic perception by about half the amount that music lessons did, which was also surveyed. But tonal language speakers tended to be worse at the rhythm task.</p>



<p>Humans must be choosy about what they pay attention to. Pitch patterns are vital in tonal languages, which might explain the musical trade-off. “You’ve got a finite resource of attention, and you’ve got to allocate that somehow,” says study coauthor Courtney Hilton, a cognitive scientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Prior research on language and music often compared just two tongues, usually English and Cantonese or Mandarin. But other cultural influences, such as Eastern and Western music styles, could have affected results. By examining a wide range of people, the new study included languages never assessed in this way and reached more generalizable conclusions.</p>



<p>“Our result here is showing that the language someone speaks — which is an important part of culture — also shapes cognition,” Hilton says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permafrost-thawing-pollution-arctic-climate-change">Thawing permafrost may unleash industrial pollution across the Arctic</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the Arctic’s icebound ground warms, it may unleash toxic substances across the region.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, the thaw threatens to destabilize facilities at more than 2,000 industrial sites, such as mines and pipelines, and further compromise <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37276-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 5,000 already contaminated areas</a>, researchers report March 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>Those numbers come from the first comprehensive study to pinpoint where Arctic permafrost thaw could release industrial pollutants. But there are probably even more contaminated areas that we don’t know about, says permafrost researcher Moritz Langer of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, Germany. “We only see the tip of the iceberg.”</p>





<p>Toxic substances released from these locations could jeopardize fish and other animals living in Arctic waterways, as well as the health of people who depend on them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-permafrost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Permafrost</a> is any soil, sediment or rock that remains frozen for at least two years. Step on the ground in the Arctic and chances are that permafrost lies underfoot. For decades, people have treated the frozen earth as staunch and largely immobile. Industries constructed infrastructure atop its firmness, and within it they buried their refuse and sludge. In some places, scientists and others have used permafrost to store radioactive waste.</p>



<p>But the Arctic is warming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">nearly four times as fast</a> as the rest of the planet as a result of climate change, and as much as 65 percent of the region’s permafrost may disappear by 2100 (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>That could release some worrisome things, says climate scientist Kimberley Miner of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the study. In 2021, Miner and her colleagues warned that the thawing of Arctic permafrost <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01162-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could release</a> antibiotic-resistant bacteria, viruses and radioactive waste from nuclear-testing programs into the environment.</p>



<p>Keen to identify where the warming could spread industrial pollutants, Langer and his colleagues first analyzed the range of Arctic permafrost and whereabouts of industrial infrastructure. They identified about 4,500 sites — including oil fields, mines and abandoned military installations — in places where permafrost probably exists. Next, the team used contamination data from Alaska and Canada — regions with accessible records — and found that as of January 2021, about 3,600 contaminated locations occupy the two regions. These include waste areas and places where pollutants were accidentally released.</p>



<p>Realistically, these numbers are probably deflated, Langer says, because many incidents of contamination have probably gone undocumented.</p>





<p>Focusing on Alaska, the researchers found that diesel, gasoline and related petrochemicals make up about half of the pollutants reported. Lead, arsenic and mercury — substances toxic to fish, people and other organisms — were reported too. But in many cases, the type of pollutant was not documented. “That’s a big problem,” Langer says, in part because it makes understanding the risks of a particular leak or spill much harder.</p>



<p>Using the locations of industrial sites and North American contamination data, Langer and colleagues extrapolated where industrial contamination and permafrost might coexist across the entirety of the Arctic, finding 13,000 to 20,000 such sites may exist today. Then, they used computer simulations to investigate the impact of current and future levels of climate change.</p>



<p>Today, there may already be a risk of permafrost degrading at about 1,000 of the known industrial sites and 2,200 to 4,800 of the known and estimated contaminated locations, they found.</p>



<p>In a low-emissions scenario in which warming rises by up to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, those numbers increase to more than 2,100 industrial sites and 5,600 to 10,000 contaminated areas. An increase of about 4.3 degrees C would probably affect almost all the known and projected locations.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re going to need to think about keeping [pollutants] where they need to be,” Miner says, “not just leaving them on the landscape where we feel like.”</p>



<p>The new findings are probably conservative, Langer says, partly because the analysis didn’t consider that infrastructure itself can warm the ground. What’s more, even if it doesn’t fully thaw, “warming of the permafrost causes quite a bit of problem,” says civil engineer Guy Doré of Université Laval in Quebec City, who wasn’t involved in the study. Permafrost that warms from –5° C to –2° C can lose half of its load-bearing capacity, he says, destabilizing infrastructure.</p>



<p>Today, no international regulations mandate industries in the Arctic to document the substances they use and store, or what happens to them. Without that information, Langer says, it’ll be difficult to assess and manage the growing risk of contamination.</p>



<p>He plans to visit decades-old oil drilling facilities in Canada to study how the changing permafrost has affected the containment of drilling fluids. “That&#8217;s the next step,” he says, “to understand better how [industrial contaminants] spread into the landscape.”</p>

<p>Last week, we brought you the story of a professor who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">found her name</a> on an article she didn’t write, which also seemed to have been plagiarized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since our story was published, we’ve learned a little more about the journal that published the article, the <em>African Journal of Political Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.buse.ac.zw/faculties/science/geography-department/prof-jephias-mapuva/">Jephias Mapuva</a>, a professor at the Bindura University of Science Education in Zimbabwe, who is listed as the <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/editorial-board.html">editor in chief of the journal</a>, told us in an email that he is “not associated with the journal in any way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It came to me as a surprise that I am listed as an Editor-In-Chief,” he wrote. He also copied an email address for the journal publisher, International Scholars Journal, and asked for his name to be removed from the website:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126985"></span>

<p>The journal’s <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/editorial-board.html">editorial board</a> also includes a couple of engineering professors and a “Commercial Manager of Multifarious Projects Group” in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As commenters on our original story pointed out, another <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps"><em>African Journal of Political Science</em></a> exists with the same ISSN listed on the International Scholars Journals website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its information page states the publication is an open-access journal that does not charge article processing fees, and is an outlet of the African Association of Political Science. The journal seems to have <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps/issue/archive">restarted publishing last year</a>, after halting in 2004. The International Scholars Journals publication has <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/archive.html">put out issues</a> continuously since 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uj.ac.za/members/siphamandla-zondi/">Siphamandla Zondi</a>, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, who is listed as <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps/about/editorialTeam">editor in chief</a> of the <em>African Journal of Political Science</em> not affiliated with International Scholars Journals, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>International Scholars Journals is included on Jeffrey Beall’s list of “potentially predatory journals and publishers,” other commenters noted. Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado, Denver, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/">took down the list</a> in 2017, but <a href="https://beallslist.net/">archived versions</a> remain online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenter <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/#comment-2160242">Chung-Chuan Lo</a> shared a link to an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/scam-journal-pretending-real-thing-nadine-bekkouche/">account</a> of another academic’s encounter with the alleged <em>African Journal of Political Science</em>. She described what happened after submitting a commentary, at the journal’s invitation:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Then the hustle for money started. The price was initially over 1000 euros. Obscene. Then they called me (!), they kept emailing, they would not hear my (several) requests to withdraw the article, and they are still emailing. This is frankly abusive. Oh, and they tried to charge a withdrawal fee, before deciding to keep the article. This sort of harassement qualifies the operation as fraudulent and engaging in spearphishing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As for why the journal published an article attributed to someone who didn’t write it, several commenters speculated that the publisher was attempting to fill issues with copy and apply a veneer of respectability with the name of a legitimate academic. We’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/29/meet-the-publisher-making-the-science-of-bronte-faulkner-and-whitman-available-for-the-first-time/">previously reported</a> on similar attempts using the names of famous authors including Walt Whitman and Charlotte Brontë.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sapphire-schrodingers-cat-quantum">A sapphire Schrödinger’s cat shows that quantum effects can scale up</a></h4>

              
                <p>In keeping with the grand tradition of tubby cats, a newly created quantum “cat” is particularly massive — at least for the quantum realm.</p>



<p>Scientists put a jiggling piece of sapphire crystal in what’s known as a “cat state,” in which an object exists in two different states simultaneously. It’s a situation reminiscent of physicists’ favorite imaginary feline, Schrödinger’s cat, known for being alive and dead at the same time.</p>



<p>The new sapphire cat <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf7553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a relatively hefty 16 micrograms</a>, physicists report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>. That’s close to half the mass of an eyelash, and more than 100 trillion times the mass of cat states previously created with molecules. “We’ve reached a new regime where quantum mechanics apparently does work,” says physicist Yiwen Chu of ETH Zurich.</p>





<p>In a quantum parable dreamt up in the 1930s by physicist Erwin Schrödinger, a cat is trapped in a box and, due to quantum effects, winds up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/schrödingers-cat-now-dead-and-alive-two-boxes-once">alive and dead at the same time</a> (<em>SN: 5/26/16</em>). This paradoxical scenario doesn’t happen in the real world. While quantum particles are capable of existing in two distinct states simultaneously — what’s called a superposition — those effects wash out for cat-sized stuff.</p>



<p>Quantum effects are typically confined to atoms, molecules and the like. The everyday world visible to human eyes doesn’t exhibit quantum properties. Scientists can coax certain tiny objects to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spooky-quantum-entanglement-goes-big-new-experiments">display quantum features</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/18</em>). But scientists don’t fully understand the border between the quantum and nonquantum realms.</p>



<p>“We really have only just begun to understand that intermediate regime,” says Benjamin Sussman of the University of Ottawa, who was not involved with the new study. “It’s of really profound interest to see how these quantum systems scale and how they behave.”</p>



<p>Cat states are a special variety of quantum behavior that come close to re-creating Schrödinger’s idea. They are superpositions of two states that are distinct according to the classical physics that describes the everyday world— like an alive or dead cat — rather than two states that exist only in the quantum domain, such as the energy levels of an atom.</p>



<p>In the new experiment, the researchers jiggled a portion of a sapphire crystal in such a way that its atoms moved in two directions at once. That’s a distinction that “captures the spirit” of Schrödinger’s cat, Chu says.</p>



<p>The jiggling was confined within a sliver of the crystal consisting of 100 million billion atoms. That’s large enough that, if extracted from the rest of the crystal, it would be visible to the naked eye, Chu says.</p>





<p>Still, the oscillations of the atoms were tiny, about a millionth of a billionth of a millimeter — not exactly the scale of everyday objects. Other demonstrations of cat states have demonstrated much larger spatial separation, despite being made up of fewer atoms.</p>



<p>In future work, Sussman says he’d like to see the researchers scale up not only the mass, but also the size of the oscillations. “That’s going to be really hard but will be really interesting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-trees-drought-survival-secrets">Ultrasound reveals trees’ drought-survival secrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>The tissues of living trees may hold the secrets of why some can recover after drought and others die. But those tissues are challenging to assess in mature forests. After all, 90-year-old trees can’t travel to the lab to get an imaging scan. So most studies of the impacts of drought on plants are done in the lab and on younger trees — or by gouging cores out of mature trees.</p>



<p>Barbara Beikircher, an ecophysiologist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, and colleagues came up with a different approach: They brought the lab to the trees.</p>



<p>In the Kranzberg Forest outside Munich, the team outfitted stands of mature spruce and beech trees with rugged, waterproof ultrasound sensors. Some of the stands had been covered by roofs to block the summer rain, creating artificial drought conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="500" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1.jpg" alt="A photo of several trees with ultrasound equipment strapped to the trunks and short green fences surrounding the trees." class="wp-image-3123551" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-521x383.jpg 521w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-612x450.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-253x186.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123551">Researchers outfitted stands of mature spruce and beech trees with ultrasound sensors and electrical probes to figure how the species cope with long dry spells.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123551">University of Innsbruck</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Five years of monitoring revealed that beeches (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>) are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/plb.13444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more drought-resilient than spruces</a> (<em>Picea abies</em>), the team reported in the December <em>Plant Biology</em>. Delving into the underlying mechanisms explained this difference.</p>



<p>Drought-stressed trees produced more ultrasound signals than trees exposed to summer rains. Those faint acoustic waves were bouncing off air bubbles called embolisms deep within the trees’ vasculature. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-sap-water-power-energy-world">Surface tension keeps water moving</a> through a tree’s thousands of tiny vessels — evaporation from pores in leaves drives water up the trunk (<em>SN: 9/6/22</em>). But if there’s insufficient water in the soil, this upward pull can generate embolisms that clog vessels. In the experiments, spruces pinged much more than beeches, suggesting they had far more embolisms.</p>





<p>That’s despite the fact that beeches appear to be less conservative with their water management, at least aboveground. Trees can prevent embolisms by closing the pores on their leaves, but there’s a trade-off. Doing so cuts off the supply of the carbon dioxide that drives photosynthesis, which makes the carbohydrates and sugars that trees need to live and grow. In dry conditions, trees face an impossible choice “between starving and dying of thirst,” Beikircher says.</p>



<p>Beeches suffered fewer embolisms than the spruce, even though they kept their pores open longer than the conifers did. Perhaps that’s because beeches have roots that extend into deeper, wetter soil as well as more robust water reserves, Beikircher says. Another set of experiments after the researchers relieved the drought suggests that’s the case.</p>



<p>At the end of the experiment, the team drenched the soil. All the trees recovered well by most measures: Rates of photosynthesis in the previously parched trees caught up to the rates of trees in the control groups and embolisms filled with water.</p>



<p>But when Beikircher measured the trees’ resistance to an electrical current, an indication of moisture levels deep within trunks, the spruces’ water reserves were still depleted. One season of rain was not enough to help these trees fully recover. It’s unclear whether spruces can replenish their reserves after prolonged drought or how long that might take.</p>





<p>Species that can withstand drought conditions and recover more quickly may become more populous in future forests as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate change causes droughts to become more frequent</a> and intense (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). That means the compositions of the trees that make up the world’s temperate forests could change as the climate warms, with uncertain consequences for the other plants and animals in these ecosystems.</p>



<p>Beikircher plans to test whether a more diverse forest could help drought-sensitive species like the spruce survive. Deep-rooted beeches interspersed with spruces might help increase moisture in the soil’s upper levels by wicking water up to where spruce roots are, she says.</p>

<p><em>We are pleased to present an excerpt from <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/distrust-9780192868459?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Distrust: Big Data, Data-Torturing, and the Assault on Science</a>, a new book by Pomona College economics professor <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/gary-n-smith">Gary Smith</a>. The Washington Post said the book&#8217;s lessons &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/03/23/smith-distrust-review-data-disinformation/">are very much needed</a></em>.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The fact that changes in bitcoin prices are driven by fear, greed, and manipulation has not stopped people from trying to crack their secret. Empirical models of bitcoin prices are a wonderful example of data torturing because bitcoins have no intrinsic value and, so, cannot be explained credibly by economic data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Undaunted by this reality, a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24877">National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) paper</a> reported the mind-boggling efforts made by Yale University economics professor <a href="https://economics.yale.edu/people/aleh-tsyvinski">Aleh Tsyvinski</a> and a graduate student, Yukun Liu, to find empirical patterns in bitcoin prices.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126972"></span>



<p>Tsyvinski currently holds an endowed chair named after Arthur M. Okun, who had been a professor at Yale from 1961 to 1969, though he spent six of those eight years on leave so that he could work in Washington on the Council of Economic Advisors as a staff economist, council member, and then chair, advising presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on their economic policies. He is most well known for Okun’s law, which states that a 1 percentage-point reduction in unemployment will increase U.S. output by roughly 2 percent, an argument that helped persuade President Kennedy that using tax cuts to reduce unemployment from 7 to 4 percent would have an enormous economic payoff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Okun’s death, an anonymous donor endowed a lecture series at Yale named after Okun, explaining that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Arthur Okun combined his special gifts as an analytical and theoretical economist with his great concern for the well-being of his fellow citizens into a thoughtful, pragmatic, and sustaining contribution to his nation’s public policy.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The contrast between Okun’s focus on meaningful economic policies and Tsyvinski’s far-fetched bitcoin calculations is striking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liu and Tsyvinski report correlations between the number of weekly Google searches for the word bitcoin (compared to the average over the past four weeks) and the percentage changes in bitcoin prices one to seven weeks later. They also looked at the correlation between the weekly ratio of bitcoin hack searches to bitcoin searches and the percentage changes in bitcoin prices one to seven weeks later. The fact that they reported bitcoin search results looking back four weeks and forward seven weeks should alert us to the possibility that they tried other backward-and-forward combinations that did not work as well. Ditto with the fact that they did not look back four weeks with bitcoin hack searches. They evidently tortured the data in their quest for correlations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, only seven of their fourteen correlations seemed promising for predicting bitcoin prices. Owen Rosebeck and I looked at the predictions made by these correlations during the year following their study and found that they were useless. They might as well have flipped coins to predict bitcoin prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liu and Tsyvinski also calculated the correlations between the number of weekly Twitter bitcoin posts and bitcoin returns one to seven weeks later. Unlike the Google trends data, they did not report results for bitcoin hack posts. Three of the seven correlations seemed useful, though two were positive and one was negative. With fresh data, none were useful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only thing that their data abuse yielded was coincidental statistical correlations. Even though the research was done by an eminent Yale professor and published by the prestigious NBER, the idea that bitcoin prices can be predicted reliably from Google searches and Twitter posts was a fantasy fueled by data torturing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The irony here is that scientists created statistical tools that were intended to ensure the credibility of scientific research but have had the perverse effect of encouraging researchers to torture data—which makes their research untrustworthy and undermines the credibility of all scientific research.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Traditionally, empirical research begins by specifying a theory and then collecting appropriate data for testing the theory. Many now take the shortcut of looking for patterns in data unencumbered by theory. This is called data mining in that researchers rummage through data, not knowing what they will find.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Way back in 2009, Marc Prensky, a writer and speaker with degrees from Yale and Harvard Business School, claimed that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In many cases, scientists no longer have to make educated guesses, construct hypotheses and models, and test them with data-based experiments and examples. Instead, they can mine the complete set of data for patterns that reveal effects, producing scientific conclusions without further experimentation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We are hard-wired to seek patterns but the data deluge makes the vast majority of patterns waiting to be discovered illusory and useless. Bitcoin is again a good example. Since there is no logical theory (other than greed and market manipulation) that explains fluctuations in bitcoin prices, it is tempting to look for correlations between bitcoin prices and other variables without thinking too hard about whether the correlations make sense. In addition to torturing data, Liu and Tsyvinski mined their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They calculated correlations between bitcoin prices and 810 other variables, including such whimsical items as the Canadian dollar–U.S. dollar exchange rate, the price of crude oil, and stock returns in the automobile, book, and beer industries. You might think I am making this up. Sadly, I am not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They reported finding that bitcoin returns were positively correlated with stock returns in the consumer goods and health care industries and negatively correlated with stock returns in the fabricated products and metal mining industries. These correlations don’t make any sense and Liu and Tsyvinski admitted that they had no idea why these data were correlated: “We don’t give explanations . . . . We just document this behavior.” A skeptic might ask: What is the point of documenting coincidental correlations?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that is all they found. The Achilles heel of data mining is that large data sets inevitably contain an enormous number of coincidental correlations that are just fool’s gold in that they are no more useful than correlations among random numbers. Most fortuitous correlations do not hold up with fresh data, though some, coincidentally, will for a while. One statistical relationship that continued to hold during the period they studied and the year afterward was a negative correlation between bitcoin returns and stock returns in the paperboard-containers-and-boxes industry. This is surely serendipitous—and pointless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have assembled enormous databases and created powerful computers and algorithms for analyzing data. The irony is that these resources make it very easy to use data mining to discover chance patterns that are fleeting. Results are reported and then discredited, and we become increasingly skeptical of scientists.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seismic-waves-mars-core">Seismic waves crossing Mars’ core reveal details of the Red Planet’s heart</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mars’ heart is about the size of our moon, and almost twice as dense. Or so suggest the first observed rumblings from a Marsquake and meteorite impact to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217090120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross the Red Planet’s heart</a>, researchers report April 24 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The penetrative reverberations allowed researchers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">refine estimates of the core’s size, density and composition</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Nobody&#8217;s ever seen before a seismic wave going through [Mars’] core,” says seismologist Jessica Irving from the University of Bristol in England. “We waited for more than 900 days for one quake on the farside,” she says. Then “24 days later, there was … a meteorite impact.”</p>

<p>Both were captured by NASA’s InSight lander, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-dart-artemis-space-news-2022">monitored seismic activity on Mars</a> for four years, up until December 2022 (<em>SN: 12/20/22</em>). Over its 1,480-day career, the lander captured the quivers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-volcanic-activity-planet-nasa-insight">over 1,000 Marsquakes</a> and a handful of impacts (<em>SN: 11/3/22</em>). But in all that time, it detected just two rumblings on the planet’s farside.</p>



<p>Analyzing the core-crossing seismicity from the two events, Irving and her colleagues found that Mars’ heart has a radius of 1,780 to 1,810 kilometers with a density of about 6,200 kilograms per cubic meter. That radius is slightly smaller than previously estimated, and about half that of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">combined layers of Earth’s heart</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/23</em>). The cores of both planets comprise about half of their total thickness.</p>



<p>Moreover, the researchers inferred that Mars’ core is mostly made of a liquid iron alloy, with sulfur making up about 15 percent of its mass. A smattering of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon together comprise about 5 percent. The findings roughly align with some previous analyses of Martian meteorite compositions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rocky-planets-early-universe-james-webb-telescope">Rocky planets might have been able to form in the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rocky planets might have been forming since the beginning of the universe. A stellar nursery in a neighboring galaxy <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01945-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the right materials for such planet formation</a>, researchers report April 24 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The overall chemical makeup of the tiny galaxy, called the Small Magellanic Cloud, is akin to that of the early universe. The finding suggests that rocky planets might have been able to develop in the relatively pristine chemical environment that pervaded the cosmos just a couple billion years after the Big Bang.</p>





<p>The Small Magellanic Cloud is one of the Milky Way’s nearest galactic neighbors, though it’s very different from our galaxy. The tiny galaxy has a much lower abundance of heavy metal elements — such as iron, magnesium and aluminum — which are all crucial to the formation of rocky planets. This low-metal environment also mimics that of the early universe, an epoch before stars had enough time to forge the heavy elements and blow them out into space.</p>



<p>Because of the lack of these elements, astronomers have been unsure if rocky planets are able to form in the Small Magellanic Cloud. And previous telescopes did not have the ability to really probe young stars with a mass less than or equal to that of the sun, so astronomers couldn’t measure the star systems’ dust content, which is needed to infer if planets could be being born. But with the sensitivity of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, or JWST, astronomers can now gather more light and see smaller, fainter stars in greater detail (<em>SN: 12/7/22</em>).</p>



<p>Astrophysicist Olivia Jones and colleagues used an infrared camera on JWST to look at a region of the Small Magellanic Cloud called NGC 346, where young stars are forming. “It’s the first time ever we’ve really been able to look at how solar-size stars form in an environment akin to the early universe,” says Jones, of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.</p>



<p>The team detected signatures that suggest that lots of dust is orbiting and falling toward hundreds of stars in the region. As these dust grains orbit, they could begin to stick together and eventually accrete to create rocky planets. </p>



<p>“One of the things we would love to understand better is how the environmental context impacts star formation and then, later on, the planet-forming populations around those young, forming stars,” says Michael Meyer, an astronomer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Because the Small Magellanic Cloud is the nearest example of a cosmic region with a much different chemical composition than the Milky Way, he says, it provides the first touchstone to study how star and planet formation depend on the stellar environment.</p>



<p>The low-metal stellar environment in the Small Magellanic Cloud is comparable to that of faraway galaxies that were developing around 11 billion years ago. During this time, a period called “cosmic noon,” there was a surge of star formation throughout the cosmos. If rocky planets could be accreting around stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, the researchers suggest, such worlds could have been forming in the early years of the universe as well.</p>





<p>The young stars in NGC 346 are also relative lightweights. One reason scientists are interested in studying the possibility of planet formation around low-mass stars is because they are the most common type of stars in the universe and the longest-lived, says Penn State astronomer Kevin Luhman, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>“They offer the longest period of time in which life might form and survive on any planets around them,” Luhman says. “If the most common star in the universe lived for only a million years, then exploded, that would be kind of bad for life.” The fact that these types of stars can potentially form rocky planets, he says, is a good sign for life developing elsewhere in the universe.</p>



<p>Follow-up research will focus on determining what chemical signatures can be found developing around the stars, Jones says. This could clue the researchers in to what the chemical elements are that make up any rocky planets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vegan-leather-fungi-repair-mycelium">A vegan leather made of dormant fungi can repair itself</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine if a ripped leather jacket could repair itself instead of needing to be replaced.</p>



<p>This could one day be a reality, if the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202301875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jacket is fashioned from fungus</a>, researchers report April 11 in <em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>. The team made a self-healing leather from mushrooms’ threadlike structures called mycelium, building on past iterations of the material to allow it to fix itself.</p>



<p>Mycelium leather is already an emerging product, but it’s produced in a way that extinguishes fungal growth. Elise Elsacker and colleagues speculated that if the production conditions were tweaked, the mycelium could retain its ability to regrow if damaged.</p>





<p>That novel approach could offer inspiration to other researchers trying to get into the mycelium leather market, says Valeria La Saponara, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>Elsacker, a bioengineer now at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and her colleagues first grew mycelium in a soup rich in proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients. A skin formed on the surface of the liquid, which the scientists scooped off, cleaned and dried to make a thin, somewhat fragile leather material. They used temperatures and chemicals mild enough to form the leather but leave parts of the fungus functional. Left dormant were chlamydospores, little nodules on the mycelium that can spring back to life and grow more mycelium when conditions are prime.</p>



<p>After punching holes in the leather, the researchers doused the area in the same broth used to grow it to revive the chlamydospores. The mycelium eventually regrew over the punctures. Once healed, the hole-punched areas were just as strong as undamaged areas — however, the repairs were visible from one side of the leather.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="139" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline.jpg" alt="Three photos side by side of squares of light-colored leather being held by a hand from the top right corner." class="wp-image-3123876" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline-330x67.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123876">Chlamydospores are little nodules on fungi’s threadlike mycelium that can spring back to life.

Elsacker <em>et al</em>/<em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>, 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The technique could potentially go beyond a proof-of-concept and into commercialization in the next decade, says study coauthor Martyn Dade-Robertson, codirector of the Hub for Biotechnology in the Built Environment in Newcastle upon Tyne. But first, the team will need to make the leather stronger and determine how to control the chlamydospores’ growth. Otherwise, he says, someone could “walk out in the rain, and then all of a sudden find that [their] jacket is growing, or perhaps [has] mushrooms popping out of it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last August, a U.S. federal research misconduct watchdog <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/05/ucla-veteran-researcher-faked-data-in-11-grant-applications-per-feds/">announced findings</a> that a longtime researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles named Janina Jiang faked data in 11 grant applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than a month later, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/23/ucla-walks-back-claim-that-application-for-50-million-grant-included-fake-data/">issued a rare correction</a> to its announcement, saying “additional information” from UCLA indicated that one of the grants “did not fund or contain falsified/fabricated data.” The watchdog agency said it would remove the application in question from its findings of research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The grant, UL1 TR000124, helped fund the UCLA <a href="https://ctsi.ucla.edu/">Clinical and Translational Science Institute</a> (CTSI) with $57 million from 2012-2015. The listed principal investigator, <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/discover-ucla-health/about/leadership/steven-m-dubinett">Steven M. Dubinett</a>, is the interim dean for UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of the correction, we wondered how a report that would have had to be reviewed by multiple officials – and lawyers – at both institutions could include such a mistake, and filed public records requests to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126959"></span>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/07/ucla-found-a-longtime-researcher-faked-data-but-made-a-strange-mistake-in-its-report/">reported last November</a>, through a public records request, we obtained UCLA’s report on its research misconduct investigation of Jiang, as well as two letters from university officials asking ORI to amend the Federal Register notice about its findings to remove the CTSI grant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erroneous information” about the source of funding for Jiang’s research had been given to the inquiry and investigation committees and made it into the report sent to ORI, the second letter stated. But how the mistake happened, or why UCLA didn’t discover it until after ORI announced the findings, remained unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a separate federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, we have <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-01230-Final-Doc.pdf">obtained email correspondence</a> between ORI and Jiang, ORI and UCLA officials, and internal discussions among ORI staffers about the request to correct the Federal Register notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But now we have even more questions. The emails we received were heavily redacted for “<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-01230-Final-Response-Letter.pdf">unwarranted invasions of personal privacy</a>” and the “<a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/2-522-0897?__lrTS=20201013140117301&amp;transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true">deliberative process privilege</a>,” which allows the government to withhold information on how agency staff members make decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve pieced together the following timeline from the emails. It’s a lot of detail, but we think it offers a glimpse into how the investigation sausage is made:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Aug. 27, 2021: ORI informed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Extramural Research about UCLA’s findings of research misconduct by Jiang in 11 grant applications, including the CTSI grant. (pp. 198-9)</li>



<li>April-May 2022: ORI staff drafted and revised a Voluntary Settlement Agreement (VSA) and other documents related to Jiang’s case. (p. 196)</li>



<li>June 8: A staffer sent Alexander Runko, director of ORI’s Division of Investigative Oversight, a revised memo and VSA. “I have added the UL1 grant back in the documents and [redacted],” he or she wrote. Unstated is why that grant, which UCLA later asked to remove from the findings, had apparently been taken out of the documents before being added back to the file. (p. 192)</li>



<li>June 16: After additional edits and discussion among ORI staff, the agency sent Jiang a letter with the VSA. (p. 186)</li>



<li>June 30: Runko sent Jiang an email following up on a meeting, with a revised VSA and “statements from ORI that you can share with your supervisor” that were redacted. (p. 181)</li>



<li>July 15 and 18: Jiang and Runko exchanged a flurry of emails about the VSA and the supervision plan for Jiang’s research. Runko revised the VSA twice in response to Jiang’s requests. All specifics are redacted. (pp. 151-163)</li>



<li>July 19: Jiang signed the VSA. (p. 151)</li>



<li>July 22: Wanda K. Jones, acting ORI director, approved the VSA, and Elisabeth Handley, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, signed it. (pp. 133-140)</li>



<li>Aug. 2: An NIH staffer asked Runko which submission of the CTSI grant contained the fabricated figure 6 mentioned in the report: “I don’t see an [redacted] after the grant number.” The reply from ORI was almost completely redacted, but the NIH apparently found it “very helpful.” (pp. 200-1)</li>



<li>Aug. 5: ORI’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/05/ucla-veteran-researcher-faked-data-in-11-grant-applications-per-feds/">findings of research misconduct</a> by Jiang were published in the Federal Register.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Aug. 11: An ORI staffer sent a note to Runko about a conversation he or she had with a UCLA official about the Jiang announcement and CTSI grant, and UCLA’s desire for a correction to the Federal Register notice. “UCLA may want to issue a clarification or statement on how the grant (UL1 TR000124) was involved,” the staff member wrote. The staffer said he or she had checked the report and found “it clearly states the UCLA CTSI Grant #UL1 TR000124.” “They did provide a clarification, when I was not able to find the figure in grant [sic],” the staff member wrote, but whatever UCLA said was redacted from the email.</li>



<li>“I don’t see a reason to change anything unless they provide some additional justification,” Runko wrote in a reply the same day.  The staff member replied with a clarification that was mostly redacted. This much was intact: “The issue she is raising is that the questioned figure was not in UL1 grant application submitted to NIH.” (pp. 213-214)</li>



<li>Aug. 16: Roger M. Wakimoto, UCLA’s vice chancellor for research and creative activities, sent a letter to ORI asking the agency to correct the Federal Register notice, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/07/ucla-found-a-longtime-researcher-faked-data-but-made-a-strange-mistake-in-its-report/">we previously reported</a>. Wakimoto wrote that the allegation of fake data regarding the CTSI grant involved a proposal submitted not to the NIH, but to “an intramural granting program supported by funds from the CTSI award.” An ORI staffer sent an email to Runko responding to the letter, but the contents were entirely redacted. (p. 206)</li>



<li>Sept. 9: Wakimoto sent a second letter to ORI, this time saying that UCLA had looked at its records again and found that the CTSI grant had not funded Jiang’s research at all. He again asked ORI to issue a correction to the Federal Register notice. </li>



<li>The following week, ORI said it would issue a correction and staffers drafted and edited the notice, which was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/23/ucla-walks-back-claim-that-application-for-50-million-grant-included-fake-data/">published</a> on September 16. (pp. 220-7)</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/graphene-tattoo-heart-beat-pacemaker">A graphene “tattoo” could help hearts keep their beat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some tattoos truly make the heart go pitter-patter.</p>



<p>In rats, a graphene “tattoo” stuck to the heart could treat an abnormally sluggish beat. Like a futuristic pacemaker, the device <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202212190" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered electrical signals that kept the heart pumping properly</a>, scientists report online March 25 in <em>Advanced Materials</em>.</p>



<p>The electronic device is currently a proof of concept, but a version for use in human hearts could be ready for testing within five years, estimates Igor Efimov, a cardiovascular engineer at Northwestern University in Chicago.</p>





<p>Efimov and his colleagues have worked for years creating implantable devices that conform to the body. A main challenge is how to marry rigid electronics with soft, sometimes throbbing tissues. For most current pacemakers, doctors thread electrodes on long wires through a vein inside the heart. Every time the heart beats, some 100,000 times per day, the wires flex. Enough flexing, and the device eventually breaks, Efimov says. One solution is to use ultrathin materials that ride along with the heart’s movements, like plastic wrap clinging to quivering Jell-O.</p>



<p>In 2021, Efimov saw something that looked promising: a paper on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-00489-8.epdf?sharing_token=nwTP0SrhHXmUfkGcbRj9RdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OMiVvBkaLPGy4yVDu7PE_NOnMmd1OVU3W4IEZLpNRflOILz7IvTycNmeOtTcuBrTcqjvU9OtCQZj2zXEzCWjjStVULnhvf6DO6KuMw_pWVIsuPeHo7wSj4g5hbiMSegCA%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graphene devices applied to the skin like temporary tattoos</a>. Unlike the metal components often used in electronics, graphene is “atomically thin,” says Dmitry Kireev, a biomedical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin who developed the graphene tattoos.</p>

<p>Graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern — is an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worlds-thinnest-material-stretches-bends-twists">appealing material for biomedical use</a>, says Nai-Chang Yeh, a Caltech physicist who was not involved in the work (<em>SN: 3/14/14</em>). “Graphene is very flexible, it’s biocompatible, it’s highly transparent, it’s highly conductive and it’s mechanically strong,” she says.</p>



<p>But Kireev had never placed graphene tattoos on heart tissue before. Efimov contacted him and said, “Well, would you like to try? We can help.” The researchers teamed up and tested the devices in experiments on mouse hearts and inside living rats. In the rats, the heart tattoo could correct an irregular beat by sending pulses of electricity to the organ, the team reports.</p>



<p>The tattoos sandwich a transparent layer of graphene between sheets of stretchy silicone and ultrathin polymer. Gold tape connects the graphene to wires that run to a power source, which sends electricity through the device.</p>





<p>Future versions of the tattoo will be wireless, Efimov says, perhaps using a tiny antenna to pick up electrical signals from an external device placed on a person’s chest. And one day, Efimov envisions graphene electrodes the size of rice grains injected into heart muscle. Such miniature equipment could perform pacemaker duties without the typical clunky components.</p>



<p>That all might sound like science fiction, but the technology is almost here, Efimov says. “Now’s the time to develop it.”</p>

                <h2>PLOS Joins UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, PLOS joined over 290 other publishers in signing the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sdg-publishers-compact/">UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact,</a> an agreement to inspire action among publishers in advancing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by actively seeking and promoting scientific content related to the goals, as well as committing to sustainable actions across our business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SDG Compact provides a framework for publishers to work towards a more sustainable future by seeking and promoting content that advances the SDGs, as well as taking steps to enhance sustainable business practices. This includes a range of activities from how we work with partners, to the opportunities we provide staff to take personal action.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Since our founding in 2001 PLOS has worked to ensure any stakeholder can learn from, build upon, or apply trusted scientific knowledge to advance global progress. By signing the UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s compact, we recognize that Open Science is a critical accelerator for achieving the SDGs and tackling this era&rsquo;s greatest challenges. Through our participation, PLOS seeks to focus and expand the work we&rsquo;re already doing, share and learn best practices from other stakeholders, and collectively harness open research to improve lives across the planet</em></p><cite><strong><em>Alison Mudditt, </em></strong><em>CEO</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<h4>Advancing the SDGs through Open and trusted research</h4>



<p>A significant portion of the articles currently published in PLOS journals are applicable to at least one Sustainable Development Goal and we expect that percentage to grow in the coming years. As with the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new titles</a> we launched in 2021, the SDGs will continue to influence the development of our portfolio and our work with research communities to seek and promote research critical to the health of our planet and its people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the content we publish, the ways in which we surface research and how we represent the broadest spectrum of researchers matter greatly to the success of these goals&ndash; and scholarly publishing more broadly. PLOS is working to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-series">eliminate financial barriers</a> to Open Access publishing and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">partnering with research communities</a> around the world to co-create more equitable solutions for sharing research and ensuring<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> inclusive policies</a> shape our journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our commitment to Open Access and Open Science, we are helping researchers increase the real-world impact of their work by ensuring it can be shared, applied, and reused by anyone who needs it. That commitment extends to research artifacts such as data, protocols, and code that strengthen reproducibility and accelerate progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Representing PLOS and the alignment of our goals with the SDG Publisher&rsquo;s compact, we&rsquo;re pleased to announce Becs Kirk, Publisher, Portfolio Development at PLOS and HESI fellow will act as a spokesperson for PLOS in coordinating our activities and sharing resources with other organizations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>PLOS has a longstanding commitment to working with global research communities who are addressing societal challenges, and to focusing the development of our portfolio to support their needs. I&rsquo;m pleased to represent PLOS in further coordinating our activities and alignment with the UN SDGs. We&rsquo;re shaping journal content, representation on our editorial boards, and the tools we offer researchers to share and promote their work around best practices for advancing a sustainable and inclusive future for all.</em></p><cite><strong><em>Becs Kirk, </em></strong><em>Publisher, Portfolio Development</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<h4>Aligning as an organization</h4>



<p>The strength of PLOS has always been the passionate individuals&ndash;including staff, the researchers to shape our journals, as well as the partners we work with&ndash;who are committed to transforming research communication in ways that build a more equitable foundation for knowledge-sharing.</p>



<p>We strive to live our values inside out, by creating a diverse, collaborative, and conscientious organization that allows these initiatives to flourish. To drive forward our efforts in advancing these goals, we&rsquo;ll be appointing an SDG Steering Committee led by our CEO, Alison Muddit and drawing on the expertise of staff that have led our progress thus far in becoming a more sustainable and inclusive organization. More to come on this soon!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>We built our journal to influence and inform decision-making at every level of society through Open Science. As Executive Editor of PLOS Climate, it&rsquo;s gratifying to see that expertise and guidance from the research community translate directly into best practices that PLOS and other signatories of the Publisher&rsquo;s Compact will take to protect our planet</em></p><cite><strong>Jamie Males</strong>, Executive Editor, <em>PLOS Climate</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>To keep track of progress, research content, and initiatives at PLOS related to the SDGs we&rsquo;re introducing a <a href="https://plos.org/our-commitment-to-sustainability/">new section of our website</a> where our communities can learn more about the work we&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;ll be sharing more updates in this space and on our website as we make progress towards these goals!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-peels-bananas">This elephant peels bananas, but only slightly ripe ones</a></h4>

              
                <p>Do you peel bananas from the top or bottom? One elephant goes with a third option.</p>



<p>When handed a slightly browning banana, Pang Pha, an Asian elephant at Zoo Berlin, will use her trunk to break the fruit, shake the pulp onto the ground, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00266-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discard the peel and then shove the pulp into her mouth</a>, researchers report in the April 10 <em>Current Biology</em>. The rare behavior, previously recorded in just a few elephants, could help shed light on how the animals learn complex movements.</p>





<p>When a zookeeper first told neuroscientist Lena Kaufmann of Humboldt University of Berlin that one of the elephants peeled bananas, she decided to test it out for herself.&nbsp;For weeks, Kaufmann and colleagues couldn’t get Pang Pha to replicate the behavior. That’s because the way the elephant eats bananas seems to depend on ripeness.</p>



<p>Pang Pha ate green and yellow bananas whole — peel and all. It was only when Kaufmann offered the gentle giant a brown-spotted banana that she revealed her peeling prowess. But the fruit can’t be too brown, Kaufmann’s team found. Pang Pha rejected completely brown bananas. Initially she would place them gently on the ground in protest. Now she throws them aside.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pang Pha, an Asian elephant at Zoo Berlin, uses her trunk to peel a slightly brown banana before eating it. She breaks the fruit, shakes the pulp onto the ground, discards the peel and then shoves the pulp into her mouth. Researchers think Pang Pha picked up the rare skill by observing her zookeepers.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the company of other elephants, Pang Pha surprisingly ate most yellow-brown bananas whole. She typically saved her peeling trick for the last banana during a social feeding session.</p>



<p>Pang Pha may have developed the peeling ability by observing her human caretakers, the researchers suspect. Elephants learning behaviors from people is extremely rare, the team says, especially a behavior this complex. None of the other elephants at the zoo — including Pang Pha’s daughter — have been observed peeling bananas. That suggests the skill isn’t easily learned from elephant to elephant.<br><br>The new study shows the value of studying individual animals, Kaufmann says. “There’s such a rich landscape of behaviors that we lose if we only look at what all elephants have in common,” she says. “If you look at each individual elephant, you can see that they’re able to do really amazing things.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cavern-west-antarctic-glacier-life">A massive cavern beneath a West Antarctic glacier is teeming with life</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The coastal plain of the Kamb Ice Stream, a West Antarctic glacier, hardly seems like a coast at all. Stand in this place, 800 kilometers from the South Pole, and you see nothing but flat ice extending in every direction. The ice is some 700 meters thick and stretches for hundreds of kilometers off the coastline, floating on the water. On clear summer days, the ice reflects the sunlight with such ferocity that it inflicts sunburn in the insides of your nostrils. It might seem hard to believe, but hidden beneath this ice is a muddy tidal marsh, where a burbling river wends its way into the ocean.</p>



<p>Until recently, no human had ever glimpsed that secret landscape. Scientists had merely inferred its existence from the faint reflections of radar and seismic waves. But in the closing days of 2021, a team of scientists from New Zealand melted a narrow hole through the glacier’s ice and lowered in a camera. They had hoped that their hole would intersect with the river, which they believed had melted a channel up into the ice — a vast water-filled cavity, nearly tall enough to hold the Empire State Building and half as long as Manhattan. On December 29, Craig Stevens finally got his first look inside. It is a moment that he will always remember.</p>





<p>Stevens is a physical oceanographer with New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Wellington. He spent 90 anxious minutes that day in Antarctica with his head buried ostrich-style under a thick down jacket to block the sunlight that would otherwise obscure his computer monitor. There, he watched live video from the camera as it descended into the hole. Icy circular walls scrolled past, reminiscent of a cosmic wormhole. Suddenly, at a depth of 502 meters, the walls widened out.</p>



<p>Stevens shouted for a colleague to halt the winch lowering the camera. He stared at the screen as the camera rotated idly on its cable. Its floodlights raked across a ceiling of glacial ice — a startling sight — scalloped into delicate crests and waves. It resembled the dreamy undulations that might take millennia to form in a limestone cavern.</p>

<p>“The interior of a cathedral,” says Stevens. A cathedral not only in beauty, but also in size. As the winch restarted, the camera journeyed downward for another half hour, through 242 meters of sunless water. Bits of reflective silt stirred up by currents streamed back down like snowflakes through the black void.</p>



<p>Stevens and his colleagues spent the next two weeks lowering instruments into the void. Their observations revealed that this coastal river has melted a massive, steep-walled cavern cutting as far as 350 meters up into the overlying ice. The cavern extends for at least 10 kilometers and appears to be boring inland, farther upstream, into the ice sheet with each passing year.</p>



<p>This cavity offers researchers a window into the network of subglacial rivers and lakes that extends hundreds of kilometers inland in this part of West Antarctica. It’s an otherworldly environment that humans have barely explored and is laden with evidence of Antarctica’s warm, distant past, when it was still inhabited by a few stunted trees.</p>

<p>One of the biggest surprises came as the camera reached bottom that day. Stevens gazed in disbelief as dozens of orange blurs swam and darted on his monitor — evidence that this place, roughly 500 kilometers from the open, sunlit ocean, is nonetheless bustling with marine animals.</p>



<p>Seeing them was “just complete shock,” says Huw Horgan, a glaciologist formerly at the Victoria University of Wellington who led the drilling expedition.</p>





<p>Horgan, who recently moved to ETH Zurich, wants to know how much water is flowing through the cavern and how its growth will impact the Kamb Ice Stream over time. Kamb is unlikely to fall apart anytime soon; this part of West Antarctica is not immediately threatened by climate change. But the cavern might still offer clues to how subglacial water could affect more vulnerable glaciers.</p>



<h4>What’s beneath Antarctica’s ice sheet?</h4>



<p>Scientists have long surmised that a veneer of liquid water sits beneath much of the ice sheet covering Antarctica. This water forms as the bottom of the ice slowly melts, several penny-thicknesses per year, due to heat seeping from the Earth’s interior. In 2007, Helen Amanda Fricker, a glaciologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1136897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported evidence</a> that this water pools into large lakes beneath the ice and can flood quickly from one lake to another (<em>SN: 6/17/06, p. 382</em>).</p>



<p>Fricker was looking at data from NASA’s Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, or ICESat, which measures the height of the ice surface by reflecting a laser off of it. The surface at several spots in West Antarctica seemed to bob up and down, rising and falling by as much as nine meters over a couple of years. She interpreted these active spots as subglacial lakes. As they filled and then spilled out their water, the overlying ice rose and fell. Fricker’s team and several others <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Siegert/publication/259427117_A_fourth_inventory_of_Antarctic_subglacial_lakes_Antarctic/links/550821bd0cf27e990e0915ce/A-fourth-inventory-of-Antarctic-subglacial-lakes-Antarctic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually found over 350</a>&nbsp;of these lakes scattered around Antarctica, including a couple dozen beneath Kamb and its neighboring glacier, the Whillans Ice Stream.</p>

<p>The lakes provoked great interest because they were expected to harbor life and might provide insights about what sorts of organisms could survive on other worlds — deep within the ice-covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn, for instance. The layers of sediment in Antarctica’s lakes might also offer glimpses into the continent’s ancient climate, ecosystems and ice cover. Teams funded by Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States attempted to drill into subglacial lakes. In 2013, the U.S.-led team succeeded, melting through 800 meters of ice and tapping into a reservoir called Subglacial Lake Whillans. It was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lake-under-antarctic-ice-bursts-life">teeming with microbes</a>, 130,000 cells per milliliter of lake water (<em>SN: 9/20/14, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Horgan helped map Lake Whillans before drilling began. But by the time the lake was breached, he and others were becoming intrigued with another facet of the subglacial landscape — the rivers thought to carry water from one lake to another, and eventually to the ocean.</p>



<p>Finding these hidden rivers requires complicated guesswork. Their flow paths are influenced not only by the subglacial topography, but also by differences in the thickness of the overlying ice. Water moves from places where the ice is thick (and the pressure high) to places where it is thinner (and the pressure lower) — meaning that rivers can sometimes run uphill.</p>



<p>By 2015, scientists had mapped the likely paths of several dozen subglacial rivers. But drilling into them still seemed farfetched. The rivers are narrow targets and their exact locations often uncertain. But around that time, Horgan got a lucky break.</p>



<p>While examining a satellite photo of the Kamb Ice Stream, he noticed a wrinkle in the pixelated tapestry of the image. The wrinkle resembled a long, shallow trough in the surface of the ice, as if the ice had sagged from melting beneath. The trough sat several kilometers from the hypothetical path of one subglacial river. Horgan believed that it marked the spot where that river flowed over the coastal plain and spilled into the ice-covered sea.</p>



<p>In 2016, while visiting the area for an unrelated research project, Horgan and his companions detoured briefly to the surface trough to take radar measurements. Sure enough, they found a void under the ice, filled with liquid water. Horgan began making plans to study it more closely. He would return twice in the next few years, once to map the river in detail and a second time to drill into it. What he found greatly exceeded his expectations.</p>



<h4>Scientists map a subglacial landscape</h4>



<p>Horgan and graduate student Arran Whiteford of the Victoria University of Wellington visited the lower Kamb Ice Stream to map the river in December 2019.</p>



<p>After weeks on the Antarctic ice sheet, they’d grown accustomed to its monotonous flat landscape, their perception sensitized to even tiny ups and downs. In this context, the surface trough “looked like this massive chasm,” Whiteford says, “like an amphitheater” — even though it slanted no more dramatically than a rolling cornfield in Iowa.</p>



<p>It was a week of scientific drudgery, towing the ice-penetrating radar behind a snowmobile along a series of straight, parallel lines that crisscrossed the trough to map the shape of the river channel under the ice.</p>



<p>Horgan and Whiteford worked up to 12 hours per day, occasionally trading positions. One person drove the snowmobile, straining his thumb on the throttle to maintain a constant 8&nbsp;kilometers per hour. Two sleds hissed along behind. One held a transmitter that fired radar waves into the glacier below; the other held an antenna that received the signal reflected back off the bottom of the ice. The second person rode on the sled with the antenna, his eyes on a bouncing laptop screen making sure that the radar was functioning.</p>

HORGAN</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Each evening they huddled in their tent, reviewing their radar traces. The river channel appeared far more dramatic than the gentle dip atop the ice suggested. Below their boots sat a vast water-filled cavern with steep sides like a train tunnel, 200&nbsp;meters to a kilometer wide and cutting as much as 50&nbsp;percent of the way up through the glacier. The more they looked, the more it resembled a river. “It kind of meanders downstream,” Whiteford says.</p>



<p>All told, Whiteford made two weeklong visits to the trough, snowmobiling over from another camp 50 kilometers away. The first time he was accompanied by Horgan, and the second time by another graduate student, Martin Forbes.</p>



<p>After returning home to New Zealand in January 2020, Whiteford examined a series of old satellite images. They showed that the surface trough — and hence, the cavern — had begun forming at least 35 years before, starting with a blip at the very mouth of the river, where it ran into the ocean. That blip had gradually lengthened, reaching progressively farther inland, or upstream. Whiteford and Horgan <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JF006532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported the observations</a> in late 2022 in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</em> — along with their theory about how the cavern formed.</p>



<p>In other parts of Antarctica where the ice sheet protrudes off the coastline, scientists have found that the ice’s underside <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2018JC013987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is often insulated from the ocean heat by a buoyant layer</a> of colder, fresher meltwater. That protective layer is sometimes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a couple of meters thick</a>. But Horgan and Whiteford suspect that the turbulence of the subglacial river flowing into the ocean stirs up that protective layer, causing seawater — a few tenths of a degree warmer than the subglacial water — to swirl up into contact with the ice. This causes an area of concentrated melt right at the river’s mouth, creating a small cavity where warm seawater can intrude further.</p>



<p>In this way, says Horgan, the focal point of melting is “stepping back over time.” And the cavern gradually burrows farther upstream into the ice.</p>



<p>Whiteford used a different set of satellite measurements — which measured the rate at which the ice’s surface sank over time — to determine how quickly the ice was melting in the cavern below. Based on this, he estimated that in the upstream end of the cavern, the ice (currently 350 to 500 meters thick over the channel) was melting and thinning 35 meters per year. That’s an astronomical rate. It’s 135 times what has been measured 50 kilometers southwest of the cavern, where the ice floats on the ocean. The water temperature is probably similar at both locations. But the turbulence caused by the river transfers the water’s heat far more efficiently into the ice.</p>



<p>Horgan thinks that the cavern at Kamb also owes its dramatic height to another factor. Glaciers in this part of West Antarctica generally flow several hundred meters per year. So the melt caused by a flowing river beneath, over years or decades, would normally be spread out over a long swath of ice. This would erode a shallow channel rather than a deep cleft. But Kamb is an oddball. Around 150 years ago, it stopped moving almost entirely due to the cyclical interplay of melting and freezing at its base. It now creeps forward only about 10 meters per year. The melting is thus concentrated, year after year, in almost the same spot.</p>



<p>Back in 2020, all of this was still conjecture. But if Horgan and his colleagues could return, drill into the cavern and lower instruments into it, they could confirm how it formed. By studying the water, sediment and microbes flowing out of it, they could also learn a lot about Antarctica’s vast subglacial landscape.</p>



<p>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet covers an area three times the size of the Colorado River drainage basin, which sprawls across Arizona, Utah, Colorado and parts of four other states. To date, humans have observed only a tiny swath of this underworld, smaller than a basketball court — represented by several dozen narrow boreholes scattered across the region, where scientists have grabbed a bit of mud from the bottom or sometimes lowered in a camera.</p>



<p>Horgan was eager to explore more. With New Zealand already melting boreholes through ice floating on the ocean, drilling into this coastal river seemed like a natural next step.</p>



<h4>How did the hidden cavern form?</h4>



<p>On December 4, 2021, a pair of caterpillar-tracked PistenBullys arrived at the place where Horgan and Whiteford had visited two years before. The tractors had traveled for 16 days from New Zealand’s Scott Base on the edge of the continent, growling across a thousand kilometers of floating ice as they towed a convoy of sleds packed with 90 metric tons of food, fuel and scientific gear. The convoy lumbered around to the upstream end of the valley and stopped.</p>



<p>Workers erected a tent the size of a small aircraft hangar, and inside it, assembled a series of water heaters, pumps and a kilometer of hose — a machine called a hot water drill. Using shovels and a small mechanized scooper, they dumped 54 tons of snow into a tank and melted it. The workers then jetted that hot water through the hose, using it to melt a narrow hole, no wider than a dinner plate, through 500 meters of ice — and down through the domed ceiling of the cavern.</p>

<h3>The cavern’s size and shape</h3>



<p>This 3-D rendering shows the shape of the cavern, based on radar traces. Scientists think it is being carved back from the coastline as a river flowing beneath the ice meets the ocean and stirs up the water there. The 2-D illustration shows what a rough cross section at one point might look like, with ice above and ground beneath.</p>

<p>The sight of animals inside the cavern generated instant excitement among Horgan, Stevens and the other people at camp. But those first images were blurry, leaving people unsure of what the orange, bumblebee-sized critters actually were.</p>



<p>Workers next lowered an instrument down the borehole to measure the water temperature and salinity inside the cavern. They found the top 50 meters of water colder and fresher than what lay below — confirming that seawater was flowing in along the bottom and a more buoyant mixture of saltwater and freshwater was flowing out along the top. The cavern, says Stevens, “is operating quite like an estuary.”</p>



<p>But those measurements also presented a mystery: The water in the top of the cavern was only about 1 percent less salty than the seawater in its bottom, suggesting that the amount of freshwater flowing in through the river was “quite small,” says Stevens. It’s akin to a shallow creek that a young kid might splash around in. He and Horgan doubted that the turbulence caused by this small flow, even over 35&nbsp;years, could melt the entire cavern — roughly a cubic kilometer of ice.</p>



<p>A likely answer came from a set of samples collected from the floor of the cavern. Gavin Dunbar, a sedimentologist at the Victoria University of Wellington, lowered a hollow plastic cylinder down the hole in hopes of retrieving a core. As he and graduate student Linda Balfoort hoisted the cylinder back up, they found it streaked and filled with chocolaty mud — a strange sight in this world of pure white, where not a speck of rock or dirt can be seen for hundreds of kilometers.</p>



<p>As Dunbar and Balfoort X-rayed and analyzed the cores months later, back in New Zealand, their peculiarities became obvious: They were unlike anything that Dunbar had ever encountered in this part of the world.</p>



<p>Every core that Dunbar had ever seen from the seafloors near this part of Antarctica consisted of a chaotic jumble of sand, silt and gravel — a material called diamict, formed as the ice sheet advances and retreats over the seafloor, plowing and mixing it like a rototiller. But in these cores, Dunbar and Balfoort saw distinct layers. Bands of coarse, gravely material were interspersed with layers of fine, silty mud.</p>



<p>That alternating pattern resembled samples from steep seafloor canyons off the coast of New Zealand, where earthquakes sometimes trigger underwater landslides that sweep for many kilometers downhill. Each flood deposits a single layer of chunky material.</p>



<p>Dunbar believes that something similar happened under the Kamb Ice Stream, possibly in the last few decades. A series of fast-moving torrents gushed through the river channel carrying big gravelly chunks from somewhere upstream that later settled on the cavern floor. “Each of these [coarse layers] represents minutes to hours of sediment deposition” that occurred during a single flood, he says. And the fine, silty layers would have been laid down over years or decades in between the floods, when the river flowed languidly along.</p>



<p>These subglacial floods could explain how this small river carved such a large cavern, Stevens says. Those floods could have been 100 to 1,000 times as large as the flow rates that were measured during the 2021–22 field season.</p>



<p>No one knows when those events happened, but scientists using satellites to study subglacial lakes have <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/10/2971/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted at least one candidate</a>. In 2013, a lake 20 kilometers upstream from the cavern, called KT3, disgorged an estimated 60 million cubic meters of water — enough to fill 24,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p>



<p>Scientists would love to know whether that flood actually passed through this cavern. “Connecting this upstream to the lake system would be extremely cool,” says Matthew Siegfried, a glaciologist at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, who coauthored one of the reports documenting the 2013 flood.</p>



<p>Studying the outflow of this river could also answer other questions about the subglacial landscape upstream. “The vast majority of our knowledge of subglacial lakes comes from surface observations from space,” Siegfried says. But those satellite records, of ice bobbing up and down, permit only indirect estimates of how much water is flowing through. It’s possible, for example, that a lot of water passes through the lakes even when the ice above isn’t moving.</p>



<p>Scientists could also learn about the subglacial landscape by studying the sediment washed downstream. When Dunbar and his colleagues examined the coarse material from their cores, they found it full of microscopic fossils: glassy shells of marine diatoms, needly spicules of sea sponges, and notched and spiky pollen grains of southern beech trees. These fossils represent the remains of a warmer world, 15 million to 20 million years ago, when a few stands of stunted, shrubby trees still clung to parts of Antarctica. Back then, the West Antarctic basin held a sea rather than an ice sheet, and this detritus settled on its muddy bottom. These old marine deposits underlie much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and the few boreholes drilled so far suggest that the mix of fossils differs from one place to another. Those mixes could provide clues to how the flow of rivers changes over time.</p>



<p>To uncover the nuance of what’s happening in the cavern “is mind-blowingly cool,” says Christina Hulbe, a glaciologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who has studied this region of Antarctica for nearly 30 years. “That’s the outlet for a massively big river system, if you think about it.”</p>



<p>By studying the water, scientists could estimate the amount of organic carbon and other nutrients flowing out of the river into the ice-covered ocean. The landscape beneath the ice sheet appears to be rich in nutrients that might sustain oases of life in an otherwise famished biological desert.</p>



<h4>Scientists unveil an oasis of life</h4>



<p>Even as the cavern penetrates farther into the Kamb Ice Stream, it does not necessarily threaten the glacier’s stability. This part of the West Antarctic coastline is not considered vulnerable, because its shallow bed shields it from the deep, warm ocean currents that are causing rapid ice loss in other regions. But subglacial rivers pour out at many other points along the coastline, including some — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">like Thwaites Glacier</a>, roughly 1,100&nbsp;kilometers northeast of Kamb — where the ice is retreating rapidly (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Thwaites and nearby glaciers <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL082182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have collectively shed over 2,000&nbsp;cubic kilometers of ice</a> since 1992. They could eventually raise global sea levels by 2.3 meters if they collapse. Remote sensing studies <a href="https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/10.1144/sp461.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have documented over a dozen low, squat shield volcanoes</a> beneath this part of the ice sheet. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00242-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevated geothermal heat flow</a>, even from inactive volcanoes, is thought to cause high levels of melting under the ice sheet. That melting produces large amounts of subglacial water, which could render these glaciers even more vulnerable to human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>Horgan believes that what scientists learn at Kamb could improve our understanding of how subglacial rivers impact those other, rapidly changing coastlines of Antarctica.</p>



<p>But the most evocative discovery made at Kamb — in purely human terms — may be the blurry, orangish animals seen swarming near the bottom of the cavern. Stevens captured some clearer images a few days later and tentatively identified them as shrimp­like marine crustaceans called amphipods. To see so many of them here, Stevens says, “we really hadn’t expected that.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Video from a camera lowered into a hidden cavern beneath the Kamb Ice Stream showed animals, perhaps amphipods, swimming about. They may subsist in part on nutrients transported by a subglacial river.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Microbes like those previously found under the ice sheet in Subglacial Lake Whillans are known to eke out a living even in harsh conditions. But animals are a different matter. The deepest seafloors on Earth sit only 10 or 11 kilometers from sunlight, and animal life in those places is generally scarce. But the animals in the cavern are thriving 500 kilometers from the nearest daylight, cut off from the photosynthesis that fuels most life on Earth.</p>



<p>The amphipods and their supporting ecosystem must be subsisting on some other food source. But what? Observations in the Kamb ice cavern, combined with those at two other remote boreholes drilled in recent years, offer some tantalizing hints.</p>



<p>In 2015, researchers pierced the ice at another site 250 kilometers from the cavern, where the Whillans Ice Stream lifts off its bed and floats. In that location, a thin sliver of seawater, just 10&nbsp;meters deep, sits beneath 760 meters of ice. A remotely operated vehicle, or ROV, sent down the hole captured images of fish and amphipods.</p>



<p>John Priscu, a microbial ecologist at Montana State University in Bozeman who was involved in the drilling at the site, believes that the glacier itself is sustaining this ecosystem. The bottom 10&nbsp;meters of ice is packed with mud that had frozen onto the belly of the glacier many kilometers upstream. The mud had been dragged to its present location as the glacier oozed forward, 400&nbsp;meters per year. As the ROV navigated about, bits of that muddy debris constantly rained down, released as the ice’s underside slowly melted. That debris is rich in organic matter — the rotting remains of diatoms and other phytoplankton that sank to the bottom millions of years ago when the world was warmer.</p>



<p>“Those amphipods are swarming to the particulate matter,” Priscu says. “They’re sensing the organic matter falling out of that basal ice.” Or perhaps they may be eating the bacteria that live on those organics.</p>



<p>Because the Kamb Ice Stream is barely moving, the supply of dirty ice moving toward the sea is small. But the river flowing into the ice cavern may deliver the same subglacial nutrients that are found in dirty ice. After all, the water’s journey through a series of subglacial lakes down to the river’s mouth may take years or decades. Throughout that time, the river absorbs nutrients from the organic-rich subglacial sediments.</p>



<p>Indeed, when scientists drilled into Subglacial Lake Whillans in 2013, they found its water honey-colored — chock-full of life-sustaining iron, ammonium and organics. “What these lakes are pumping out may be a concentrated source of nutrients” for ecosystems along the dark coastline, says Trista Vick-Majors, a microbial ecologist at Michigan Technological University in Houghton who was involved in the drilling at Lake Whillans. She <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GB006446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has estimated that</a> the subglacial rivers flowing out from under Kamb and its neighboring glaciers may deliver 56,000&nbsp;tons of organic carbon and other nutrients to this section of the coastline every year.</p>



<p>More recently, in December 2019, a team from New Zealand led by Horgan and Hulbe drilled through the ice just 50 kilometers from the Kamb cavern, in a place where the Kamb Ice Stream floats on the ocean. There’s no dirty ice there and no nearby river outlets. The area resembled a famished seafloor desert; it was populated by single-celled microbes with little to eat, and few signs of animals were seen — only a few burrowing traces on the muddy bottom. Priscu sees this location as an exception that proves the point: Subglacial nutrients are the crucial energy source in this dark world under the floating ice, whether they are dragged forward on the undersides of glaciers or spilled out through subglacial rivers.</p>



<p>The mud and water samples collected from the Kamb ice cavern may provide a new opportunity to test that theory. Craig Cary, a microbial ecologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, is analyzing DNA from those samples. He hopes to determine whether the microbes in the cavern belong to taxonomic groups that are known to subsist on ammonium, methane, hydrogen or other sources of chemical energy that originate from the subglacial sediments. That might reveal whether such sources support enough microbial growth to feed the animals observed there.</p>



<p>The team also needs to measure the flow rate of the subglacial river that spills into the cavern, since that determines the nutrient supply. Stevens continues to monitor this thanks to a set of instruments left behind in the cavern.</p>

STEVENS/NIWA</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As people were packing up camp on January 11, 2022, workers pumped more hot water into the borehole, widening it to more than 35 centimeters — and creating a dangerous pitfall. Stevens and his colleagues donned climbing harnesses, clipped into safety ropes and approached the hole one last time. They lowered a series of cylinders the size of caulking guns down the hole. These devices continue to measure the temperature, salinity and water currents inside the cavern, sending the data 500 meters up a cable to a transmitter that beams it home via satellite once a day. That data will reveal how the river’s flow changes over time. With luck, the instruments might even detect a subglacial flood gushing through.</p>



<p>“That would just be outstanding,” Horgan says. For many years, he had to content himself with seeing these rivers and lakes dimly, through the outlines of water on radar and satellite images. This is “one of the first times we’ve got to stand at a river mouth and observe it.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">For much of the past year, we and several colleagues in our field have been trying to convince a publisher to retract a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jwi.org/calendar/challenging-parental-alienation">Advocates are using</a> the text because it contains details on how to advance numerous laws in the United States and throughout the world. The text is also currently being <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/library/publications/questioning-scientific-validity-parental-alienation-label-abuse-cases">used to influence judicial decisions</a> that affect the lives of thousands of families.</p>



<p>The problem is, the work contains a massive amount of misinformation, misquoted sources, plagiarized text, and many other flaws.</p>



<p>We have been so disappointed with the failure of the publisher and the Committee on Publishing Ethics (COPE) to address our concerns and our request for retraction that we have decided to share our experience with the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126939"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On December 3, 2021, Routledge, part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group,&nbsp; published <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Challenging-Parental-Alienation-New-Directions-for-Professionals-and-Parents/Mercer-Drew/p/book/9780367559762"><em>Challenging Parental Alienation: New Directions for Professionals and Parents</em></a><em>, </em>which was edited by Jean Mercer and Margaret Drew. All of the chapter authors in the book have been staunch critics of parental alienation (PA) research and theory, the study of children who, as one of us (JJH) has written, are influenced by a parental figure to reject their other parent for reasons that are exaggerated or not legitimate during and after a divorce. The field has a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0001404">strong scientific basis</a>. Our group, comprised of scientists and practitioners working in the field of PA, purchased the book with the intent of writing a book review for a peer-reviewed journal.</p>



<p>We soon identified a pervasive amount of mis/disinformation about PA, overstated and distorted facts, mischaracterization of extant research, use of secondary and tertiary citations (and nonexistent ones), strawman arguments, and other techniques of science denial across all chapters of the book.</p>



<p>The problems were so extensive, we decided to write a thorough critique of the larger issues and submit a request to the publisher to retract the text from circulation, recall existing physical and digital copies, and issue a public statement that this action was taken. <a href="https://pasg.info/app/uploads/2023/04/Analysis-of-Mercer-Drew-2023-04-04.pdf">The critique and request for retraction</a> was endorsed by 45 organizations studying and working with families affected by PA.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Our organizations – the <a href="http://www.pasg.info">Parental Alienation Study Group</a> and the <a href="https://garipa.org/">Global Action for Research Integrity in Parental Alienation</a> – submitted our critique to Claire Jarvis, senior editor for health and social care at Routledge, and Jeremy North, managing director of books at Taylor &amp; Francis, on August 12, 2022.&nbsp; We also attached a letter that included the following statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is not simply a difference of opinions among professionals with contrasting perspectives on a controversial topic. Rather, our critique centers on factual errors such as distortions of the writings and opinions of other scholars.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Two weeks later, Jarvis responded by stating that the original proposal for the book “was externally reviewed by experts in the field and received two supportive endorsements. Although we appreciate that the field is a contested one, we are happy with the book’s content and will not be withdrawing it from sale.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Realizing that Jarvis and North were not going to address our concerns, we contacted COPE on August 28, 2022. We asked specifically for help obtaining information about the procedures followed by the publisher to reach their decision to publish the book, and to gain assistance facilitating communication and resolution with Routledge. We were informed by Alysa Levine, operations manager at COPE, that we were required to refrain from posting anything about the case while it was under review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A week later, Iratxe Puebla, facilitation and integrity officer at COPE, emailed Jarvis and Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics and integrity at<strong> </strong>Taylor &amp; Francis. Her email stated that COPE’s role was to provide guidance on whether any procedures were followed, or actions taken that were inconsistent with COPE practices or guidelines. She wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Bernet has raised concerns that the book mentioned contains errors and inaccuracies about parental alienation. Dr. Bernet considers that the publisher should consult independent experts in assessing his concerns and withdraw the book from publication. We include below a summary of the concerns raised by Dr. Bernet.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Puelba asked Jarvis and Alam about the review process for the book, and how the publisher and its employees handled concerns about the work. She asked for an update on the current status of the follow-up with us, and whether a resolution had been reached regarding the concerns about the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In mid-September, Jarvis briefly responded to Puebla and Bernet with the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have further discussed this concern with our editorial and publishing directors. They asked me to reiterate the first reply we gave to you which was that we are happy with the reviews we obtained for this project and also with the academic credentials of both editors. Because of this, we will not be withdrawing this book from sale.</p>

<p>Immediately after receiving this message, Bernet responded by pointing out that there still appeared to be no attempt to investigate the concerns we raised about the book, that we had no information about who specifically conducted the reviews of the project or how the reviewers were selected, and that she did not seem to be aware the book’s chapter authors have spent years <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15379418.2018.1557578">publishing derogatory comments and falsehoods about PA</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On September 16, 2022, Puebla emailed to notify us that she had raised our correspondence with Jarvis to the attention of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee at COPE, who would review the matter. She said she would be in touch in “due course.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the next 3 months, Puebla repeatedly asked Jarvis to provide a response to the issues raised in her initial email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jarvis did not respond to any of the requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After Jarvis and her colleagues at Routledge and Taylor &amp; Francis ignored the third deadline that COPE imposed on them, we emailed Puebla on November 28.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time, we brought to her attention a <a href="https://drpeterwilmshurst.wordpress.com/2022/11/15/has-cope-membership-become-a-way-for-unprincipled-journals-to-buy-a-fake-badge-of-integrity/">blog</a> recently posted by Peter Wilmshurst, a cardiologist and whistleblower. In it, Wilmshurst asked, “Has COPE membership become a way for unprincipled journals to buy a fake badge of integrity?”&nbsp;His point was that COPE may be unable or unwilling to sanction large publishers because COPE needs the funds these publishers pay as membership dues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taylor &amp; Francis is a <a href="https://publicationethics.org/category/publisher/taylor-and-francis">member of COPE</a>, and presumably a substantial payer of <a href="https://publicationethics.org/cope-membership-subscription-fees#PublisherJournal">dues</a>.&nbsp;We explicitly asked whether there was any hope that Puebla’s office could help us resolve our disagreement with Taylor &amp; Francis. If COPE was powerless to help sort this out, we needed to know so that we could proceed with another approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day later, Puebla replied stating she raised the email to the attention of relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After receiving no additional response, we again emailed Puebla on December 16, reviewing the chain of events described above. We asked, again, what the next step was—if any. Her response:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This matter is under discussion by relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee. I should note that the COPE office will be closed for a good part of the next two weeks and thus, we may only be able to provide a further update in January.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On January 1, 2023, we emailed Puebla again, this time with information about a new peer-reviewed paper published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bsl.2605"><em>Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law</em></a><em>. </em>The article detailed vast misinformation about PA that has been published and then republished since 1994. We pointed out that four chapters from <em>Challenging Parental Alienation </em>contained this misinformation, something our critique cited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our point was that the errors we identified in the book were not random or accidental. Rather, they represent a larger campaign by the editors and authors of the book to discredit PA research and theory. The chapter authors in the book have made the same false statements in other journal articles, book chapters, formal presentations, and government documents. The conveying of disinformation needs to be interrupted, and that is why we were seeking retraction. We asked again what the next steps are and wrote that it seemed Routledge’s membership in COPE should be suspended for failure to respond to COPE’s inquiries.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Exactly one month later, after receiving no response from Puebla, we emailed her again. We provided an outline of our correspondence regarding the matter since August 12, 2022. We informed her that during the time of this inquiry process, the editors of <em>Challenging Parental Alienation</em> have been promoting the book through book reviews in journals, websites, and government documents in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We again asked her for suggestions on how to resolve our dispute with the publishers, whether they had given up all discussion and negotiations with them, and whether COPE was ready to recommend suspending Routledge’s membership for failure to comply with COPE’s basic expectations regarding the resolution of serious complaints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, we asked whether she was ready to proceed with the next step in COPE’s flow chart of processes for handling this type of problem, which was that the Subcommittee member and Facilitation and Integrity Officer would review all correspondence and draft a report. We also asked whether we could start to share our concerns on social media and other outlets.</p>



<p>On February 4, Puebla responded to say that she, again, had raised the correspondence to the attention of relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee and would be in touch as they provided advice. This is the last communication we have had with COPE.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><strong></strong>Ironically, Routledge has published several books that present PA theory in a responsible, positive manner. But now they have published an extremely negative book replete with misinformation that directly contradicts their previous books on the topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We remain concerned that the publisher has refused to retract a book with obviously false and misleading material—which we believe is likely to damage children and families in many countries—and that COPE seems powerless to intervene.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/04/20/how-can-a-neural-network-be-like-the-brain/">How can a neural network be like the brain?</a></h4>

              
                <p>NeuroAI is the budding research field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. One of the core concepts used in the field is that artificial neural networks can act as good models of the brain. For example, it’s often claimed that convolutional neural networks can account for the response of the ventral visual stream to images. Similarly, large language models have been found that capture what’s going on inside the language network of the brain. When I have discussions with people outside of our narrow field, this often triggers surprise. Wait, how can a deep neural network be like the brain? What does it mean to be a good model? How can the squishy stuff be like the silicon?</p>



<p>Here I want to get into the specifics of how, mechanically, you compare a brain to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). I give some historical background first, focusing on classic results and methods that originated in the field of visual perception. I will explain the nitty gritty of how correspondence scores between brains and ANNs are calculated. I discuss some of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the classic methods of linear regression and RSA, and explain some of the proposed alternative metrics in Williams et al. (2021). You’ll get the most out of these sections if you’re coming from a math background: statistician, data scientist, computational neuroscientist, etc. Nevertheless, if you’re less math-oriented, I will give intuitive explanations so you can follow along. I conclude with a call to create and use more nuanced and detailed comparisons between brains and neural nets.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">History: the visual ventral stream as a convolutional neural net</h1>



<p>Let’s start with the classic example of convolutional neural networks vs. the ventral visual stream. In the late 80’s, Yann LeCun was inspired by the classic work of Hubel and Wiesel on the physiology of the visual cortex. He created a neural network consisting of sandwiched layers of selectivity and invariance operations, not unlike the simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex. His network, LeNet, was the first example of a convolutional neural net (CNN) trained with gradient descent, and it could classify handwritten digits. Two decades later, this work was then greatly scaled up by Alex Krizhevsky and co. in Geoff Hinton’s lab at the University of Toronto. AlexNet led to the ImageNet moment, in 2012, where a CNN did far better than state-of-the-art classical machine learning methods at image classification, showing that “deep learning has arrived”.</p>



<p>If CNNs were inspired by the brain, and they do the same thing as a brain (image classification), could they be a little like the brain? If it talks like a duck, and it walks like a duck, is it a duck? This is a surprisingly subtle question, and two teams (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1403112111">Dan Yamins in Jim DiCarlo’s</a> lab, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003915">Khaligh-Razavi in Niko Kriegeskorte’s</a>) answered this question with a vigorous “yes, maybe!?” in 2014. They looked at the responses of the ventral visual stream—areas of the brain traditionally associated with shape perception and image classification—and compared them against the ANNs of the time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The mechanics of comparing a brain to an ANN</h2>



<p>So how did they compare a brain to an ANN? They followed what’s now considered a classic recipe. You need three inputs:</p>



<ol>
<li>an ANN trained for some task (e.g. visual classification)</li>



<li>a brain (human or non-human)</li>



<li>a set of benchmark stimuli (e.g. a set of images, sentences, videos, etc.)</li>
</ol>



<p>You then proceed as follows:</p>



<ol>
<li>You probe the ANN with all the benchmark stimuli. You obtain a matrix of responses <strong>X</strong>. Each row is one stimulus (=one image, one movie clip, one sentence, etc.). Each column corresponds to a subunit of the neural network (e.g. the collected intermediate activations of the ANN).</li>



<li>You do the same with the brain. That means, for instance, having someone sit inside the scanner, looking at the same set of images that the neural network was exposed to, and you recording their functional responses. You collect the data into a new matrix. The rows are again exemplars, but now the columns represent something else: physical neurons, EEG sensors, fMRI voxels, etc. This gives us a matrix of responses <strong>Y</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>By construction, <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> have the same number of rows, but different column counts. We’ve thus reduced the problem of comparing a brain and an ANN to the problem of comparing two matrices of different shapes.</p>



<p>There are two now classic ways of doing this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Linear regression: Do multiple linear regression to map one matrix onto the other. Learn a weight matrix <strong>W</strong> such that the residual ||<strong>Y</strong> &#8211; <strong>XW</strong>|| is minimized. This requires some regularization: Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes the sum-of-squares of <strong>W</strong>, might help here. An alternative is to require that the mapping is low-rank using partial least-squares with a limited number of components. This is the path used by Yamins &amp; DiCarlo. The final score is the R2 of the linear regression, perhaps calculated through cross-validation (CV).</li>



<li>Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA): One difficulty with the previous method is that it requires learning a weight vector <strong>W</strong>. This is necessary, in part because the dimensionality of the two matrices might be different. If we form the matrices <strong>XX</strong>’ and <strong>YY</strong>’, however, we obtain two square matrices of the same size. Furthermore, these matrices are invariant to a relabeling (permutation) of the columns. Thus, we can compare the elements of the two similarity matrices via a correlation coefficient. Technically, you could have a negative score, but you could threshold or square to get a score in the 0-1 range. This <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full">is the method pioneered by Niko Kriegeskorte back in 2008</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>These procedures will result in two distinct scores for the similarity of matrices: the linear regression score (really, CV R2) and the RSA score. Both have the property that 0 is maximally misaligned and 1 is maximally aligned. This way, we have reduced the difficult philosophical question of what it means for a brain to be like an ANN to a problem of <em>big number good, small number bad.</em></p>

<p>Using these tools, the two historical papers came to similar conclusions: deep neural nets trained on images have similar representations to the ventral visual stream of the brain. For the Yamins paper, it was with linear regression and with single-cell neurophysiology; for Khaligh-Razavi, it was RSA on fMRI data.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conceptual difficulties with comparing brains and ANNs</strong></h1>



<p>Procedures to map brains to ANNs like linear regression and RSA swap out deep philosophical issues about the nature of perception with a technocratic procedure. In fact, there’s a lot that hides under these scoring procedures.</p>



<p>Both methods are <em>correct</em> at the extremes: if you try to compare two random matrices against each other, you’ll get a score of 0; and if you compare a brain (or an ANN) against itself, you’ll get a score of 1. So a brain is similar to itself but not to random noise: cool. That’s a pretty low bar to achieve, and it’s in the middle scores that we run into conceptual difficulties. What does a 0.5 similarity between the brain and an ANN mean? What are we actually trying to quantify?</p>

<p>There are different ways in which we can conceptualize how the brain can be like an ANN. Let’s name some of these ways:</p>



<ol>
<li>We could ask for a 1-to-1 correspondence: each subunit in the ANN should correspond to a neuron in the brain. That’s a very high bar to clear! Let’s call this 1-to-1 correspondence.</li>



<li>We could ask that distances are preserved in the brain and in the ANN. An analogy in 3d will help. Two three-dimensional shapes (say, rubber duckies, above) can be similar, regardless of their (arbitrary) orientation. Distances between two points on the surface of the duckies are preserved: they are invariants. Let’s call this orthogonal correspondence.</li>



<li>We could ask that one manifold of responses can be morphed into another through a linear transformation. Let’s call this linear correspondence.</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s not clear how traditional linear regression and RSA scores map to these desiderata. You can make a verbal argument that linear regression is similar to linear correspondence (2), while RSA is most similar to orthogonal correspondence (2). However, there are complications in real implementations: regularization in linear regression, selection of voxels with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio in RSA. This means that we might not capture our (unstated) goals in complex ways.</p>



<p>Traditionally, these concerns have been more or less swept under the rug, and each subfield has converged on its own widely agreed-upon scores: RSA for human neuroscience, linear regression for single-cell neurophysiology. The argument goes that whatever score we choose, alternative scores would correlate with it. This encourages papers from using whatever is the most commonly used score in their subfield, which allows the scores to be compared more readily from paper to paper. A perfectly reasonable heuristic, but a little unsatisfying.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Williams et al.&#8217;s solution: computational shape analysis</strong></h1>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14739">Williams et al. (2021)</a> offer a nice treatment of these issues with some good conceptual solutions, casting the problem as one of computational shape analysis: analyzing shapes in high-dimensional spaces with statistical tools.</p>

<p>First, they project the two representations (brain and ANN) onto a fixed, common-sized representation. You could use random projections, subsampling, PCA, etc. to get two matrices with different widths to the same width. Call the resulting matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;hat{&#92;bold{X}}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;hat{&#92;bold{Y}}" class="latex" />. One of their proposed distances is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;min_{T &#92;in G} ||&#92;hat{&#92;bold{X}} - &#92;hat{&#92;bold{Y}}||" class="latex" />. <strong>T</strong> is a transformation within some group <em>G</em> that captures what is it that we mean by “same”. Some potential choices:</p>



<ol>
<li>If you want one-to-one correspondence between the brain and ANN, <em>G</em> can be the set of all permutation matrices</li>



<li>If you want distances to be preserved, then <em>G</em> can be the orthonormal matrices</li>



<li>If you want to allow squishing along arbitrary linear dimensions, you can let <em>G</em> be arbitrary linear transformations</li>
</ol>



<p>It turns out the resulting scores are proper distances that respect the triangle inequality, which has some nice benefits for clustering. They also introduce more metrics for more unusual scenarios. For example, for convolutional neural networks, you’d want something that allows remapping along the channel dimension, but not along the space dimension. Although each metric seems like it requires a brute-force search, it turns out there are clever ways of calculating the optimal transformations in each scenario.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The advantage of axiomatic methods</h1>



<p>Overall, Williams et al. take cues from the recent success of geometric deep learning (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478">Bronstein et al. 2021</a>) to ask deep questions about the metrics we use. More than just an incremental numerical improvement, I think it’s a big conceptual improvement over linear regression and RSA: you know what you’re getting into. An axiomatic approach tells you very explicitly what the underlying assumptions are.</p>



<p>Ironically, this makes it easier to poke holes in some of these scores. For instance, one of the core desiderata that Williams et al. fulfill is that their chosen score should be symmetric. Now, I would argue that a brain can be more similar to a neural network than vice-versa. Modern large language models (LLMs) represent more stuff than humans: GPT-4 knows markdown, latex, English, German, how to write listicles and poems and sound like a pirate. Most people can only do a subset of these things. Divergences for distributions are naturally asymmetric, so there’s nothing inherently fishy about a score that is asymmetric. I’m sure there is a variant of linear regression’s asymmetric R2 which can be properly axiomatized according to the framework laid out by Williams et al.</p>



<p>In the meantime, one can use combinations of these well-justified metrics to answer interesting questions about how brains vs. ANNs represent information. For example, the delta between linear correspondance (metric 3) and the orthogonal correspondance (metric 2) is an index about how much warping is necessary to get two latent spaces to match. This could help reveal whether a brain’s representation is <em>a subset of</em> or <em>a noisy approximation of</em> a particular artificial neural net, which is ambiguous for each individual metric. Williams et al. have made their metrics available in <a href="https://github.com/ahwillia/netrep">this Python package</a>, so you can try this out yourself.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Discussion</h1>



<p>For all their justification, we haven’t seen much empirical work using well-axiomatized scores beyond linear regression and RSA. I think the reason for the status quo is that we’ve been focused on coarse characterizations thus far. This will surely need to change as we go beyond <em>ANNs as metaphors for the brain</em> and start using them as <em>in silico models</em> of the brain.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://xcorr.net/2022/05/18/whats-the-endgame-of-neuroai/">I’m interested in using ANNs as models for the brain for the purpose of neural engineering</a>. What I really want is that when I create a virtual lesion in a neural network, it predicts how the real brain will react to a real lesion. Such a <em>causal manipulation score</em> doesn’t yet exist, but I think it would be both conceptually and practically useful. The axiomatic approach of Williams et al. points us towards ways of building this type of score.</p>



<p>For other purposes, however, it may be that the metrics we have are good enough. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.16.537080v1">This recent paper from Tuckute et al.</a> shows that one can learn a transfer function between a large language model and the brain’s language network using linear regression. The model can predict which sentences drive or don’t drive the brain. Using in silico models to predict the response of the brain is helpful in this scenario, and in a certain meaningful sense it means that the brain <em>is like a neural network</em>, along this prediction axis, but perhaps not according to more stringent criteria.</p>



<p>The work from Williams et al. is just one of a number of recent approaches looking at this problem in depth. We’ve seen <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11665">some of the same authors extend this work to stochastic representations</a>. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/01/01/2022-in-review-neuroai-comes-of-age/">Furthermore, empiricists have pointed out problems that current metrics don’t capture</a>, for example, hierarchical correspondence. I think it’s an exciting time to think deeply about our metrics and what it really means for a brain to be like an ANN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/plos-genetics-to-launch-microbial-section/">PLOS Genetics to launch Microbial Section</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, April 20 at 2pm Eastern</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; PLOS today announced that<em> PLOS Genetics </em>is expanding the scope of its journal with a renamed section called <em>Microbial Genetics. </em>This section will replace the former Prokaryotic Genetics section to emphasize research on microbes more broadly with the aim to publish studies that use genetic approaches to provide insights into how bacteria as well as archaea and their phages/viruses, fungi (including yeasts and filamentous fungi), and protists function and interact with the biotic and abiotic world.</p>



<p><em>PLOS Genetics</em> has an established presence in the fungal genetics community, but this research has not easily found a home within its existing journal sections. Currently, the majority of these submissions, primarily studies in yeast, are handled within the General section of the journal. The new microbial section will rectify that issue.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We believe the new <em>Microbial Genetics</em> section will provide a logical new home for these submissions and reaffirm our continued support for this type of research,&rdquo; said Gregory Copenhaver, Co Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are excited that the relaunch of this section will include a Curated Collection for malaria-related research, which will also include other protozoan parasites,&rdquo; said Gregory Barsh, Co Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Genetics.</em></p>



<p>The new section on Microbial Genetics will be headed by Geraldine Butler, Eva Stukenbrock, Lotte S&oslash;gaard-Andersen and Sean Crosson. These four section editors are supported by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/editorial-board">associate editors</a> with broad expertise in microbial genetics.</p>



<p>To learn more about this section relaunch, you can read the editorial<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010695"> here</a>.</p>
