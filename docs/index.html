<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image.png"><img decoding="async" width="114" height="150" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130490"/></a></figure></div>


<p><em>International Wound Journal</em>, a Wiley title, has retracted 27 papers since June with notices mentioning “manipulated” or “compromised” peer review. </p>



<p>“A comprehensive investigation examining manipulated peer review in this journal is in progress,” a Wiley spokesperson told Retraction Watch. The publisher anticipates retracting more articles as the investigation continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first retraction of the batch, of the November 2023 article “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14502">Analysis of the Association Between Serum Levels of 25(OH)D, Retinol Binding Protein, and Cyclooxygenase-2 and the Disease Severity in Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers</a>,” appeared June 14. The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14947">notice</a> stated Wiley and the journal’s editor in chief “concluded that the peer review process of this article was manipulated” following an investigation by the publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130489"></span>



<p>The authors “did not respond to the notice of retraction,” according to the notice. Corresponding author Liwei Bai of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University in Weihui, China, did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the Wiley spokesperson told us the publisher’s investigation began “through our standard processes and channels prior to the receipt of inquiries from external parties,” 20 of the retractions in the batch credited “a third party.” These notices <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70022">stated</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It came to the publisher&#8217;s attention from a third party that a number of articles shared concerning similarities in format and structure. Following an investigation by the publisher, the retraction has been agreed on as the peer review and publishing process for this article were found to be manipulated</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five papers pulled November 12 have different notices, which stated the articles were accepted “solely on the basis of a compromised peer review process,” and therefore must be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>International Wound Journal</em> recently became open access, according to a September 2023 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14380">editorial</a> marking the journal’s 20th birthday. The journal had increased its number of editions from eight to 10 in 2023, and would add two more in 2024, the editors wrote, “as our submission volumes have increased exponentially.” The editors also shared plans to publish “several ‘special’ editions to supplement our annual editions.”</p>



<p>In an August <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70010?af=R">editorial</a>, the editors acknowledged some of the increase in submissions the journal had seen “is related to ‘papermill’ type activity.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This has challenged our submission and review process. To manage this, we are implementing significant back-end processes to identify and reject such content. We are also creating the largest single editorial board for any wound care journal, to strengthen our review process to enhance its effectiveness. This has become necessary to ensure the continued quality of our journal, especially considering the threat that “papermill type” activity may have on our overall subject area. This is a global challenge to the world of academic and clinical research. It is something that the IWJ does not take lightly and we are working diligently in playing our part to minimize its impact in the world of wound care.</p>

                Several years ago, UCL investigated the Macchiarini affair and found their surgeon Martin Birchall was not only innocent, but also entitled to more money and more patients to experiment upon. 
Now, Patricia Murray was awarded for exposing this UCL malfeasance, and Sholto David scrutinised UCL papers for data manipulation.

<p>Crossref, a nonprofit focused on metadata of scholarly publications, has suspended the membership of a company linked to websites which copied the appearance of journals belonging to Elsevier and Springer Nature, among others from major publishers, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move follows <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">Anna Abalkina’s reporting on Retraction Watch</a> about the activities of Springer Global Publications, which had used its membership in Crossref to assign Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to papers in 13 journals with similar names to those established by legitimate publishers. The DOIs linked to papers on webpages mimicking the appearance of the original journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Global Publications did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the suspension of its Crossref membership. The company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/26/company-linked-to-cloned-journals-of-major-publishers-denies-cloning-journals-of-major-publishers/">previously told us</a> it did not “create, review, or manage the content associated with the identifiers we issue,” and did not publish any journals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The website of the company has also been suspended by its hosting provider, and is no longer available online.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130485"></span>



<p>Ginny Hendricks of Crossref told us the organization had suspended Springer Global Publications for “misrepresenting information on their application form,” because the company told us they don’t publish the journals they provide DOIs for. “Sometimes these things take months, but this was clear cut,” Hendricks said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Editor’s note: Crossref <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/">acquired the Retraction Watch Database</a> last year and funds our efforts to maintain and update the repository.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Crossref’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/revocation/">policies</a> on suspending or revoking membership, the executive committee of the nonprofit’s board must review and ratify the decision to revoke membership. The board’s next meeting will likely take place in January, Hendricks said, but in the meantime Springer Global Publications “can’t access the system and are already suspended from membership.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/sheltering-from-time-a-review-of-time-shelter">Sheltering from Time: A Review of Time Shelter</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>In this review, Rebecca Pope discusses the International Booker Prize winning novel, &apos;Time Shelter&apos;. Georgi Gospodinov discusses transporting patients with Alzheimer&apos;s Disease back in time in a &apos;clinic for the past&apos;, as a promising treatment. But is this always a good idea?... </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Bulgarian author, Georgi Gospodinov, brings us his third novel, ‘Time Shelter’, which brings us into the world of Alzheimer’s Disease through the eyes of a fictional narrator, while discussing the utility of immersive therapies.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">‘Time Shelter’ was a fascinating read. Having completed a Neuroscience MSci degree, I had scientific knowledge of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) already, but this text was based on the patient experience - a new angle for me as a preclinical researcher. Fortunately, I have never had someone close to me develop AD, so have not personally experienced how awful it is for a friend or family member. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In the book, Gospodinov delves into the idea of immersive therapies, alongside a clinician, Gaustine, creating floors of a clinic focused on a specific year, or decade, of times past. By utilising seemingly fictional patient stories - their backgrounds, the time they are living in, their changing relationships, their response to the immersion - Gospodinov discusses his interactions with them and the emotions that are raised both for them, as well as within him, in-depth during every observation. In fact, the clinic is so successful that individuals with no memory loss are also keen to experience the past!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It is difficult to know how each person will experience their decline and loss of memory after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, or in which time they will be ‘living’ for the foreseeable future. Will they be ‘reliving’ a traumatic time of their life, or will it be a place of comfort? How can we support them and make them comfortable? This is yet another example of why personalised therapies are so important. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We are collections of our memories - if they are unwillingly stripped from us, who remains? </strong></span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Whilst creating these realistic and dystopian, frozen moments in time, Gospodinov highlighted the attention to detail that is required, including about things that in the moment do not seem particularly important (advertisements, trending colours, widespread opinions, major news stories, popular children’s toys). It gave me an appreciation for the things immediately around me as I was sitting reading the book in the park - the fashion, the language, the 2024 obsession with running!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We are collections of our memories - if they are unwillingly stripped from us, who remains? Do we instead become a collection of the memories that other people possess of us? It is incredible that something, be it a scent or a piece of music, can suddenly bring people back to themselves, reanimating them (and sometimes giving seemingly non-verbal people the power of speech). Knowing what these prompts are is the major difficulty, and a clinician must spend ample amounts of time with the patient or their friends and family to gather personal information to try to guess at these things. Unfortunately, it seems that in these cases, the brain is effectively locking away our memories and forgetting to label the key…</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Is it right to have somebody living in another time with the ‘real’ world passing them by outside?</strong></span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The novel also touches on the ethics of the treatments; is it right to have somebody living in another time with the ‘real’ world passing them by outside? Gospodinov also raises the question: is it always a good idea to feed their illusion? The example he uses is of a lady who has returned to living in a time of perpetual fear, as a prisoner of Auschwitz. Certainly, there are very real moral questions to be asked here, to be considered on a case by case basis. The latter half of the book focused on the dystopian introduction of a political voting system for European countries to select which decade they would like to live in. Gospodinov went into intricate detail about the politics, music, affluence, and other factors of each country in the decades chosen. This was an intriguing and terrifying concept, but was also a bit dry to read.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With our ageing society, AD is becoming more prevalent, and the likelihood that we will know someone affected by the disease is ever increasing. In 2019, more than 55.2 million people were experiencing dementia in old age and this number is predicted to increase to 78 million by 2030 (1). It is becoming more and more urgent to develop therapies that can provide immediate comfort for patients, with the long-term goal of developing preventative treatments. I think that immersive experiences would be a relief for people with AD who are distressed and confused, largely stuck in the past. The isolation and frustration that patients must feel to not be understood and to be alone in their experience is truly devastating and difficult for those around them.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Overall, ‘Time Shelter’ was an interesting read, with its title being a clever nod to ‘bomb shelter’, implying that the immersive therapies are providing a literal shelter from time. It</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">prompts the reader to reflect about the best, personalised care for people with AD and raises moral questions surrounding treatment.</span></span></p>

<p>A former researcher at Nemours Children’s Health in Wilmington, Del., admitted to falsifying and incorrectly reporting data in at least two published studies, both of which were supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health. The studies have been retracted.</p>



<p>The researcher, Valerie Sampson, reported herself to Nemours, which launched an inquiry into all of her publications, according to a hospital spokesperson. The institution’s findings are under review at the U.S. Office of Research Integrity.</p>



<p>Sampson left Nemours in January 2022 after 16 years with the hospital, according to her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerie-sampson-b10210221/">LinkedIn profile</a>. She also held a position as an affiliated scientist at the University of Delaware, a role that ended in the same month, per the profile. Six months following her departure from Nemours, Sampson took a position as a scientist at WuXi Advanced Therapies in Philadelphia, a company specializing in cell and gene therapies, for a little over a year. She is currently unemployed, according to the profile. </p>



<span id="more-130469"></span>



<p>None of her papers seem to have been flagged on PubPeer, besides comments sharing the text of the retraction notices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sampson describes herself as a “Meticulous and analytical Researcher” with more than 15 years of experience in “cancer research, Research Compliance and Safety.” We tried to reach Sampson on LinkedIn and at an email address listed in an online directory but got no response. Her institutional email is no longer active. </p>



<p>One of the retracted papers, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666350320300237">Neointimal hyperplasia after carotid transection and anastomosis surgery is associated with degradation of decorin and platelet-derived growth factor signaling</a>,” appeared in <em>JVS-Vascular Science</em> in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the retraction <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666350324000270">notice</a> posted in October, Sampson contacted the journal and “admitted to manipulating samples and incorrectly reporting of data [sic]” to produce “the desired result.” Her co-authors were unaware of her actions, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other retracted paper, “<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/13358/text/">Integrating mechanisms of response and resistance against the tubulin binding agent Eribulin in preclinical models of osteosarcoma</a>,” appeared in <em>Oncotarget</em> in 2016. It was cited 19 times before it was retracted in October, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/28663/">retraction notice</a>, Sampson “confirmed there was incorrect reporting of data” for seven figures in the paper, including polymerase chain reaction experiments without template controls. The notice also included a statement attributed to Sampson in which she accepted “sole responsibility for the errors and the incorrect reporting of data.”</p>



<p>Kathryn Skeen, a media representative from Nemours, told Retraction Watch Sampson had “self-disclosed” her misconduct to the institution. Following the admission, Nemours launched an investigation into all of Sampson’s published work. During the review, Nemours identified “potential concerns” in several other papers where Sampson is listed as an author, Skeen told us. The institution then notified the journals involved, and those journals have initiated their own investigations into the validity of the research, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skeen declined to share the details about Nemours’ internal investigation, writing that ORI is reviewing the case.</p>

<p>After we reported on a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">new scam</a> to publish papers on webpages remarkably similar to those of Elsevier, Springer, the American Medical Association and other major publishers, the company linked to the clones denied any role in producing the content they contain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until we reached out for comment, the company “<a href="https://www.springergloballtd.com/">Springer Global Publication</a>” – which is not affiliated with Springer Nature – had advertised a variety of services on its website, including finding a writer for research papers, editing manuscripts, developing research proposals, analyzing data and managing the peer review process, a collection of services which is a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">classic attribute of a paper mill</a>. After we emailed them, they removed descriptions of these services from their website, as well as links to papers published in cloned journals, but did not respond before publication of our story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After our story appeared, we received an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SGP-response.pdf">email</a> signed by “Administrator &#8211; Springergloballtd.com,” in which the company said it did not “create, review, or manage the content associated with the identifiers we issue.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company stated:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130466"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We would like to emphasize that our organization is not a publisher, nor do we operate any journals, cloned or otherwise. Our primary role is to provide Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) as a form of online identification for assignments, research papers, and various other digital content at the request of our customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Our responsibility begins and ends with providing identifiers for submitted content, and we do not evaluate, verify, or publish the content ourselves,” the statement continued. “Our clients are responsible for the content they submit and its intended use.”</p>



<p>On a page still available on <a href="https://springergloballtd.com/publication.html">Springer Global&#8217;s website</a>, and archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241123143541/https://springergloballtd.com/publication.html">here</a>, the company lists 16 journals as “Our Publication [sic],” including “<a href="https://springergloballtd.com/JAMA%20Opthalmology.html"><em>JAMA Ophthalmology</em></a>” and several others with titles matching journals from major publishers. The journal pages link to webpages for <a href="https://jamanetwork.international/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/97106/">articles</a> closely resembling the websites of the original publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While we acknowledge that some submissions may contain journal names or designs that resemble those of established publishers, it is important to note that our role does not extend to verifying the authenticity of submitted content,” the company told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company also stated it does not “create, host, or manage the webpages associated with the identifiers.” These pages are “provided to us by our clients, who assume full responsibility for their content and appearance,” it claimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company asked for us to share “specific cases or evidence that indicate misuse of our services.” We provided a list of DOIs published in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">our story</a>, and asked if they would take any action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another email signed by the “Administrator,” the company replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As a relatively new entity in this domain, this situation has been a significant learning experience for us. Through your findings and our subsequent investigations, we have recognized that there were indeed issues that require our immediate attention and corrective action.</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>We are prepared to take any steps necessary to resolve this matter, including the review and possible retraction or correction of any problematic DOIs.</p>
