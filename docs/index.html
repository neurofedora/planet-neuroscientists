<p>An experiment deploying AI-generated messages on a Reddit subforum has drawn criticism for, among other critiques, a lack of informed consent from unknowing participants in the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university overseeing the research is standing by its approval of the study, but has indicated the principal investigator has received a warning for the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The subreddit, r/ChangeMyView (CMV), invites people to post a viewpoint or opinion to invite conversation from different perspectives. Its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_a">extensive rules</a> are intended to keep discussions civil.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131744"></span>



<p>Early Saturday morning, CMV moderators posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/meta_unauthorized_experiment_on_cmv_involving/">a long message about the experiment</a>, designed to study whether large language models, or LLMs, could be used to change views. It began:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The CMV Mod Team needs to inform the CMV community about an unauthorized experiment conducted by researchers from the University of Zurich on CMV users. This experiment deployed AI-generated comments to study how AI could be used to change views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The researchers, who requested anonymity form the subreddit moderators, provided this description of the research:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Over the past few months, we used multiple accounts to posts published on CMV. Our experiment assessed LLM&#8217;s persuasiveness in an ethical scenario, where people ask for arguments against views they hold. In commenting, we did not disclose that an AI was used to write comments, as this would have rendered the study unfeasible. While we did not write any comments ourselves, we manually reviewed each comment posted to ensure they were not harmful.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The researchers’ note continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We recognize that our experiment broke the community rules against AI-generated comments and apologize. We believe, however, that given the high societal importance of this topic, it was crucial to conduct a study of this kind, even if it meant disobeying the rules.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>User accounts created to post AI-generated content posed as a victim of rape, a trauma counselor specializing in abuse, a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter, among other personas, according to the moderators’ post. All user accounts linked to the experiment and listed in the post have been suspended. The Zurich group has <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eo4SHrKGPErTzL1t_QmQhfZGU27jKBjx/view">shared a preliminary writeup</a> of its findings.</p>



<p>“This is one of the worst violations of research ethics I&#8217;ve ever seen,” Casey Fiesler, an information scientist at the University of Colorado, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cfiesler.bsky.social/post/3lnqrpz3qas2r">wrote on Bluesky</a>. “Manipulating people in online communities using deception, without consent, is not ‘low risk’ and, as evidenced by the discourse in this Reddit post, resulted in harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sara Gilbert, research director of the Citizens and Technology Lab at Cornell University, claimed the study has harmed CMV itself. The subreddit has been “an important public sphere for people to engage in debate, learn new things, have their assumptions challenged, and maybe even their minds changed,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sarahagilbert.bsky.social/post/3lnqqhyd6fc2c">wrote on Bluesky</a>. “Are people going to trust that they aren’t engaging with bots? And if they don’t, can the community serve its mission?”</p>



<p>Trust is a theme in some of the 1,500-odd comments on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/meta_unauthorized_experiment_on_cmv_involving/">original r/ChangeMyView post</a>. <a href="https://www.404media.co/researchers-secretly-ran-a-massive-unauthorized-ai-persuasion-experiment-on-reddit-users/">Other</a> <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/unauthorized-experiment-on-cmv/">outlets</a> have weighed in on the project as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to follow-up questions, CMV moderator u/DuhChappers said the experiment violated Reddit’s rule to not impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading manner. “I think it would be a stretch to say that these accounts did not impersonate individuals in a deceptive manner. The bots literally said things like ‘I am a black man and ‘I am a sexual assault survivor’ when those are manifestly untrue,” the moderator wrote in a message to us.</p>



<p>OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, <a href="https://redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-oai-partner">has an agreement with Reddit</a> to use its content to train its models. Earlier this year, OpenAI used content from r/ChangeMyView to test the persuasiveness of its AI models, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-used-this-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion/">TechCrunch reported</a>. This research used “a downloaded copy of r/changemyview data on AI persuasiveness without experimenting on non-consenting human subjects,” the CMV moderators noted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A message sent to the Zurich researchers’ anonymous email account referred us to the University of Zurich media relations office, which did not immediately respond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The moderators stated they have filed a complaint with the University of Zurich’s institutional review board. A response from the university’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences Ethics Commission&nbsp; indicated the matter had been investigated and the principal investigator had been issued a formal warning, according to the moderators.</p>



<p>The moderators had also asked the University of Zurich to block the research from being published. The response from the university noted that is outside their purview. A university response quoted in the post stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;This project yields important insights, and the risks (e.g. trauma etc.) are minimal. This means that suppressing publication is not proportionate to the importance of the insights the study yields.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a follow-up message, the u/DuhChappers pointed to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ideasforcmv/comments/1ibwcns/post_sticky_with_research/m9wdil6/">a list of studies</a> the subreddit has participated in. “We are very happy to provide data and aid to researchers, especially when they approach us beforehand and let us know what they are planning,” the moderator wrote. “The difference in this study is both that the researchers did not ask us before, and that they were actively manipulating members of the subreddit rather than simply observing data. That is a line we cannot accept being crossed.”</p>

                For women with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the decision to start a family can come with a mix of hope, excitement, and uncertainty. How might MS affect pregnancy - and how might pregnancy affect MS? With growing research and evolving clinical guidance, we now know more than ever about this complex relationship. Neave Smith explores what the science says, offering clarity on key considerations before, during, and after pregnancy.

<p>The Canadian National Breast Screening Study conducted in the 1980s and led by researchers at the University of Toronto evaluated the efficacy of breast cancer screening in reducing mortality from breast cancer. Because the research was supposedly a “gold standard” randomized controlled trial, its results, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1336543/">published</a> in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1336544/">academic</a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g366">journals</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/breast-cancer-death-rates-in-canada-didn-t-improve-with-mammograms-1.2532730">reported in the media</a>, have influenced public perceptions and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9230883/">informed</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11233866/">policy</a> on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23074501/">mammography screening</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8105098/">in several countrie</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8105098/">s</a>.</p>



<p>However, over the past decades, flaws in this study have come to light. My colleagues and I learned of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09691413211059461">failures in randomization</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8234686/">we</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7842421/">other</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012720/">researchers</a> have found other <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jbi/article/4/2/135/6555326">serious problems</a>. We think these flaws strongly suggest the publications of CNBSS results should be retracted. Despite being informed of the flaws in this study in 2021, the University of Toronto has not adequately or appropriately addressed these issues.</p>



<p>The CNBSS was configured as two separate randomized clinical trials, one for women in their 40s at entry and the other for women in their 50s. In CNBSS1, 50,000 women ages 40-49 were supposedly randomly assigned to the intervention arm, in which they would receive up to five annual screens with two view film mammography plus clinical breast examination by a nurse, or to the control arm, where they received a single clinical examination at entry and usual care (essentially, no screening) afterwards. In CNBSS2 for 40,000 women, the randomization was between the intervention of mammography plus a clinical breast exam versus clinical exam only.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131733"></span>



<p>When the results of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1423087/">CNBSS1</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1336544/">CNBSS2</a> were first published in 1992, the investigators reported no difference in mortality from breast cancer between the arms in either trial. This finding contrasted with positive results in several other studies. In fact, the investigators initially, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/84.11.832">falsely</a>, claimed screening was leading to excess deaths from breast cancer in the younger women. That claim was eventually <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/84/11/832/929878?redirectedFrom=fulltext">retracted</a>. As well, results from CNBSS were later used by one of its principal investigators to produce <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.06.033">unrealistically high estimates of overdiagnosis</a> attributed to mammography screening.</p>



<p>I and other colleagues have <a href="https://ajronline.org/doi/abs/10.2214/ajr.161.4.8372752">criticized</a> the CNBSS over the years for, among other serious problems, strong indications of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8234686/">bias in randomization</a>. These concerns led to a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012720/">forensic review</a> in 1995 of the randomization of the trial, but, for reasons not entirely clear, the mandate of the review did not include interviewing the staff crucial to the randomization process. The review proved inconclusive and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012723/">left the key question of subversion of randomization open</a>.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2021, my colleagues and I became aware <a href="https://borealisdata.ca/file.xhtml?fileId=211354&amp;version=2.0">of eyewitness evidence</a> staff members had steered some participants with symptoms of breast cancer into the mammography arm of the study. At all but one trial site, all women received a clinical breast examination before getting their study arm allocation. The staff registering the women into the study were aware of the exam results. Entering a woman with significant findings to the intervention arm would assure her of an immediate mammogram.</p>



<p>According to eyewitness testimony, well-meaning staff members could, and did, steer such individuals into the screening arm with the intention of providing a symptomatic woman with an immediate mammogram, without appreciating the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34812692/">consequences for randomization</a> this entailed. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09691413211059461">As we have explained</a>, moving even a few women from their intended random allocation in the control arm to the intervention arm after discovery of palpable abnormalities could shift the trial findings from demonstrating a mortality benefit from screening to suggesting a mortality detriment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of this new evidence, later in 2021 we contacted the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS), whose subsidiary, The National Cancer Institute of Canada, had sponsored the CNBSS. The CCS then approached the University of Toronto, via the Dean of Medicine, informing them of this evidence and requesting a review. In the meantime, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09691413211059461">we published</a> an article describing the evidence for subversion of randomization.</p>



<p>After several months with no response from the university, we followed with a letter to the university’s Research Ethics Board. Eventually we were informed that the matter had been referred to the Office of Research Integrity, which is the responsibility of the Vice President of Research and Innovation of the University of Toronto. Finally, in December of 2021 we were told that our concerns would be investigated and an external three-member panel would be appointed to do this. This was not consistent with the university’s established framework for investigations of research ethical issues.</p>



<p>After another long gap, we learned on June 14, 2022, the panel members had been selected by Lorraine Ferris, the associate vice president of research and innovation at the University of Toronto. Two of the members of this committee, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24519765/">Mette Kalager</a> and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1401875">Peter Jüni</a>, had previously been on record supporting the results of the CNBSS and in one case, had co-published on issues around screening with one of the trial’s principal investigators. If CNBSS were to be invalidated, both of these individuals would have to reverse pointed statements they had made publicly. We were surprised the university&nbsp; would appoint either of these individuals to the committee, given their clear conflicts of interest (for the same reason, that these panel members did not immediately recuse themselves also was surprising).</p>



<p>We immediately raised these concerns to Prof. Ferris. In her response, she stated the investigation would go forward with this panel. She said it was challenging to find suitably qualified panel members for such a review. We explained our concerns regarding subversion of a randomized control trial do not require people with specific expertise in breast cancer screening studies to resolve them; it is largely a matter of consideration of proper conduct of any such study.</p>



<p>In a follow-up letter, we indicated we would continue to protest the process the university had chosen to investigate our concerns and to push for a more appropriately constituted panel. At the same time, we agreed to be interviewed by whatever review panel was appointed by the university. We did not want, by refusing to cooperate, to provide an excuse for the university to back away from its responsibility to conduct an investigation. On Aug. 2, 2022, we received a response from Prof. Ferris that she was unwilling to reconsider the composition of the panel.</p>



<p>The panel did interviews by Zoom in the Fall of 2022, including one with me. But the witness list was not made available to those of us who had raised the initial concerns, nor have the statements made by the various witnesses been shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, we were informed by Professor Ferris that she expected the review to be completed by March of 2024. However, that date passed without event. We requested a meeting with the current Provost, Trevor Young, and that was arranged for March 28 of last year. Professors Ferris and Leah Cohen, vice president of research and innovation, and strategic initiatives, were also scheduled to attend. The meeting was abruptly cancelled by the Provost on the afternoon of March 26. We have heard nothing since.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a></a>This is not the first time the University of Toronto has delayed or failed in fulfilling its responsibilities to safeguard the ethical conduct of medical research.&nbsp; Notably, in the late 1990s, Nancy Olivieri, a hematologist clinician researcher conducting a study with an industrial collaborator to evaluate a new drug for treating thalassemia, observed adverse effects on patients. When she attempted to discontinue the study and voice her concerns, she was faced with intense harassment by the pharmaceutical manufacturer and by some of her academic colleagues. Her request for intervention from the university –- which was in the midst of negotiating a $20 million building donation from the manufacturer &#8212; did not receive an adequate response. Ultimately the matter had to go to an <a href="https://www.caut.ca/docs/af-reports-indepedent-committees-of-inquiry/the-olivieri-report.pdf">external review</a>, which vindicated her.</p>



<p>At this point, almost four years have elapsed since we brought our concerns to the attention of the University of Toronto and, as far as we can see, nothing has happened. Perhaps the long delay in the review suggests that, in light of overwhelming evidence, the university is no longer able to credibly support the conduct or the results of the CNBSS. Or perhaps it means that by delaying its review, the university hopes the problem will go away.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a>The CNBSS has influenced policy and opinions of primary healthcare providers and women, discouraged opportunities for earlier detection of cancer, and, in turn, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11696453/">resulted in delays in cancer detection</a>. The publications of results from CNBSS must be retracted.</p>

                <p>It is fascinating how much data quality can vary between different calcium imaging data sets. In this blog post, I will discuss a metric to quantify and compare data quality and in particular shot noise between calcium imaging datasets.</p>



<p>This variation of data quality depends on potential artifacts due to movement or instrument noise, the frame rate of the microscope, and the flux of fluorescence photons. The photon flux determines the shot noise level for each neuron and therefore whether calcium transients due to action potentials can be detected from the recording. Photon flux depends on factors such as neuron size (in pixels), indicator expression levels, and baseline brightness. As a result, it varies not only between recordings but also across neurons within the same session.</p>

<p>In our 2021 study on spike inference from calcium imaging data with CASCADE (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5">Rupprecht et al., 2021</a>), we took advantage of the fact that the slow calcium signal is typically very similar between adjacent frames. Therefore, the noise level can be approximated by</p>

<p>The median excludes outliers due to fast onset dynamics of calcium signals. Normalization by the square root of the frame rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="f_r" class="latex" /> makes the metric comparable across datasets with different frame rates. (I have discussed the application of this metric to various datasets in an <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/10/04/large-scale-calcium-imaging-noise-levels/">earlier blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>However, this metric is to some degree biased, as it assumes the ideal scenario of zero neuron activity. In the presence of neuronal activity, however, the ups and downs of calcium transients will increase the apparent noise level systematically. Recently, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mnLnd6cAAAAJ">David Hildebrand</a> brought up this issue, and I decided to look into it more carefully.</p>



<p>I used ground-truth spike patterns from electrophysiological recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons (mouse visual cortex, see <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641129v2.full">Fig.2 Suppl.1</a>), convolved them with a linear calcium kernel, and added Gaussian noise of known magnitude. Then, I quantified how precisely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> was able to recover the true noise value.</p>



<p><em>First</em>, the metric generally overestimated the true noise level by about 20%. This overestimation was largely independent of the noise level but slightly increased for lower noise level. This makes sense: the relative effect of the same amount of a fixed level of neuronal activity is greater when the baseline noise is zero. However, the overall effect was relatively small &#8211; 20% is not dramatic for such a coarse metric:</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, for low frame rates, the overestimation became more substantial, reaching up to 50% on average for a frame rate of 1-2 Hz. This is a significant bias that should be kept in mind. If you use the metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> to quantitatively compare between recordings of different frame rates. it may be good to correct for this bias. In most other cases, this effect is likely negligible:</p>

<p><em>Finally</em>, the overestimation also depended on the true spike rate of the respective recording. In the plot below, each point represents the quantification derived from the ground truth recording of an individual neuron with a its specific spike rate. As one would expect, the overestimation of noise levels is minimial for neurons that are almost silent, and grows almost linearly with the true spike rate:</p>

<p>Altogether, I still believe that the standardized noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> is a very useful (and probably under-used) metric to compare data quality across recordings. The above analyses provide context that should ideally be considered for quantitative comparisons &#8211; by quantifying how much the metric is affected by noise level, frame rate and individual spike rate.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about his work in the presentation entitled &quot;Understanding structure-function mapping in small spiking neural networks.&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We know that the precise timing of spikes represents information in spiking neuronal
networks. However, the information processing in spiking networks is not yet fully
understood. One way to understand the working mechanism of a spiking network is to
associate the structural connectivity of the network with the corresponding functional
behaviour. In this journal club, I will begin with an introduction to different spiking
neuron models and their properties. Then I’ll talk about the evolution of small spiking
neural networks for temporal pattern recognition tasks. In the second half, we will
discuss the structure-function mapping in spiking neural networks evolved or created to
perform a computational task.</p>

<p>An expert in AI at Google has admitted he used the technology to help write a preprint manuscript that commenters on PubPeer found to contain a slew of AI-generated phrases like “squared blunder” and “info picture.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11218v1">Leveraging GANs For Active Appearance Models Optimized Model Fitting</a>,” appeared on arXiv.org in January but was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11218">withdrawn</a> April 7. The author, <a href="https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Anurag-Awasthi-Engineering-Lead-AI-AInfrastructure-Google/acb5115b-1224-4a94-a97c-d9e0aa35cdd0">Anurag Awasthi</a>, is an engineering lead in AI infrastructure at Google. In a PubPeer comment, he described the paper as a “personal learning exercise.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2025, sleuth Guillaume Cabanac, creator of the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1::::::">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, pointed out in a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F19A87982B29CB5C819040BFD7E8EA">PubPeer comment</a> the paper included several tortured phrases. These phrases indicate AI use and occur when large language models try to find synonyms for common phrases. In Awasthi’s paper, “linear regression” became “straight relapse,” and “error rate” became “blunder rate,” among others.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131717"></span>



<p>Awasthi replied to the comment saying “phrasing issues were unintentional artifacts from an earlier revision where automated tools were used to rephrase for variety.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another PubPeer comment pointed out similarities between Awasthi’s preprint and a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-016-0916-3">2016 paper</a> by different authors. Aside from containing similar structure, Awasthi’s paper uses much of the same language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Awasthi again replied on PubPeer reiterating the overlap was an “unintended artifact.” His comment reads, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This preprint was intended to explore a new idea—to the best of my knowledge—and I shared it early to test its relevance. The project initially began as a personal learning exercise but sensing a possible novelty, turned into a publication attempt. The layout and literature review, drafted with the help of AI-assisted tools, ended up too close in phrasing to earlier work—particularly the one you&#8217;ve highlighted.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After receiving further criticism about the undisclosed AI use, Awasthi replied that he “clearly underestimated the seriousness of preprints.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He responded to our request for comment by directing us to the Google press office, which did not respond.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Scientific Reports</em> has retracted a controversial paper claiming to present evidence an ancient city in the Middle East was destroyed by an exploding celestial body – an event the authors suggested could have inspired the Biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision comes two years after <em>Scientific Reports,</em> a Springer Nature title, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/21/journal-investigating-sodom-comet-paper-for-data-problems/">published an editor’s note</a> informing readers the journal was looking into concerns about the data and conclusions in the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The then-pending <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99265-5">retraction</a> was the subject of an April 10 <a href="https://cosmictusk.com/nature-scientific-retractions/">blog post</a> by one of the paper’s authors, George Howard, who called the journal’s decision to remove the article “a profoundly disappointing and frankly disgusting turn of events.” </p>



<span id="more-131710"></span>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/01/criticism-engulfs-paper-claiming-an-asteroid-destroyed-biblical-sodom-and-gomorrah/">Criticism</a> of the article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3">A Tunguska sized airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam a Middle Bronze Age city in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea</a>,” began soon after its publication in September 2021. Between critiques, questions, and the authors’ responses, the article has garnered <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#187">187 comments</a> on PubPeer, outpacing the 19 scholarly citations recorded in Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors have corrected the article twice. In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06266-9">February 2022</a> correction, they acknowledged “inappropriate” manipulation of several dozen figures, which sleuth Elisabeth Bik had <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143#4">flagged on PubPeer</a>, and published the original images. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35266-6">May 2023</a> correction updated a figure sourced from physicist Mark Boslough, who said the authors had mislabeled and misinterpreted it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boslough coauthored a Matters Arising commentary, published April 22, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-98362-9">describing “errors” in the work</a> that “have led to assertions of evidence that do not appear to be supported by the data, and to conclusions that are not factually supported.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six of the paper’s authors wrote a response, which the journal did not publish but Howard included in his blog post. “We agree with the points raised” in the Matters Arising commentary, they wrote, “with the clarification that none of their comments are relevant to the conclusion” of the original article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors’ response reiterated the “high-temperature melted pottery and melted surficial sediment” they had reported at the site. An earlier Matters Arising, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08216-x">March 2022</a>, questioned whether those findings could be the result of ancient smelting technologies rather than a fireball from space. “The observations and data presented here do not meet the well-established criteria for documenting evidence of an extraterrestrial event,” the critics concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Obviously, I and the other coauthors strongly disagree with the retraction,” Allen West, the corresponding author of the paper, told us. “A small but vocal group of scientists has actively sought to stifle discussion on the Tall el-Hammam airburst. Such actions undermine the principles of scientific inquiry.”</p>



<p>West said the authors would republish the original article with new data. “The critics thought that they could suppress this discussion, but they failed,” he said. “We are simply going around them so that the debate about these extremely dangerous airbursts can continue.”</p>



<p>Boslough has been in contact with Rafal Marszalek, chief editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, about the paper since soon after its publication. Boslough called the journal’s system of handling concerns “opaque,” with all decisions “made behind closed doors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement to us, Marszalek called the questions about the paper “a complex case for which differing concerns emerged over many months, with the final concerns raised undermining the conclusions of the paper and necessitating retraction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Throughout the process, in line with COPE guidelines, our focus was solely on responsibly assessing the validity of the conclusions of the paper, and never on the ideological positions of any of the parties involved,” Marszalek said in the statement. “We would like to thank all those that contributed their time and expertise throughout the process.”</p>



<p>“I think the pattern of problems revealed on PubPeer were overwhelming,” Boslough said, starting with the image manipulation Bik observed. “Their evidence simply didn’t support their conclusions, and they withheld most of the data that they claimed provided the basis for many of their graphs, maps, and age interpretations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boslough anticipates the retraction will lead to more scrutiny of the <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180/">group’s other, also controversial, work</a>, such as a 2007 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0706977104">paper</a> in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> claiming to present evidence of an extraterrestrial impact about 13,000 years ago they say led to the extinction of wooly mammoths and the Clovis culture in North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other papers “have similar problems with lack of transparency, missing or nonexistent evidence, and basic misunderstandings of the physics associated with impacts and airbursts,” Boslough said.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/allen_gao_uc_davis.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="716" height="492" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/allen_gao_uc_davis.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131707" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/allen_gao_uc_davis.jpg 716w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/allen_gao_uc_davis-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Allen Gao</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A lead researcher at UC Davis has lost three decades-old papers from the same journal for image duplication, and the journal says it is investigating more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/urology/research/faculty_research/allen.html">Allen Gao</a>, director of research for the Department of Urologic Surgery at the institution is <s>first</s> last and corresponding author on the papers, published in <em>The Prostate</em>. </p>



<p>The journal retracted the articles – published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pros.10110">2002</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pros.20045">2004</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pros.20865">2009</a> – in&nbsp; February. The papers have been cited 42, 71, and 27 times respectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<span id="more-131706"></span>



<p>All three notices reference a third party who alerted the journal to image duplication issues. The retraction notices for the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pros.24872">2002</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pros.24874">2009</a> papers also reference image reuse by different articles with some of the same authors. “Each article in which these images appear describes different experimental conditions,” the 2002 notice reads.</p>



<p>Gao did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes <em>The Prostate,</em> told Retraction Watch the journal was investigating “additional concerns flagged via PubPeer associated with” Gao.</p>



<p>Sleuth Elisabeth Bik pointed out image irregularities on PubPeer for two of the retracted papers, although the Wiley spokesperson did not respond to our question about whether the third party listed in the notices referenced these comments. Gao has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=allen+c.+gao">more than 20 papers with comments</a> on PubPeer, most of which reference image manipulation and duplication concerns, with <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2025/02/21/schneider-shorts-21-02-2025-i-reviewed-the-facts-and-could-not-find-any-scientific-misconduct/#gao">several described</a> on the blog For Better Science.</p>



<p>The three retracted papers share coauthor Soo Ok Lee, a former researcher with the University of Rochester. Lee and Gao were affiliated with the same universities at the time of each publication. Lee has four previous <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dLee%252c%2bSoo%2bOk">retractions</a> in the Retraction Watch database, as well as six corrections and an expression of concern, all related to image issues, several of which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/01/04/university-of-rochester-cancer-researchers-included-incorrect-images-in-13-papers-committee-finds/">we previously reported</a>. Lee did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two papers by Lee and Gao have been amended in <em>Oncogene</em>, a Springer Nature title. One article, published in 2003, received an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-021-02034-7">expression of concern</a> for image duplication and shared images with one of the newly retracted papers, according to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pros.24872">the notice</a>. The other, a 2023 paper, received a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-025-03392-2">correction</a> on April 10 for “inadvertent” image duplication.</p>



<p>A representative for UC Davis told us the university was “conducting a review of this matter” but was “unable to comment on specific allegations at this time.”</p>



<p><em>Correction, April 28, 2025: Gao was the last and corresponding author on the three papers, not the first author, as originally stated. </em></p>
