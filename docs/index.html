              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/roman-empire-cold-climate-plague-archaeology">Cold, dry snaps accompanied three plagues that struck the Roman Empire</a></h4>

              
                <p>For those who enjoy pondering the Roman Empire’s rise and fall — you know who you are — consider the close link between ancient climate change and infectious disease outbreaks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Periods of increasingly cooler temperatures and rainfall declines <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coincided with three pandemics that struck the Roman Empire</a>, historian Kyle Harper and colleagues report January 26 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Reasons for strong associations between cold, dry phases and those disease outbreaks are poorly understood. But the findings, based on climate reconstructions from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 600, help “us see that climate stress probably contributed to the spread and severity of [disease] mortality,” says Harper, of the University of Oklahoma in Norman.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-3" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-3">Harper has previously</span> argued that the First Plague Pandemic (also known as the Justinianic Plague), combined with declining global temperatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-ancient-plagues-pandemics-lessons-society" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to weaken the Roman Empire</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new findings reinforce an idea that climate shifts can influence the origin and spread of infectious diseases, says Princeton University historian John Haldon. But it’s unclear whether a range of factors in the ancient Roman realm, including long-distance trade networks and densely populated settlements, heightened people’s vulnerability to disease outbreaks, says Haldon, who did not participate in the new study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To reconstruct the ancient climate, marine palynologist Karin Zonneveld and colleagues turned to an extensive sample of fossilized dinoflagellates. These single-celled algae had been preserved in radiocarbon-dated slices from a sediment core previously extracted in southern Italy’s Gulf of Taranto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dinoflagellates live in the sunlit upper part of the sea. Different species of this organism assume signature shapes in the late summer and autumn before settling on the ocean floor. Some species live only in cold waters, others only in warm waters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late summer and autumn, water temperature in the Gulf of Taranto closely aligns with southern Italy’s air temperature, says Zonneveld, of the University of Bremen in Germany. Her group tracked changes in the composition of dinoflagellate species in sediment slices to estimate late summer/autumn temperatures in southern Italy during the Roman Empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also used dinoflagellates to gauge changes in ancient rainfall. Plentiful rainfall in central and northern Italy causes rivers to discharge nutrient-rich water into the Gulf of Taranto. Dinoflagellate species known to rely on plentiful nutrients thrive under those conditions and end up on the sea floor. Other dinoflagellate species prefer nutrient-poor water. Their preservation in underwater sediment reflects stretches of scant rainfall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dinoflagellate analysis revealed that warm, stable temperatures and regular rainfall occurred from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 100, Zonneveld says. That time corresponds to the Roman Warm Period, a time of political and social stability for the Roman Empire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, phases of increasingly cold and dry conditions occurred shortly before or during three pandemics: the Antonine Plague, which spread from Egypt to Europe and the British Isles in the late 160s; the Plague of Cyprian, which struck during a time of Roman political turmoil in the mid-200s; and the Justinianic Plague, which reached Italy by 543. By the late 500s, average temperatures were about 3 degrees Celsius colder than the highest averages during the Roman Warm Period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unclear how high death rates climbed during these disease outbreaks and how they might factor into the fall of the empire. The Roman Empire’s power and influence fell dramatically by around the time of the Justinianic Plague, though the eastern half of the empire lasted until the fall of its capital in Constantinople in 1453.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And despite providing valuable new climate information from ancient Roman times, neither Zonnefeld’s team nor anyone else can say with certainty how temperature and rainfall shifts may have aided the spread of infectious diseases, says classical archaeologist Brandon McDonald of the University of Basel in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s known that the Justinianic Plague was caused by the Black Death bacterium <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, specific disease-causing agents for the Antonine Plague and the Plague of Cyprian remain unknown, McDonald says, further muddying attempts to explain how climate may have influenced those events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Economic and social historian Colin Elliott notes that many infectious microbes flourish under cold, dry conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

As a result, hungry people in the Italian countryside may have migrated to cities where imported grain was available, says Elliott, of Indiana University in Bloomington. “Diseases moved with migrants, but surges of malnourished and immunologically [vulnerable] populations into cities almost certainly increased pandemic virulence as well.”&nbsp;</p>

The milder climate may have impaired or killed temperature-sensitive mosquitoes that regularly transmitted the dangerous disease in southern Italy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The journal <em>Cureus </em>has retracted 56 papers nearly two years after it first began to suspect the works were of dubious lineage.</p>



<p>Cureus – an open access journal founded in 2009 and <a href="https://group.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/springer-nature-acquires-cureus/23793592">acquired by Springer Nature in 2022</a> – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/04/29/journal-issues-55-expressions-of-concern-at-once/">slapped 55 of the papers with expressions of concern</a> in April 2022. At that time, at least one author said they didn’t know anything about the work and <em>Cureus </em>noted the “articles were submitted and subsequently published purportedly as an effort coordinated by Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University to ensure all medical interns publish at least one peer-reviewed article in order to qualify for enrollment in a postgraduate residency program as stipulated by The Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS).”</p>



<p>At the time, <em>Cureus</em>’ founding editor in chief John Adler told us “The investigation has been frustratingly slow due to the relative unresponsiveness of Saudi gov officials.” Apparently, that remained the case. This week, the journal retracted 56 studies. All of the retraction notices read the same way:</p>



<span id="more-128650"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. Concerns were raised regarding the identity of the authors on this article. Specifically, Faisal Alhaway and Malak Shammari have stated that they were added to this article without their knowledge or approval. The identity of the other authors could also not be verified. As the appropriate authorship of this work cannot be established, the Editors-in-Chief no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions of this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Springer Nature why the move had taken nearly two years. Graham Parker-Finger, <em>Cureus</em>’ director of publishing and customer services, told us through a spokesperson:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We agree that editorial action on problematic content should happen as quickly as possible, but we need to ensure we are acting responsibly and appropriately.  Our initial investigation attempts stalled after we experienced protracted difficulties in communicating with the relevant parties.  Although all of the articles were reviewed by at least one independent peer reviewer and underwent several rounds of journal editorial review, based on the lack of follow-up and inability to connect with anyone related to the case, the journal made the decision to publish an expression of concern for each article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adler told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After a dozen or so failed attempts to communicate with Saudi Government authorities over the better part of a year, we decided to retract all these articles. The editorial team could not convince ourselves that anything in these articles was wrong, but neither could we vouch for their authenticity, especially with the primary authors simply vanishing. The circumstances here are so peculiar given the seeming lack of any clear motivation by the authors and the ghosting of us by Saudi authorities. So out of an abundance of caution we made the decision to retract and just move on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Parker-Finger continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is our position that our primary responsibility is to the public (and more specifically, the scientific community) to only publish credible medical science. While the authorship issues are undoubtedly suspicious, the journal still has no reason to doubt the scientific accuracy of the articles, which contributed to the delay to act as we worked through the most appropriate course of action. At the time these decisions were made, the journal was also engaged in acquisition talks with Springer Nature and we determined that the best course of action would be to work with Springer Nature’s research integrity and legal resources on next steps, given the level of uncertainty regarding the situation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He said the journal has “undertaken a number of activities to prevent a similar situation occurring in future:”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our system now has an automated function for the identification and rejection of submissions that include authors with illegitimate email domains such as <a href="http://boximail.com/">boximail.com</a>.  It also sends an automated notification to senior editorial staff if one author submits multiple submissions over a short period and these cases will be followed by inquiry and, if needed, full investigation.  Our submissions editors have been trained to identify and flag suspicious publishing activity of this type and senior editorial staff have been thoroughly briefed on details of case for awareness and advice on appropriate steps to take including contacting department leadership to authenticate identities.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parrot-intelligence-smart-brain-behavior">What parrots can teach us about human intelligence</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Bruce the kea is missing his upper beak, giving the olive green parrot a look of perpetual surprise. But scientists are the astonished ones.</p>



<p>The typical kea (<em>Nestor notabilis</em>) sports a long, sharp beak, perfect for digging insects out of rotten logs or ripping roots from the ground in New Zealand’s alpine forests. Bruce has been missing the upper part of his beak since at least 2012, when he was rescued as a fledgling and sent to live at the Willowbank Wildlife Reserve in Christchurch.</p>



<p>The defect prevents Bruce from foraging on his own. Keeping his feathers clean should also be an impossible task. In 2021, when comparative psychologist Amalia Bastos arrived at the reserve with colleagues to study keas, the zookeepers reported something odd: Bruce had seemingly figured out how to use small stones to preen.</p>



<p>“We were like, ‘Well that’s weird,’ ” says Bastos, of Johns Hopkins University.</p>



<p>Over nine days, the team kept a close eye on Bruce, quickly taking videos if he started cleaning his feathers. Bruce, it turned out, had indeed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97086-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invented his own work-around to preen</a>, the researchers reported in 2021 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>First, Bruce selects the proper tool, rolling pebbles around in his mouth with his tongue and spitting out candidates until he finds one that he likes, usually something pointy. Next, he holds the pebble between his tongue and lower beak. Then, he picks through his feathers.</p>



<p>“It’s crazy because the behavior was not there from the wild,” Bastos says. When Bruce arrived at Willowbank, he was too young to have learned how to preen. And no other bird in the aviary uses pebbles in this way. “It seems like he just innovated this tool use for himself,” she says.</p>



<p>Tool use is just one of parrots’ many talents. The birds are famous for emulating, and perhaps sometimes even understanding, human speech. Some species can also solve complex puzzles, like how to invade a secured trash bin, or practice self-control. Such abilities, on par with some primates, have earned parrots a place alongside members of the crow family as the “feathered apes.”</p>



<p>For a concept as abstract as intelligence, it’s challenging to develop a concrete definition that applies across animals. But researchers often point to features once thought to make humans special — enhanced learning, memory, attention and motor control — as signs of advanced cognition. Many of these capabilities are definitely seen in parrots, as well as in the crow family, and other animals like chimpanzees, dolphins and elephants.</p>



<p>“The question is, why is this kind of intelligence evolving multiple times?” says Theresa Rössler, a cognitive biologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna.</p>



<p>Exploring the parallels between parrots and people could provide clues. “Parrots are our evolutionary mirror image,” behavioral ecologist Antone Martinho-Truswell wrote in his 2022 book, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-parrot-in-the-mirror-how-evolving-to-be-like-birds-makes-us-human-antone-martinho-truswell/17417050?ean=9780198846109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Parrot in the Mirror</a></em>. With powerful brains and a proclivity for words, these birds are “the very best example,” he writes, of “nature’s ‘other try’ at a humanlike intelligence.”</p>



<p>It’s taken decades for cognitive scientists to realize this, says Irene Pepperberg, a parrot researcher and comparative psychologist at Boston University. At first glance, parrot brains look quite simple. And given the obvious physical differences and the fact that birds and humans last shared a common ancestor more than 300 million years ago, parrots are not an obvious candidate to help researchers understand human intelligence.</p>



<p>“When I started this work in the ’70s, my first grant proposal came back literally asking me what I was smoking,” Pepperberg says. That’s when she started working with Alex, an African gray parrot who, by the time of his death in 2007, had become renowned for his extensive vocabulary and knowledge of shapes, colors and even math.</p>



<p>Further supporting Pepperberg’s pioneering work, a slew of studies over the last decade highlight parrot smarts — and what these brilliant birds may teach us about how humanlike intelligence can emerge.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A vast skill set</h4>



<p>Parrots’ most well-known talent is their affinity for spoken words. Proficiency varies among species, but African grays (<em>Psittacus erithacus</em>) are particularly good at picking up words and speaking clearly, Pepperberg says.</p>



<p>These parrots <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24335-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can repeat up to 600 different words</a>, researchers reported in 2022 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. While some parrots simply mimic words, it is possible to train birds such as Alex, who had a vocabulary of more than 100 words, to communicate with people.</p>



<p>“It’s not like you can actually sit there and ask them, ‘Why did you do that? What were you thinking?’ ” Pepperberg says. “But because you can [train them to communicate], you can ask them the same types of questions that you ask young children.” Another one of her African grays, for example, can request time alone by saying “Wanna go back.”</p>



<p>Many of parrots’ other cognitive triumphs have come to light only more recently.</p>



<p>Like Bruce the kea, a variety of other parrots are also capable of incredible feats with a tool in claw or beak. Hyacinth macaws (<em>Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus</em>) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15248094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crack open nuts</a> by holding pieces of wood in their beak or foot to keep the food in just the right position. Palm cockatoos (<em>Probosciger aterrimus</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-male-palm-cockatoos-drumsticks">craft drumsticks and rock out</a> to attract mates. Goffin’s cockatoos (<em>Cacatua goffiniana</em>) can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoos-tool-kit-national-park">recognize individual tools as being part of a set</a>, the only animals other than chimpanzees and humans known to do so (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 12</em>).</p>

Figaro grabs both tools before flying to the box, a sign that he recognizes the tools as part of a set.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Overall, 11 of the nearly 400 parrot species, or about 3 percent, have been documented in scientific studies using tools. Crowdsourcing from YouTube videos, Bastos and colleagues <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.14.553302v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncovered 17 more tool-using species</a>, bringing the total to 28. After plotting the known tool users onto an evolutionary tree, the team estimates that 11 to 17 percent of parrot species may use tools.</p>



<p>Because the ability is more widespread across species than previously thought and found in all but one of the parrot families, it’s possible that tool use originated with the very first parrot, which lived more than 50 million years ago, Bastos argues. Why all the parrots in one major group, the family that includes common pet species like lovebirds and lorikeets, might have lost this proficiency is unclear.</p>



<p>“I’m hoping that future research can reveal why on Earth this one family of parrots doesn’t do it, whereas [every other family] seems to,” Bastos says.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, other researchers are investigating more subtle skills. Some parrots, for example, can practice restraint.</p>



<p>Griffin, one of Pepperberg’s current African grays, can pass a version of the marshmallow test. In the human version, children are offered a marshmallow as an immediate treat but are promised more if they can wait until later to devour it. Offered nuts instead of a marshmallow, Griffin can wait up to 15 minutes for better or more rewards, just like many preschoolers. Exactly what such self-discipline reveals about intelligence is debated, but self-control in humans may be a factor in decision making and planning for the future.</p>



<p>Among humans, how much trust people have in others and other factors such as socioeconomic status can influence responses to the marshmallow test. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fcom0000361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Different African grays also respond differently</a>, Pepperberg and colleagues reported in August in the <em>Journal of Comparative Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>A parrot named Pepper started out waiting for a larger treat, Pepperberg says. “Then she realized, ‘Wait a minute, if I take the smaller treats [really quickly], I get to go back to playing with my human, and I prefer that to the [big] treat.’ ”</p>



<p>Unlike Griffin, who receives near-constant interaction with people, Pepper is often left to her own devices. Because Pepper spends more time alone, perhaps she considers it unacceptable or unpleasant to wait to take a treat when people in the room are ignoring her.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The beauty of a bird brain</h4>



<p>A bird’s brain looks nothing like a primate’s. Most primate brains have curves and crinkles that twist into the elaborate patterns of the cerebral cortex. The nerve cells packed within these wrinkles help people think, remember and learn. A bird brain, on the other hand, “looks like a blob of protoplasm,” the jellylike substance that fills cells, Pepperberg says. Because of this simple-looking brain, it was long thought that to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/five-species-show-why-bird-brain-stupid-phrase">have a bird brain was to be stupid</a>.</p>



<p>But Pepperberg knew that was wrong. When she gave scientific talks in the 1980s about parrot accomplishments, people would say, “But it can’t be happening, there’s no cerebral cortex,” she recalls. “I was like, you’re the neurobiologists. Go find it.”</p>



<p>By the early 2000s, scientists had discovered that, in fact, parts of the avian brain are akin to the mammalian neocortex, the largest part of the cerebral cortex. Subsequent work has found that, compared with mammals, avian brains have “a higher total number of neurons for the same amount of skull space,” says neurobiologist and geneticist Erich Jarvis of Rockefeller University in New York City.</p>



<p>Parrot brains <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517131113#sec-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are especially densely packed</a>. Some species even have more neurons than some large-brained primates. This density may facilitate the formation of brain circuits not found in other animals, Jarvis says.</p>



<p>One of those circuits seems to be a major information highway comparable to one in human brains, says comparative neuro­biologist Cristián Gutiérrez-Ibáñez of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.</p>



<p>Human brains transfer information from the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum — a “little brain” at the back of the skull that in part coordinates movement — through clusters of neurons known as the pontine nuclei. This connection is crucial for cognitive functions like learning how to talk or making tools.</p>



<p>In birds, the similar pathway <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28301-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connects the avian equivalent of the neocortex to the cerebellum</a>, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez and colleagues reported in 2018 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. In addition to the pontine nuclei, birds shunt information through a second conduit, the SpM. It’s unclear what info gets transmitted via the SpM, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez says. But among birds, the parrot SpM is particularly large in size — a tantalizing hint that it may contribute to parrot intelligence.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Information highway</h3>



<p>Human and parrot brains look different but share a brain circuit that coordinates higher cognitive abilities. In this pathway, the cerebral cortex, or the avian equivalent, sends information to the cerebellum (pink arrows) via clusters of neurons called the pontine nuclei. Birds have an additional connection that shunts info via a conduit called the SpM, which is particularly big in parrots and might contribute to their brainpower.</p>

<p>Parrot and human brains <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218314179" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also share genetic underpinnings</a>, a team of researchers including Jarvis and behavioral neurobiologist Claudio Mello reported in 2018 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Parrots have acquired duplicate copies of various genes, some of which are known to be important for brain development and speech in people, says Mello, of Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. More copies could mean more ability. But parrot smarts may come down to how genes in the brain are regulated in addition to gaining more or new genes. Unlike other studied birds, parrots have genetic mutations in regions of DNA that provide instructions to switch genes on or off, perhaps to activate certain genes crucial for brain function and cognition.</p>



<p>This is reminiscent of humans, Mello says. We have mutations in these same gene regulators while other apes don’t. In us, the changes allow the regulators to kick-start genes related to growing big forebrains, a region important for complex cognition. If the same is true in parrots, it could point to a shared evolutionary process for humanlike intelligence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The evolution of intelligence</h4>



<p>To figure out the evolutionary origins of parrots’ brainpower, scientists have to go way back — all the way to the mass extinction that ended the Age of Dinosaurs. In the aftermath, as modern avian groups emerged, some birds rapidly evolved big brains.</p>



<p>That’s what paleontologist Daniel Ksepka and colleagues found by analyzing the skull casts of more than 2,000 living bird species, 22 extinct bird species and 12 nonavian dinosaurs. A large brain relative to body size is one indication, albeit imperfect, that an animal might be intelligent. Parrots, as well as members of the crow family, ended up with some of the largest brains of any birds.</p>



<p>Dinosaurs and early birds <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30430-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had similar sized brains relative to their bodies</a>, the researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Current Biology</em>. By the time of the mass extinction 66 million years ago, both groups were already beginning to form forebrains. Rapid environmental change in the wake of the asteroid impact that may have sparked the mass extinction could have pushed some avian brains further on the fast track to growth, says Ksepka, of the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn.</p>



<p>“The day after [impact] is going to be really hard,” he says. And then came forest fires and changes in the atmosphere and temperature as dust blocked out the sun.</p>



<p>Adaptable animals with relatively large brains — a group that probably included parrot ancestors — may have had a leg up over those without. Animals that figure out how to open pinecones with their beaks, say, will do better than the ones waiting for the next crop of berries that might never come, Ksepka says.</p>



<p>Today, having a big brain is just one thing humans and parrots have in common. In general, they also share long lives, monogamy and learning to sing or talk from others, a trait known as vocal learning. Researchers are investigating how these traits might relate to the evolution of intelligence. Right now, there are more hypotheses than answers.</p>



<p>For example, one line of thinking suggests vocal learning and a need for complex forms of communication may have paved the way to greater intelligence. Parrots “have very large, flexible vocal repertoires,” says behavioral ecologist Lucy Aplin of the University of Zurich and Australian National University in Canberra. “They can learn new vocalizations throughout their lives.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear what most parrot calls mean. But some parrots make signature sounds that declare who they are or what groups they belong to, Aplin says. If parrot talkativeness is indeed a driver of cognition, “that then begs the question, why do they need such complex communication, which then ties it back to their social systems,” she says.</p>



<p>Parrots live in large, cohesive groups. So having a good memory and enhanced intelligence may help the birds maintain relationships and strategically climb up the social ladder. Sulphur-crested cockatoos (<em>Cacatua galerita</em>), for instance, live in groups of hundreds of individuals yet maintain hierarchies that don’t seem to be based on physical characteristics. “The assumption is that they must be doing it based on memory, which is a big cognitive load,” Aplin says.</p>



<p>The possible connection between big brains and parrots’ social natures is a question that Aplin’s team is beginning to explore using MRIs of parrot brains. The goal, she says, is to identify how brain size as a whole — as well as regions particularly important in cognition — vary among species that differ in level of sociality.</p>



<p>In the case of songbirds, species with more complex vocal skills are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-complex-vocal-skills-problem-solvers">better at solving cognitive puzzles in the lab</a>, Jarvis and colleagues reported in September in <em>Science</em>. Jarvis, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, speculates that the same is probably true among parrots.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Birds with more complex vocal skills are better at problem-solving | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pI2-AfLzgJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">More than 200 birds from 23 species were given different cognitive tests to gauge their intelligence. One of the problem-solving tasks asked birds to pull a cork lid off a glass flask to access a tasty treat (bottom left). Comparing these tests with birds’ ability to learn songs and calls showed that the better vocal learners are also better at problem-solving.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Parrots and songbirds, as well as humans, have neural circuits involved in song and speech that evolved from nearby pathways that control body movements. Instead of controlling muscles that move wings or arms, the circuits are connected to sound-producing organs. Parrots have more sophisticated vocal communication skills than songbirds, thanks to an additional copy of this same circuit, Jarvis and colleagues reported in 2015. The extra dedicated brain space hints that vocally adept parrots may therefore be better problem solvers than songbirds. So far, Jarvis has only tested songbirds’ problem-solving skills.</p>



<p>Parrots’ dexterity in maneuvering objects with their feet <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05151-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also relate to the evolution of intelligence</a>, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez and colleagues reported in August in <em>Communications Biology</em>. “[Hand-eye coordination] is like a stepping stone into intelligence and higher cognitive ability,” he says.</p>



<p>Take primates. Monkeys and apes with better motor skills tend to have bigger brains, researchers reported in 2016. Finesse with handling objects as tools is key for accessing challenging food sources, like using sticks to crack open nuts or to pull ants out of anthills. Good motor skills, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez says, are also probably key for understanding an item’s physical properties, and big brains can mentally manipulate those objects.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Parrot intelligence in the wild</h4>



<p>How parrot intelligence plays out in the wild is mostly unknown. What scientists know about parrot smarts largely comes from captivity, where the absence of predators and the abundance of food might free up mental space, Pepperberg says.</p>



<p>Captive parrots are probably best viewed as what can be, not necessarily what always is. “We say humans are brilliant, and we point to Einstein, we point to Beethoven, we point to Picasso,” Pepperberg says. While the average human might struggle with calculus, musical theory or painting masterpieces, we still say <em>Homo sapiens</em> does great things.</p>



<p>It’s also possible that scientists are just missing the cognitive feats of wild parrots. It’s difficult to get wild parrot studies off the ground because the birds can fly away, and researchers can’t easily follow. (New Zealand’s kākāpō, the only flightless parrot, is the exception.) “Researching these highly mobile animals is a challenge in the wild,” says Rachael Shaw, a behavioral ecologist at Te Herenga Waka – Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Cognitive biologist Alice Auersperg of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and colleagues solved that problem by capturing wild Goffin’s cockatoos in Indonesia, placing them in a field-based aviary and then releasing them after studying how the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221011118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cockatoos make and use sets of wooden tools</a> to get seeds out of sea mangos.</p>



<p>Shaw and colleagues are working to improve another challenge of field studies — recognizing individual birds — by developing facial recognition software, which could also be useful in conservation. More than 100 parrot species are endangered or threatened because of habitat loss and the pet trade.</p>



<p>Studying parrot intelligence could help conservation efforts, Bastos says. A study from 2018 found that wild keas in New Zealand <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32363-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned to use sticks to tamper with egg-baited traps</a> intended for stoats — a relative of weasels that preys on keas. Some birds got stuck inside the boxes and died. Understanding the bird’s cognitive limits could lead to new, kea-proof trap designs.</p>



<p>Sometimes wild parrots aren’t in forests but in people’s yards. Across the Tasman Sea from New Zealand, in Sydney, sulphur-crested cockatoos can learn from one another <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoo-open-trash-cans">how to break into trash bins for food</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22, p. 10</em>). People retaliate with tricks of escalating difficulty to keep the birds out.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cockatoos raid trash bins in Sydney. People have come up with creative ways to deter the birds, with varying degrees of success.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These urban bird populations highlight the adaptability of parrots, Aplin says. Sydney has sprung up around cockatoos’ native habitat. “We can’t assume that cities are empty spaces where we only have to account for human wants and needs. We also have to be thinking about the animals that we’re supporting specifically in those cities.”</p>



<p>Some Goffin’s cockatoos escaped from the pet trade into urban settings in Singapore, where there is now a stable population. Seeing how the birds adapt in real time is “super exciting,” Rössler says. Scientists could learn how the new surroundings might spark new innovative behaviors. “That’s the evolution in the making.”</p>

<p>A Springer Nature journal <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/13204/articles">retracted 34 papers</a> earlier this month, including, ironically enough, one on how to detect fake news, which appeared in special guest-edited issues hacked by publication cheats.</p>



<p>Special issues <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">have emerged over the past few years as particularly vulnerable to paper mills</a>.

<p>“Hybrid deep learning model for automatic fake news detection,” from a group in Turkey led by Othman A. Hanshal, was published last February in Applied Nanoscience. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13204-024-03001-w">retraction notice reads</a>: </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/handwriting-brain-connections-learning">Handwriting may boost brain connections more than typing does</a></h4>

              
                <p>Writing out the same word again and again in cursive may bring back bad memories for some, but handwriting can boost connectivity across brain regions, some of which are implicated in learning and memory, a new study shows.</p>



<p>When asked to handwrite words, college students showed increased connectivity across the brain, particularly in brain waves associated with memory formation, compared with when they typed those words instead, researchers report January 26 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. The finding adds to growing evidence of handwriting’s benefits and could give fodder to laws that implement handwriting curricula, such as the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently enacted California law requiring the teaching of cursive</a> in grades 1 through 6.</p>



<p>The new study shows that “there is a fundamental difference in brain organization for handwriting as opposed to typing,” says Ramesh Balasubramaniam, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Merced who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Plenty of previous research has shown that handwriting improves <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-0663.82.1.159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spelling accuracy</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154193120905302218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory recall</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614524581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conceptual understanding</a>. Scientists think that the slow process of tracing out letters and words gives individuals more time to process the material and learn.</p>



<p>In the new study, psychologists Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel, both at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, recruited students from the university and stuck electrodes on their heads. The researchers asked the students to type out or handwrite in cursive with a digital pen a word that appeared on a computer screen. Sensors in a cap recorded electrical brain activity while participants carried out each task.</p>



<p>Then the scientists looked for coherence, which is when two brain areas are active with the same frequency of electrical waves at the same time. This parameter can reveal the strength of functional connectivity among different regions across the brain.</p>



<p>With handwriting, the researchers saw increased activity, specifically in low frequency bands called alpha and theta, not only in the expected motor areas due to the movement but also in others associated with learning. These low frequency bands have previously been shown to support memory processes. When the team compared the two tasks, they realized that handwriting — but not typing — increased the connectivity across parietal brain regions, which are involved in sensory and motor processing, and central ones, many of which are involved in memory. These findings suggest that there are distinct processes of brain activation happening while a person types or writes.</p>

<p>“Even when the movements are very similar, the activation seems much, much higher in handwriting,” Balasubramaniam says. “It shows that there&#8217;s more involvement of these brain regions when you’re handwriting, which might give you some specific advantages.”</p>



<p>The researchers posit that this boost of stimulation facilitates learning because these particular waves between these areas are implicated in <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30294-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory formation and encoding</a>.</p>



<p>Because the team did not test whether participants remembered the words, it’s not yet clear how exactly the increased activity impacts learning, says psychologist Kathleen Arnold of Radford University in Virginia. “[The study] warrants some follow up to see what exactly is causing those connectivity differences and whether or not they reflect learning outcomes.”</p>



<p>Balasubramaniam also notes that it’s possible the differences in brain activation are merely due to the unique movement required to type or write. “But that said, we&#8217;ve got to start somewhere, and these are the first results to actually show that these two things have different brain activation patterns.”</p>



<p>And although handwriting may help with learning processes, typing is often easier, faster and more practical. Students and teachers alike should therefore consider the task at hand to inform their decision to handwrite or type, van der Meer says. For example, using handwriting to take notes might help retain information better while typing out an essay may be easier.</p>



<p>Despite the need for more studies to determine the optimal learning strategy, experts say that handwriting shouldn’t be left behind in the digital age. “[Schools] need to bring in more writing into curriculum design,” Balasubramaniam says.</p>



<p>Van der Meer agrees. “[Writing is] so good for [young] brains, so we shouldn&#8217;t use [this generation] as guinea pigs to see how their brains end up without any handwriting,” she says. “And it&#8217;s important for them to be able to at least write a grocery list or a love letter. I really think that that is important for us humans.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-ends-mission">NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter officially ends its mission on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p>After nearly three years, NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter, the first spacecraft to undertake a powered flight on another world, has ended its mission. Officials at the agency confirmed on January 25 that the history-making quad-copter has sustained damage to one of its rotor blades and is no longer capable of flying.</p>



<p>&#8220;While we knew this day was inevitable, it doesn&#8217;t make it any easier,&#8221; said Lori Glaze, NASA&#8217;s planetary science division director, during a news conference on the status of the quad-copter.</p>



<p>Many on the Ingenuity team are already thinking back fondly on the mission&#8217;s many accomplishments. &#8220;[For] a helicopter that&#8217;s overperformed the way that this has, I don&#8217;t think you can really mourn it and be sad,&#8221; says Håvard Fjær Grip, the  mission&#8217;s chief pilot and an engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>



<p>Ingenuity — Ginny to its friends — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">hitched along with NASA’s car-sized rover Perseverance</a> as the rover landed on Mars in February 2021 (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). A few months later, the small helicopter spun its rotor blades, climbed into the thin Martian atmosphere, rose to a height of three meters, and took a picture of Perseverance during its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover">first test flight</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/21</em>).</p>

<p>The aerial robot vastly outperformed its initial expectations, which was to fly a handful of times over 30 days. The idea was to demonstrate flight was possible on Mars, and then ground itself. Ingenuity instead undertook a total of 72 flights, traveling 14 times farther than planned and logging more than two hours of total flight time. During its travels, the helicopter did far more than fly<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">: It became part of the science mission</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>). Ingenuity made 3-D elevation maps of its surroundings, went places that Perseverance couldn’t get to, and scouted potential sites for the rover’s scientific observations. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingenuity helped scientists discover that, unlike on Earth, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-two-sound-speeds-laser-helicopter">speed of sound in Mars’ atmosphere</a> depends on pitch, likely due to its carbon-dioxide rich nature (<em>SN: 4/11/22</em>). It also demonstrated the ability to autonomously choose landing sites, clean itself after dust storms, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-mars-nasa-flight-1-year-anniversary">snap tons of amazing photos of the Martian landscape</a>, often including its own shadow (<em>SN: 4/19/22</em>).</p>



<p>During the helicopter&#8217;s 70th flight in December near the rim of Jezero crater, the robot reached an area with sandy, mostly featureless terrain, posing a challenge for its autonomous navigation system, which uses features such as rocks to know where it is and how to get around. On its next journey, the helicopter ran out out of features to track and executed an emergency landing. &#8220;That&#8217;s when we realized that this is more challenging to navigate than we thought,&#8221; says Grip. The intent for its subsequent flight was to rise a bit in the air, hover over the terrain, and get a fix on its location. Unfortunately, things didn&#8217;t go as planned.</p>



<p>On January 19, NASA reported that <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1748883252604236281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ingenuity briefly lost communications</a> with the Perseverance rover as it was descending during its 72nd flight. While contact was soon restored, the small helicopter suffered damage from the fall that has permanently grounded it.</p>



<p>There was a moment of sadness when the team first received images that confirmed damage to the helicopter,  Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity&#8217;s project manager, said in the news briefing. &#8220;But that was very quickly replaced with happiness and pride and a feeling of celebration for what we&#8217;ve pulled off.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-ant-lion-dinner-trees-ecosystem">How an invasive ant changed a lion’s dinner menu</a></h4>

              
                <p>How did the ant steal the lion’s dinner? This isn’t the beginning of one of Aesop’s Fables. It’s the finding of a new study showing how the disruption of one tiny mutual relationship on the African savanna has big impacts on the food web — all the way to the lion’s den.</p>



<p>When big-headed ants (<em>Pheidole megacephala</em>) invade the savanna, they kill off native acacia ants (genus <em>Crematogaster</em>), robbing local whistling thorn trees of their valiant defenders against hungry elephants. Without ants to bite them, the elephants rip up the thorn trees, opening up the grassland, which makes it harder for lions to catch their preferred zebra meals. Lions end up hunting buffalo instead. The findings, published online January 25 in <em>Science</em>, show that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg1464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invasive species’ effects can be very indirect</a> — and suggest that changes in different low-level mutualisms might also echo up food webs in other ecosystems.</p>



<p>Over the past 15 years or so, wildlife ecologist Jake Goheen and his colleagues at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya, have been studying <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forget-mice-elephants-intimidated-ants" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forget-mice-elephants-intimidated-ants">how acacia ants protect whistling thorn trees</a> (<em>SN: 6/15/10</em>). When an elephant tries to eat the tree, “ants swarm up inside its nostrils and bite from the inside out,” Goheen says.</p>



<p>The scientists were also examining what the lions in the conservancy eat as part of a separate study. “One of the things that we found … was that lions are much more effective, they&#8217;re more successful with their hunts in areas where tree cover is high,” Goheen says.</p>



<p>But what happens when tree cover is suddenly low? To find out, Goheen and his colleagues collared six lionesses from the local prides to track their activity and kills. The team also set up experimental plots where big-headed ants had invaded, and where the native ants still held sway.</p>



<p>The big-headed ant arrived in the conservancy between 2002 and 2005, Goheen says. “We think it probably was imported on produce,” brought into the houses or tourist camps in the area. The invading insects kill local acacia ants wherever they find them. And other studies have shown that without defending ants, pachyderms tore down the thorn trees five to seven times more often.</p>

Here the smaller invasive ants encircle and tear apart the larger native ants.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135388">Patrick Milligan</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the new study, the scientists could have used drones or satellite images to study tree cover, but “we don’t have that kind of money,” Goheen says. Instead, the researchers tracked their collared lions, and then got down on hands and knees near the lions’ recent kills, using a range finder to measure the openness of the area. Areas with big-headed ants, the team showed, had 2.67 times higher visibility than areas without — meaning that lions could see farther, but so could their prey.</p>



<p>Lions relied on the cover of trees to pounce on hapless zebras nearby: Where visibility was low, the probability of a zebra kill was 62 percent. But when visibility was high, the lion’s chance of taking down a zebra dropped to only 22 percent.</p>



<p>Over the three years of the study, zebra dinners decreased from 67 percent to 42 percent of lion kills. But the lions didn’t go hungry. Instead, they went for beef. Buffalo kills increased from zero to 42 percent of kills over the study period. It’s a risky diet, Goheen says. Buffalo “are big and feisty,” and lions hunting buffalo are more likely to be injured.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study shows that “the disruption of a mutualism can have cascading effects on other species in the community,” says Emilio Bruna, a plant ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “Those effects can be unexpected and indirect.”</p>



<p>It’s a clue, Bruna says, that ecologists should be looking out for other pairs like the acacia ant and the thorn tree, where a single special relationship is a foundation for an ecosystem and a single anthill could cause a savanna-wide shift in who is eating who.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/organisation-in-your-phd">Organisation in Your PhD</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Rachel McKeown shares her learned experience of the importance of organisation and timekeeping, whilst completing a PhD, and how to ensure you maintain a good work/life balance.</strong></p>
<blockquote>No two people, or two PhDs, are the same...</blockquote>
<p>When thinking about the skills required to take on a PhD, there are a lot of buzzwords that crop up over and over. Determination, teamwork and critical thinking are common themes you’ll encounter in any major project. </p>

<p>One of the most valuable assets for any PhD candidate, that might not come to mind so quickly, is the ability to organise. This doesn’t just refer to the planning of your project, but also planning how to ensure that you remain in the best frame of mind throughout. When I was an undergraduate student, I had a strong grasp on the former, but a much more tenuous sense of the latter. I had a handle on how to keep track of multiple overlapping deadlines, churning out essays never a day late, but the toll the course took on me was far greater. I couldn’t engage my mental ‘brake’. On starting my postgraduate studies, I was resolute that I would extend my organisational capacity, finding ways to build my own defences as I set out to face my greatest academic battle thus far. Here are a few lessons I have picked up along the way related to organising my work, and my life around it.</p>

<p><strong><u>Control your calendar</u></strong></p>

<p>The day-to-day life of a PhD student often differs significantly to the undergraduate lifestyle, with the independence and freedom allowing you to break free of the rigidity of a structured course. There are a few fixtures that can’t be shuffled, such as weekly lab group meetings but, by and large, your time is yours to arrange. This can be a little overwhelming to anyone who is used to living life according to a timetable. However, flexibility is your friend, if you’re willing to embrace it. </p>

<p>Without a one-size-fits-all workday, find a schedule that best matches your rhythm. Are you perkiest in the early hours, or a denizen of the night? Personally, I’m the type who likes to get the hands-on lab tasks out of the way first, pushing admin and desk tasks to later in the afternoon to give me time to reflect with a freshly brewed mug of tea. Some of my lab mates prefer to meander into work a little later in the day and let the coffee machine work its magic, before slowly ramping up their productivity throughout the day. We all get our work done in the way that suits us.</p>
<blockquote>Are you perkiest in the early hours, or a denizen of the night?</blockquote>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shift your general patterns around either. I’m certainly guilty of trying to turn a blind eye to the impact of the changing seasons. In the summer I can rise well before 7AM, head out for a run and still make it to the lab before 9AM. Writing this piece in January, I already dread the call of tomorrow’s pre-dawn alarm, knowing the energetic barrier I will face to leave my duvet and brace for the predicted sub-zero journey to work. When the sun rises after I do, the weariness permeates throughout the day. Interestingly, one day this week, an alarm-setting mishap turned out to be a blessing in disguise as, waking up naturally an hour later to sunlight trickling through my curtains, I went about my day with a little extra spring in my step. I was more alert, more focused and far more productive. I’ll be making a note of this to battle the winter blues. </p>

<p><strong><u>Keep on track</u></strong></p>

<p>I may be doing a PhD in neuroscience, but sadly I am far from unlocking any memory-related superpowers. With a relentless barrage of tasks, from setting up an experiment, preparing for a meeting or replying to an all-important email, it is all too easy for a few to slip by uncompleted. This isn’t so bad when the job is trivial, but a crucial deadline sneaking up on you is much more unpleasant and is best avoided. </p>

The written word is far less fickle than my memory. In today’s technocentric society, there are many digital tools out there that will get the job done, but as an Apple convert, the in-built Reminders app is my daily lifesaver. I use it to log anything and everything that I need to get done, neatly partitioned into sections for PhD work, general life and University societies I’m involved with, in particular the running of Bluesci, the University of Cambridge science communications platform. The seamless synchronisation between my laptop, phone and watch means I’m never far away from checking my uncompleted tasks. I’m trying to get into the habit of inputting tasks as soon as they pop into my mind – as soon as I accepted writing this piece, it went straight into 				      <em>Reminders.</em></p>
<p>Reminders, along with a handy alert for a week’s time to make sure I had a first draft in place. Though, tying my work responsibilities to my everyday tech does run the risk of struggling to disengage and fully relax, which I’ll come to shortly.</p>
<blockquote>The written word is far less fickle than my memory.</blockquote>
<p>For setting daily goals, I take a more traditional approach and instead rely on my trusty notebook. At the start of each day, I take a few moments to write a list of everything that I want to accomplish by the time I come to winding down. Let me tell you, the satisfaction that comes from seeing a full set of ticks at the end of the day is a real motivational boost, like receiving a shiny gold star from a teacher when you were little. Rather than pushing myself to complete a task, I feel the pull of this self-imposed incentive. This has worked wonders for my short-term productivity as I give myself a real-time pat on the back.</p>

<p><strong><u>Balancing act</u></strong></p>

<p>PhDs are notorious for consuming your time in ways you don’t initially expect. This is sometimes part of the package you sign up for, and the sense of reward from looking at the horde of precious data you’ve just acquired more than makes up for it. However, I’ve found more insidious ways that work has tried to extend into other aspects of my life. In the early days, I found myself trawling through (likely unimportant) papers late into the night, just for the sake of feeling productive, when I should have been resting. Sapping my energy like this wasn’t sensible as I pushed myself too hard without need, bringing myself dangerously close to the burnout I so wanted to leave behind. </p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_e05111d76f4e4d4fa64396950c6c81f6~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_393,h_723,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>I have developed a curated calendar system, again using Apple Calendar as a personal choice, where I enter all of my work commitments colour-coded in red. These could be practical lab experiments, or desk-based work, such as writing up experimental notes, preparing a presentation and analysing data. This lets me plan a few days into the future, or sometimes even weeks, so that my project keeps its momentum. If something takes more time than I initially budgeted for, then I update the calendar retrospectively for the increased working hours and may use this to set aside a little extra time for myself on other, less demanding days. For example, on days I prepare hydrogel substrates for neuron culture, I’m typically working constantly in the lab for an extra two to three hours, so ending my work day an hour earlier later in the week, to catch the last of the winter daylight, doesn’t incur quite so much guilt as it used to in my undergraduate days. </p>
<p>								                   <em>Midweek calendar – work by day and relax by  </em>The red blocks need a healthy counterweight in 			          <em>evening.</em></p>
<p>the form of green blocks, representing my social and recreational activities. Recurring ones include gym sessions, quiz nights with my friends or simply taking a walk along the river to the tune of my latest favourite podcast - sometimes to expand my scientific scope (e.g. <em>New Scientist Weekly)</em>, or sometimes to completely depart from it to broaden my interests (I’m currently flitting through the centuries by listening to <em>The Rest is History</em>). When the red and the green are in harmony, my routine is much more sustainable and burnout is kept at bay. Seeing my week ahead in full colour-coded glory has both aesthetic appeal and practical benefit.</p>

<p>There also must be time set aside for a complete detox. When the holiday season hits, rest and recuperation become the priority. In a mastery of self-kindness, give yourself the gift of completely tuning your mind out of experimental mode – those projects will still be waiting upon your return, and you’ll be more refreshed to take them on. You might even be able to see a problem in a new light or pick up on a small, but crucial, detail that previously remained under the radar. I’m writing this having just returned from Christmas break, where I fully immersed myself in quality family time and tackling the seemingly never-ending stack of unread novels I’ve been meaning to get to. Any emails that cropped up during this time were syphoned off into the Reminders app for the first day back. </p>

<p><strong><u>Master your toolset</u></strong></p>

<p>No two people, or two PhDs, are the same, so what works for one person may not work for another. This is why it’s important to take the time to play around with organisational approaches and find a system that’s fine-tuned to the way you work. It takes a little effort and a little self-experimentation, but harnessing this skill in your PhD toolkit is one you will be grateful for further down the line. As the thesis write-up dawns upon me, it’s time to engage my own organisational toolset to face it. But first, it’s time to put a big red tick next to ‘Complete first draft of blog’…</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quasicrystal-einstein-tile-hat-shape">A predicted quasicrystal is based on the ‘einstein’ tile known as the hat</a></h4>

              
                <p>The “hat” wowed mathematicians. Now the shape is shaking up physics.</p>



<p>In 2023, mathematicians reported that the 13-sided tile was the first known “einstein.” That’s a shape that can perfectly cover an infinite plane — no gaps or overlaps — but can do so only <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">without a repeating pattern</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/23</em>).</p>



<p>Now, scientists have predicted the properties for a two-dimensional material based on the hat. It’s a quasicrystal, a material that is orderly like a crystal, but in which the arrangements of atoms don’t repeat. Intriguingly, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/33074Yb3Ufa1478fd33b049723e53c7a8d73f77b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hat-based material shares properties with graphene</a>, a crystalline material, the researchers report in a paper to appear in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s got lots of properties that we associate with quasicrystals, but then it acts strangely like crystals,” says physicist Sinéad Griffin of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the research. “It’s a really fun study.”</p>



<p>Previously, mathematicians needed more than one shape to cover an infinite plane in this nonrepeating way, known as an aperiodic tiling. Some earlier aperiodic tilings have connections to real-world materials. Penrose tilings, based on sets of two tiles discovered in the 1970s by mathematician Roger Penrose, look like a 2-D slice through a quasicrystal. Such quasicrystals have been found in meteorites and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">atomic bomb test debris</a>, in addition to being made in the lab (<em>SN: 5/17/21</em>).</p>



<p>So scientists wanted to know what a material based on the hat tiling might be like. Physicist Adolfo Grushin and colleagues calculated the properties of electrons in a 2-D material in which atoms sit at the hats’ vertices.</p>



<p>To characterize a material, scientists can look at the relationship between the energies of its electrons and their wavelengths. (According to quantum physics, electrons travel through materials as waves; the wavelength denotes the size of those waves.) In this energy–wavelength relationship, the researchers found striking similarities between the hat quasicrystal and graphene, a 2-D crystal of carbon.</p>



<p>That’s because many of the vertices of the hat tiling fall along a hexagonal grid like that of graphene, says Grushin, of Institut Néel of CNRS in Grenoble, France.</p>



<p>The fact that the hat tiling is made up of a single tile shape, rather than multiple shapes, also helps explain how it straddles the worlds of crystals and quasicrystals. The use of a single tile means it’s closer to being periodic than other aperiodic tilings, without actually repeating.</p>



<p>Unlike graphene, however, the hat material is chiral, which means that the electrons would behave differently if you were to flip the material as if reflected in a mirror. In a real material, that chiral property might affect how light interacts with the substance, for example, by rotating the light’s polarization, the orientation of its electromagnetic waves.</p>



<p>More interesting features popped up when the researchers investigated what would happen if the material were placed in a magnetic field. In the hat tiling, a fraction of the hat tiles are mirror images of the others. Electrons, specifically those with zero energy, became trapped around the flipped hats at certain values of magnetic field. “We found it quite beautiful that this happens,” Grushin says.</p>



<p>Although the material is entirely theoretical for now, the researchers proposed some ways that the material could be brought to reality. For example, scientists could manually place molecules on a surface in a pattern matching the hat tiling. That would be the ultimate hat trick.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-outbreak-influenza-panzootic-galapagos">A bird flu outbreak is sweeping the globe. Its long-term effects are unclear</a></h4>

              
                <p>As I step among poop-covered rocks toward the plateau of a small island in the Galápagos, a part of me rejoices. Not only am I about to see the archipelago’s famed blue-footed boobies for the first time, but the sight of guano everywhere, and birds to make fresh batches, serves as a reminder: The ongoing avian influenza outbreak has not yet ravaged this picturesque place.</p>



<p>Ghostly, leafless Palo Santo trees and saltbushes sprinkle the island, surrounded by boulders in varying shades of red-tinged black and brown. White splotches of guano splattered on rocks are hard to miss against this arid landscape on North Seymour Island in November, the tail end of the dry season. The poop’s sources are similarly difficult to overlook.</p>



<p>The island is known for hosting a large colony of magnificent frigatebirds (<em>Fregata magnificens</em>), some of which hang suspended in the air above tourists’ heads as we disembark from a dinghy and scramble up the rocky path. As I admire the birds’ fabulous red throat sacs — which males inflate like balloons to attract females — I hope that none deposit excrement on my head.</p>

<p>A short walk along a dusty trail brings us to, in my opinion, the stars of the show, blue-footed boobies (<em>Sula nebouxii)</em>. The dopey looking birds show no sign of fear even as we cluster around their nests eagerly snapping photos.</p>



<p>That I had the chance to visit these birds on North Seymour at all — amid all their poop — was a relief after traveling more than 5,000 kilometers for a vacation in Galápagos National Park. Just two months before, at the end of September, news broke that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/deadly-avian-flu-reaches-galapagos-islands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deadly avian influenza had reached the archipelago</a>.</p>



<p>The virus’ presence posed a grave threat. The islands are home to birds like the Galápagos penguin that are found nowhere else in the world. National park and government officials closed some islands to tourists to protect endemic seabirds — an understandable tactic that left me selfishly thinking about the possibility of not getting to see iconic birds up close. To track the virus, “we have eyes watching the whole archipelago,” wildlife veterinarian Gustavo Jiménez-Uzcátegui of the Charles Darwin Foundation told <em>Science </em>in September.</p>



<p>The concern is warranted. Outside the Galápagos, the global bird flu panzootic has been destructive. (Panzootics are the animal equivalent of human pandemics.) It’s unclear why the archipelago has so far escaped the worst of avian influenza, Jiménez-Uzcátegui told me when we met in the island town of Puerto Ayora. Also unknown are the effects the outbreak could permanently imprint on bird populations and the ecosystems that they’re a part of around the globe.</p>



<p>“Most people have no idea that we are in the middle of a wildlife emergency, an animal pandemic, and that this may be the nail in the coffin for some species,” says Michelle Wille a viral ecologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, who studies avian influenza. “It’s very concerning.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bird flu has killed millions of animals</h4>



<p>While the viral variant behind the outbreak <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06631-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerged in Europe in 2020</a>, the outbreak itself didn’t take off until late 2021. Since then, avian flu has likely killed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">millions of wild birds</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). In Peru, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320723003737" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of wild birds</a> have died. Places like <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/12/23-0330_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.05.574233v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> have documented tens of thousands of deaths. In the United States, roughly 9,000 wild birds have <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-wild-birds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested positive for avian flu</a>, some of which were reported after being killed by hunters.</p>



<p>In October, bird flu <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/first-confirmed-cases-of-avian-influenza-in-the-antarctic-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived in the Antarctic region for the first time</a> when unexplained mortality of brown skuas on Bird Island was pinned on the virus.</p>



<p>But birds aren’t the only animals in the flu’s crosshairs. “If you can imagine thousands of dead birds, you can imagine how this is an ‘all day buffet’ for scavengers,” Wille says. Avian predators all over the world, including bears and foxes, have tested positive. Marine mammals such as seals and sea lions that swim with or eat infected birds have experienced mass die-offs. In the Arctic, a polar bear died in October after contracting the virus. And on January 11, researchers confirmed that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/bird-flu-found-mammals-near-antarctica-first-time-scientists-say-2024-01-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elephant and fur seals in South Georgia</a>, a sub-Antarctic island, had been infected.</p>



<p>By the time of my trip in mid-November, fears of birds dying en masse in the Galápagos hadn’t yet come to fruition. To date, there have been just 34 confirmed flu infections in red- and blue-footed boobies, Nazca boobies, frigatebirds and tropicbirds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="331" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline2.jpg?resize=680%2C331&#038;ssl=1" alt="Researchers dressed in full-body biohazard suits swab the anus of a black bird.

Thirty-four birds have tested positive since the virus was first detected in September.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135311">Galápagos National Park Directorate</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That the global outbreak is happening at all is a chapter in a predictable story, says Nichola Hill, a disease ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. And the virus’s incursion into some mammals is “absolutely on track with being the worst-case scenario you could have imagined for this.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The flu’s long-term effects remain unclear</h4>



<p>Researchers have long understood that avian influenza viruses — which normally cause mild disease in waterfowl like ducks — can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-flu-flies-coop">turn deadly after spreading and evolving</a> on poultry farms (<em>SN: 9/2/05</em>). Close relatives of the virus responsible for the ongoing panzootic have been “simmering away” in Eurasia for more than a decade, Hill says. “And now in the last three years, it’s had major consequences for wildlife.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, researchers are focused on documenting the sheer scale of avian and mammalian deaths. “We will probably not know the true extent of this for years to come,” Wille says. The ripple effects on ecosystems will likewise take years to unravel.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Death rates vary among bird species. Waterfowl such as ducks are key spreaders of bird flu and have at least some built-in protection from the virus. Because their immune systems have coevolved with influenza viruses, the animals have a “head-start on immunity” compared to other animals, Hill says. Meanwhile, birds like bald eagles and red-tailed hawks that don’t have such a long history with influenza are “just getting hit really hard.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That disparity has Hill wondering how long it might take for infections to become less deadly, as wild birds develop immunity against the virus. Her lab aims to explore how birds’ immune systems have coevolved with avian flu, including which parts of the immune response are crucial for preventing the virus from running rampant and causing death in some species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of now, Wille says, there are no signs that the panzootic is slowing down. But there are glimmers of hope.</p>



<p>In October, researchers announced <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-condors-vaccine-avian-influenza-65e27a0751666eee0e3ab3b82ae18251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some early results from a bird flu vaccine trial</a> in California condors. After 10 birds had received two doses of the vaccine, six of them had antibody levels high enough to provide at least partial protection against death. “If it works, it demonstrates that we may be able to limit the impact on highly endangered species,” Wille says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Climate may be protecting the Galápagos</h4>



<p>Why avian flu has been less “aggressive” in the Galápagos compared with most everywhere else — and whether it will stay that way — remains a big question, Jiménez-Uzcátegui says. But he has one intriguing hypothesis.</p>



<p>“The unique difference from the other parts [of South America], like Peru, Ecuador,” he says, “is the habitat.”</p>

<p>Flu in both people and birds <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-easier-catch-cold-flu-covid-winter">tends to largely be a cold-season disease</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/23</em>). Last year, El Niño <a href="https://www.weather.gov/news/230706-ElNino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived in the Galápagos</a>, bringing warmer than average waters to the islands’ part of the Pacific Ocean. Normally, the climate pattern reduces the marine food supply, affecting many of the animals that swim in the waters around the islands. The more moderate temperatures may have also made it harder for avian flu to spread, Jiménez-Uzcátegui says.</p>



<p>Piecing together the relationship between the local climate and influenza infections could help determine if Jiménez-Uzcátegui’s hunch is correct. He and his team also hope to examine the immune systems and genetics of birds that call the archipelago home. For now, though, researchers and officials continue to keep an eye out for influenza on the islands.</p>



<p>On the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s easy to center humans in worries about infectious diseases, especially because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/epidemics-infectious-disease-influenza-covid-pandemic">influenza outbreaks can be devastating</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/21</em>). But my visit to Galápagos National Park — a truly special place for nature lovers — underscored that wild birds around the globe are enduring the worst flu outbreak yet. And despite small signs of hope in these iconic islands, the virus’s impacts could reverberate for years to come.</p>

<p>A journal quietly retracted two papers after a six-month Retraction Watch investigation linked them, and two of the journal’s editors, to the Indian paper mill iTrilon.</p>



<p>Based in Chennai, iTrilon hawks authorship of “readymade” publications to scientists “struggling to write and publish papers in PubMed and Scopus-Indexed Journals.” The company, whose website disappeared following <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">our exposé</a> in <em>Science</em>, claims to have connections at journals that allow it to guarantee acceptance of many of its papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two retracted papers – “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Beniwal-et-al.-2023.pdf">Evaluation of the neuroprotective activity of citral nanoemulsion on Alzheimer’s disease-type dementia in a preclinical model: The assessment of cognitive and neurobiochemical responses</a>” and “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lorenzo-et-al-2023-quercetin.pdf">Therapeutic effects of quercetin-loaded phytosome nanoparticles in a preclinical model of Parkinson&#8217;s disease: The modulation by antioxidant pathways and BDNF expression</a>” – had both been put up for sale by iTrilon before they appeared last year in the non-indexed journal <a href="https://lifeneuro.de/"><em>Life Neuroscience</em></a>. </p>



<p>We published the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-1.jpg">matching</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_Quercetin-Neuro-Life.jpg">ads</a> last week in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">a companion piece</a> to the <em>Science</em> article that linked a professor and dean at a university in Spain to several iTrilon papers. The dean, <a href="https://archive.fo/G1bac">Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas</a> of Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias, in Las Palmas, acknowledged paying the paper mill, but said he thought the money was meant to cover article-processing charges. He has since taken down <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/dionisio-lorenzo-lorenzo-villegas-9562463a">his LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>



<span id="more-128640"></span>



<p>The editor-in-chief of <em>Life Neuroscience</em>, Nasrollah Moradikor of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231016053222/https:/georgianeuroscience.com/nasrollah-moradikor/">International Center for Neuroscience Research</a>, in Tbilisi, Georgia, confirmed the journal had pulled Lorenzo’s two papers, although it has not issued retraction notices.</p>



<p>“Today, I asked our managing editor and told them about Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas, his article retracted from our journal website [sic],” Moradikor wrote in a January 22 email to Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>But as we reported in <em>Science</em>, Moradikor was the corresponding author of the paper about Alzheimer’s disease, which was touted by iTrilon after being accepted by the journal and just two weeks before publication. As such, he should have known about author additions.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-2.jpg">a WhatsApp exchange</a> about the paper, iTrilon’s scientific director,<a href="https://archive.fo/F0Iww"> Sarath Ranganathan</a>, described it as “a collaborative research carried out at Georgia [sic]. Authors from any country are allowed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moradikor, who stopped answering emails in October after we told him we were interested in discussing “your work as an editor and your connection with iTrilon,” now denies any links with the paper mill.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m shocked, that you mentioned me and Dr. Indranath Chatterjee [a coauthor on the Alzheimer’s paper] on this News,” he wrote in his email. “We don&#8217;t have any relation with Itrilon and Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas in Spain.”</p>



<p>But last autumn, Chatterjee gave<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Seminar-chatterjee-moradikor-itrilon.jpg"> a talk</a> on scientific publishing organized by iTrilon and the International Center for Neuroscience Research, as we reported in <em>Science</em>. And in an October interview, Chatterjee, who is also an editor at <em>Life Neuroscience</em>, said Lorenzo had been involved in the work for the Alzheimer’s paper “mostly like for the supervising and also kind of reviewing and like checking the paper and the manuscript are properly written or not.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked how he had met Lorenzo, Chatterjee said, “Actually, like, you know, it was in connection with the International Center for Neuroscience, not with me.”</p>

Could cats be the solution? At the same time, many humane societies have more cats to rehome than they can manage. Could lonely older adults be the solution?</p><p>Researchers at the University of Georgia and Brenau University developed a novel program where older adults were paired with a foster cat coming from a local humane society, with the opportunity to adopt. A Human-Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI)-funded feasibility study explored the impact of this program on the older adult participants and the cats. Researchers explored how fostering a shelter cat could impact loneliness and well-being in older adults living alone. They also wanted to learn if these older adults would be more likely to adopt their foster cat after common barriers, such as pet deposit fees, were paid by the study. Could it really be a win-win situation?</p><p>The study enrolled adults aged 60 and older living alone and without any pets. Participants completed health surveys before placement with cats and completed follow-up surveys at 1-month and 4-months post-placement. Participants could choose to adopt their foster cat any time between 1- and 4-months post-placement. If participants chose to adopt their foster cat, the study paid the adoption fee, and a 12-month post-placement survey was completed.</p><p>Findings from the study revealed that loneliness scores significantly decreased at the 4-month mark after the cat fostering began. A similar 4-month improvement that approached statistical significance was observed for mental health. However, at the 12-month follow-up, loneliness scores were no longer statistically significant. The researchers suggest that these one-year reports were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a substantial proportion of older adults experiencing elevated levels of loneliness.&nbsp;</p><h2>Alexis Winger and Ambi</h2><p>Alexis states that before she got Ambi, “<em>I lived alone, and the loneliness was becoming oppressive. Ambi has brought an end to oppressive loneliness. There are still times when I am away from people too long, when I have no one to talk to and lonelines settles in, but then Ambi settles into my lap or just runs through the room, and I am not alone. Ambi has brought me smiles, laughter, responsibility and love</em>.”</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="476" height="638" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Picture1-3.jpg" /></figure><div><blockquote><p>The day that Alexis picked out Ambi at the Athens Area Humane Society to foster.

Almost all (95.7%) of study participants decided to adopt their foster cat at the completion of the study. Dr. Sherry Sanderson, the team lead and Associate Professor at the University of Georgia’s College of Veterinary Medicine, noted: “Our results show that by removing some perceived barriers to pet ownership, including pet deposit fees, pet adoption fees, pet care supplies and veterinary support, we can not only help older adults live healthier, happier lives but we can also encourage the fostering and adoption of shelter cats into loving homes”.</p><p>Dr. Kerstin Emerson, a Gerontologist in the College of Public Health’s Institute of Gerontology, Health Policy &amp; Management at the University of Georgia, and an investigator from the study states, “In May of 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General stated that loneliness and isolation is an epidemic in this country, and their report placed an emphasis on the urgent need for a cure.” Dr. Don Scott, a Geriatrician and Campus Director of Geriatrics and Palliative Care from the Augusta University-University of Georgia Medical Partnership and also a researcher from the study, added, “The ill effects of loneliness and social isolation, particularly for older adults, are well-documented, and more strategies are needed to improve health outcomes for this population.” The investigators from this study plan to do a larger scale study. The hope is when an older adult seeks to prevent or ward off loneliness and isolation, they will collaborate with a support team prepared to explore feline companionship as part of an individualized holistic approach to care, and there will be programs in place and funding available to support this new approach to treating loneliness in older adults.</p><h2>Judith Atkins and Bashi</h2><p>Judith is semi-retired from nursing, but she still provides nursing care to some of the residents in the Senior Living Residence that she lives in. When recently asked what Bashi means to her, Judith sent back the following reply:</p><p>“He (Bashi) has been a comfort to two of my neighbors. While providing nursing care to a resident who was in hospice care, Bashi stayed with her until she died. I also took him to visit a resident with cancer and breathing problems when I went to visit. I also took Bashi to the nursing home to visit two people I took care of there.”</p><p>Judith went on to say, “He still enjoys catching balls and batting them into the hall closet, continues to steal straws from my drinks and claims all boxes. Best of all, he still likes my left shoulder to put his head on to make sure his world is okay. At night at times, I find him asleep on a pillow by my head. His love of people is unlimited, and he will try and go in any apartment with the door open to be loved on by strangers. He escapes into the hall to force me to exercise chasing him, and needless to say he is always the winner.”</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-design-5.jpg" /></figure></div><blockquote><div><p>Judith was ready to enroll in the study just days before the Pandemic occurred, and the Foster Cat Study was shut down for six months.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aquifers-losing-water-climate-change-overuse">Many but not all of the world’s aquifers are losing water</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world’s precious stash of subterranean freshwater is shrinking — and in nearly a third of aquifers, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06879-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that loss has been speeding up in the last couple of decades</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 25 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>A one-two punch of unsustainable groundwater withdrawals and changing climate has been causing global water levels to fall on average, leading to water shortages, slumping land surfaces and seawater intrusion into aquifers. The new study suggests that groundwater decline has accelerated in many places since 2000, but also suggests that these losses can be reversible with better water management.</p>



<p>It’s the first effort to synthesize global-scale groundwater data collected on site, rather than assessed by satellite. Previous studies have quantified the scope of global groundwater loss by analyzing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-earths-groundwater-basins-run-deficits">data collected by a pair of NASA satellites known as GRACE</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/15</em>). But while satellites can scan the entire globe, some of the nuance of water loss — and recovery — in regional aquifers can be hard to detect from space, the researchers say.</p>



<p>To assess how groundwater is changing in aquifers, hydrologist Scott Jasechko of the University of California, Santa Barbara and colleagues analyzed water level data collected since 1980 in about 170,000 monitoring wells around the globe. Those wells offer glimpses into the state of almost 1,700 of the world’s largest aquifer systems.</p>



<p>Using the well data, the team identified where groundwater loss was most quickly accelerating. In 12 percent of the aquifers the team studied, water levels are now dropping by more than half a meter per year. And in 36 percent of the aquifer systems, the water level is dropping by a tenth of a meter per year. The fastest declines were detected in some of the world’s most arid regions, including central Chile, Iran and the western United States.</p>

<p>But there are signs of hope, the researchers say. In some areas, groundwater levels have begun to climb in the last two decades, even after shrinking at the end of the 20th century. Those recoveries are probably due to changes in regional water management. Groundwater losses from an aquifer in Thailand’s Bangkok basin, for example, reversed this century thanks to regulatory measures that include charging fees on groundwater pumping and licensing wells. The Abbas-e Sharghi basin of Iran, meanwhile, is now recovering after water was diverted to the basin from a large dam in the west of the country.</p>



<p>These reversals suggest that “long-term groundwater losses are neither universal nor inevitable,” the team says.</p>



<p>The results are also important for understanding discrepancies between GRACE data and local observations of groundwater levels, which have long been a thorn in the side of water management, says environmental scientist Li Xu, who was not involved in the study. Studies like this can be a big help in identifying where and why those discrepancies occur, he says, and “will definitely contribute to creating a global baseline for sustainable groundwater management.”</p>



<p>By identifying hot spots that need the most urgent attention, this work also helps highlight which parts of the world are most at risk of involuntary human migration due to water shortages, says Xu, of the University of Saskatchewan’s Global Institute for Water Security in Saskatoon, Canada. “Water is the key trigger for human migration or displacement worldwide, and those populations in low- and middle-income countries and in dry regions are most vulnerable.” Identifying those regions most at risk could lead to timely policy interventions, he says, “especially cross-border [aquifers] that could further increase the risk of armed conflicts.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lawn-sprinklers-suck-water-physics">What happens when lawn sprinklers suck in water? Physicists answer that quirky question</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physicists are fascinated with heady puzzles, from the nature of space and time to how the universe came to be. But spinning lawn sprinklers? Yes, that too.</p>



<p>A new experiment provides an answer to a quirky physics quandary popularized by physicist Richard Feynman in the 1980s. The puzzle centers on a style of sprinkler that works by squirting water out the ends of an S-shaped tube. The sprinkler spins away from the escaping water due to conservation of angular momentum. That much is straightforward.</p>



<p>But what happens if you stick the sprinkler in a tank of water and have it suck the water in? The question seems simple. But complex fluid flows and subtleties of momentum conservation have led different physicists to argue that it should either spin in the opposite direction as it does when operated normally, or not move at all. Different experiments likewise clashed.</p>



<p>So applied mathematician Leif Ristroph and colleagues gave it a whirl. “It ended up being one of the hardest problems our lab has ever worked on,” says Ristroph, of New York University. The team performed experiments with a painstakingly crafted transparent sprinkler, alongside mathematical calculations that backed up their measurements. The device floats in a tank of water to reduce friction, an effect that confounded earlier experiments. When run in reverse, the sprinkler <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/bd07eYb2Ma914376272d01f749b26c02e305d7e13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indeed spins the opposite </a>way, the researchers report in a paper accepted to <em>Physical Review Letters.</em> Further experimentation revealed why.</p>



<p>Whereas the normal sprinkler spews jets of water outward, in the reverse operation, jets form within the sprinkler itself. These jets stir up vortices, observed using lasers to illuminate microparticles added to the water. Importantly, the jets and their vortices aren’t symmetrical. When the jets collide in the sprinkler’s middle, they continue at an angle, suggesting they made a glancing collision, rather than hitting head-on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This high-speed video shows fluid moving inside a sprinkler as it sucks in water (made visible by laser-illuminated microparticles). As the water enters the sprinkler, two jets form and collide at glancing angles, forming four asymmetric vortices. In this part of the study, the sprinkler was fixed in place, rather than being allowed to rotate. But when released, the jets’ momentum sends the sprinkler spinning in the opposite direction of a normal sprinkler that spews water out, solving a longstanding physics puzzle.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s because, even though the arms of the sprinkler are perfectly aligned, the internal jets aren’t. The trip through the curved arms displaces the flow of water in each jet. That asymmetry sets the sprinkler rotating backward to conserve angular momentum.</p>



<p>The sprinkler puzzle’s solution just demanded a spritz of insight.</p>

<p>The journal a publication ethics watchdog threatened with sanctions for taking years to retract articles will pull four more related papers, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last July, the Committee for Publication Ethics (COPE) sent a warning letter to Elsevier regarding 10 papers by Yoshihiro Sato and Jun Iwamoto, who hold positions four and six on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a> of retractions, that the publisher had said it would retract three and a half years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/10/exclusive-cope-threatens-elsevier-journal-with-sanctions-for-clear-breakdown-before-seven-retractions/">reported previously</a>, seven of the papers were retracted from <em>Journal of the Neurological Sciences</em> in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following our reporting on COPE’s letter to Elsevier, the publisher has decided to retract the remaining three articles, plus a letter regarding one of the retracted papers, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. </p>



<span id="more-128635"></span>



<p>Andrew Grey, a professor at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who first contacted the <em>Journal of Neurological Sciences</em> about concerns with Sato’s papers in 2017, told us the move is “a good outcome for publication integrity, albeit long overdue. I am sure we will never know what happened to cause the absurd delay.”</p>



<p>Elsevier has not responded to repeated requests since January 12 for comment about these four upcoming retractions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/20/the-notices-are-utterly-unhelpful-a-look-at-how-journals-have-handled-allegations-about-hundreds-of-papers/">work of Grey and colleagues</a> Alison Avenell and Mark Bolland to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/09/analysis-casts-doubt-on-bone-researchers-body-of-work/">expose problems</a> in Sato’s research has led to more than 120 retractions, but in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2023.2295996">recent analysis</a> they found publishers have yet to assess nearly a third of the papers about which they have raised concerns. Yesterday, Science published a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/whistleblowers-flagged-300-scientific-papers-for-retraction-many-journals-ghosted-them">detailed report</a> on the saga to date. “Retractions come slowly—often years after complaints arise, if at all—in part because journals may defer to institutional investigations, which can be slow, unreliable, or absent,” Science noted. “Journals’ decisions also lack transparency.”</p>



<p>In June 2020, after Elsevier hadn’t acted on his concerns and Grey sought help from COPE, the publisher said it would retract the 10 papers he had flagged. When it still <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/23/an-elsevier-journal-said-it-would-retract-10-papers-two-years-ago-it-still-hasnt/">hadn’t years later</a>, and had apparently stopped responding to COPE’s inquiries, the organization sent Elsevier a warning letter stating that the journal’s behavior was “inconsistent with the standards that we expect from COPE members.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher subsequently retracted seven of the articles, but in a January 12, 2024 email seen by Retraction Watch, Mihail Grecea, a senior expert in publishing ethics at Elsevier, wrote that COPE’s letter hadn’t included “a detailed enough ‘Summary of concern’ which would grant for retraction” of three of the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grey informed Grecea that Kurume University had recommended retracting one of them for authorship misconduct, and the other two articles shared coauthors with that paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“More broadly, 119 of Dr Sato’s publications have now been retracted,” Grey wrote. “Why should readers have any confidence that any of his remaining publications are reliable? In the absence of robust evidence of reliability, they should all be retracted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He requested Elsevier also retract a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022510X98003116">letter</a>, “Reply to Davie and Sharp: different mechanisms of bone metabolism between patients with stroke and with spinal cord injury,” that Sato and his coauthors had written in 1999. Grey wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It refers to the now-retracted paper J Neurol Sci 1998;156:205–10, and cites 7 other retracted papers (refs 5-11) by the Sato research group.</p>



<p>It is rather clearly not reliable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Grecea responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given the rather scarce evidence regarding the three papers in the document provided by COPE, I tried to contact myself the Kurume University and the Futase Social Insurance Hospital (both listed by the three papers as the affiliations of the authors of the three papers).</p>



<p>Kurume University has responded at the end of December and I am currently working on the three retractions. I would estimate the 3+1 retractions to appear online around the end of this month.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/honeybees-italy-steal-pollen-bumblebees">Some honeybees in Italy regularly steal pollen off the backs of bumblebees</a></h4>

              
                <p>Honeybees rely on plant pollen as a protein-packed food source. And some are even willing to steal from other bees to get it.</p>



<p>Pollen stealing has been seen before, in the United States. But now, researchers in Italy have also observed honeybees <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-023-01049-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snatching pollen off the backs of bumblebees</a>. The observations, published December 21 in <em>Apidologie</em>, are among the most extensive documentation of bee-on-bee larceny to date.</p>



<p>On a summer trip in 2019 to Mount Antola, in the northern Italian region of Liguria, independent naturalists Tiziano Londei and Giuliana Marzi, both based in Milan, recorded video of what they thought were honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) trying to push bumblebees off the flower of a woolly thistle (<em>Cirsium eriophorum</em>). A closer look at the video, however, revealed that this wasn’t a case of competitive harassment — it was a full-blown robbery. &nbsp;</p>

Because honeybees aren&#8217;t good at collecting pollen from woolly thistle, the bumblebees — which get pollen stuck on their hairy bodies — appear to be too good a target to pass up. This behavior, previously seen in several areas in the United States, has now been observed in Italy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As red-tailed bumblebees (<em>Bombus</em> <em>lapidarius</em>) scrounged around the flowers for nectar and pollen, some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollen-hitches-ride-bees-all-right-spots">pollen grains stuck to their hairy bodies</a> (<em>SN: 9/6/17</em>). Londei and Marzi witnessed honeybees shamelessly snagging this pollen for themselves. The thieves tended to target male bumblebees slightly more than females, as the males appeared less bothered by the pilfering (though even females didn’t react aggressively).</p>



<p>“Honeybees are well-known as pollen pigs,” says Avery Russell, a biologist at Missouri State University in Springfield who was not involved in the study. So stealing pollen from the bodies of bumblebees, he says,&nbsp;&#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem like a far stretch.”</p>



<p>To see how common the criminality is, the researchers went back to the scene twice in the following three years and also observed bees at two other sites about 25 kilometers away. Honeybees at these other sites were not seen stealing from bumblebees, but bees at the first site continued their larcenous ways year after year. For instance, honeybees collected pollen from only three of the 31 flowers the researchers observed in 2021, but stole from 28 of the available 66 bumblebees.</p>



<p>Scrutinizing the differences between these sites, the researchers suspect honeybees resort to theft in areas where pollen is hard for them to get from flowers (the honeybees struggled to collect pollen from the woolly thistle), but where there are plenty of other bees around.</p>



<p>Pollen stealing by honeybees has previously been observed only in North America, first <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25083029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Kansas</a> and then later in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25084015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-the-kansas-entomological-society/volume-78/issue-2/0406.15.1/Quantifying-a-Rare-Event--Pollen-Theft-by-Honey-Bees/10.2317/0406.15.1.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana</a>. Discovering the behavior in Italy suggests this may be a global crime spree. Russell says it would be nice to next learn whether pollen theft negatively impacts bumblebees, or the flowers they pollinate. He’s also curious if other bee species ever steal pollen, too. “We do notice that in the hive, bumblebees will nibble on each other&#8217;s pollen baskets,” he says.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AdobeStock_164136662_Edit-1-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Microfluidic devices allow fluids to be manipulated on a scale ranging between one micrometre and one millimetre. The application of microfluidics in the biomedical field covers many different aspects, including sensing, cell manipulation and micropumping. These devices also serve as tissue/organ culture platforms. The concept of organ-on-a-chip allows such complex systems to be reproduced in a smaller and simpler platform, holding massive potential for the study of intercellular communications as well as an alternative to animal models. Micropumps find applications as drug delivery systems, as well as being a fundamental component of microfluidic devices. These are but a few examples of the potential these technologies hold in the biomedical field.</p>
<p>The Collection <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/mtfba">Microfluidic technologies for biomedical applications</a> welcomes submissions on the design, development and application of microfluidic technologies in the context of biomedicine.

<p>Two assistant professors at universities in the United States are coauthors of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/13/10/926">a review</a> that appears to have been advertised for sale by the Indian paper mill iTrilon, a Retraction Watch investigation has found.</p>



<p>One of the professors, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/liu-yuguang-ph-d/bio-20503555">Yuguang Liu</a> of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is also guest editor of the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors/special_issues/GFBCFF9AIQ">MDPI special issue</a> in the journal <em>Biosensors</em> in which the review was published last year. The other professor, <a href="https://floridapoly.edu/directory/faculty/ajeet-kaushik.php">Ajeet Kaushik</a> of Florida Polytechnic University, in Lakeland, sits on the <a href="https://archive.fo/a1LuB">editorial boards of<em> Biosensors</em></a> and several other titles from MDPI, Elsevier, Wiley, Springer Nature and other publishers.</p>



<p>An MDPI representative said Liu, who declined an interview request, had not been involved in editorial decisions regarding the paper. Meanwhile, Kaushik acknowledged his work on the article had sprung from a LinkedIn message from a researcher in India who, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">we reported last week</a>, has been offering co-authorship in return for help getting his articles published.</p>



<p>“This is sad,” Kaushik told us by email, adding that he had not seen “any red flags” when he agreed to collaborate on the review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I contributed to this review article as an ethical co-author,” he said. “I am making it clear that my role in this article does not have any involvement of money or other exchange offers.”</p>



<p>The paper’s link to iTrilon became apparent during a six-month Retraction Watch investigation for <em>Science</em> that found <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">paper mills had taken to bribing journal editors</a> to ensure publication of their articles. Based in Chennai, iTrilon sells authorship of “readymade” scientific papers and gets them published through a network of editors with whom it claims to be working. The company’s <a href="https://www.itrilon.com/">website</a> was taken down following our story.</p>



<p>As we reported in a companion piece to the <em>Science</em> article, papers advertised last year by iTrilon <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">buoyed the research output</a> of <a href="https://archive.fo/G1bac">Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas</a>, a professor and dean at Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias, in Las Palmas, Spain. Lorenzo acknowledged paying the company.</p>



<p>The review in <em>Biosensors</em> is one of the six papers Lorenzo coauthored in 2023 that could be linked to iTrilon. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_Colorectal-diagnostics-review.jpeg">matching ad</a> was posted in July and referred to a “review article” about “diagnostics for colorectal cancer,” to be submitted to a journal “indexed in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science” with an impact factor above 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These details are all consistent with the review, “Current Status and Emerging Trends in Colorectal Cancer Screening and Diagnostics,” which was submitted to <em>Biosensors</em> on August 29.</p>



<p>But Giulia Stefenelli, chair of the scientific board of MDPI, said the publisher was not investigating the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is important to note that establishing a direct link between the articles and the content advertised by the cited platform is not an easy process. The titles of the articles and the number of authors do not immediately correlate with the published material. Should we receive further evidence that clearly distinguishes the relationship to the publications unequivocally, we will proceed to initiate an official investigation,” Stefenelli told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Liu, who is a corresponding author of the review, did not agree to an interview. But she said in an email that she was “unaware” of the iTrilon ad matching the paper and that “I don’t think it’s related to my paper or the special issue on MDPI.”</p>



<p>We were unable to find contact information for the review’s first author, <a href="https://archive.fo/k1ctn">Shreya Singh Beniwal</a> of Lady Hardinge Medical College, in New Delhi. Beniwal was also first author of <a href="https://archive.fo/aON4t">a research article</a> coauthored by Lorenzo, which unequivocally matched a previous <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-1.jpg">ad from iTrilon</a> and has now been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How the authors came to collaborate on the review is only partly clear. A LinkedIn message from last spring reveals <a href="https://archive.fo/ktZCO">ArunSundar MohanaSundaram</a>, an assistant professor at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, in Chennai, and co-corresponding author of the review, had been proffering author slots on manuscripts to researchers who could help get them published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m ready to offer ‘co authorship’ if you could review the work and support me as an EDITOR in reputed journals,” MohanaSundaram, who has coauthored several papers advertised for sale by iTrilon, wrote in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arunsundar-contacting-researchers-on-linkedin-2.jpg">the message</a>, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">we reported last week</a>. He did not respond to repeated emails.</p>



<p>MohanaSundaram, Lorenzo and Beniwal came up with the idea for the review article, according to the statement on author contributions.</p>



<p>Kaushik said he had not heard of iTrilon until we reached out to him. But he acknowledged being contacted by MohanaSundaram:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Yes, I was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn-message-from-Arunsundar-to-Ajeet-Kaushik.png">approached by Dr. Arun on LinkedIn</a> but at the beginning of this REVIEW ARTICLE. Then this paper moved forward by email exchanges. The similarity Index was acceptable, and all figures were either self-designed or with the permission. So, I did not see any red flags. I was involved in this article due to my credentials in the field of biosensors and nanomedicine.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kaushik added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please note, that I am a young scholar and working hard to make a good name based on clean and ethical research. I generally want to help, but such incidents are centaily aletrs, and I will be more careful and reserv in the future [sic].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presently, I am seeing some of the approaches (so-called shortcuts) to get easy or sponsored publications. BUT, I do not like and support such approaches.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both Mayo Clinic and MDPI emphasized that Liu had not been involved in editorial decisions regarding the manuscript.</p>



<p>“The paper’s scientific review, revision, and submission process was handled by an Assistant Editor, Mila Opacic, not Dr. Liu,” Andrea Kalmanovitz, director of Communications &#8211; Media Relations at Mayo Clinic, said in an email. She did not reply to follow-up questions about how Liu had come into contact with far-flung authors linked to paper-mill articles.</p>



<p>According to Stefenelli at MDPI:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The article was accepted by the Section editor-in-chief of &#8220;Nano- and Micro-Technologies in Biosensors,&#8221; to which the Special issue belongs, Prof. Michael Thompson. In accordance with MDPI editorial procedure, Guest Editors are completely excluded from the peer-review process and decision-making stages for articles submitted by themselves and their colleagues. The MDPI procedure seeks for an independent assessment by a member of the Editorial Board for all cases of conflict of interest (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark17">https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark17</a>).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kaushik, who is a member of the editorial board for the same section of the journal, said he had not been involved in any editorial decisions regarding the review article, nor in the selection of the journal.</p>



<p>Update, 1/24/24, 0930 UTC: </p>



<p>In an email received after this story ran, MohanaSundaram denied any ties to iTrilon and the ads matching his papers. “I am shocked to see your news article which portrays that I am involved in the insane paper mill business. I am strongly against such unethical practice which is a threat to the research fraternity and the society,” MohanaSundaram told us. “I never came across any such Advertisements and I don&#8217;t have any relationship with iTrilion [sic] or any such paper mills.”</p>



<p>He added that he was “always open to research collaborations” and that “For some papers, I feel that higher level of expertise (beyond my capacity) may be required to improve the quality of the manuscript. In such case, I may have approached some editorial board members or experts.”</p>



<p>“My intention is that Editorial board members from good journals have a great experience and expertise, hence they can guide in the best way to match the top notch quality of good journals and the trends in current and advanced research,” MohanaSundaram said. When these individuals made “significant contributions” to his papers, he said, “they &#8220;ethically&#8221; become a leader/corresponding author of the paper in due course of preparation of the final manuscript.”</p>



<p>“Hence, to state that I don&#8217;t have any objections in such ethical grounds, I sometimes mentioned regarding authorships in the initial communications”, MohanaSundaram told us.</p>

                <p>Access to raw scientific data enhances understanding, enables replication and reanalysis, and increases trust in published research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vitality and utility of research data has made Open Data a central tenet of Open Science, second only to publishing under an Open Access license. For that reason, governments, funders, and publishers increasingly recommend <em>or even require</em> data sharing, and readers have come to view Open Data as a hallmark of quality research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Purpose-built data repositories are the most effective, stable, and discoverable way to share research data&mdash;which means more attention and impact for research. In fact, articles that link to data in a repository have a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">25% higher citation rate</a> than articles that do not share data, or share only in Supporting Information files.</p>



<p>Repositories also make it easier to claim academic credit for data collection and curation, by assigning a unique identifier, like a DOI, and enabling authors to link their <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether I&rsquo;m using my own data or someone else&rsquo;s, having access to the data in a repository means that I know which version to use and refer to. This has been really useful as I don&rsquo;t waste time looking through files and folders on my own computer as I can just click on the DOI and go straight to the data. This also means I don&rsquo;t have to bother anyone else to get the data or spend time magnifying graphs and approximating the values of the data points in order to reuse someone else&rsquo;s findings (yes I really did this with an article published back in the 1980s!)&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/palm-plant-flowers-fruits-underground">This first-of-its-kind palm plant flowers and fruits entirely underground</a></h4>

              
                <p>Palm trees are often associated with Hollywood Boulevard and tropical resorts, but their relatives in the palm family Arecaceae can come in many different shapes and sizes. And one shuns the limelight to an almost absurd degree — the new-to-science <em>Pinanga subterranea </em>palm grows its flowers and fruit entirely underground.</p>



<p>“We knew immediately that it’s a really odd palm,” says Benedikt Kuhnhäuser, a botanist at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in Richmond, England.</p>



<p>Malaysian botanist Paul Chai first noticed the palm growing in Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary, on the island of Borneo, in the late 1990s. However, Kuhnhäuser says, Chai lost all his photographic evidence for the enigmatic plant during flooding in Kuching, the capital of the Malaysian state of Sarawak. In 2018, Chai told Kuhnhäuser and other botanists visiting Borneo about the lost palm over breakfast. The team embarked on a multiday trek to reach the sanctuary and found, to their surprise, that the underground palm was actually abundant.</p>



<p>Growing anything other than roots underground is rare, but examples can be found across the plant kingdom. South-central Africa is home to an <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-tropical-ecology/article/suffrutex-grasslands-in-southcentral-angola-belowground-biomass-root-structure-soil-characteristics-and-vegetation-dynamics-of-the-underground-forests-of-africa/90BDAA37B8FE9518441FBC997F1803B8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“underground forest”</a> where many plants flower aboveground but grow woody material below; a Bornean pitcher plant <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pitcher-plant-underground-new-species-carnivorous">buries its traps</a> under the soil (<em>SN: 7/8/22</em>). In fact, plants across 33 different families have been found to conceal flowers or fruits underground, but burying both is exceedingly rare. Besides the underground palm, “there&#8217;s only one other plant in the world that does this,” Kuhnhäuser says, “and that&#8217;s some tiny orchid genus called <em>Rhizanthella</em> in Australia.”</p>



<p>Just because the palm is new to science doesn’t mean no one knew it existed. “Several local people, especially Indigenous ones, knew the palm,” says Cibele de Cássia Silva, a botanist at the University of Campinas in Brazil who was not involved with the research. The local people not only had names for it, but some dig up and eat the inconspicuous palm’s fruit as a snack. For Cássia Silva and Kuhnhäuser, this highlights the importance of not only engaging with Indigenous knowledge but also including that knowledge in scientific papers.</p>

<p>The biology of the palm is also fascinating. Getting flowers pollinated and seeds dispersed is often vital for plants, so how does a plant pull it off underground? The palm may rely at least partially on self-pollination, and Cássia Silva suspects that beetles may be able to move pollen between plants even belowground. The researchers also saw wild pigs digging up its fruits, which means the animals could help the palm spread its seeds through feces. The team <a href="https://kew.iro.bl.uk/concern/articles/de820e60-4c53-44d8-921e-d95f554181d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described the plant</a> in the fittingly named journal <em>Palms</em> in June 2023 and reported on <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ppp3.10393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its unique biology</a> around the same time in <em>Plants, People, Planet</em>.</p>



<p>Kuhnhäuser’s Kew colleague Sidonie Bellot is now working on unraveling the relationships between the underground palm and its relatives, which will help reveal the steps the palm took to reach its subterranean lifestyle; many of its relatives live close to the ground anyway, so going all the way under may not have been that large of a leap.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Mohammad Tayaraninajaran will talk about his paper &quot;A probabilistic meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm for image multi-level thresholding&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which
causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged many countries. To curb the
effect of the pandemic requires the development of low-cost and rapid tools for detecting
and diagnosing the patients. In this regard, chest X-ray scan images provide a reliable
way of detecting the patients. One limitation, however, is the need for experts to analyse
the images and identify the cases which can be a burden, when a large number of images are
to be processed. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to extract rapidly, from the
X-ray images, the regions in which there exist indications of COVID-19 infection. To
identify the regions, image segmentation is required which is performed in this paper with
a novel optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm uses probabilistic
representation for the solutions. To improve the optimization process, we propose a
diversity preserving operator. For multi-level image thresholding via optimization
algorithms, different fitness functions have been proposed in the literature. In the
proposed method in this paper, we use three fitness functions to benefit from the
advantages of all. A fitness swapping scheme is proposed which swaps between the fitness
functions in the optimization process. Also, a diversity preserving operator is proposed
in this paper which compares the individuals and reinitializes the similar ones to inject
diversity in the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of COVID-19
benchmark images and experimental analysis suggest better performance for the proposed
algorithm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/periwinkle-snail-live-birth-evolution-reproduction">These snails give live birth, and it’s the babies that may do the labor</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oddball minority of animals that don’t lay eggs includes a tough little snail called a rough periwinkle.</p>



<p>Unlike mammals giving birth to kittens and fawns and helpless little humans, this tidal-zone snail has switched to live birth relatively recently.&nbsp;Its newcomer version of birthing offspring into the world without an eggshell is…. different: These periwinkle moms give birth multiple times a day. And unlike humans, it’s probably not the mom but the babies who do the hard labor.</p>



<p>Egg-laying periwinkle relatives have a jelly gland that creates a goo-protected mass of eggs outside the mom’s body. But in <em>Littorina saxatilis</em>, the gland has evolved into a make-do womb, or brood pouch<em>.</em> Eggs still form there, but stay inside mom’s body until after they hatch, says evolutionary ecologist Kerstin Johannesson of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.</p>



<p>Mom can have up to a few hundred embryos at various stages of maturation in the gland. When birthing the mature ones, “if she starts to push, also the ones that are not ready will probably come out,” Johannesson says. As a long-time observer of the snails, she doubts that the moms push at all. The little periwinkles may crawl out of their mother’s body and into the world on their own.</p>



<p>When ready to leave the mob in the brood pouch, each baby snail first scrapes a hole in its own transparent eggshell-like covering, “like a hatching bird,” Johannesson says. Then babies must find the exit from mom’s body. “How they find it, we do not know,” she says, “but maybe they can feel the smell of fresh saltwater coming from the outside through the hole.”</p>



<p>The live birth of these snails fascinates Johannesson and others because the species probably developed the ability in the last 100,000 years or so. That’s just an evolutionary eyeblink, really.</p>



<p>When comparing rough periwinkles with two close sister species (<em>L. arcana</em> and <em>L. compressa</em>)<em>, </em>the only reliable visible difference that shows they are separate species is the quirk of live birth.</p>



<p>It was glass German Christmas ornaments that helped evolutionary biologist Sean Stankowski clarify just how strong a species barrier separates live bearers from egg-laying sisters. The glass ornaments, made to be filled with chocolates and dangled on a holiday tree, worked well as passion chambers for pairs of snails, one partner from a live-bearer species and one from an egg-layer. (Considering mollusks in general, this had the kink of pairing males with females rather than the normal two hermaphrodites lining up for mutual sperm delivery.)</p>



<p>In the glass ornaments, some of the pairs mated. But Stankowski, of the University of Sussex in England, and colleagues found no viable offspring, a sign the partners are separate species, in this case with strong separation. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hybrids-reveal-barriers-successful-mating-between-species">Ability to make babies is one way to think about defining a species</a>, but far from the only way (<em>SN: 10/31/17</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The ornaments were just a tiny part of some seven years of intense research, mostly genetic exploration, that let Stankowski, Johannesson and colleagues explore how an egg-laying lineage gave rise to such a consequential change as live birth. &nbsp;Both <em>L. arcana</em> and <em>L. saxatilis</em> live in the drown-dry craziness of rocky tidal zones, but the egg-layers stay mostly in northern Europe and Russia. The live-birth species, however, has spread farther around Europe and added the northern Atlantic coast of North America to its range. Because <em>L. saxatilis</em> hitchhikes well, it now lives in San Francisco Bay and the canals of Venice.</p>



<p>Yet live birth doesn’t look as if it came from some big dramatic genetic change. Instead, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differences built up bit by bit</a>, from changes in some 50 regions in the snail’s genes. None of these seems more influential than any of the others, the team reports January 5 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Giving the eggs more protection might explain the species’ success, the researchers say, even though the newborns emerge from their moms looking vulnerable and only half a millimeter long. You can feel them between your fingers “like grains of sand,” says Johannesson. “They simply creep out of the mother’s pocket, and quite often you can see them crawling around on her shell.” Mom may not help her offspring emerge, but she can provide their first breakfast: diatoms and bacteria ready to be scraped off her shell. Nom-nom!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The entire editorial board of a sociology journal has resigned after they say that the publisher, Springer Nature, installed new editors-in-chief without consulting the board &#8212; but Springer Nature says they tried unsuccessfully to engage the board on planning going back at least five years.</p>



<p>In December 2023, senior editors of the journal, <em>Theory and Society</em>, learned Springer Nature “had opted for a ‘completely different view’ of the journal going forward,” according to a message shared on a listserv for the American Sociological Association and published on the <a href="https://scatter.wordpress.com/2024/01/10/questions-for-the-new-theory-society-editorial-board/">blog Scatterplot</a>. The 10 senior editors subsequently resigned, they told their colleagues, but didn’t offer additional details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 4, the journal’s corresponding editors also resigned, according to a resignation letter shared with the sociology listserv. The corresponding editors cited Springer Nature’s decision to replace Janet Gouldner, the former executive editor (and widow of the journal’s founding editor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/10/obituaries/alvin-gouldner-60-a-radical-sociologist-dies-of-heart-attack.html">Alvin Gouldner</a>), without consulting the rest of the editorial board. They wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128611"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Springer Nature’s unyielding position on this was a clear violation of our profession’s academic norms and standards and was fundamentally at odds with the spirit of the journal. Given our long service and dedication to the journal, we were extremely disappointed that at no point in the publisher’s effort to install a new Executive Editor was a single one of the Senior Editors (nor, to our knowledge, any of the Corresponding Editors) consulted regarding their vision for the future of the journal. Additionally, their attempts to have input into the process of selecting new leadership for the journal were repeatedly rebuffed. We are unaware of any other publisher handling its relationship with an editorial board in such a dismissive fashion.</p>



<p>For us, this is not only about Theory and Society, but more broadly, the precedent of for-profit owners of academic journals unilaterally installing their selected editors. At stake here is how much control we academics are willing to give to for-profit publishers who have so much influence over our professional trajectories on the one hand and rely on our uncompensated labor on the other.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The mass resignation is the latest in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">growing list</a>, as academic researchers increasingly see themselves at odds with for-profit journal publishing companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teresa Krauss, Publishing Director for Humanities, Social, Behavioural and Health Sciences at Springer Nature, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have spent a number of years assessing the journal, including the authors’ experience of the journal, and considering whether its scope reflects changes in the discipline.&nbsp; Feedback from researchers suggested that the field was becoming more interdisciplinary, although the scope of the journal remained unchanged.&nbsp; We also received a sustained volume of correspondence from submitting authors over this time which expressed deep concerns regarding turnaround times for their submissions. We concluded that it was necessary to reduce turnaround times and to develop the journal to better serve our authors and the wider research community.</p>



<p>The decision to appoint a new Editor in Chief was not made lightly or without consultation. We recognise and are grateful for the many years of distinguished leadership of the journal by Dr Janet Gouldner, who had held the post since 1981. Discussions with Dr Gouldner regarding the need to find a successor, including whether one could be found from within the then Senior Editors, took place over several years but were unsuccessful. We also raised the issue of succession planning with five of the senior editors in 2019 in person, but they were unwilling to enter into discussions on the subject. Regretfully, eventually a decision had to be made to press ahead with appointing a successor with an editorial vision that reflected our shared goals for the journal.</p>



<p>We began working with the new Editors-in-Chief to recruit a new Editorial team after we received a letter of resignation from the previous Corresponding Editors. We are looking to internationalise and diversify the editorial board pool over the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The two new editors in chief, Kevin McCaffree, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Texas in Denton, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_H._Turner">Jonathan Turner</a> of the University of California, Riverside, have published a “<a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11186/updates/26605018">Statement of Goals for Theory and Society</a>,” subtitled “The Troubled State of Sociology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In it, they wrote that “a monoculture of critical approaches utterly dominate” their discipline, “and, though often well-intentioned, this monoculture is undermining sociology’s professional legitimacy.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is an unacceptable state of affairs and calls for a theory journal devoted to scientific sociological theorizing. Theorizing in sociology has always been eclectic, and we will continue this tradition, but what’s needed is a platform to unify these perspectives into a broad but disciplined scientific perspective. Theory and Society is now one of these platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new editors also promised “drastically shorter turnaround times for submitted papers,” special issues, and new article formats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many sociologists criticized the statement on X (formerly named Twitter):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh look the journal was taken over by people who want to push back against ideological research via their own very specific ideological view of science.<br><br>Even from a practical perspective this thing stinks.

<p>“Everyone knows that the review times were a bit crazy,” <a href="https://x.com/bhbradlow/status/1744369940025446902?s=20">wrote another sociologist</a>, “but that is surely no justification for this attack on intellectual independence by a for-profit publisher. This is a major loss.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2024/01/12/jonathan-turner-is-the-new-co-editor-of-theory-and-society-and-his-latest-diatribe-wont-surprise-you-at-all/">a blog post</a>, a sociologist at the University of Maryland described a recent paper by Turner as “a White-male-grievance monument to laziness and entitlement.”</p>



<p>“For both the way Springer handled it, and because of Turner’s attitude and the journal’s stated mission, I won’t be submitting to or reviewing for the journal (which, granted, I have yet to ever do, anyway), and suggest others follow suit,” Philip N. Cohen wrote.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">McCaffree told Retraction Watch he’d been invited to interview for the position. He said he was told “that turnaround times needed to be shortened and that the publishing vision needed to be more scientific, less political and more interdisciplinary.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Then we just got to work. The decision to remove the old board was made before I was asked to interview.</p>



<p>We do want to see the field improve along the lines suggested above, but that&#8217;s it. We don&#8217;t have any deeper agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think, with any widescale shift in a journal&#8217;s board and direction, some people will be upset. Others will be intrigued and motivated. But, frankly, Jon and I do not answer for Springer;&nbsp; their decision to change direction was theirs to make and – also – had the old board not resigned in a huff, we would have been happy to have many of them continue to serve.&nbsp; But, they did resign, and we respect that decision. Our only focus now is on finding and platforming the best sociological theory we can find.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turner told us he’d also been invited to edit the journal. He expected to “keep at least some of the board to sustain that part of the journal&#8217;s long-term tradition but add new members to reflect our desire to broaden the scope of theoretical approaches appearing in the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher, Turner said, “simply eliminated some [of] the board at the very time we were beginning to ask some to remain.” He and McCaffree have tried to bring some former board members back on, and recruit new members “that have a critical perspective,” he said, but they have refused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides assembling a new board, the incoming editors-in-chief are focused on going through a backlog of submissions, some over a year old, Turner said, to decide whether to send them out for review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turner said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I remain surprised and saddened about the reaction of the board that consisted of many fine scholars. I don&#8217;t quite see why they are so upset but I cannot do much to change their minds in what appears to be an attempt, I guess, to punish Springer. For Kevin and me, we just need to keep the journal going as editors; and, at least on my part, I am simply ignoring the controversy and hope that when our first issues come out, everyone will see that the journal is meeting its mission to publish theories relevant to understanding the organization of human societies.</p>

<p>Zulfiqar Habib, dean of computer science at COMSATS University Islamabad, in Pakistan, was appalled when he discovered part of a former PhD student’s dissertation had been published in a scientific journal.</p>



<p>After all, the former student, Kurshid Asghar, had been dead for more than a year by the time the manuscript was submitted to <em>Security and Communication Networks</em>, a Hindawi title. And Habib knew none of Asghar’s coauthors had contributed to the research, which Habib had supervised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was both shocking and unbelievable,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-128607"></span>



<p>Habib decided to share his concerns with Roberto Di Pietro, chief editor of <em>Security and Communication Networks</em>, in which <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/4270776/">the paper</a> had appeared in September 2021. What followed was a strange and opaque investigation, which Wiley, Hindawi’s parent company, now says had “some limitations” and is being revisited following Retraction Watch’s inquiry.</p>



<p>In a December 2021 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-2.pdf">email</a> to Di Pietro, Habib wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>May I have your attention on a very serious issue about academic fraud. A group of people has illegally published a research paper in your esteemed journal by stealing a chapter of PhD thesis … This paper is copied from Chapter 6 of PhD Thesis of Dr. Khurshid Asghar after his death without the consent and knowledge of his PhD supervisor (Dr. Zulfiqar Habib) and co-supervisor (Dr. Muhammad Hussain).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A research integrity specialist at Hindawi wrote back to inform Habib that, according to the authors, Asghar had shared his work with them:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>And while Dr Asghar wrote the original draft, they contributed to the article by editing this original draft with Dr Asghar prior to submission and then answering the reviewers comments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors were willing to add Habib to the author list, the Hindawi specialist said. But Habib demurred. Instead, he asked to see “documentary evidence” proving the authors weren’t just trying to “hide academic fraud and justify plagiarism.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In subsequent emails, the specialist told Habib the authors had submitted documentation for their claims but Habib couldn’t see it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>… as you are not conducting an official investigation into this allegation of research misconduct, we cannot share the evidence provided by the authors with you without the consent of all parties. We cannot obtain Dr Asghar&#8217;s consent and he is a party within the documentation provided.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Di Pietro chimed in to note that he found Zulfiqar’s point of view “quite reasonable” and suggested starting “an appropriate level of investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in June 2022, Hindawi shut down the case. As the research integrity specialist wrote in an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2.pdf">email</a> to Habib:</p>



<p><em>We have received notification that you have contacted COMSATS University Islamabad to request a formal investigation into the authorship of the article:</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Muhammad Hameed Siddiqi, Khurshed Asghar, Umar Draz, Amjad Ali, Madallah Alruwaili, Yousef Alhwaiti, Saad Alanazi, M. M.

<p>We have received the report from the committee formed to investigate this issue in which it was found that the article by Siddiqi et al. did not plagiarise other works. Given the outcome of the investigation, we are now closing this complaint.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>COMSATS University Islamabad did not reply to requests for comment. Nor did <a href="https://sa.linkedin.com/in/dr-muhammad-hameed-siddiqi-8317021b">Muhammad Hameed Siddiqi</a>, the paper’s first author, nor <a href="https://www.uosahiwal.edu.pk/depart-hod/information-technology">Umar Draz</a>, its corresponding author. </p>



<p>But in an email, a spokesperson for Wiley told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are aware of some limitations with the initial investigation and have re-opened the case. We will be reaching out to the parties involved to outline next steps and to ensure that an appropriate outcome is reached as promptly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They later added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We revisited the case as a result of this inquiry, and have decided to reopen it.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-largest-shark-fossil-long-body">Megalodon, the largest shark ever, may have been a long, slender giant</a></h4>

              
                <p>The largest shark discovered to date — the monstrous <em>Otodus megalodon </em>— may have been a sleek, long-bodied leviathan.</p>



<p>A fresh look at the extinct predator’s fossilized remains suggests <a href="https://doi.org/10.26879/1345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its body was many meters longer and possibly more slender than previous reconstructions</a>, researchers report January 22 in <em>Palaeontologia Electronica</em>. The findings may offer better <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/megalodon-sharks-predators-paleontology">insights into the biology and lifestyle</a> of megalodon, including how fast it swam or what it ate (<em>SN: 6/27/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reconstructing what ancient, extinct animals looked like when they were alive is challenging, even when complete fossilized remains are available. But reconstructing megalodon is much harder. Like all sharks, the giant had a cartilaginous skeleton that preserves poorly relative to bone. It is mostly known from teeth and many meters of fossilized, cartilaginous vertebrae, with the rest of the skeleton remaining a mystery.</p>



<p>Traditionally, modern great white sharks (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>) have been used as a model for megalodon’s body shape. That’s because great whites are the largest predatory sharks alive today and great whites and megalodons are categorized in somewhat closely related families.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm9424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 reconstruction</a> that extrapolated from great whites caught the attention of Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago, and his colleagues. That study based its reconstruction on the cartilaginous vertebral column of purported megalodon remains housed in a Belgian museum. Adding together all the vertebrae end-to-end revealed a body length of over 11 meters. But Shimada and his colleagues noticed that older work on that same specimen from the 1990s had calculated the entire animal’s length as about 9 meters. That work was based on the diameters of the vertebrae and how those scale with size in great white sharks, which tops out at around 6 meters long.&nbsp;But the 2022 study still assumed megalodon was more or less great white-shaped, Shimada and his colleagues argue.</p>



<p>In their reassessment of the Belgian megalodon specimen’s vertebral column and the 2022 reconstruction, Shimada and his team question relying on the shape of great white sharks to build our view of megalodon. Megalodon’s vertebral column is relatively thin compared with the sturdier vertebrae that support the beefy brawn of great whites, makos and other modern relatives, the team notes. The researchers offer a new interpretation: Because such a small vertebral column would make more sense in a longer, leaner body shape, megalodon may have been built more like a bus than a van.&nbsp;Overall, it may have been an even bigger predator than researchers thought, Shimada says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This study was “a major learning moment for both myself and many other scientists in that we need to take a broader perspective when reconstructing extinct animals, especially megalodon,” says coauthor Phillip Sternes, an organismal biologist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>



<p>A slender body may mean that megalodon wasn’t as powerful a swimmer as great whites are. This matches recent research from Shimada and his colleagues on the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08912963.2023.2211597?src=recsys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape of a megalodon scale</a> that suggested the shark was a slow cruiser capable of short bursts of speed.&nbsp;This shift in body shape may hint at how it ate or how much it ate, says paleontologist Dana Ehret of the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton, who was not involved in either work.</p>



<p>“When working with extinct species, especially ones that don&#8217;t have any close living relatives today, we do our best by estimating what they may have looked like or how they behaved but it is never exact,” he says.</p>



<p>The new study takes an interesting approach, says vertebrate paleontologist Michael Gottfried, but the researchers still rely on great white sharks as a model in some ways, like on patterns of the size of vertebrae in different parts of the shark’s body. Gottfried and his colleagues were the researchers who measured and reconstructed the Belgian specimen as roughly 9 meters long in the 1990s. He says he isn’t sure how accurately the vertebrae can be added up to a total length, because many of the vertebrae are incomplete or fragmentary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, we are still speculating on body form and many other aspects of megalodon,” says Gottfried, of Michigan State University in East Lansing. Additional fossil material from the head and fins would be crucial for understanding how the giant shark looked.</p>

                Leave a balloon out in the cold and it’ll shrink and look pathetic. Sorry, but that’s the law—the ideal gas law.

<p><strong>Happy leap second!</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/happy-leap-second"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 12, 1974</p>



<p>A “leap second” has been invented … to keep time signals used by navigators in step with the actual motion of the Earth. The latest leap second was celebrated New Year’s Eve at the stroke of midnight Greenwich Mean Time, when around the world … radio stations added an extra “beep” to their hourly time signals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Time is running out for the leap second. In 2022, metrologists <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2022/resolution-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to abandon the timekeeping quirk</a> by 2035. Unlike the leap year, which occurs every four years, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/leap-second-helps-us-reality-time">the leap second is deployed</a> whenever clocks need adjusting due to variations in Earth’s spin causing slight changes in the length of a day. Global officials have inserted a leap second 27 times since 1972. But satellites and other tech that rely on the precise time kept by atomic clocks <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leap-or-not-leap">can glitch when the clocks are adjusted</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/06, p. 248</em>). Scientists have suggested using a leap minute instead, which would require atomic clocks be reset once every 50 years or so.</p>

<p>New findings from a survey of psychology researchers show <a href="https://osf.io/pv7e2">nearly half of the respondents have encountered unethical authorship practices</a> in studies they have been involved in.</p>



<p>Researchers in Belgium surveyed more than 800 people involved in psychological research about their experiences with gift and ghost authorship, as well as the use of explicit authorship guidelines at their institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost half said they had witnessed gift authorship on more than one occasion – in other words, the respondents saw someone listed as an author when they had made little or no contribution to a paper. Ghost authorship –  excluding someone from a paper when they have made a significant contribution – was far less common, with fewer than one in five of the respondents reporting that they had dealt with the phenomenon. Since the authors used a convenience sample, the data show signs of authorship misconduct in psychology, but don’t tell the whole story. </p>



<span id="more-128594"></span>



<p>Gert Storms, a professor of psychology and educational sciences at KU Leuven, and an author of the paper, which was posted to the OSF Preprints server on December 11, says the science community pays little attention to inappropriate authorship compared with other misconduct, and the questionable practice goes largely unchecked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Storms says the manuscript of the survey’s results has been desk rejected three times. One editor cited concerns about informed consent. For that reason, the authors decided not to share the data openly, they said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These findings should be known,” Storms says. “I’m not concerned about getting it published in a way that gives me ‘a new publication with my name on it’. At my age, I just don’t care for that. It is the message.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Storms himself has witnessed several instances of undeserving bylines. Early in his career, somebody was given a byline on a paper Storms published even though they had made no contribution to the paper apart from applying for grant money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the survey did not ask respondents why they believed the authorship misconduct occurred, Storms says the practice is advantageous for the perpetrators. “It will affect research to a large extent because it determines how much research money and grants people get, who gets hired, who is kicked out of the race and so on,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gift authorship in particular helps researchers accumulate publications to their name – crucial to academic recognition for those pressured by the ‘publish or perish’ culture in academia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I see CVs where people have one paper every eight or nine days, what should one think about this?” Storms says.&nbsp; “Who has an idea that is worth putting on paper, and who contributes substantially to things that can be published every eight or nine days? That is simply impossible.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other research on questionable authorship practices indicates a much higher prevalence of gift and ghost authorship in the biomedical field compared with psychology. One study of biomedical researchers reported 75% of respondents had <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32958486/">experienced the addition of an undeserving author</a> to a paper they had worked on. The same survey found that more than 30% of respondents had encountered a ghost author – a practice that may be more frequent in a field with regular industry collaboration, Storms says. In some fields, “it&#8217;s simply better for the credibility of the findings that [some authors] are not mentioned,” he says. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Authorship criteria vary between institutions. The <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/standards-disclosures">American Psychological Association’s authorship standards</a> state that “substantial scientific contributions” warrant authorship of a paper; the <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines</a>, which are widely adopted by scientific journals, recommend authors should also draft or revise the work, in addition to having contributed substantially to the paper, among other criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Defining what is a substantial contribution can lead to debate,” says Steven De Peuter, a staff member of the Research Coordination Office at KU Leuven and an author of the paper. A recent study has <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198117">shown researchers often don’t agree</a> with what is enough of a contribution to deserve authorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new survey, each respondent was asked a series of questions about a paper they had recently published. When authorship guidelines – such as those developed by the APA or ICMJE – were not used to decide who should be an author on the paper, respondents were more likely to think that the decision was unfair. Likewise, if the respondents’ research setting did not encourage any authorship guidelines, they were more likely to believe the final authorship decisions weren’t a fair reflection of contribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the main point is that people need to be willing to discuss what the criteria are,” De Peuter says. “That also helps incredibly to establish an atmosphere of fairness and openness.” He also notes that authorship disputes often are a symptom of a pre-existing conflict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guidelines that require writing for authorship tend to exclude members of the research group&nbsp; with less tangible roles. For example, under ICMJE guidelines, “if I&#8217;m just a brilliant engineer who figured out how to get my machine to do the new trick, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily qualify me for authorship,” says Alex Holcombe, a professor of psychology at the University of Sydney and expert in authorship issues. “We&#8217;re stuck in a system that is not set up for indicating who did what.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contributorship – a system that categorizes each person’s contributions to a paper – is a more transparent approach, Holcombe argues. He backs the classification system CRediT, or the <a href="https://credit.niso.org/">Contributor Roles Taxonomy</a>, which includes roles such as software and visualization, as well as the more traditional roles of writing,conceptualization and funding acquisition. Thousands of journals have already adopted the system, but it exists alongside the traditional system of authorship and is not yet routine across the research landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authorship misconduct has been relatively overlooked compared with other types of research misconduct, Storms says. In the 1980s, William Bevan, then president of the American Psychological Association, said decisions about authorship, like those about sex, should “have a degree of intimacy about them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have the impression that the same attitude is still present in psychology,” Storms says. “And that&#8217;s really a shame.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-photo-galaxy-eht">Astronomers have snapped a new photo of the black hole in galaxy M87</a></h4>

              
                <p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-2" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-2"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-3" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-3">Heads up space</span></span> fans: A new picture of the supermassive black hole lurking in the galaxy M87 just dropped.</p>



<p>The new image looks a lot like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">the previous, headline-grabbing shot</a> revealed in 2019 (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). The main difference is that the brightest spot around the black hole <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/01/aa47932-23/aa47932-23.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shifted counterclockwise by about 30 degrees</a>, researchers report January 18 in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em>. This is probably due to material sloshing around in the black hole’s accretion disk as it gets consumed.</p>



<p>But other aspects have not changed. A bright ring and the black hole’s shadow appear almost exactly the same size as before. This helps confirm that M87’s black hole is the type predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity and not some more exotic or unexpected variety, says astrophysicist Lia Medeiros of Princeton University.</p>



<p>“In science, it&#8217;s always really important to do the same or similar experiments multiple times,” Medeiros says. It helps “make sure you&#8217;re not fooling yourself, and that your results are reproducible.”</p>



<p>Medeiros is part of an international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, which used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">a network of radio telescopes around the globe</a> to zoom in on M87’s heart, about 55 million light-years from Earth (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Previously, all images from the EHT — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">those of the supermassive black hole in our own galaxy’s center</a> — used data taken in 2017 or earlier (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>). The new picture is the first to incorporate observations from 2018.</p>

<p>In the interim, the EHT team added another telescope to their collection: the Greenland Telescope in northwestern Greenland.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enigma-pulsar-companion-mass-ticks">Astronomers are puzzled over an enigmatic companion to a pulsar</a></h4>

              
                <p>Circling around a pulsar in our galaxy is a mysterious entity that is either a very heavy neutron star, one of the lightest black holes ever discovered, or an exotic and never-before-seen quasi-stellar object.</p>



<p>The new finding comes from the MeerKAT Radio Telescope in South Africa, which carefully monitored 13 millisecond pulsars in a dense cluster of stars 40,000 light years from Earth. These pulsars are a type of neutron star that quickly spin, rotating in fractions of a second, while sending out powerful beams of radiation like a cosmic lighthouse.</p>



<p>For some pulsars, those beams flash past our planet with a regularity that rivals an atomic clock. By hunting for tiny variations in the beams’ arrival on Earth, researchers can deduce the existence of anything perturbing the pulsar’s motion.</p>



<p>The ticks of one particular pulsar, known as PSR J0514−4002E, revealed that it has an invisible companion <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg3005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighing between about 2.1 and 2.7&nbsp;times the mass of the sun</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 19 <em>Science</em>. That potentially makes it too heavy to be a neutron star, astronomer Ewan Barr of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, and colleagues say. Neutron stars are thought to collapse into black holes once <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heaviest-neutron-star-mass-sun-record-black-holes">they reach around two to three times the sun’s mass</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/22</em>). But because nobody knows exactly where that dividing line rests, nor precisely what happens once this limit is reached, the researchers can’t definitively say what this object is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers have discovered a handful of similar entities before, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-detected-collision-black-hole-mystery-object">one found using the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors</a> in 2020 (<em>SN: 6/23/20</em>). Barr and colleagues speculate that this new object formed when two lighter neutron stars crashed together. By studying the pulsar ticks more closely, the researchers hope to determine the hidden entity’s true nature and use it to probe matter in similarly extreme objects.</p>
