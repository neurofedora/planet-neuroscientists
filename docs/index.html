              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-otzi-iceman-dna-ancestry-genome">A new look at Ötzi the Iceman’s DNA reveals new ancestry and other surprises</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new look at the Iceman’s DNA reveals that his ancestors weren’t who scientists previously thought.</p>



<p>In 2012, scientists compiled a complete picture of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frozen-mummys-genetic-blueprints-unveiled">Ötzi’s genome</a>; it suggested that the frozen mummy found melting out of a glacier in the Tyrolean Alps had ancestors from the Caspian steppe (<em>SN: 2/28/12</em>). But something didn’t add up.</p>



<p>The Iceman is about 5,300 years old. Other people with steppe ancestry didn’t appear in the genetic record of central Europe until about 4,900 years ago. Ötzi  “is too old to have that type of ancestry,” says archaeogeneticist Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. The mummy &#8220;was always an outlier.&#8221;</p>





<p>Krause and colleagues put together a new genetic instruction book for the Iceman. The old genome was <a href="https://cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00174-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily contaminated</a> with modern people’s DNA, the researchers report August 16 in <em>Cell Genomics</em>. The new analysis reveals that “the steppe ancestry is completely gone.”</p>



<p>But the Iceman still has oddities. About 90 percent of Ötzi’s genetic heritage comes from Neolithic farmers, an unusually high amount compared with other Copper Age remains, Krause says.</p>



<p>The Iceman’s new genome also reveals he had male-pattern baldness and much darker skin than artistic representations suggest. Genes conferring light skin tones didn’t become prevalent until 4,000 to 3,000 years ago when early farmers started eating plant-based diets and didn’t get as much vitamin D from fish and meat as hunter-gathers did, Krause says.</p>



<p>As Ötzi and other ancient people’s DNA illustrate, the skin color genetic changes took thousands of years to become commonplace in Europe.</p>



<p>“People that lived in Europe between 40,000 years ago and 8,000 years ago were as dark as people in Africa, which makes a lot of sense because [Africa is] where humans came from,” he says. “We have always imagined that [Europeans] became light-skinned much faster. But now it seems that this happened actually quite late in human history.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnet-rust-nanoparticles-estrogen-out-water">Magnetic ‘rusty’ nanoparticles pull estrogen out of water</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new “smart rust” could one day help pull pollutants out of waterways, leaving cleaner water behind.</p>



<p>Researchers adorned tiny particles of iron oxide, better known as rust, with “sticky” molecules that <a href="https://acs.digitellinc.com/live/30/page/975/1?eventSearchInput=3907631&amp;eventSearchDateTimeStart=&amp;eventSearchDateTimeEnd=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grab on to estrogen and similar hormones in water samples</a>. A magnet can then remove both the particles and the trapped pollutants from the water, materials scientist Lukas Müller reports August 16 in San Francisco at a meeting of the American Chemical Society.</p>





<p>The new technology could potentially limit excess estrogen’s harmful effects on animals, especially those that live in waterways.</p>



<p>With the nanoparticles, &#8220;we are able … to clean very different kinds of environmental pollutants,” says Müller, of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany.</p>



<p>Estrogen hormones typically enter waterways through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hormones-heres-beef">humans’ and other animals’ waste</a> (<em>SN: 1/2/02</em>). Even low concentrations can have harmful chronic effects on aquatic life, like higher instances of cancer or reproductive issues, says Konrad Wojnarowski, a biologist at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München who was not involved in the study. Wastewater treatment plants can remove some estrogen hormones, he says, but the process isn’t cheap or energy efficient.</p>



<p>For now, “we still don’t have an ideal way of dealing with estrogen pollution in the environment,” but nanoparticles could help, Wojnarowski says.</p>



<p>To build the estrogen-catching particles, Müller and Marcus Halik, a chemist also at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität, drew on prior experience designing iron oxide nanoparticles that can catch other kinds of pollutants like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/oil-magnets">oil</a> or herbicides (<em>SN: 7/25/08</em>). The tiny iron oxide cores are each about 10 nanometers in diameter. Each core is then covered in phosphonic acid molecules, which act like sticky hairs that scoop up contaminants.</p>



<p>The new version of the nanoparticles specifically targets estrogen by including two types of phosphonic acid. One kind is long, repels water and attaches to the neutrally charged part of the estrogen molecule. The other is positively charged to attract parts of estrogen hormones that carry a slight negative charge.</p>



<p>The smart rust removed much of the estrogen from small water samples prepared in the lab, the researchers found. Their next step is to test the nanoparticles on samples from actual waterways.</p>



<p>And the team is investigating exactly how the molecules on the nanoparticle surfaces grab and hold on to estrogen at the atomic scale. With this information, Halik says, they can improve the estrogen binding even more.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/run-two-hour-marathon-drafting-pacers-eliud-kipchoge">How to run a marathon in under two hours</a></h4>

              
                <p>In an unofficial race in Vienna in 2019, Kenyan long-distance runner Eliud Kipchoge became the first person ever to run a marathon in under two hours. A new study shows how teamwork made that feat possible.</p>



<p>Kipchoge ran with a rotating posse of pacers, other runners who deflected some of his air resistance in a process known as drafting. Now, wind tunnel tests with action-figure manikins suggest that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2022.0836" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those pacers saved him 3 minutes and 33 seconds</a> — dropping him below the two-hour mark to 1:59:40 — researchers report August 16 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society A</em>. An alternative configuration of pacers could have given Kipchoge an even bigger boost, cutting an additional 49 seconds, the team proposes.</p>





<p>Elite marathon runners are often accompanied by team members who swap in and out to keep them on pace. Scientists know from experiments on live participants and from computer simulations that running between these pacers can reduce an athlete’s drag.</p>



<p>In the new study, mechanical engineer Massimo Marro of the École Centrale de Lyon in France and colleagues measured the drag force felt by manikins in a wind tunnel, which allowed the team to test different drafting configurations readily. Inside the tunnel, the team replicated Kipchoge’s 2019 formation, which featured five pacers in a V in front with two more in the rear. This arrangement reduced about half the drag felt by the athlete — enough to trim about three and a half minutes off his time, the team found. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Testing different formations of action-figure manikins in a wind tunnel shows how setting up a phalanx of pacers can diminish drag from air resistance, allowing a runner to go faster. In a set-up (left) mirroring the runners in Eliud Kipchoge’s unofficial sub-two-hour 2019 marathon in Vienna, five manikins create a V in front of the runner (gray circle).&nbsp;A   formation that deploys the five forward pacers in more of a lowercase-t formation (right) is even more optimal, the researchers demonstrate.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">Credit: École Centrale de Lyon/LMFA UMR 5509</p>
</div>



<p>The researchers also identified three new formations that could further maximize performance.</p>



<p>Rather than a V, the winning design sets the five pacers in front in a formation shaped like a lowercase t: one pacer behind another, followed by two side-by-side, and then one more behind that pair. The researchers estimated the drag Kipchoge would have felt running alone at his marathon speed to calculate the predicted savings from this new formation: 4 minutes, 22 seconds.</p>





<p>“You can sort of slice through the air with a narrower wedge” using this formation, says Rodger Kram, a physiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved with the research. “That’s quite innovative.”</p>



<p>While official races typically allow runners only two or three pacers, Kram suggests competing athletes could make use of “cooperative drafting” —&nbsp;taking turns coasting in each other’s shadows to boost performance.</p>



<p>In September, Kipchoge and his competitors will attempt to break the two-hour barrier in a professional race for the first time in Berlin, where in 2018 Kipchoge set the current official record of 2:01:39.</p>



<p>“The limit is close, but it’s not reached,” Marro says. “These collaborative strategies could help to improve the record.”</p>

                <p>In what seems like something out of a sci-fi movie, scientists have plucked the famous Pink Floyd song “Another Brick in the Wall” from individuals’ brains. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Using electrodes, computer models and brain scans, researchers previously have been able to decode and reconstruct individual <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-reads-peoples-thoughts">words</a> and entire <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscientists-decoded-thoughts-brain-scans">thoughts</a> from people’s brain activity (<em>SN: 11/15/22; SN: 5/1/23</em>).</p>



<p>The new study, published August 15 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>, adds music into the mix, showing that songs can also be decoded from brain activity and revealing <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how different brain areas pick up an array of acoustical elements</a>.

<p>People listened to Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” song while having their brain activity monitored. Using that data and a computer model, researchers were able to reconstruct sounds that resemble the song.</p>

<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">L. Bellier <I>et al</I>/<I>PLOS Biology</i> 2023 <a />(CC-BY 4.0)</a></div>
</div>



<p>To decode the song, neuroscientist Ludovic Bellier of the University of California, Berkeley and colleagues analyzed the brain activity recorded by electrodes implanted in the brains of 29 individuals with epilepsy. While in the hospital undergoing monitoring for the disorder, the individuals listened to the 1979 rock song.</p>



<p>People&#8217;s nerve cells, particularly those in auditory areas, responded to hearing the song, and the electrodes detected not only neural signals associated with words but also rhythm, harmony and other musical aspects, the team found. With that information, the researchers developed a computer model to reconstruct sounds from the brain activity data, and found that they could produce sounds that resemble the song. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a real tour de force,” says Robert Zatorre, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal who was not involved in the study. “Because you’re recording the activity of neurons directly from the brain, you get very direct information about exactly what the patterns of activity are.”</p>





<p>The study highlights which parts of the brain respond to different elements of music. For example, activity in one area within the superior temporal gyrus, or STG, located in the lower middle of each side of the brain, intensified at the onset of specific sounds, such as when a guitar note played. Another area within the STG increased and kept its activity up when vocals were used.</p>



<p>The STG on the right side of the brain, but not the left, seemed to be crucial in decoding music. When the researchers removed information from that brain area in the computer model, it decreased the accuracy of the song reconstruction.</p>



<p>“Music is a core part of human experience,” says Bellier, who has been playing instruments since he was 6 years old. “Understanding how the brain processes music can really tell us about human nature. You can go to a country and not understand the language, but be able to enjoy the music.”</p>



<p>Continuing to probe musical perception is likely to be difficult because the brain areas that process it are hard to access without invasive methods. And Zatorre wonders about the broader application of the computer model, trained on just one song. “Does [it] work on other kinds of sounds, like a dog barking or phone ringing?” he asks.</p>



<p>The goal, Bellier says, is to eventually be able to decode and generate natural sounds in addition to music. In the shorter term, incorporating the more musical elements of speech, including pitch and timbre, into brain-computer devices could help individuals with brain lesions or paralysis or other conditions communicate better.</p>

<p>Common mental health disorders, or CMDs, such as anxiety, depression and stress significantly contribute to workplace absences. Intervention programmes have been employed in workplaces to aid people with a history of or presently experiencing mental health issues but present some limitations, among which is the identification of staff experiencing CMDs.</p>
<p>Prevail is presented as a new intervention strategy that focuses instead on the whole workforce, aiming to increase the overall mental wellbeing of employees. The aims of the new programme include reducing the stigma of mental health, increasing the level of awareness of mental health issues, educating staff to manage mental health issues within the workplace and encouraging people to disclose potential issues they are experiencing.</p>
<p>In this study, the delivery of the Prevail intervention was very well received, with 81% of the participants stating it was helpful in improving their own mental health. While there was no distinct effect on the level of stigma towards others, evidence suggests that the Prevail intervention is successful in reducing self- and anticipated stigma and social distance from people with mental health issues. In addition, a reduction in levels of sickness absence was observed between the pre- and post-intervention periods.</p>
<p>This study presents a novel approach to tackling common mental health disorders in the work environment by addressing the whole workforce and shows its effectiveness in improving their overall mental wellbeing.</p>

<p>The Triassic period (252-201 million years ago) separates the Permian and the Jurassic Periods and marks the start of the Mesozoic Era. It followed the most devastating mass extinction event in history. This Period was characterised by the expansion and diversification of reptiles and saw the first appearance of dinosaurs, belonging to the Archosauria.</p>
<p>Phytosaurs, also archosauromorphs, were mostly semi-aquatic reptiles and fossil record allowed to determine they were spread across the Pangea. In this study, phylogenetic analysis allowed to determine that a partial skull and bone fragments collected in 1974 in Nova Scotia, Canada belong to a new phytosaur genus and species, named <em>Jupijkam paleofluvialis</em>. The biogeographic reconstructions show that this new species is one of the youngest phytosaur lineage to have been identified.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis also allowed to infer that climate events, in particular related to an arid central belt, were important determinants not only in the spreading of phytosaurs, but in establishing the biogeography of vertebrates in the Triassic Period.</p>

<p>Medication adherence is a key determinant of treatment success. Additional, unnecessary treatment may be needed as a consequence of non-adherence, leading to increased patient discomfort as well as financial costs. Being able to efficiently estimate adherence means also being able to determine the associated costs and identify patients most at risk of non-adherence.</p>
<p>Data mining of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is an opportunity to expand adherence estimation to large scale groups, but consensus on the best method to do so is lacking.</p>
<p>This study compared different adherence measures using a Scottish EHR dataset for asthma medication. Of the eight Continuous, Multiple Interval, Measures of Medication Availability (CMAs) that were assessed, CMAs 1 to 4 calculate the amount of medication obtained over a certain period, while CMAs 5 to 8 are based on the timing of the prescriptions. In the context of the study, CMA7 and 8 proved reliable in estimating current adherence based on data from the previous year.</p>
<p>This study highlights key considerations to take into account when designing medication adherence estimates and provides a rule-based data extraction method which can be adapted to different conditions and regimens.</p>

<p>Merlot, a cross between Cabernet Franc and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes, is one of the most extensive wine cultivations in the world. Merlot, and grapevine in general, genome mapping and chimera identification can be helpful elements in selection and conservation efforts. Grapevine chimeras are an important element of viticulture and more specifically periclinical chimeras, where the somatic variation is present throughout the cell layer, are of particular interest due to their stability and their ability to be propagated through cuttings.</p>
<p>In this study, a method for genome sequencing and chimera identification is presented based on long reads sequencing, trio binning and organ comparison. A total of 51 and 53 chimeras originating from SNVs in non-repeated sequences were identified in Merlot Haplotype CF and Merlot Haplotype MG, respectively. Haplotype comparison yielded 3.5 million variants between Merlot-leaf-hap-MG or Merlot-root-hap-MG and Merlot-root-hap-CF pseudo-molecules – mostly Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs).</p>
<p>These findings not only are significant for the cultivation of Merlot wine, but have a wider application for viticulture and plant breeding and conservation.</p>

<p>Low-income or resource-limited settings struggle to access adequate technologies to ensure a timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory infections in children. Lack of resources impact the clinical training necessary for the operation of a standard stethoscope, making the assessment of symptoms challenging. A digital stethoscope prototype was developed to address such challenges, and in this study its usability and uptake were assessed in rural areas of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The study involved both parents and community healthcare providers, aiming to identify the level of acceptance of the prototype use and its practical performance.</p>
<p>There was positive feedback on acceptance and the healthcare providers were happy with the level of training and support they received ahead of and during the enrolment. Issues were also reported, in relation to both the implementation and technological aspects. These included inability to charge the device due to lack of electricity, having to transport the device as such an expensive piece of kit cannot be stored in the clinic, and technical problems such as lack of visual cues and unwanted recording, which also raises privacy concerns.</p>
<p>This study provides valuable feedback on practical aspects of the implementation of digital devices in resource-limited settings and insights into areas with improvement potential.</p>

<p>Talk about artificial intelligence. Fifteen studies published in various journals name a mysterious computer scientist as an author. </p>



<p>The problem? He doesn’t seem to exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragan Rodriguez is listed as being affiliated with Case Western Reserve University, but an official at the Cleveland institution told a sleuth no one of that name has been associated with the university.</p>



<p>The studies on which Rodriguez’s name appears range in topic from cancer detection to &#8220;renewable energy systems optimization.&#8221; The papers were published since 2018 in 10 journals from four major scientific publishers since 2018, including the <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy </em>and the <em>Journal of Building Engineering</em>, which have both historically had impact factors above 7, and&nbsp; <em>Applied Energy</em>, whose impact factor has been above 11. They have been cited a total of 232 times.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127713"></span>



<p>Alexander Magazinov, a researcher and scientific sleuth, told Retraction Watch he noticed Rodriguez’s name while searching for papers that over-cited beneficiaries of a potential citation ring that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/17/journal-to-retract-papers-that-cost-its-impact-factor/">cost two journals their impact factors</a> earlier this year. The papers are associated with an operation Elizabeth Bik has dubbed the “<a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2022/09/15/the-iranian-plants-paper-mill/">Iranian plant paper mill</a>,” and the authors include Majid Khayatnezhad, a researcher at Islamic Azad University in Iran. Khayatnezhad has denied benefiting from a citation ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov said he was looking at papers that gave an unusual amount of citations to Noradin Ghadimi, a researcher at Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University in Turkey. Ghadimi, who did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch, is a frequent co-author with Khayatnezhad and another potential citation ring beneficiary, said Magazinov. He told us:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>With that in mind, I tried to locate other papers that over-cite Ghadimi, and thus found &#8220;Rodriguez&#8221;. This combination of a South Slavic given name and a Spanish surname is weird; also weird is the total absence of domestic collaboration of this allegedly US-based &#8220;researcher&#8221;.</em></p>



<p>The practice of listing gift, guest, or honorary authors, who usually have made <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/15/i-never-asked-or-expected-to-be-included-as-an-author-retired-penn-state-prof-has-three-retractions-for-manipulated-peer-review/">minimal or no contribution</a> to the paper, is common in academic publishing, although it generally is considered unethical or at least questionable. The custom does not typically extend to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/18/another-whodunit-the-author-no-one-can-find/">fabricating a researcher’s entire identity.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rodriguez is not listed as a corresponding author on any of the 15 studies that bear his name and has no profile or listing of any kind on Case Western’s website. Although he is listed on some studies as being affiliated with the university’s “Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,” the corresponding department at the school is the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering.</p>



<p>Magazinov emailed Case Western asking if anyone with this name had ever worked at the university, and, if so, for the institution to investigate his work. In an email seen by Retraction Watch, Tracy J. Wilson-Holden, assistant vice president of research integrity, told him:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Upon a thorough review of Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) records, it was determined that Dragan Rodriguez is not, and never has been, a member of the CWRU community as faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, student or volunteer</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov forwarded the email to the journals that had published papers on which Rodriguez is listed as an author, writing that Wilson-Holden’s statement meant that “it is beyond reasonable doubt that [Rodriguez’s] affiliation is falsified, and it is quite likely that the identity is also fictional.”</p>



<p>The studies that Rodriguez is listed as an author on are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retraction Watch could not contact Rodriguez due to his email address not being listed on any study, university or researcher profile, or website. Magazinov told us he also has been unable to find a valid email address for Rodriguez or any other way to contact him directly. Several of Rodriguez’ co-authors failed to respond to requests from Retraction Watch for comment about how he ended up on the papers in question.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/macaques-puerto-rico-shade-hurricane-maria">Macaques in Puerto Rico learned to share shade after Hurricane Maria</a></h4>

              
                <p>After Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico in 2017, monkeys living there forged new bonds to share a suddenly scarce resource: shade.</p>



<p>Rhesus macaques (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>) that were willing to hang out with others <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.17.549328v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted their chance of survival</a> in the storm’s aftermath, researchers report July 24 at bioRxiv.org. That newfound sociability may have allowed multiple animals to escape the scorching heat of the day beneath any trees left standing, and any other source of shade they could find.</p>





<p>Amid Hurricane Maria’s heavy rain and furious winds — coming just two weeks after Hurricane Irma dumped a heavy deluge of rain — trees and other plants across Puerto Rico toppled. Nearly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-hurricane-maria-heavy-rains-devastated-puerto-rico-forests">a quarter of Puerto Rico’s total forest biomass</a> was demolished (<em>SN: 3/17/20</em>). Cayo Santiago, a once lush key located off Puerto Rico’s coast, was left largely barren after it lost nearly two-thirds of its vegetation.</p>



<p>More than five years later, Cayo Santiago’s flora hasn’t recovered, says Camille Testard, a behavioral ecologist and neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania. As of April 2023, the tiny island hosted fewer than 600 living trees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3130228" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-1a.jpg?ssl=1" alt="A satellite photo of Cayo Santiago seen before Hurricane Maria with trees and abundant shade to assist macaques." width="680" height="800" class="image-compare__image-before" /><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3130229" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-1b.jpg?ssl=1" alt="A satellite photo of Cayo Santiago seen after Hurricane Maria with a distinct lack of trees and other forms of shade to assist macaques." width="680" height="800" class="image-compare__image-after" /></div><figcaption>Before Hurricane Maria, trees and shade were abundant on Cayo Santiago (left, February 2017). More than five years after the storm, vegetation hasn’t recovered and shade is a scarce resource (right, March 2023).<span class="credit">Left: Google Earth</span><span class="credit">Right: Google Earth</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But a colony of around 1,600 macaques, managed by the University of Puerto Rico’s Caribbean Primate Research Center, also calls Cayo Santiago home. Without much remaining tree cover, the destructive hurricane left many monkeys searching for shady relief from temperatures that regularly exceed 40° Celsius (104° Fahrenheit). Some of that shade now comes in smaller forms: from boulders, water basins or even human shadows.</p>



<p>“If you’re collecting data on the island, you’re gonna have monkeys that are sitting in your shade and following you around,” Testard says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Hurricane Maria, the macaques, typically hierarchal animals, could often be found fighting over food, status or mates. But immediately after the storm, the macaques <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00368-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded their social network to form new relationships</a>, Testard and colleagues reported in 2021. While monkey fights still happen, they aren’t as common as before. These new friendships meant more access to shade in tight places, the team hypothesized. But it lacked the data to back it up.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers examined interactions within groups of monkeys over a 10-year span, five years before and five years after the hurricane. During that decade, the team analyzed monkey groups in 10-minute increments from 6:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. (One year, 2020, was excluded because of the COVID-19 pandemic.)</p>



<p>After Hurricane Maria, from 2018 to 2022, the animals spent more time in close company in the heat of the afternoon compared with relatively cooler mornings, the team found. The recorded interactions don’t specifically note whether the monkeys were sitting in shade or sun, says coauthor Lauren Brent, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Exeter in England. But more social monkeys were less likely to die in the five years after the storm, which suggests that afternoon gatherings took place in the shade, so the animals might cool down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="700" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2.jpg" alt="A photo of several macaques lined up in the shade of a bare tree trunk." class="wp-image-3130230" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2-372x383.jpg 372w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2-437x450.jpg 437w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2-181x186.jpg 181w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080423_eg_social_macaques_inline-2-563x580.jpg 563w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130230">Macaques line up in the shade of a bare tree trunk to escape the heat of the day in July 2019.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130230">Sébastian Tremblay</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The findings are a “wonderful” example showing how behavior can be an important factor for survival as environments change, says Richard Buchholz, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Because researchers on Cayo Santiago ensure macaques have food and water, it’s unclear whether the same might happen in a group of wild monkeys, he says. But “it’s exciting that [the researchers have] shown this impact on mortality.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that the boost in sociality comes not from a benefit of being tolerant of their primate peers after a natural disaster, but because there’s a cost to being intolerant, Buchholz says. “We tend to get lethargic when things get superhot.” The animals may be calmly sitting together in the shade so as not to raise their metabolisms, “avoiding the metabolic cost of chasing after somebody and building up more heat that you’ll have to get rid of somehow.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>There could also be other consequences to monkey gatherings. In a separate study, posted July 19 to bioRxiv.org, Testard, Brent and colleagues used computer simulations to show that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.17.549341v1.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becoming more social may increase the risk that infectious diseases</a> will spread.</p>



<p>“So even if you’re really flexible, and you’re able … to adapt to this new environment, the way that you have to adapt actually makes you more vulnerable to other external shocks to the system,” Testard says. “I think that needs to be kept in mind when we think about the effects of natural disasters on wildlife health.”</p>

<p>A law firm that holds a mortgage on the house of Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University, may foreclose on the property, a judge has ruled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Croce hired James E. Arnold and Associates to represent him in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/19/osu-cancer-researcher-carlo-croce-loses-appeal-of-new-york-times-libel-suit/">libel case</a> against the <em>New York Times</em> and a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/04/litigious-osu-professor-loses-appeal-in-federal-defamation-case/">defamation case</a> against <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">David Sanders</a>, a professor of biological sciences at Purdue University who became something of a public nemesis for the Ohio scientist after pointing out problems in Croce’s published work. Croce also needed representation for Ohio State’s research misconduct investigation, and a suit attempting to <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/18/embattled-cancer-researcher-loses-legal-bid-to-be-reinstated-as-department-chair-at-osu/">stop the university</a> from removing him as chair of the department of cancer biology and genetics. </p>



<p>Croce lost each case. Ohio State’s investigation <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02002-5">found problems</a> with how he managed his lab that did not amount to research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127710"></span>



<p>Arnold and Associates was the second firm Croce hired, after his original lawyers at <a href="https://www.keglerbrown.com/">Kegler Brown Hill &amp; Ritter</a> dropped his cases and sued him because he wasn’t paying his bills. Last December, a judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/09/judge-orders-osu-cancer-researcher-to-pay-1-million-to-lawyers-from-failed-libel-suit/">ordered</a> Croce to pay Kegler Brown nearly $1.1 million. To enforce the judgment, Ohio State has been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/judge-orders-cancer-researchers-art-collection-seized-to-pay-fees-from-failed-libel-suit/">garnishing his wages</a>, and Kegler Brown has filed a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/230731-motion-to-sell-artwork.pdf">motion</a> for the court to allow Sotheby’s to handle the sale of pieces from Croce’s collection of Renaissance artwork, which the county sheriff seized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After also ceasing to pay Arnold’s fees, according to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/arnold-v-croce.pdf">lawsuit</a> Arnold later filed, Croce agreed to put up his house <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/croce-arnold-note.pdf">as collateral</a> for continued representation, but still didn’t pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/230712-Arnold-decision.pdf">decision</a> dated July 12, judge Jeffrey M. Brown granted Arnold a favorable summary judgment in three counts of the firm&#8217;s suit against Croce, as well as finding that the firm has “met the requirements to foreclose” on Croce’s house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reached by phone, Arnold confirmed, “I intend to sell his house if he doesn’t pay his debt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of publication, Zillow <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2140-Cambridge-Blvd-Upper-Arlington-OH-43221/33990724_zpid/">values Croce’s house at $3.2 million</a>.</p>



<p>The court will hold a hearing on December 4 for a magistrate to determine the amount Croce owes Arnold’s firm, which Arnold estimated to be about $650,000 in original fees, plus interest that has been accruing at 21% per year, reaching “probably north of $500,000.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the magistrate or a jury decides how much Croce owes Arnold, foreclosure can proceed, unless Croce appeals the decision and provides a bond guaranteeing that a third party will pay his debt if he loses, Arnold said. He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It would be wise for him to start to liquidate some of his artwork to pay his debts, otherwise he won’t have any place to put it.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-adults-50-colorectal-cancer-warning">Why are more people under 50 getting colorectal cancer? Scientists have some clues</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abdominal pain is one clue something could be wrong. Changing bowel movements may be another. Other people might notice blood in their stool. Doctors may chalk that symptom up to hemorrhoids, but for some people, it’s a sign of something more insidious: early-onset colorectal cancer. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the patients that Thejus Jayakrishnan sees are in their 30s or 40s, establishing themselves in their careers and perhaps settling down in a new house with young kids at home. When they find out they have colorectal cancer, they’re shocked, he says. “It’s not something you expect.” In some cases, the cancer, which takes root in the large intestine, has already spread through the body and encroached on the liver or lungs.</p>





<p>Though the number of colorectal cancer cases among people under 50 has been rising for decades, younger and middle-aged adults’ symptoms can still go overlooked, says Jayakrishnan, a physician at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. These people aren’t in the age group that doctors tend to be concerned about, he says.</p>



<p>That’s also been the experience of Christopher Lieu, a medical oncologist at the University of Colorado Cancer Center in Aurora. “For the last 10 years of my career, all my patients were told, ‘You&#8217;re just too young to have colorectal cancer. Don&#8217;t worry about it.’” In a June talk at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, Lieu noted that, by 2030, colorectal cancer could be the number one cause of cancer death in people ages 20 to 49. “This is a humongous issue,” he said.</p>



<p>In 2018, the American Cancer Society updated its guidelines to reflect the changing incidence of the disease. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experts-advise-start-colorectal-screening-45-not-50">Screening should begin at 45 years old rather than 50</a>, the organization now recommends (<em>SN: 5/31/18</em>). But younger people with early-onset colorectal cancer may still be falling through the cracks, says Yin Cao, a cancer epidemiologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “At least 50 percent of these cases are under age 45,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists don’t know what’s driving the disease’s increase in younger adults, but they’ve been looking for answers. Recent research is beginning to reveal some hints, though the picture remains murky.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Cao and Jayakrishnan are looking for ways to identify the disease earlier, before it has advanced to other parts of the body. Cao’s team recently identified warning symptoms linked to the early-onset cancer. And Jayakrishnan presented a small study at the June ASCO meeting that suggests there may be metabolic differences between people with early-onset and average-onset tumors.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with these and other doctors about what they’re learning about early-onset colorectal cancer and what questions remain. Here are three key aspects of the disease that they wish more people knew.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More younger adults are getting colorectal cancer, a trend that’s occurring around the world.</h4>



<p>Historically, in the United States, colorectal cancer has been a disease of older people, Cao says. But in 2017, a landmark study marked a change in who was getting diagnosed.</p>



<p>Though older individuals still made up most cases, scientists noted that, from 2000 to 2013, colorectal cancer incidence among people ages 50 to 64 had meandered downward. In people 65 and older, the rate had plunged. But there had been a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colorectal-cancer-rise-among-younger-adults">22 percent increase in cases in people under 50</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/17</em>). Whereas 59 new cases were diagnosed out of every million younger people at the start of that period, the rate had risen to 72 out of a million by the end. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really alarming because we saw this rising incidence in younger adults,” Cao says, and for a disease that hadn’t typically affected a younger population.</p>





<p>The data reflected what doctors were seeing in the clinic, Lieu says. Looking back through the decades, scientists can track the rise’s origin to the late 1980s. Seeing the numbers creep up for a few years might have been a blip, but “what’s concerning is that [the trend] doesn’t seem to be reversing,” Lieu says. In fact, “this problem continues to get worse.” And it appears to be occurring more or less globally. Other high-income countries, including Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, mirror the rise.</p>



<p>Scientists have noticed that people born in more recent generations tend to have a greater risk of developing colorectal cancer than people born in earlier generations, what’s known as a birth cohort effect. That means someone who turns 40 today is more at risk than someone who turned 40 a decade ago, Lieu says. The pattern, and the fact that most early-onset cases lack a hereditary link, has doctors and scientists scrambling to answer a singular question: “What are younger individuals being exposed to that could account for that risk?” he asks.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Many factors may be driving the increase in early-onset colorectal cancer.</h4>



<p>It’s not easy to take a magnifying glass to people’s lives and deduce what may be causing their disease. Sifting through a person’s diet history and past environmental exposures is complicated, Lieu says. “People have difficulty remembering what they ate yesterday, let alone their entire lives.”</p>



<p>That’s one reason the early-onset colorectal cancer picture is still so cloudy. Today, scientists are investigating an assortment of potential disease drivers, including obesity, antibiotics, the gut microbiome, alcohol intake, delivery by cesarean section and a diet rich in red meat and sugar.</p>



<p>Cao’s team, for example, has linked drinking <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/12/2330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sugar-sweetened beverages to an increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer in women</a>. Her group and others have also reported a connection between the disease and <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/6/1147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people with metabolic syndrome</a> (which can include conditions like high blood pressure and excess belly fat) as well as those <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/113/5/543/5951179?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who eat a Western diet</a>, among other factors.</p>



<p>Other teams have pointed out alterations in the gut microbiome in people with early-onset disease. They have a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.1036946/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different community of gut microbes</a> compared with people diagnosed later in life, a 2022 study suggested. Though many scientists are exploring the microbiome’s role in early-onset colorectal cancer, so far “nothing definitive has been determined,” says Cathy Eng, a medical oncologist at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That seems to be true of the many potential risk factors scientists have identified. It’s also possible that younger generations are somehow more susceptible to environmental insults that kick colorectal cancer into action. “I think it&#8217;s really hard to draw a conclusion at this point,” Cao says. Lieu agrees. Scientists are still “at the hypothesis-generating stage,” he says.</p>



<p>Some data can even be downright confusing. One study linked <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/11/1971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oral antibiotic use with an increased risk of colon cancer yet a reduced risk of rectal cancer</a>. “Even in the same study, you’re getting two very different answers,” Lieu says.</p>



<p>And the diet and obesity-related risk factors are not one-size-fits-all. In Lieu’s experience in Colorado, many of his young colorectal cancer patients are otherwise “incredibly healthy,” he says. “They’re [Division 1] athletes; they’re triathletes; they’re pretty remarkable.”</p>



<p>A combination of different factors working together may set off early-onset colorectal cancer, and the recipe may vary among individuals. Doctors want to be able to say, “If we stop doing this one thing, then we can prevent the cancer,” Lieu says. But, he adds, “I don’t think there’s going to be a single smoking gun.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Four ‘red flag’ symptoms may be signs of early-onset colorectal cancer.</h4>



<p>Though scientists have not pinned down a single, definitive cause of early-onset colorectal cancer, they have identified some early warning signs.</p>



<p>Up to two years before their diagnosis, people with the disease may experience <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djad068/7147891?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, diarrhea and iron-deficiency anemia</a>, Cao’s team reported in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> in May.</p>



<p>The researchers trawled through insurance claim data from more than 27,000 people with and without the disease. They were looking for patterns in patients’ records — telltale symptoms documented in people under 50 who were later diagnosed with the cancer. The four signs Cao’s team identified stood out because they seemed specific to early-onset cases, and they often preceded a diagnosis by months to years. Unexplained weight loss could also be a symptom to look out for, Lieu says.</p>



<p>Knowing and spotting the warning signs could help people get a jump on the disease. In one 2019 survey of nearly 1,200 early-onset patients and survivors, <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/79/13_Supplement/3347/635227/Abstract-3347-Young-onset-colorectal-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 7 out of 10 were diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease</a>, when their cancer had already grown into neighboring tissues or spread to distant locales in the body. Patients often waited months before seeing their doctor and then visited multiple doctors before receiving a correct diagnosis.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Four ‘red flag’ signs of colorectal cancer</h4>



<p>Scientists have identified some warning signs of early-onset colorectal cancer, which can affect younger and middle-aged adults. Knowing and spotting the warning signs could help people get a jump on the disease. Four potential &#8220;red flag&#8221; symptoms are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>



<li>Rectal bleeding</li>



<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Iron-deficiency anemia</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>Many early-onset cases are actually diagnosed at the emergency room, Cao says. “The bottom line is if someone has at least two [red flag symptoms], they really need to be aware of it,” she says. “It will definitely be worth a conversation with their primary care doctor.”</p>



<p>Beyond noticing suspicious symptoms, other doctors are exploring different ways to spot the cancer before it spreads. In a study of 170 patients, the&nbsp;<a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/222545?0=n&amp;1=u&amp;2=l&amp;3=l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early-onset and average-onset diseases left different metabolic signatures in the blood</a>, Jayakrishnan reported in June at ASCO. His team saw differences in chemical reactions involving citrate and the amino acid arginine in young people with the cancer. If Jayakrishnan’s results hold up, such metabolic signatures could one day help doctors screen people for the disease.</p>



<p>“If you can detect it early,” he says, “colorectal cancer has really good treatment options. It really makes a huge difference.”</p>



<p>One key part of early detection may simply be wider knowledge that the early-onset disease is on the rise, says Colorado’s Lieu. Most cases of abdominal pain probably won’t be cancer, he says, but “you just don’t want to ignore it.” Raising awareness of the disease and its symptoms among both patients and doctors could “save somebody’s life.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frogs-glow-biofluorescence-language">Many frogs glow in blue light, and it may be a secret, eerie language</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the dim twilight hours, many frogs may be capable of emitting a faint green or orange glow.</p>



<p>A survey of hundreds of frogs in South America shows that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.25.550432v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more frogs are biofluorescent</a> than previously thought, researchers report in a preprint posted July 28 at bioRxiv.org. The ghostly colors may have a role in the frogs’ communication with members of the same species, the scientists say.</p>



<p>The findings “are a reminder to check our own perception as humans,” says Jennifer Lamb, a herpetologist at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who was not involved with the research. “We are very visually dominant in terms of our senses. And other animals are too, but they might be experiencing that visual world differently than we are.”</p>





<p>Biofluorescence occurs in many types of creatures. It happens when an organism absorbs light at one wavelength, or color, and reemits it at a different wavelength with lower energy. Over the past several years, researchers have recognized the trait in a growing diversity of species, from the fur of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/100/1/21/5299493?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flying squirrels</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/platypus-glow-blue-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescent-fur">platypuses</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-glow-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescence">the nests of certain wasps</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/20, SN: 9/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>Fluorescence was <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1701053114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first discovered in frogs</a> in 2017. Since then, researchers have tested more amphibians for fluorescence, says Courtney Whitcher, an evolutionary biologist at Florida State University in Tallahassee. But investigations of frog biofluorescence have used just one or two light sources she says, usually violet or ultraviolet light.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get a more detailed and cohesive picture of fluorescence in frogs, Whitcher and her colleagues tested frogs using five different light sources covering a range of wavelengths from green to UV. From March to May 2022, the team captured and shone lights on 528 individual frogs in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru and measured any reemitted light.</p>



<p>All 151 frog species they tested had some degree of fluorescence, ranging from 2 percent of the original light intensity to well over 90 percent. Prior to this study, less than two dozen of the 42 frog species that had been previously tested were considered fluorescent.</p>



<p>The frogs’ green and orange fluorescence was most intense under blue light that dominates at twilight. This is similar to how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glowing-frogs-salamanders-may-be-surprisingly-common">many salamander species fluoresce</a> under blue light, Lamb says (<em>SN: 2/27/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fluorescence in land living animals “was recently thought to be rare, and when people go out looking for it, surveying across multiple species, it turns out it’s everywhere,” says zoologist Linda Reinhold, recently a graduate student at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia.&nbsp;“It was only because no one had looked before.”</p>



<p>Many of the frogs’ body parts that strongly fluoresced are also involved in signaling to other frogs. Much of the fluorescence seemed centered on the throat and underside of the frogs, which are commonly used in courtship rituals.&nbsp;“While they&#8217;re calling, that vocal sac region is expanding and contracting,” Whitcher says. Fluorescence may make for a more noticeable display.</p>



<p>The green glow is probably something other frogs can see, the researchers say. The team found that in the twilight hours — a time when frogs tend to court and mate — frog eyes are quite sensitive to the particular green light that’s emitted from the frogs’ skin.&nbsp;The orange fluorescence, on the other hand, may be intended for a different receiver, such as a predator. It may serve as camouflage or a warning signal, Whitcher says.</p>



<p>It’s “astonishing” how widespread fluorescence is among these frogs, says evolutionary biologist Mark Scherz, of the Natural History of Denmark in Copenhagen. “Not a single one of the species they tested failed to fluoresce,” he says, adding that testing the frogs against a variety of light wavelengths might help explain the fluorescence rate.</p>





<p>But he is skeptical that the fluorescence would be strong enough for communication purposes. Twilight is much dimmer than daylight, he says, so there may not be much light available for conversion to an emerald glow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whitcher is now investigating whether fluorescence in male frogs influences female frogs’ mating choices.&nbsp;“Maybe there&#8217;s a threshold of fluorescence intensity that is needed in order to elicit some kind of behavioral response,” she says.</p>

<p>A professor at the University of Pittsburgh is suing the institution and two administrators, alleging they discriminated against him because he is Black.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.sph.pitt.edu/directory/moses-bility">Moses Bility</a>, an assistant professor of infectious diseases and microbiology in the university’s School of Public Health, alleges the school’s response to a 2020 paper he published and later withdrew that proposed jade amulets may prevent COVID-19 was discriminatory.</p>



<p>He also claims the school discriminated against him by blocking him from transferring his lab to the Pitt-affiliated Hillman Cancer Center, and that one of the named administrators plagiarized his COVID-19 paper, among other allegedly discriminatory acts. Bility says the school denied his application for tenure in June as retaliation for his complaints of discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bility is seeking lost wages, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. His <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bility-amended-complaint.pdf">complaint states</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127700"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As a result of all the conduct of Defendants as set forth above, Dr. Bility has suffered embarrassment, substantial mental anguish and emotional distress, and loss of wages and potential earnings. The discrimination has affected his family, including his wife and children, who have been deprived of receiving his best care and attention due to him coping with all Defendants’ discriminatory conduct.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pitt and the two administrators, Donald Burke and Maureen Lictveld, the former and current deans of the school of public health, respectively, have filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that Bility “alleges no facts actually linking perceived wrongs to either his race or his complaints of discrimination.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://marcus-shapira.com/attorneys/jeremy-d-engle/">Jeremy Engle</a>, a lawyer at the Pittsburgh firm Marcus &amp; Shapira, who is representing the defendants, declined to comment. (The firm is unrelated to Retraction Watch co-founder Adam Marcus.)</p>



<p>Bility’s lawyer, <a href="https://www.ohanlonschwartz.com/about-us/">Steven O’Hanlon</a> of the firm O’Hanlon Schwartz, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The motion to dismiss is meritless given the extensively detailed amended complaint.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The article that proposed jade amulets may prevent COVID-19, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720363592">Can Traditional Chinese Medicine provide insights into controlling the COVID-19 pandemic: Serpentinization-induced lithospheric long-wavelength magnetic anomalies in Proterozoic bedrocks in a weakened geomagnetic field mediate the aberrant transformation of biogenic molecules in COVID-19 via magnetic catalysis</a>, was published as an “article in press” in <em>Science of the Total Environment</em>, an Elsevier title, in October 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/29/amulets-may-prevent-covid-19-says-a-paper-in-elsevier-journal-they-dont/">critique online</a>, the authors of the paper <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/11/16/co-authors-of-paper-on-covid-19-and-jade-amulets-blames-the-online-press-and-social-media-for-misinterpretation-in-retraction-letter/">withdrew it</a>, and Bility planned to replace the paper with a new version on which he would be the sole author. (In the process of our previous reporting on the article, Bility <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Gmail-STOTEN-paper.pdf">accused</a> Retraction Watch of racism.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bility told us that he had presented the work at several conferences this year and resubmitted an updated version of the manuscript to <em>Science of the Total Environment</em> a few months ago. However, the journal rejected it as “not well aligned with the aims and scope of this environmental science journal,” according to the decision letter Bility shared with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I believe that Science of the Total Environment was afraid to review the work due to the previous backlash against the journal when the work was reviewed and published in 2020. I will be submitting my work to another journal in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339721710_Serpentinization-induced_lithospheric_long-wavelength_magnetic_anomalies_in_Proterozoic_bedrocks_in_a_weakened_geomagnetic_field_mediate_the_aberrant_transformation_of_biogenic_molecules_in_COVID-19_v">updated version</a> of the paper Bility shared with us no longer mentions traditional Chinese medicine in the title or jade amulets in the body of the text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his complaint, Bility alleges that he withdrew the paper after receiving “violent threats, racial abuse and harassing actions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the alleged harassment involved vandalism. The name tag on Bility’s office wall was torn down multiple times, he says. Later, in the fall of 2021, the complaint says that someone broke into his office:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the ceiling was tempered [sic] with; Dr. Bility believed that electronic recoding [sic] devices were placed in the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bility claims he also received pressure from others at Pitt. Jean Nachega, an associate professor in the school of public health whom Bility listed as last author on the paper, told Bility that Nachega’s “research funding was threatened to be withheld if the article was not withdrawn,” according to the complaint. School officials demanded Bility’s chair investigate him and his research.</p>



<p>When the findings of the investigation – that Bility “did not violate any academic integrity standard” – were presented at a departmental town hall meeting over Zoom, “students in Defendant Pitt’s School of Public Health called Dr. Bility derogatory names, such as stupid, retarded, unintelligent, etc.,” he alleges. Bility also received two emails “from anonymous individuals who Dr. Bility assumes came from the Defendant Pitt community” that included racial slurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In the fall of 2020, Bility says he received a verbal offer to move his research lab to the Hillman Cancer Center, which is also affiliated with Pitt, but he alleges the move was blocked on account of the withdrawn paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On December 21, 2020, Dr. Bility was informed (via a zoom call) by Dr. Robert Ferris, the Director of the Hillman Cancer Center and the Associate Vice Chancellor for Cancer Research, Defendant Pitt Health Sciences, that he was instructed by an unnamed powerful individual in the Defendant Pitt Health Sciences not to allow Dr. Bility to move to the center. Dr. Ferris offered Dr. Bility an opportunity that if he apologized for engaging in the research in question, the powerful individual in the Defendant Pitt Health Sciences might reconsider the decision to block the transfer; Dr. Bility refused to apologize.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bility also alleges that, in 2021, Burke, who had retired from his role as dean that January, published a preprint that plagiarized “the assumptions, findings, and prediction framework” of the withdrawn <em>Science of the Total Environment</em> article. (Burke, Bility alleges, had earlier discouraged him from pursuing the line of research and presenting his work at a school workshop in 2019.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bility submitted a formal complaint to the university, which an inquiry panel found did not warrant a formal investigation. The school closed the matter in July 2022. Bility alleges the inquiry panel was biased against him.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In August of 2021, Bility alleges that Lichtveld, the current dean of the public health school, emailed him to relay requests from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that he remove two grant funding acknowledgments from a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71548-z"><em>Scientific Reports</em> article</a> he had published in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98417-7">correction</a> in September 2021 removed one of the grants, but Bility was “very concerned” about the request to remove the other, from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), according to the complaint, and doubted that NIH had indeed asked for it. He alleges:&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nature-color-climate-change-visible">Nature’s changing colors makes climate change visible</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following days of torrential rain, more than a dozen rivers in Vermont overflowed in early July, causing catastrophic flooding. Some parts of Vermont saw up to 23 centimeters of rain, or 9 inches, an amount exceeding even the rainfalls from Hurricane Irene in 2011. Once considered 1-in-100-year events, such floods are set to become more frequent as climate change warms the region, scientists say. That’s because warmer air can hold more moisture. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This time, my hometown of Burlington was largely spared. But Lake Champlain, which runs the length of the city, was not. As the water from the Winooski — a 145-kilometer river that swamped the state capital, Montpelier — flows into the lake near where I live, so too does the garbage, gasoline and other pollutants that it swallowed up.&nbsp;</p>





<p>I glimpsed this pollution firsthand while biking with friends on a path along the lake shortly after the worst of the flooding. The south end of the lake, where we started, remained surprisingly clean and free of debris, appearing light blue. But as we biked north, past the junction of river and lake, the water turned murky and brown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That color shift reminded me of something I’d recently read about deep-sea divers in Estero Salado, a fishing town in the Dominican Republic. The divers describe similar <a href="https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes to ocean hues</a> where they fish, and their color vocabulary is intricate. They speak of blue, black, yellow, green, purple and chocolate to describe the seawater’s appearance at different times and under different circumstances, writes medical anthropologist Kyrstin Mallon Andrews in July in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</em>.&nbsp;These colors tell the divers about the state of the water and possible impacts on the behavior and visibility of sea life, such as depth, turbulence and influx of runoff from storms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Divers also speak of drastic changes to those colors over the years. Purple water, which “surpasses clean,” has become increasingly rare. Yellow water, caused by flooding in the nearby river and toxic runoff from the region’s rice fields, wreaks havoc on once fertile fishing grounds. Longer hurricane seasons turn the waters chocolate brown — a color too dangerous for diving — for months rather than weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My own experience and that of the deep-sea divers made me wonder if using color to describe climate change could work as a communication tool. When I pose the idea to Tim Edensor, a social and cultural geographer at Manchester Metropolitan University in England, he concurs.</p>



<p>Historically, the colors of a person’s world would have stayed fairly constant, he says. But climate change is rapidly altering our visual environment. And those changes can be hard to ignore. “This transformation of the color of the water, I think this is really quite perturbing and it’s also disorienting,” he says. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Such color changes are not limited to our waterways. Scientists have been talking about changes to the world’s color palette for several years. Here in New England, <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/news/gund/science-fall-foliage-and-climate-change-uvm-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autumn’s vibrant leaves could become duller</a> due, in part, to warmer nighttime temperatures that slow chlorophyll’s degradation process, researchers say. And satellite images show that while much of the Arctic is getting greener, some parts are turning brown, a sign that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning">vegetation could be dying</a> (<em>SN: 4/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>Many flowers, meanwhile, have increased the amount of their ultraviolet pigments, a natural sunscreen to protect against rising temperatures and a thinning ozone layer, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Current Biology. </em>While these changes are invisible to the human eye — we can’t see UV radiation — the flowers <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31267-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appear darker to pollinators</a>. That change in hue could reduce a pollinator’s attraction to affected flowers, the researchers wrote.</p>



<p>When it comes to the world’s waterways, satellite images taken over the past 20 years show that over half the world’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06321-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oceans have become greener</a>, researchers reported in July in <em>Nature.</em> Dissolved organic material in the water or changes to the type or quantity of phytoplankton are the most likely culprits, says Emmanuel Boss, an aquatic physicist at the University of Maine in Orono. “The bacteria are very happy. There is a whole microbial community that I think is having a blast.”</p>



<p>Another study of satellite images found that lakes in areas where average summer temperatures were once moderate and the waters froze come winter are also likely to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-lake-color-blue-green-brown">switch from blue to green or even brown</a> as the climate warms in coming years (<em>SN: 10/3/22</em>)<em>. </em>Hot spots for this shift include northern Europe and northeastern North America.</p>





<p>Color changes at such sweeping scales can be hard to grasp. But Mallon Andrews’ research with the Dominican deep-sea divers shows how individuals experience these changes in their communities. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015, Mallon Andrews, of Syracuse University in New York, went to the Dominican Republic to investigate water issues in the region. She spent days standing on a bridge overlooking a bay with the divers and soon learned their ocean language. “Their mode of communicating ocean conditions was always based around color,” she says. “Some colors you can dive in. Some colors have consequences if you dive in them. And some colors are used for navigation purposes.”</p>



<p>As the divers taught her over several years to dive, Mallon Andrews too began to see those nuances in color. She eventually realized that the divers’ color scheme was more than descriptive; it was also diagnostic. Once, for instance, one diver described the water as “methylene blue.” Mallon Andrews had never heard the term, so she looked it up and found that methylene blue is a medication used to treat people suffering from hypoxia. “What he is saying is that previous to these conditions, there was more oxygen in the water,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some colors can affect the divers’ physical and mental health, Mallon Andrews says. For instance, because yellow water clouds the water’s surface, the fishermen must dive continually to see fish, an exhausting process. Yellow water also causes skin rashes and debilitating ear infections, along with “sort of generalized angst,” she says.</p>



<p>Pairing that local, firsthand knowledge with more remote monitoring techniques could bring a deeper understanding of how climate change is altering the colors of our world, some scientists say. “It is very valuable for space agencies to have local people take high quality measurements that can be used to validate what we are inferring from space,” Boss says. </p>



<p>The camera on the satellite Boss’ team used to look at the world’s oceans, for instance, can’t see anything smaller than a kilometer, so it lacks detail. Scientists studying those images also have to sift out the material in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, dust and human-made aerosols, to see the ocean with any clarity.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blue shift</h3>



<p>Some of the world’s blue lakes will shift to green or brown in coming years as regions that typically see average summer air temperatures below 19° Celsius cross that threshold, researchers reported in 2022. Some lakes (shown) are already in areas within 1 degree (yellow), 2 degrees (cyan) or 3 degrees (purple) of that temperature. The most susceptible lakes — those located in areas closest to the 19° C tipping point — are mostly located in northeastern North America and northern continental Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Could learning to read the color of water provide another tool to measure climate change, even for people like me who can barely manage a snorkel? When I pose the question to Brenda Bergman, she is skeptical. People’s subjective look at the water is too variable, says Bergman, who heads the science and freshwater programs for The Nature Conservancy in Vermont. Sensors and direct water readings can do the job more systematically.</p>



<p>But she and Edensor say that helping people become attuned to the world’s changing colors could help them understand how climate change is impacting their local communities.</p>



<p>“A lot of the [climate change] literature is excessively abstract and it’s also unimaginable,” Edensor says. Everyday indicators, like changes to the color of water, are much more tangible.</p>



<p>My bike ride along Lake Champlain was one of these visceral experiences. At first, the kids with us begged to jump into the water. As the water changed color, those requests slowed — then stopped altogether after we spotted seven dead frogs on a rocky outcropping over that murky water.</p>



<p>“These changes can’t be denied,” Edensor says. “You see them with your own eyes.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pondering resistance</h4>



<p><em>Microwaving deltamethrin can renew the insecticide’s ability to kill mosquitoes that have become resistant to it. Scientists are working to add the improved insecticide to bed nets, <strong>Tina Hesman Saey </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-microwave-insecticide-spray">Restoring an insecticide’s mosquito-killing power</a>” (</em>SN: 6/17/23, p. 4<em>).</em></p>



<p>Although the finding “sounds like a welcome discovery,” reader <strong>Linda Ferrazzara </strong>wrote, “might the newer, more effective version of the insecticide also have more serious adverse effects on the human beings it’s supposed to protect?”</p>





<p>Deltamethrin is so commonly used as an insecticide because it’s much more lethal for insects than it is for mammals, says <strong>Bart Kahr</strong>, a crystallographer at New York University. The lethal dose for a human, which is based on toxicology data for rats, would be more than 100 billion times what it is for a mosquito, he says.</p>



<p>Since microwaving deltamethrin changes its crystal structure but not its chemical composition, the lethal dose would not be expected to change, <strong>Kahr </strong>says. The new form might be faster at delivering deltamethrin to both humans and mosquitoes, but it would still take incredibly prolonged contact with a high amount of the insecticide to be consequential to a mammal. “Of course, no one has made such an experiment, but it stands to reason from the data that we have,” he says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding pain</h4>



<p><em>Brain implants in four people with chronic pain revealed a potential biomarker of the debilitating condition. The brain signal could one day help doctors track treatment responses, <strong>Laura Sanders</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implants-chronic-pain">Implants track chronic pain in the brain</a>” (</em>SN: 6/17/23, p. 10<em>).</em></p>



<p>Some readers on social media wondered what the discovery might mean for other types of long-lasting pain. “Am SO hoping that this will one day be expanded to those of us who have [the autoimmune disorder lupus],” Twitter user <strong>@SusanFi84657717</strong> wrote. Meanwhile, Facebook user <strong>Wernell Loell</strong> hoped the finding might apply to pain associated with grief.</p>



<p>The study gave researchers a glimpse of just one specific type of chronic pain: neuropathic pain, which is rooted in the nervous system, <strong>Sanders</strong> says. Three people in the study had neuropathic pain after a stroke, and one person had phantom limb pain in an amputated leg.</p>



<p>“So far, researchers don’t have this detailed view of other types of long-lasting pain,” <strong>Sanders</strong> says. But the brain implant study, while small, has provided some hints. Scientists found patterns of activity in the brain shared by all four participants when their pain was high. But the research also turned up brain activity patterns that were unique to each person.</p>



<p>“Figuring out the neural signals — both common and unique — that come with various sorts of chronic pain is the first step,” <strong>Sanders</strong> says. “The bigger goal is to interfere with those signals. Scientists are now testing whether brain stimulation can short-circuit these particular pain signals.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Correction</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-fossil-lost-world-microbe-life">Ancient molecules tied to complex life</a>” (<em>SN: 7/15/23 &amp; 7/29/23, p. 6</em>) stated incorrectly that the oldest known eukaryotic fossils date to 800 million years ago. Instead, the sentence should say that the oldest known steroid fossils date to 800 million years ago. The oldest known eukaryotic fossils actually date to nearly 3 billion years ago.</p>

                <p>Heat waves are synonymous with summer for most people. But this summer’s heat has broken records for temperatures and duration. As of late July, Texas had experienced highs over 100° Fahrenheit for more than 30 days straight. China posted its highest temperature ever recorded, and Europe’s heat may surpass last year’s onslaught, when more than 60,000 people may have died due to excessive heat.</p>



<p>The hot, dry weather helped fuel coast-to-coast wildfires in Canada, with smoke spilling south and blanketing the U.S. Midwest and East Coast. For many people, it was their first experience with dangerous air quality caused by wildfires, a plague that has become all too familiar to people in the western United States.</p>





<p>Scientists know that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-air-quality-pollution">wildfire smoke can harm human health</a>, staff writer Meghan Rosen reports. Tiny particles that can lodge deep in the lungs are a big concern, and smoke can contain chemicals like formaldehyde and benzene. But researchers don’t yet know the long-term effects of being exposed to wildfire smoke intermittently over many years and are now focused on answering that question.</p>



<p>The Northern Hemisphere <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">heat waves are being driven by warmer oceans amped up by climate change</a> plus the return of a natural climate cycle called El Niño, staff writer Nikk Ogasa reports. Another factor is meandering jet streams, which have pinned hot air in place.</p>



<p>I asked Rosen, Ogasa and earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling the question we at <em>Science News</em> have been asking for a few years now: Is this the year that climate change smacks even the least vulnerable?</p>



<p>When it comes to human capacity to withstand extreme heat and high humidity, “there’s this grim feeling like we’re pushing the limit, except we don’t know what the limit is,” Gramling said. She reported last summer that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">human heat tolerance may be lower than thought</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/22, p. 6</em>). People are definitely talking and thinking more about it, Ogasa said. And he’s adapting himself, going for runs when it’s least humid. Gramling also noted that there’s been a decrease in the number of people saying that climate change doesn’t exist. “People are considering things now that maybe they were less open to before.”</p>



<p>I asked these reporters what questions on climate change and health they’d like to dig into next.</p>



<p>Rosen: “I’d like to know more about how heat and wildfire smoke may affect a developing fetus. Are there particular windows of pregnancy where it’s especially dangerous for someone to be inhaling smoke, or living through a heat wave?”</p>



<p>Ogasa: “I’m curious about how we’re going to reckon with the growing need for cooling. So many places are starting to face unlivable conditions. How do we deal with that growing energy demand, what alternatives are there for people who can’t get traditional AC and in which climates do those alternatives work?”</p>



<p>Gramling: “I’m definitely interested in the limit of human heat tolerance. What even is adaptation?” As we all travel into what feels like uncharted territory, we’ll keep reporting on big questions about climate change, like how much people can adapt and the technological advances that may make a difference.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-measurement-muon-magnetism">There’s a new measurement of muon magnetism. What it means isn’t clear</a></h4>

              
                <p>Muons might not behave as expected. But scientists can’t agree on what to expect.<br><br>By taking stock of how the subatomic particles wobble in a magnetic field, physicists have pinned down a property of the muon’s internal magnet to greater precision than ever before, researchers from the Muon g−2 experiment reported August 10 in a seminar hosted by Fermilab in Batavia, Ill.</p>



<p>Previous measurements of muons&#8217; magnetism haven’t aligned with theoretical predictions. Those predictions come from one of the most important and carefully tested scientific theories ever developed, the standard model of particle physics, which describes subatomic particles and the forces that bind them.</p>





<p>Many physicists have hoped that the muon discrepancy might be hinting at a flaw in the stalwart theory that could lead to a better understanding of the universe. But several recent scientific surprises have muddled the theoretical prediction of the strength of the muon’s tiny magnet, making it harder to know if the measurement is pointing to new physics or an unresolved issue with the prediction.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Measurements of muon magnetism have long hinted at unknown particles</h4>



<p>Muons are in the same particle family as electrons but are about 200 times as massive. These short-lived particles behave like miniature magnets, each with their own magnetic field. The strength of that magnet is adjusted by a strange effect of quantum physics. Empty space is filled with a constant flurry of particles that appear temporarily before flitting out of existence. Known as “virtual” particles, they have very real effects. These transient particles alter the strength of the muon’s magnet by an amount that can be calculated according to the standard model.</p>



<p>The precise value of this tweak — known as the anomalous magnetic moment, or “g−2” in physics equations — is what has befuddled physicists.</p>



<p>Tantalizingly, particles unknown to science could shift the value of g−2 that scientists measure. So previous hints of a disagreement with the standard model’s predictions have generated a hubbub among physicists.</p>



<p>“The muons’ behavior that we’re measuring is affected by all of the forces and particles in the universe,” says Muon g−2 researcher Brynn MacCoy, a physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “It’s basically giving us this direct window into how the universe works.”</p>



<p>The first indication of a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-orbits-may-defy-main-physics-theory">mismatch between the prediction and measurements</a> of g−2 came from an experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., completed more than two decades ago (<em>SN: 2/15/01</em>). Then in 2021, the Muon g−2 experiment, based at Fermilab, reported its first results, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">confirming the discrepancy</a> (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, Muon g−2 has <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/result2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubled its precision</a> in an updated magnetism measurement, the researchers reported in the Fermilab seminar and in a paper posted August 10 on the website of the Muon g−2 collaboration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“To reach that level of precision is really unprecedented and really impressive,” says physicist Carlos Wagner of the University of Chicago, who was not involved with the experiment. “I am simply in awe.” The new measurement incorporates four times as much data as the previous one, among other improvements that beefed up the precision.</p>



<p>Scientists aim to compare that measured value to the standard model prediction. But determining what, exactly, the standard model predicts is complicated.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There is a tricky step to calculating the value of g−2</h4>



<p>In 2020, after much careful consideration, a group of theoretical physicists called the Muon g−2 Theory Initiative came to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157320302556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consensus prediction</a> that they could compare with measurements. But since then, new, contradictory information has come out from other experiments and theoretical calculations, <a href="https://muon-gm2-theory.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed in a statement</a> posted August 9 on the Muon g−2 Theory Initiative’s website. That information has left the prediction uncertain.</p>



<p>“It’s not possible to make a comparison at this point and say whether the standard model agrees or disagrees with experiment,” says theoretical physicist Tom Blum of the University of Connecticut in Storrs.</p>



<p>The confusion hinges on a particularly challenging bit of the calculation of g−2. Known as the hadronic vacuum polarization, it refers to the adjustment resulting from a virtual photon emitted by the muon that splits into a quark and its antimatter partner, an antiquark. Quarks are a class of particle that make up bigger particles known as hadrons, including protons and neutrons. The quark and antiquark interact before annihilating back into a virtual photon.</p>



<p>Scientists have come up with two main ways of calculating this hadronic vacuum polarization term. The conventional way involves using certain experimental data as an input to the calculation. Those data come from experiments that measure how electrons and their antimatter particles, positrons, collide and produce hadrons. The results of such experiments are thought to be well understood.</p>



<p>But a recent experiment, CMD-3, at the VEPP-2000 particle collider in Novosibirsk, Russia, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disagrees with those other experiments</a>, researchers reported in February at arXiv.org. If this one outlier is correct, that would suggest that the hints of disagreement between muon measurements and the prediction might be weaker than thought.</p>



<p>A second way of estimating the thorny hadronic vacuum polarization term uses a method called lattice quantum chromodynamics. That technique involves mathematically splitting up spacetime into a grid in order to make calculations more tractable. Scientists have only recently managed to make such calculations precise enough for useful comparisons.</p>



<p>In 2021, a group nicknamed “BMW” published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03418-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarization&nbsp;contribution</a> in <em>Nature</em>. That estimate pointed to a closer harmony between the prediction and measurement of g−2 and disagreed with the data-driven approach. But the technique demanded confirmation. Since then, other scientists have performed their own lattice calculations to check a portion of the BMW result. Those teams obtained similar results to BMW, boosting confidence in the lattice method.</p>



<p>The focus has now shifted away from scrutinizing the experimental measurement and is instead aimed at analyzing the disagreement among different theoretical techniques.</p>



<p>“The experiment has delivered,” says theoretical physicist Thomas Teubner of the University of Liverpool in England, a member of the Muon g−2 collaboration. Now, to figure out if muons are keeping with the standard model or cracking it, it’s up to the theoretical physicists, he says. “We have to get our house in order.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-ancient-whale-king-tut">Meet the tiny ancient whale named after King Tut</a></h4>

              
                <p>Just days after the world was introduced to the heaviest known ancient whale, a much tinier member of the same family has been found on the other side of the planet.</p>



<p>The newly discovered species is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-04986-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the earliest — and smallest — basilosaurids</a>, a family of ancient aquatic creatures related to modern whales, researchers report August 10 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. It measured just 2.5 meters long, the team estimates, and weighed a mere 188 kilograms, about as much as a blue whale’s heart.</p>





<p>“It’s definitely a very small animal,” says Mark Uhen, a paleontologist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Researchers found the 41-million-year-old fossilized skull, jaw and teeth of <em>Tutcetus rayanensis</em> in Wadi El-Rayan, a nature reserve in Egypt. Named in part after the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, the species shares King Tut’s regal roots: The name “basilosaurid” is derived from the Latin <em>basilosaurus</em>, or “king lizard” (the first basilosaurid specimen was <a href="http://oceansofkansas.com/Harlan1834b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistakenly classified</a> as a reptile).</p>



<p>Like Tutankhamun, the <em>T. rayanensis </em>specimen perished on the cusp of adulthood. It still had a couple of its baby teeth, along with adult molars that grew in relatively early in its life. That pattern of tooth growth suggests that the species “lived fast and died fast,” or at least faster than other basilosaurids, says study coauthor Abdullah Gohar, a paleontologist at Mansoura University in Egypt.</p>



<p>Another group of researchers recently announced the discovery of the basilosaurid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colossal-ancient-whale-heaviest-animal"><em>Perucetus colossus</em></a>, possibly the heaviest animal ever known to exist, in Peru (<em>SN: 8/2/23</em>). Just one of its vertebrae weighed over half as much as its teeny cousin’s entire body.</p>



<p><em>T. rayanensis</em> may have lived around the same time as the gigantic <em>P. colossus</em>, which rivaled modern blue whales in body mass, Gohar says. But their vastly different body types indicate that they probably occupied different ecological niches, Uhen says.</p>



<p>Gohar says he hopes to study older fossils to better understand the full story of whale evolution. The area where the researchers found <em>T. rayanensis</em> contains 15 million years of mammalian evolutionary history, including that of other early whales.</p>



<p>“We’ve been working that area for a long time,” Uhen says. “It’s good to know that there are still things out there to discover.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rigby-scientist-jwst-lgbtq-astronomers">Meet Jane Rigby, senior project scientist for JWST and advocate for LGBTQ+ astronomers</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">One of a telescope operator’s primary jobs is to keep any stray light out of the instrument. Earthly and other unwelcome photons can swamp the cosmic light from distant stars and galaxies. During more than a decade as a project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, Jane Rigby obsessed over minimizing light leaks — with extraordinary success. The sky looks darker to JWST than most anyone had hoped.</p>



<p>Rigby herself, now the senior project scientist for JWST, is a source of light.</p>





<p>“I remember the light in her eyes,” says astrophysicist Jane Charlton, who met Rigby the summer before her freshman year at Penn State and later advised her research. “Jane had incredible grades, but that’s not necessarily what I look for. The love of astronomy, and passion for that, is what I look for.”</p>



<p>Nearly three decades later, Rigby’s palpable joy in discussing the success of JWST, which launched on December 25, 2021, has made her one of the public faces of the telescope. She presented <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">the telescope’s first images</a> at the White House and has given keynote speeches at some of the biggest astronomy meetings (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 30</em>). During public appearances, she often wears JWST-themed socks, scarves and pins. “I have JWST socks for pretty much every day of the week,” she says.</p>



<p>She has also lit a path for queer astronomers, as well as others who are historically underrepresented in astronomy. Rigby has been out as part of the LGBTQ+ community since 2000, when she met her now-wife when they were both astronomy graduate students at the University of Arizona in Tucson. She has devoted much of her career to holding the door open for others.</p>



<p>“I didn’t grow up with any queer role models,” she says. “I hope I’m the last generation for which that’s true.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Focusing on the instruments</h4>



<p>Rigby remembers being asked to draw a favorite TV show in preschool. She used up an entire black crayon drawing Carl Sagan’s <em>Cosmos</em>.</p>



<p>Her interest in space crystallized into a career plan at about age 12, after she saw Sally Ride speak at a local college. Ride, the first American woman in space, made Rigby want to be an astronaut.</p>



<p>“I knew there were two paths to becoming an astronaut: a test pilot or a scientist,” she says. “And it was pretty clear that I was never going to be tall enough to fly the shuttle.” At 5 feet, 2 inches tall, she’s still two inches too short to have been a space shuttle pilot. If she couldn’t make it to space, she saw more potential in science than in flying planes.</p>



<p>Rigby’s first experience using a telescope for research, as an undergraduate student at Penn&nbsp;State, was stymied by light leaks. She, Charlton and another student traveled to western Texas to use the telescope at the McDonald Observatory. They were looking to catch light from a distant quasar filtering through a diffuse and mysterious cloud of cosmic gas. These small, dense clouds appear to be packed with heavy elements from supernova explosions, but surprisingly, they’re not found in galaxies’ centers where a lot of stars are born and dying. “We were, at that time, trying to figure out what they were,” Charlton says. “As we still are.”</p>



<p>After a night of guiding the telescope by hand, the group realized that light from something other than the quasar — maybe an alert light on an instrument panel — had flooded the telescope. The trio tracked it down, covered it with tape and tried again. The same thing happened night after night. Ultimately, they returned to Pennsylvania with no quasar data.</p>



<p>“It didn’t work,” Rigby says. “But it was really fun. I was learning everything, trying to learn how the telescope worked.”</p>

Rigby</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Since then, Rigby has used many major telescopes, from those at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii to the Magellan telescopes in Chile to the Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes. Along the way, her research developed a theme: investigating how galaxies grow and change along with the super­massive black holes hiding within.</p>



<p>But her approach is less “How can I answer this burning question?” and more “What can I do with this shiny new instrument?”</p>





<p>“I’m a very observational astronomer,” she says. “I will use any telescope I can get my hands on.”</p>



<p>All that telescope time meant she was ready to join the JWST team when the opportunity came.</p>



<p>“Because she had seen data from Spitzer and Hubble,” JWST’s precursors, says astronomer Matt Mountain of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy in Washington, D.C., “she knew what she was looking for.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meeting the James Webb Space Telescope</h4>



<p>Rigby began working on JWST in 2010, when she took a job at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., as the telescope’s deputy operations project scientist.</p>



<p>One of the first things she did was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cost-overruns-and-delays-add-65-billion-nasas-next-gen-space-telescope">read the report of an independent review panel</a> that found that the telescope was mismanaged, over budget by billions of dollars and would launch years later than originally planned (<em>SN: 11/11/10</em>). “I’ve certainly been four years from launch multiple times,” she says.</p>



<p>Before launch, most of her time was devoted to making sure that changes to the telescope’s design wouldn’t mess up the science. She imagined possible ways to use JWST and met with other team members to make sure the final telescope would deliver on those goals.

<p>“Because she is a working scientist who really wanted to use the data,” Mountain says, “she was an ideal choice for operations scientist,” a job she moved up to in 2018. “In these complex spaces, with all the engineering, the personalities, the politics at NASA, working with contractors, she always keeps her eye on the prize: What science are we trying to do?”</p>



<p>Rigby bridged the divide between the science and engineering teams, helping them speak a common language. Her job has been “a lot of active listening and soft power, a lot of synthesizing and a dose of specialized technical expertise,” she says. “Oftentimes I’m the big-picture person in a room full of specialists.”</p>

<p>After the telescope launched, got in position and unfolded itself — “the six-month unwrapping of the Christmas present,” Rigby says — her job shifted to characterizing how well the telescope works. In practically every metric, it’s a dream come true.</p>



<p>There’s better-than-expected image quality, higher sensitivity, faster response times and a longer potential mission lifetime than predicted before launch — and practically no light leaks. The telescope’s great golden mirrors are exposed to space, and light can scatter off dust grains on the mirrors, registering on images as faint, diffuse patterns the team calls “wisps” and “claws,” or a ghostly streak dubbed “the lightsaber.” But the mirrors proved remarkably dust-free, meaning the sky appears incredibly dark.</p>



<p>“It’s not an accident that the telescope works so well,” she says. “That was careful work beforehand.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>When asked about such successes, and her own, Rigby points to a huge amount of work by tens of thousands of people. “I understand the desire to humanize something that can seem really big and impersonal. But I don’t like the singling out,” she says. “I try to reflect it back to the team.” It took thousands of people and tasks to ensure JWST’s success. Engineer Larkin Carey, with Ball Aerospace, for example, cleaned every square centimeter of the telescope’s mirrors by hand with a tool like a shaving brush, Rigby says.</p>



<p>With the telescope working so well, Rigby could turn her attention to the scientific questions. She helps lead an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jwst-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observing program called TEMPLATES</a>, looking at galaxies whose light has been magnified by foreground objects to get a glimpse at how the galaxies form stars. At a June meeting in Albuquerque of the American Astronomical Society, Rigby shared how the TEMPLATES team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05998-6" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05998-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found hydrocarbons</a>, “the same stuff that smoke is made of,” in a galaxy whose light dates back more than 12&nbsp;billion years — the furthest back in time such molecules had ever been seen.</p>



<p>Early in July, Rigby became <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-names-dr-jane-rigby-new-webb-telescope-senior-project-scientist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the senior project scientist for JWST</a>; it’s her job to figure out how to get the most and best science out of the telescope.</p>



<p>Research colleagues describe her as superhuman. “I don’t know how she does everything that she does, and does everything well,” says TEMPLATES collaborator Keren Sharon of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. And Rigby’s enthusiasm is abundant: “She gets giddy,” Sharon says. “It could be about figuring out a bug, or discovering this super exciting thing about a galaxy that we didn’t know before … and she’s literally bouncing. Her face lights up.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Opening doors for others</h4>



<p>Rigby wants anyone to be able to experience and pursue that enthusiasm. When she started attending American Astronomical Society meetings in the 1990s, she didn’t know there was a secret LGBTQ+ networking dinner. “You had to know it existed. That was a little closety. But it’s where people were.”</p>



<p>At the time, there was a lack of protection from employment discrimination and no guarantee of institutional support for astronomers with same-sex partners. Rigby recalls accepting a fellowship at Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., and immediately having to request health insurance benefits to cover her partner.</p>



<p>“That’s awkward,” she says. “You want to be talking about your science and your telescope proposals, not how can I get health insurance for my family because we’re different.” Finding other LGBTQ+ astronomers was “a lifeline,” she says.</p>



<p>These days, the meet-up at AAS is too big to go out to dinner. At a January 2023 meeting in Seattle, “we lost count at 120 people. We had to spill out into the hallway,” Rigby says. “That feels good.”</p>



<p>Seeing queer astronomers like Rigby so far along in their careers was helpful to Traci Johnson, a data scientist who was a graduate student in astronomy in Sharon’s lab at the University of Michigan. Johnson identifies as lesbian and nonbinary and came out during graduate school. “I realized it is possible to be out, and be happy, and also have a really amazing career,” Johnson says.</p>



<p>Rigby has taken an active role in encouraging inclusivity, though she seems to be up against the legacy of JWST’s namesake. Many astronomers have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02678-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called for the telescope to be renamed</a> because James Webb was NASA administrator at a time when the U.S. government fired employees for being gay.</p>



<p>Rigby won’t comment on the telescope’s name. But her support for LGBTQ+ astronomers is clear. Rigby was a founding member of the AAS Committee for Sexual-Orientation and Gender Minorities in Astronomy, which works to promote equality for LGBTQ+ astronomers within the field; has co-organized conferences on making astronomy more inclusive; and authored a recent white paper urging the astronomy community to address diversity, inclusion and harassment. A current priority is making sure trans people feel safe and welcome.</p>



<p>Rigby doesn’t want to be pigeonholed as “the gay astronomer.” She knows her contributions to astronomy extend far beyond any particular group. But she says the leadership skills, resilience and ability to shift her perspective that she has learned through living and organizing as a member of the LGBTQ+ community have made her a better astronomer. They’re skills she transfers to her role as a leader at NASA.</p>



<p>“The whole vision is, you get to bring your authentic self to work,” she says. “And work embraces your authentic self.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fastest-evolving-moss-adapt-climate-change">The fastest-evolving moss in the world may not adapt to climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world’s oldest moss has seen four mass extinctions — but may not survive climate change.</p>



<p>The genus <em>Takakia</em> has the <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00736-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest number of fast-evolving genes</a> of any moss, researchers report August 9 in <em>Cell</em>. A decade-long study of <em>Takakia</em> in the Himalayas shows that the moss is well-adapted to its high-altitude home, with resistance to extreme cold and intense ultraviolet light. But no matter how fast it can tweak its genes, the scientists found, rapidly rising temperatures in the region were associated with a decrease in the moss’s range — a faster decrease than any of the mosses around it.</p>





<p><em>Takakia</em> consists of just two species of moss. While they can be found individually in the United States and Japan, both species occur together only on the Tibetan Plateau in the Himalayas. The two are unlike any other plant in the world. The evolutionary shoot containing <em>Takakia</em> branched off the other mosses around 390 million years ago.</p>



<p>“The evolutionary position of <em>Takakia</em> in plants is like that of platypus in mammals,” says Yikun He, a plant geneticist at the Capital Normal University in Beijing. Just as the platypus has a lot of strange, not-quite-mammal traits — like egg-laying and a beak — <em>Takakia</em> has a bunch of features that make it not quite like other plants, such as featherlike leaves and a lack of pores for controlling the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>“It looks very different from other mosses,” says Ralf Reski, a plant biotechnologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany. “For a long time, it was unclear if it was a moss.”</p>

<p>To learn more about mysterious <em>Takakia</em>, Reski, He and their colleagues set up a long-term study in the Tibetan Plateau, more than 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>



<p>Over 11 years, the researchers collected samples, analyzed genomes, collected data on the surrounding ecosystem and compared modern specimens with fossils from 165 million years ago. The team also had to evacuate several students due to altitude sickness. The field sites were accessible only in August and September, and even then, “the climate is unpredictable, and one day may experience spring, summer, autumn and winter,” He says.</p>



<p>Humans might have had a tough time, but the moss was comfortable in its high-altitude home. That’s due in part to its genes. While <em>Takakia</em> sports a genome whose length is average for a moss — just over 27,400 genes — it has the largest known number of fast-evolving genes, the researchers found.</p>



<p><em>Takakia</em> needed that speed when the Himalayas began to rise 65 million years ago. As the mountains stretched toward the sky, the mosses on them were exposed to lower temperatures and higher amounts of ultraviolet light. They had to adapt. And adapt <em>Takakia</em> did. </p>



<p>The new study showed the moss&#8217;s ability to withstand solar radiation. When the researchers exposed <em>Takakia</em> to a high amount of UV light, it was unharmed, while comparison mosses began to die within 72 hours. The hardy moss produces “high amounts of metabolites like flavonoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids to protect against radiation,” Reski says. It also sports genes to enable more efficient DNA repair — essential protection against harmful rays.</p>



<p><em>Takakia</em> also adapted to the extreme cold. It can go dormant for eight months of the year while under snow, and gets all of its growth and reproduction done, He says, “in the precious three-to-four-month light window period.”</p>





<p>All of these features evolved from about 50 million years ago to the present, the study showed, without ever changing the moss’s physical appearance compared with fossils of <em>Takakia</em> from about 165 million years ago.</p>



<p>But this relatively speedy evolution doesn’t seem to be fast enough to help the moss adapt to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate change</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>).</p>



<p>During the 11 years of the study, Reski, He and their colleagues documented an average increase in temperature of about four-tenths of a degree Celsius in the region. Meanwhile, the coverage of <em>Takakia</em> in their sample population decreased by about 1.6 percent per year — faster than four other local mosses.</p>



<p>The researchers predict that by the end of the 21st century, suitable conditions for <em>Takakia</em> will be limited to only 1,000 to 1,500 square kilometers around the world. By that time, the researchers suspect, the world’s oldest moss could be extinct.</p>



<p>Others are more optimistic about the fate of this tough little moss. There are populations in other places, says evolutionary biologist S. Blair Hedges. So while the Tibetan Plateau may eventually be <em>Takakia</em>-free, he hopes the moss can make it elsewhere.</p>



<p>What’s more, “it’s fantastic to see all these different things known about a single [genus], from the fossil record all the way up to the complete genome,” says Hedges, of Temple University in Philadelphia.</p>



<p>In the meantime, He, Reski and their colleagues are cultivating <em>Takakia</em> populations and transplanting them to other regions in Tibet in the hopes of giving old moss a new lease on life. “<em>Takakia</em> saw the dinosaurs come and go. It saw us humans coming,” Reski says. “Now we can learn something about resilience and extinction from this tiny moss.”</p>

<p>Following an inspection earlier this month, Colombia&#8217;s FDA has suspended all human research at a facility that until this summer had been receiving <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/adoCUZ3XEU-voptEvqRj0A/project-details/10513808#details">U.S. funding to develop a malaria vaccine</a>.</p>



<p>The Malaria Vaccine and Development Center, in the city of Cali in western Colombia, is part of the <a href="https://inmuno.co/cic/es/consorcio-2/">Caucaseco Scientific Research Consortium</a>, which is run by husband-and-wife team Myriam Arévalo-Herrera and Sócrates Herrera. The couple has secured more than $17 million from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2003.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported in April, an investigation by the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) exposed <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/27/us-backed-researchers-in-colombia-accused-of-experimenting-on-animals-humans-without-approval/">a host of serious problems at the facilities</a>, including widespread animal abuse and falsified research approvals.

<span id="more-127695"></span>



<ul>
<li>The center was not certified by Invima in Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and thus was not authorized to conduct clinical trials.</li>



<li>Documents found at the center described clinical studies that had been performed without mandatory approvals from Invima and ethics committees.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Studies had been conducted without written informed consent from participants.</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-ocean-heat-florida-climate-change">Extreme ocean heat off Florida has ebbed. But for marine life, the danger remains</a></h4>

              
                <p>In late July, a fierce ocean heat wave ratcheted up temperatures in Florida’s coastal waters to unprecedented highs. One buoy bobbing in shallow, turbid Manatee Bay logged a measurement of 38.3˚ Celsius (101˚ Fahrenheit). That may be the highest temperature ever recorded in the ocean. A week later, that surge in ocean heat had ebbed. But South Florida’s denizens are still in hot water.</p>



<p>The concern is not just that the Manatee Bay buoy recorded shockingly high, hot tub–level temperatures — actually, “close to the limit of hot tub temperatures” — for several days in a row, says Benjamin Kirtman, a climate scientist at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.</p>





<p>And it’s not just that June and July’s brutally hot water temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean are linked to shockingly hot temperatures on land. This summer, Miami’s heat index, a measure of air temperature and humidity, soared to a record-breaking streak of nearly two months, reaching a daily heat index of 38° C (100° F).</p>



<p>It’s not even that such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-extreme-heat-wave-past-climate-new-normal">ocean heat waves are becoming the new normal</a>, as swells of heat more and more frequently crest atop the baseline warming of the global ocean due to climate change (<em>SN: 2/1/22</em>). Florida’s waters may have hit a record high, but <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/marine-heatwaves/#report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July saw widespread ocean heat waves</a> around the world, from the North Atlantic Ocean to the eastern equatorial Pacific to the Southern Indian Ocean.</p>



<p>“The global oceans have warmed up so much … we’re seeing a ratcheting up that’s unprecedented in the modern instrument record, and maybe in the last 125,000 years,” Kirtman says. “It’s really quite remarkable.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">‘Way outside of the bounds of anything these corals have experienced’</h4>



<p>In Florida, the temperatures of the coastal waters have returned to a normal summertime range for now. But the danger remains acute for many ocean dwellers, from corals to fish, says Andrew Baker, a coral biologist also at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School.</p>



<p>Murky Manatee Bay, swirling with sediment, isn’t home to corals — but the water temperatures in the reefs around the Florida Keys were still “incredibly hot,” perhaps reaching up to 36° C (96° F), Baker says.</p>



<p>As the sweltering sea temperatures peaked in July, the Coral Restoration Foundation, a nonprofit marine conservation organization based in Key Largo, Fla., found 100 percent coral mortality at one site, Sombrero Reef off Key West. There, heat had caused the corals to bleach.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-flourish wp-block-embed-flourish"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="Interactive or visual content" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/14641978/embed#?secret=Lh2SPtSXxx" data-secret="Lh2SPtSXxx" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="575" width="500"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Corals may survive a few days of very high temperatures but too long spent in extremely hot water can kill them. That accumulated heat stress is measured by coral scientists in &#8220;degree heating weeks,&#8221; or DHW, a measure of both the intensity and duration of the heat the corals experienced over the previous 12 weeks. Significant coral bleaching begins to occur at 4˚ C–weeks; at 8˚ C–weeks, corals experience severe, widespread bleaching and significant mortality is expected. The accumulated heat stress on the corals at Sombrero Reef in the Florida Keys (shown) generally peaks in August and September (gray lines). But the mounting heat stress on the corals in 2023 (red line) is unprecedented in records going back to 1985.</figcaption></figure>
</div>



<p>Bleaching occurs when corals’ symbiotic algae, the main source of their food, flee, leaving the corals colorless and essentially starving. Corals can recover from bleaching, but if the events are too severe or too frequent, they can kill entire reefs. U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records show that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/corals-are-severely-bleaching-five-times-often-1980">heat burden on corals globally has been rising since the 1980s</a> (<em>SN: 1/4/18</em>).</p>



<p>Even with the return to typical summertime water temperatures off Florida’s coasts, the impacts of July’s heat wave on the region’s corals will linger. That’s because corals have a limit to how much accumulated heat they can tolerate before bleaching. And with this heat wave, the corals have already received far too much heat far too early in the summer, researchers say.</p>





<p>NOAA records from sites across the Florida Keys each tell the same worrisome story — that what’s happened in 2023 so far is “way outside of the bounds of anything these corals have experienced,” Baker says. And the corals still must contend with two more months of expected, but still very hot, water in August and September.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, scientists are racing to save corals growing at nurseries in the Keys, bringing them to onshore laboratories away from the overheated coastal waters. The cultivated corals are part of a decade-long effort to protect the two most important reef species in the region, staghorn and elkhorn coral, from the ever-looming threat of bleaching.</p>

<p>The fledgling finger- to hand-sized corals are cultivated in coastal waters atop bits of PVC tubing, and are ultimately destined to be planted in reefs. As the water temperatures rose, researchers hurried to collect the cultivated corals ahead of their expected spawning in early August. Scientists feared the &#8220;heat stress is just too much for these baby corals,&#8221; and that they might not spawn at all, Baker says. Happily, some of the rescued staghorn corals, now ensconced in the laboratory, did manage to spawn on August 3, releasing clouds of eggs and sperm into the water. Whether the sperm will fertilize the eggs remains uncertain, but Baker and colleagues are cautiously optimistic.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It’s not just corals in trouble</h4>



<p>The overheated water is also bad news for everything from sponges to sea grasses to fish. “There are a lot of studies that show that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animals-swim-thousands-kilometers-escape-ocean-heat-waves">species experiencing ocean heat waves are migrating [to cooler waters]</a>,” says Regina Rodrigues, a physical oceanographer at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil (<em>SN: 8/10/20</em>). But in tropical regions like the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, where cooler waters are prohibitively far away, “that community doesn’t have anywhere to go.”</p>



<p>That lack of access to an escape route to cooler waters is why the region’s cold-blooded ocean species, including fish, may be even more vulnerable to warming than their counterparts on land. On average, ocean ectotherms <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1132-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend more time near the upper limits for body temperature</a> than land ectotherms, as marine ecologist Malin Pinsky of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., and colleagues reported in 2019.</p>



<p>Then there’s the anoxia. As water heats up, it releases oxygen, like bubbles escaping a pot boiling on the stove, leaving less oxygen available for sea life. Such heat-amped anoxic waters have been linked to increased sea grass die-offs as well as fish kills. In June, for example, thousands of fish killed by a low-oxygen event washed up on the Texas Gulf Coast just south of Houston.</p>



<p>Florida’s sea grasses have been in free fall for years, with thousands of hectares of marine sea grass beds wiped out by anoxia as well as nutrient pollution, which can lead to harmful algal blooms that block out the light for underwater plants. The loss of those sea grass ecosystems has been deadly for manatees and other creatures that rely on the grasses for food.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">‘It’s just bonkers hot’</h4>



<p>What’s driving the brutal ocean temperatures is still uncertain — but human-caused climate change is undeniably at its core, researchers say. “Ninety-three percent of the excess heat in the atmosphere is being absorbed by the ocean,” Rodrigues says. That’s raised the average temperature of ocean waters, “and once the mean temperature is raised, the extremes are easier to achieve.”</p>



<p>Other factors are also likely playing a role, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">this year’s onset of the global climate pattern known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>). The El Niño phase of that climate pattern tends to increase the global average temperature, and this year’s El Niño is bidding to be “a strong one,” Kirtman says.</p>



<p>“Certainly, one of the questions that’s come up is how much [of the heat] is internal natural variability, and how much a ratcheting up of climate change,” he says.</p>



<p>Local extremes — such as the temporary hot tub in Manatee Bay — may also be influenced by factors such as the shallowness of the water and murkier, less-reflective waters absorbing more heat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, Kirtman says, the global oceans have warmed up so much that El Niño or sediment-laden waters alone can’t possibly explain what’s going on. “This is so crazy, so bonkers. It’s just bonkers hot.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unknome-catalog-genome-protein-mysterious">The ‘unknome’ catalogs nearly 2 million proteins. Many are mysterious</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to vast, under-explored frontiers, space and Earth&#8217;s oceans come to mind. But even in human bodies, there’s still much to be discovered. Meet the &#8220;<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unknome</a>,&#8221; a new database that emphasizes how much we still don&#8217;t know about human genes and proteins.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://unknome.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly available database</a> ranks groups of proteins by how little is known about them. That information could help scientists identify proteins for future study, including for disease treatment and drug discovery, researchers report August 8 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>





<p>Cell biologist Sean Munro and colleagues compiled the unknome — a portmanteau of the words <em>unknown</em> and <em>genome </em>— to identify understudied but potentially important proteins and their corresponding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-project-dna-genetics-revolution-green">protein-coding</a> genes: DNA that copies a protein’s recipe into RNA (<em>SN: 2/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>Proteins are generally grouped into families that have a common evolutionary ancestor. The unknome database contains all protein families with at least one protein encoded by the human genetic instruction book, or genome, or by the genomes of 11 other commonly studied organisms. Over 13,000 groups and nearly 2 million proteins are included.</p>



<p>The unknome assigns a “knownness” score to each group of proteins based on how much is known about their corresponding genes. Some 3,000 of those groups, including 805 that contain at least one human protein, have a knownness score of zero, showing there’s still much to learn within the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">human genome</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/22</em>).</p>



<p>Munro and colleagues used the database to study 260 genes that are shared between fruit flies and humans and that have low knownness scores. After dialing down the activity of each of the protein-coding genes in the flies, the researchers found that about 60 were essential for life. Others were important for reproduction, growth, movement and resilience against stress.</p>



<p>“Even in really well-studied [organisms] like flies, there are new things to be found,” says Munro, of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.</p>



<p>Whether some or all of those genes have similar effects in humans is still unknown. But the database could help researchers tease out important human proteins by quickly screening similar proteins in more easily studied organisms like fruit flies, says data scientist Tudor Oprea of Expert Systems Inc., a drug discovery company in San Diego, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Munro says the next step for his group is to work with similar efforts like the <a href="https://understudiedproteins.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understudied Proteins Initiative</a> for a large-scale study of these mysterious proteins.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiral-galaxies-lentil-shaped-star">Spiral galaxies might have been lentil-shaped before becoming starry whirls</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way might have once looked more like a legume than a starry whirlpool.</p>



<p>Over their unfathomably long lifetimes, spiral galaxies like the Milky Way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-galaxies-are-flat-old-ones-are-more-blobby">are generally thought to </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-galaxies-are-flat-old-ones-are-more-blobby">morph</a> into lentil-shaped “lenticular” galaxies and then into elliptical blobs (<em>SN: 4/23/18</em>). But an analysis of nearby galaxies suggests that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/3/3588/7152347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our galaxy, and others like it, was once lenticular</a>, astronomer Alister Graham reports in the July <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. If correct, Graham’s proposed update to the evolutionary sequence of galaxies would rewrite the history of the Milky Way.</p>





<p>“Lenticulars have always been sort of the abandoned stepchild of [galaxy] morphology,” says astronomer Christopher Conselice of the University of Manchester in England, who wasn’t involved in the study. But this paper puts them into focus, he says, as being a major aspect of how galaxies change.</p>



<p>Lenticulars get their name from the way their entire halo of stars, when viewed edge on, bulges in the middle and thins out toward the sides, much like a lentil. These galaxies exhibit a confusing mix of properties that’s made their presumed place in the middle of galaxy evolution sequences rather suspect.</p>



<p>“We’ve known for a while that that’s almost certainly not correct,” Conselice says. Particularly puzzling is that lenticulars, despite their spiral-like disks, don’t have lots of gas, which hinders them from producing new stars. Spiral galaxies do have lots of star-forming gas, and scientists aren’t sure why lenticular galaxies don’t.</p>



<p>Graham, of Swinburne University of Technology in Hawthorn, Australia, found new clues to this mystery of galaxy evolution by considering black holes.</p>



<p>Most galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole in their center, and when galaxies merge, so do those black holes. This makes the mass of a galaxy’s black hole a kind of record of its past collisions. If a galaxy got big by gobbling up its neighbors rather than by sucking up surrounding gas, its black hole should be hefty relative to the swarm of stars that surrounds it.</p>



<p>Using images from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, Graham compared the black hole and stellar masses of about 100 nearby galaxies. For galaxies of the same shape, he saw that black hole mass and stellar mass tend to be linked in a predictable way — except for the lenticular galaxies.</p>



<p>When Graham took a closer look at the lenticulars, he realized they are actually two distinct groups that had been lumped together: those that have lots of interstellar dust and those that do not. This division, which he previously reported in the May <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>, could have been a superficial aesthetic difference. But the galaxies’ black hole masses suggest otherwise.</p>



<p>Dust-poor and dust-rich lenticulars have entirely different relationships between their black hole masses and stellar masses, suggesting different histories and explaining the apparently scattered behavior of lenticular galaxies. The dusty galaxies tend to have a heftier supermassive black hole than the ones found in both spirals and dust-poor lenticulars. Dust-poor lenticulars are usually on the small side in terms of both black hole mass and stellar mass.</p>



<p>This led Graham to conclude that spiral galaxies are actually in between the two types of lenticulars, evolutionarily speaking. His new analysis suggests that dust-poor lenticulars become spirals after capturing small &#8220;satellite galaxies” and other minor mergers —&nbsp;bumping up their black hole masses — and scooping up nearby gas.</p>



<p>When spirals collide with other substantial galaxies, he proposes, they become dust-rich lenticulars — and indeed, he adds, every dust-rich lenticular in his dataset was previously recognized as the remnant of a spiral galaxy merger. Collisions between these dust-rich lenticulars are then enough to finally erode the galaxies’ discs of stars and destroy their dust, producing blobby elliptical galaxies.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Black holes are a good tracer of galaxy evolution, Conselice says, but the new sequence could be controversial. One issue, he says, is that lenticular galaxies in the nearby universe are usually such lightweights that they would need to merge tens or even hundreds of times — far more than the expected average of around three over 10 billion years — to form a large spiral galaxy.</p>



<p>But things might have been different in the early universe, he adds. Long ago, there could have been more massive lenticulars. Figuring that out might be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope, which can see incredibly faint infrared light, so is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-time-galaxy">allowing scientists to peer farther away</a> — and further back in time — than ever before <em>(SN: 12/16/22</em>).</p>



<p>“If you could look in the more distant universe, you could potentially see some of these galaxies when they&#8217;re first forming, or when they&#8217;re evolving,” Conselice says. “We could potentially really test this idea.”</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the associate editors of the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em>, a Wiley title, have resigned in a dispute with the publisher, and more resignations are likely, according to those involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the resignations, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/another-wiley-journal-board-resigns-after-month-long-strike">reported first</a> by <em>Times Higher Education</em>, were effective immediately, but a portion of the associate editors set August 28 as their effective date in hopes Wiley may negotiate with them about <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/08/01/associateeditors-workstoppage-jbiogeography-continues/">their concerns</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the associate editors stopped processing new manuscripts at the end of June, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">we reported</a> last month, due to the dispute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In interviews with Retraction Watch, two associate editors who had put in their resignations described concerns with the journal’s high article processing charges (APCs) fueling Wiley’s profitability, as well as the “breakdown in negotiations” between the publisher and the journal’s lead editorial team. </p>



<span id="more-127686"></span>



<p>As we reported last week, Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/01/an-editor-resigned-in-protest-now-wiley-is-firing-him-four-months-earlier-than-he-planned-to-leave/">moved to terminate</a> Mike Dawson, the chief editor of the journal, as of August&nbsp; 27, after he had tendered his resignation in early May with the contractually-required six months notice. Dawson expressed disappointment that the publisher had “not made any efforts to address any of the issues” the editorial team raised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve taken these decisions because we believe the decisions lead to the greatest success and longevity of the journal,” Dawson said. “It’s disappointing Wiley is not engaged. They would benefit in the long run. It’s that simple.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass resignations at the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> are the latest in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/26/editors-in-chief-of-aging-journal-resign-en-masse-after-impasse-with-the-anatomical-society-and-wiley/">string</a> of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/editors-of-public-health-journal-resign-over-differences-with-publisher/">such actions</a> by <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/imaging-journal-editors-resign-over-extreme-open-access-fees/">editors</a> <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/elsevier-journal-board-follows-through-mass-resignation-threat">dissatisfied</a> with the actions of publishers. Last week, many moderators of ProMED-mail, an infectious disease bulletin that reported the first cases of COVID-19, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/03/promed-early-warning-system-on-disease-outbreaks-appears-near-collapse/">announced</a> they were suspending work for the service after the host society said it would start charging subscription fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> is not fully open access, but <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13652699/homepage/fundedaccess.html">charges APCs</a> of $4,800 for authors who wish to make their articles freely available.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-thumbnail"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley-150x150.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-127688" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tolley.jpeg?w=256&amp;ssl=1 256w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Krystal Tolley</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Such fees are “excessive,” and “not affordable,” said Krystal Tolley, one of the associate editors who put in her resignation for the end of the month. Tolley is based in South Africa, and said she and other researchers in the Global South “just don’t have those kinds of funds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley and other major publishers often waive fees for authors in low-income countries, and “transformative agreements” in which funding agencies or universities pay publication fees rather than authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But neither option is satisfactory, Tolley said. Few articles receive waivers, and as for transformative agreements, “I find it lip service. It’s not them who’s taking the hit, it’s still somebody who’s paying them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publishing model of charging high fees for open access publication, Tolley and other associate editors wrote in an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.14697#jbi14697-bib-0027">editorial</a> about their work stoppage:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>severely hampers the research visibility of early career researchers and those in countries with low-to-middle economies who cannot afford [open access] fees and therefore publish in less visible outlets. At the same time, this system promotes the visibility of those researchers with ample funds and allows unfair free access to their content. [Open access] combined with high APCs creates a pay-to-play system where those that have funds have research that is likely to be more visible and more cited.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides the journal’s high APC, the editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">have also objected</a> to what they understand as the publisher’s intention to make the journal entirely open access, increase its volume, and automatically refer rejected manuscripts to other Wiley journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors began trying to engage Wiley in discussion about their concerns near the beginning of this year, but the journal’s managers “essentially refused” to talk, Dawson said. After four months of frustration, he put in his resignation on May 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was clear that I could not achieve anything as chief editor when Wiley would not talk at all,” he said. He and the associate editors discussed what to do next, and settled on the work stoppage to try and pressure Wiley to the negotiation table. “Where we are now is the result of them not engaging seriously.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawson said he suspected an email he sent informing authors who had submitted to the journal during the work stoppage that processing their manuscripts could be delayed sparked Wiley’s decision to fire him. He said Wiley initially attempted to fire him by email, effective immediately. He pointed out that termination without notice was in breach of his contract, and later that day received a letter giving him 30 days notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson confirmed the dates of his resignation and termination but would not otherwise comment on the staffing changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson previously told us that the journal<em> </em>was no longer part of the referral program for rejected manuscripts, and “there are no plans to flip the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> to open access but that we continually evaluate our journals to ensure they stay aligned with subject areas and funding trends.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither of those statements are concessions, Dawson said. He and the editors of the publisher’s other biogeography journals were only referring a small number of rejected manuscripts to each other, so they had essentially implemented the policy themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley “may not have an explicit plan” to make the journal open access, Dawson said, but at the beginning of the year the publisher was “absolutely clear” that they intended “to flip the journal to open access on a time horizon of two to four years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the resignations, a Wiley spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our highest priority is to continue delivering impactful research that serves the academic community and society at large. Wiley regularly meets with editors on issues that impact research publishing. To that end, we have extended several invitations to meet with the editors from the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> to discuss their concerns and further support their important work. We appreciate the feedback shared by members of the academic publishing community and welcome further discussion to strengthen our journals and the people they serve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dawson noted that some of the <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/07/14/betterpublishing-jbiogeography-i/">12 points</a> the editors had raised for discussion were more difficult to resolve than others, and said the editors would take action on the easier things, such as setting up an advisory board consisting of the chief editors of the publisher’s biogeography journals, as a sign of good faith. Then discussion of the difficult issues, such as what constitutes a fair APC and amount of profit for Wiley to make, could follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/gis/staff/williams-jack/">Jack Williams</a>, chair of the department of geography at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who resigned as an associate editor of the journal last week, likened the current scientific publishing system to giving blood. He has gladly donated his time for peer review and editing “as service to science,” and has also given blood to the American Red Cross on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I found out the American Red Cross is making profit margins of 20% or whatever,” he said, he’d think, “Maybe I should give blood somewhere else. That’s not what I’m giving blood for.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, “When you see a model in which labor is essentially given for free, then made part of a business model that includes fees to authors, with fairly high profit margins, that&#8217;s a point of concern.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The system can work, he said, but it “feels out of balance to me right now.” With such high APCs, “it doesn’t feel right to me to put my effort into that system currently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s still deciding where to draw the line on journals he will or will not support by editing or peer reviewing, but said shifting his donated service work towards nonprofit, society-associated journals with lower fees made sense. “There’s more alternatives out there now than there used to be. We have to take a hard look at the value we’re getting for the money we’re paying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tolley has decided to stop editing or reviewing articles for journals published by Wiley or the other major scientific publishers, and avoid submitting her own work to them when possible, “because they’re getting free content.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of her coauthors don’t agree with that stance, so as a compromise, the group will not pay open access fees for a current submission to a major publisher’s journal, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To change the system, it has to be everyone who buys into this and says ‘No, I’m not going to pay that much money or work for free,’” Tolley said. “The majority of people have to do this, stop sending content to them, stop reviewing, stop editing. That’s the only way.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS is one of eight signatories on this letter. It was sent to Congress last week and posted publicly today (August 7, 2023).</p>



<p>Dear Chairwoman Granger and Subcommittee Chairman Rogers,</p>



<p><strong>RE: Response to House Appropriations Committee release of the Fiscal Year 2024 bill for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee<sup>1</sup></strong></p>



<p>In our capacity as representatives of leading fully Open Access research publishers and Open Science platforms, we submit our objection to the draft language<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;in the Subcommittee&rsquo;s FY24 spending bill<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;that&nbsp; blocks implementation&nbsp; of the Office of Science and Technology Policy&rsquo;s (OSTP) August 2022 guidance to make federally funded research freely available without delay.<br><br>As a group of global publishers, we share a single aim &ndash; the transition to fully open scientific communication for the benefit of all parts of society. We believe the restriction of funds as outlined in Sec 552 of the bill is detrimental to this goal. We strongly support the OSTP guidelines which we believe represent a significant policy advancement for global scientific and academic research.<br><br>If enacted, the current Appropriations Bill will prevent American taxpayers from seeing the societal benefits of the more than $90 billion in scientific research that the U.S. government funds each year, as most of the research remains locked behind publishing paywalls. And it will remove the current requirement for commercial publishers to adapt their business models to make public access to science fair. Science for the few who can access it &ndash; as opposed to the many who pay for it &ndash; is inefficient as scientific or governmental policy.</p>



<p>The political and societal move towards Open Science is well established as the demand for access to all publicly funded research intensifies. The retention of the 12-month embargo, as the Appropriations Bill stipulates, is a retrograde step within the global context of research and access to scientific literature.<br><br>As part of an established ecosystem of publishers, funding organizations, and governmental and scholarly institutions, we have seen prominent examples of the collaborative advancement of Open Science:</p>



<ul><li>The world&rsquo;s largest subscription publishers were transitioning to open policies for years prior to the OSTP announcement, in accordance with the principles of Plan S<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and alongside the organizations of cOAlition S.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;These efforts have received strong support from the Association of Research Libraries,<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;academic societies, and individual researchers.</li><li>Funders such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;have already limited or removed embargoes as a part of their funding mandates.</li><li>Longstanding governmental efforts, such as the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative,<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;increasingly rely on making published results of federally funded research more openly available to researchers and the public.</li></ul>



<p>The United States is a global scientific leader. The inclusion of the current language in relation to Sec 552 would be a block on the advancement of US research and its influence within the international scientific community.</p>



<p>We would be happy to work with the Committee to develop alternative language that maintains the existing direction of Open Science policy and scientific freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Microtektites found in Caribbean may shed light on tektite origin </strong>—<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/microtektites-found-caribbean-may-shed-light-tektite-origin"><em>Science News</em></a>, August 11, 1973</p>



<p>Though their origin remains a mystery to scientists, huge strewn fields of tektites have been found in widely separated areas of the world&#8230;. Microtektites have now been found in the Caribbean, and the characteristics of these newly found specimens may ultimately shed some light on the question of tektite origin….</p>



<p>Some believe that the tektites come from the moon. They feel that tektites were formed when an asteroid hit the moon, splashing droplets of molten rocks so high that they escaped the moon&#8217;s gravity and fell to Earth. However, mass spectrographic analysis of lunar samples shows that elements in the lunar crust are far different from tektites. The tektites are more like the elements in the continental crust of the Earth itself. [Planetary scientist Billy P. Glass] feels that if the parent material of [newfound] microtektites can be determined … the discovery of the origin of the glassy objects might quickly follow suit.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Glass surmised that these geologic curiosities have earthly origins, based on his and his colleagues’ analyses of the North American strewn field — a blanket of glassy particles that covers much the southeastern United States and Caribbean and dates to about 35 million years ago. But it took another 20 years for researchers to identify the source.</p>



<p>In 1994, tektites and concentric fault lines in southern Virginia revealed an 85-kilometer-wide impact crater under Chesapeake Bay. <em>Science News</em> reported that &#8220;a structure this size would rank as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/large-meteorite-scar-identified-virginia">the largest crater in the United States</a>&#8221; and would be among the largest on Earth (<em>SN: 8/20/94</em>). What’s more, when the space rock slammed into our planet, the collision created <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mangled-microfossils-may-mark-impact-sites">intense seismic waves that bent microfossils</a> into odd shapes, scientists reported nearly a decade later (<em>SN: 6/11/03</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken together with evidence from Earth’s three other major strewn fields, the findings helped confirm that tektites form when a bolide slams into our planet with enough force to blast liquified chunks of Earth&#8217;s crust into the atmosphere. These chunks then harden into raindrop-, barbell- and ravioli-shaped particles as they fall back to the surface.</p>



<p>So far, researchers have linked three of the four major strewn fields with impact craters. The North American strewn field is tied to the Chesapeake crater in Virginia, the central European strewn field is associated with the Ries crater in Germany, and the Ivory Coast strewn field originates from the Bosumtwi crater in Ghana. The holdout is the Australasian strewn field, which is the largest known and covers about 10 percent of Earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Scientists recently got a break in the case. Analyses of tektites found in Thailand and other geologic evidence as well as computer simulations suggest a probable source. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1904368116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2-kilometer-wide meteorite struck Laos about 800,000 years ago</a> and flung debris across Asia, Australia and Antarctica, scientists reported in 2020 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. </p>



<p>The resulting crater, which may be about 13 kilometers wide by 17 kilometers long, was eventually buried under volcanic material, the team contends. Verifying this hypothesis will require drilling through lava fields to see if the rocks underneath show melting and shattering — both hallmarks of an impact.</p>



<p>To a collector, the curiosities found around an impact crater are full of wonder and poetry. To a planetary scientist, these small pieces of evidence may yet open big windows into Earth’s geologic past.</p>

<p>The authors of a response to an article critiquing the use of the term “terminal anorexia” retracted their letter last month after receiving major backlash from researchers, healthcare providers, and people with eating disorders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00808-w">Regardless of inequities in care, terminal anorexia nervosa exists: a response to Sharpe et. al</a>,” which defended the use of the term, was published May 20 in the <em>Journal of Eating Disorders</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter was a response to “<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00791-2">Inaccessibility of care and inequitable conceptions of suffering: a collective response to the construction of “terminal” anorexia nervosa</a>,” an article published earlier in the month in the same journal by researchers with lived experiences of eating disorders<em>.</em> The article outlined methodological problems with the criteria for diagnosis of a “terminal eating disorder” put forward in “<a href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-022-00548-3">Terminal anorexia nervosa: three cases and proposed clinical characteristics,</a>” a previous paper by two of the authors of the response letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The response was retracted on July 17. Its retraction note reads:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127677"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors have retracted this article following discussions with multiple stakeholders. The authors offer their deepest apologies for the distress and the unintended negative impact of this piece.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The original response is no longer available online but can be viewed on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230520194241/https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00808-w">archived version</a> of the page. </p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Joel Yager, the first author of the retracted response, said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We retracted the letter following conversations with involved and affected parties after we better understood how they were impacted by our language in this response letter. But please understand that we remain dedicated to continuing to help encourage compassionate and critical conversations about this patient population.&nbsp; We stand by our advocacy for the rare yet highly deserving population of adults who cannot survive their anorexia nervosa and thus deserve the full and compassionate care that anyone with a terminal illness is due.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response letter prompted immediate backlash online, with James Downs <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesldowns/status/1659990726359351297">tweeting</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

In my view this is borderline an abuse of a publication platform and it’s hard to know how to respond without giving this harmful construct oxygen. <a href="https://t.co/yMof0O5YJD">https://t.co/yMof0O5YJD</a></p>&mdash; James Downs (@jamesldowns) <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesldowns/status/1659990726359351297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Downs, who is a psychological therapist, researcher, and a person with a longstanding eating disorder, wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Aside from some of the arguments made, the tone and personal nature of the response disturbed me the most. For instance, the insinuation that authors with lived experience of the subject are less aware of the realities of the deaths of patients with anorexia than clinicians and academics was highly condescending, I was particularly concerned that the response appeared to make a psychological interpretation of Sharpe et al.&#8217;s argument as a product of the &#8220;anorexic voice&#8221;, which felt to me like a misuse of clinical authority, publicly evoking the supposed-psychopathology those within a vulnerable population as a rhetorical device.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Others also felt the letter did not address the main points of the article to which it was responding. Sam Sharpe, the first author of that article, wrote in an email to Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The publication by Yager et al. 2023 did not engage with the core components of our thesis and appeared to constitute an attempt to undermine the credibility of our team and other lived experience researchers that, without supporting evidence, likely doesn’t have a place in academic discussion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Scout Silverstein, another author of the Sharpe et al. article, told Retraction Watch that they and the other authors of the article agree that there are rare situations in which anorexia is deadly, and that people in this situation deserve compassion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Many of us agree that a fraction of people diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa will experience a critical stage of illness that may lead to death, and that those people deserve death with dignity. Our concerns about the original paper by Gaudiani et al. are its methodological flaws, failure to account for systemic inequities, and its lack of foresight in understanding the implications of introducing this diagnostic criteria in this manner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although the authors offer an apology in the retraction notice, Marissa Adams, another author of the Sharpe et al. article, pointed to an article in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/13/anorexia-right-to-die-terminal-mental-health"><em>The Guardian</em></a> in which Jennifer Gaudiani, an author on both papers advocating for establishing criteria for “terminal anorexia,” said, “I know for a fact that this advocacy is correct and that these individuals deserve to be cared for compassionately at the end of their lives.”</p>



<p>The co-editors in chief of the journal, Phillipa Hay and Stephen Touyz, did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Selene Cary, publishing director of fully open access journals at Springer Nature, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article was retracted at the request of the authors, after they raised concerns about potential unintended negative impacts of the correspondence following discussions with multiple stakeholders. We took the concerns raised very seriously and concluded that retraction and removal of the correspondence from the journal website was the most appropriate and responsible action to take.</p>
