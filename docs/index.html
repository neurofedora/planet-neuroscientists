<p><em>The Lancet</em> has put an expression of concern on a 2006 case report of a baby’s death purportedly from morphine poisoning through breast milk. The decision comes just days after the <em>New Yorker </em>published <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/02/did-a-celebrated-researcher-obscure-a-fatal-poisoning">a year-long investigation</a> into the death and the controversies that have surrounded it.</p>



<p>The case report described the 2005 death of a baby boy whose mother had been prescribed Tylenol 3, which contains codeine. Gideon Koren, founder of the now-defunct Motherisk Drug Testing Laboratory at the University of Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children, used the case for years to claim codeine – which gets metabolized to morphine in the body – can pose a lethal risk to breastfeeding infants.</p>



<p>“It feels like an element of vindication,” David Juurlink, professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Toronto, told Retraction Watch of the expression of concern. Juurlink, a pharmacologist and toxicologist who has been pursuing this case for over a decade, requested <em>The Lancet </em>retract the article in 2020, when he and a colleague published a review article calling into question key elements of the case report. The paper, he said, “really does serve as the foundation of an entire branch of pediatric pharmacology that shouldn’t exist.”</p>



<span id="more-134103"></span>



<p>Koren, a pediatrician and pharmacologist, resigned from the Hospital for Sick Children, known as SickKids, in 2015 following an investigation into Motherisk, a lab which tested for perinatal exposure to drugs and alcohol, including for criminal and child protection cases. The investigation, prompted by <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/sick-kids-orders-systematic-review-of-dr-gideon-koren-s-published-works/article_c791f35d-cffc-5678-ac77-6aedcc8071bf.html">coverage in the <em>Toronto Star</em></a>, found the Motherisk lab’s test results were “inadequate and unreliable,” the newspaper reported. The investigation brought <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/sick-kids-orders-systematic-review-of-dr-gideon-koren-s-published-works/article_c791f35d-cffc-5678-ac77-6aedcc8071bf.html">more than 400 of Koren’s papers</a> under scrutiny by the hospital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2008, <em>The Lancet </em>published <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61266-0/fulltext">a letter</a> raising questions about some of the conclusions in the 2006 report. Toxicologist Nicholas Bateman and colleagues questioned whether the dose of morphine delivered by breast milk could actually be fatal. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61267-2/fulltext">In response</a>, Koren and colleagues attributed the dose to the fact that the mother was a rapid metabolizer of codeine, meaning her body more readily converts codeine into morphine.</p>



<p>The case report came under scrutiny again in 2020, when Juurlink and pharmacologist Jonathan Zipursky published a <a href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.1882">review </a>outlining the unlikelihood of morphine toxicity occurring through breast milk. They noted the morphine concentration in the breast milk sample was relatively small, even with the mother being a rapid metabolizer, and the baby had a codeine — not morphine — blood concentration 100 times higher than would be expected from breast milk.</p>



<p>That 2020 review culminated in <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/should-breastfeeding-mothers-take-codeine-for-post-partum-pain-doctors-re-examined-a-2005-tragedy/article_1003f656-cef2-5ade-8742-df77d55d786a.html">coverage in the <em>Star</em></a> and a request for retraction to <em>The Lancet</em>, as well as requests for retraction for columns Koren had published in <a href="https://www.cfp.ca/content/53/1/33.long"><em>Canadian Family Physician</em></a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/171516350613900610"><em>Canadian Pharmacists Journal</em></a>. The two Canadian journals consulted two external experts and ultimately decided to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1715163520970443">retract the articles</a>, based on “clear evidence that the findings are unreliable,” the joint retraction statement said.</p>



<p><em>The Lancet </em>referred the matter to SickKids to investigate, and the hospital concluded the matter was simply a “scientific disagreement,” the <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/a-flawed-medical-journal-article-on-postpartum-pain-was-targeted-for-retraction-from-the-lancet/article_7af2e0fe-1ad6-5f3f-a512-d306a8f58545.html"><em>Star </em>reported in 2023</a>.</p>



<p>“They went to Gideon Koren and three of his coauthors on the paper, and they said, ‘Do you stand by your findings?’” Juurlink told us. “In no universe is that a competent investigation.”</p>



<p>Parvaz Madadi, who had been a Ph.D. student in Koren’s lab, had been named as a coauthor on the two retracted papers. But she told the <em>New Yorker</em> she didn’t write either paper. </p>



<p>On January 20, days before the <em>New Yorker </em>story appeared, Madadi wrote to <em>The Lancet </em>asking them to retract the 2006 article. The move came after Madadi reviewed her past work and the case report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At the core of her letter is a new allegation: that Koren falsified toxicological data,” the <em>New Yorker </em>article states. Madadi confirmed those details for us but declined to comment further, pending the outcome of the investigation. According to the Feb. 3 retraction notice, <em>“The Lancet </em>was contacted with new allegations of falsification of toxicological data, authorship issues, and ethical concerns about the Case Report with a renewed call for retraction.”</p>



<p>Juurlink told us he wrote to <em>The Lancet </em>last week to reiterate the scientific issues with the paper. “It should be retracted because it is unreliable on account of major scientific error,” he said.</p>



<p>According to the notice, <em>The Lancet</em> is once again referring the matter to SickKids for investigation. <em>The Lancet </em>declined to comment further.</p>



<p>Koren moved to Israel after being dismissed from SickKids in 2015. As of 2022 he was affiliated with the Ariel University Adelson School of Medicine, but he is not currently listed among the faculty, and we were unable to find current contact information for him. The <em>New Yorker</em> reported he could not be reached for comment.</p>

</div>


<p>In 2019, a journal retracted <a href="https://journals.lww.com/drug-monitoring/fulltext/2019/04000/an_investigation_into_variability_in_the.21.aspx">a paper</a> of Koren’s “due to concerns regarding academic and research misconduct,” including publishing the paper without his coauthor’s consent, as we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/19/controversial-pediatrics-researcher-has-20-year-old-paper-retracted-for-misconduct/">reported at the time</a>. Koren has six retractions, by our count.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>New Yorker </em>article describes David Naylor, the former interim president and CEO of SickKids, referring to the hospital’s faculty “screening endless manuscripts” and “devising strategies for requesting retractions of Koren’s most egregious works.”</p>



<p>Juurlink said the toll of Koren’s unreliable research has been enormous, but the accounting remains incomplete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not just about one infant death,” Juurlink said. “It&#8217;s about millions of babies not being breastfed because mom&#8217;s taking opioids. It&#8217;s about women by the millions having their peripartum analgesia modified based upon a myth,” he said. “And critically, it is about infant deaths that have been mistakenly attributed to breast milk because of this whole narrative.”</p>



<p>He added: “I think it is now incumbent upon the Hospital for Sick Children to get it right this time.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Heliyon</em> has published fewer papers and ramped up its retractions since a major indexing service put the journal on hold and the publisher launched an audit of all papers published in the journal since its launch in 2016.</p>



<p>Clarivate <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">put <em>Heliyon </em>on hold in September 2024</a>, citing concerns about the quality of the content. The “on-hold” status indicates a journal is being re-evaluated, and new content isn’t indexed, according to <a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-policies-category-change-requests-appeals/">documentation</a> on the Clarivate website. A spokesperson for Clarivate told us they couldn’t comment on specific journals, but said a journal must be both taken off hold and have its missing content backfilled by August 1 in order to receive an impact factor for that year. If a journal is still on hold and content hasn’t been backfilled, the journal will not receive an impact factor, the spokesperson said.</p>



<p><em>Heliyon</em> published over 11,000 papers in 2023 and more than 17,000 in 2024, issuing around two dozen retractions in each year. Last year, the journal published 3,168 articles and retracted 392 others.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134082"></span>



<p>So far this year, 37 papers have been retracted, and 144 have been published.

<p>The journal’s editorial director, Christopher Schulz, declined to comment about whether the uptick in retractions was a result of the journal being put on hold, as did the journal’s publishers, Cell Press and Elsevier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Queen Muse, the head of media and communications at Cell Press, pointed us to <a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/research-integrity-commitment">a statement</a> the journal published last April. The statement says Elsevier performed an audit of the journal that “uncovered concerns regarding practices that do not align with our policies, such as citation manipulation, compromised peer review, authorship irregularities, and tortured phrases.”</p>



<p>As a result, Elsevier started an investigation involving “all published articles between the launch of the journal and the present day for integrity and ethics concerns,” the statement says. It also states the investigation is ongoing, and also includes “making improvements to the journal’s workflow to help prevent ethical issues in new submitted papers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Update, Feb. 4, 2026: The second paragraph was edited to clarify a journal&#8217;s eligibility for receiving an impact factor. </em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2026/02/03/arxiv-future-proofs-access-to-research-with-third-party-digital-preservation/">arXiv future proofs access to research with third-party digital preservation</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv has entered into agreements with two third-party digital preservation services, adding a level of protection that goes beyond arXiv’s in-house activities and safeguarding open research for the future. Through its agreements with <a href="https://www.portico.org/">Portico</a>, a not-for-profit community-supported dark archive for scholarly materials, and <a href="https://www.tib.eu/en/">TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology</a> (the German National Library of Science and Technology), arXiv is ensuring that the research it hosts will remain discoverable, accessible, and usable by researchers well into the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIB </span><a href="https://blog.tib.eu/2025/05/14/protecting-science-tib-builds-dark-archive-for-arxiv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced in 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it was building a dark archive to protect arXiv content; having a formal agreement in place allows for better collaboration and provides the ability for TIB to provide access to arXiv content in a worst case scenario. Both Portico and TIB will keep arXiv content “dark” (preserved but not available for use) until such time as it becomes necessary for them to provide access to the content. While our hope is that this time never comes, having this extra layer of security allows us to assure the community that arXiv content will not be lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A key objective of the collaboration between TIB and arXiv is to ensure the digital preservation and reliable accessibility of scientific data and publications,” said Dr. Irina Sens, Deputy Director of TIB. “Through this partnership, we are jointly contributing to the sustainability of open scholarly communication. TIB contributes its extensive expertise in long-term preservation and in the operation of trusted information infrastructures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital preservation services, such as Portico and TIB, focus on maintaining the authenticity, data integrity, and ongoing usability of content entrusted to their care. They can also serve as an access point for content in the case of catastrophic failure or in the unlikely event that arXiv is no longer able to host content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Academic libraries need assurance that there is a reliable preservation solution in place for arXiv, which is a critical resource for researchers and students” said Kate Wittenberg, Portico Managing Director. “We welcome the opportunity to safeguard this research and support the needs of the scholarly community by including arXiv in Portico.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting digital preservation agreements in place is an important part of a digital stewardship and risk management strategy, and we are happy to be working with two leaders in the preservation space. </span></p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Spain has ordered a literary scholar to pursue retractions of nine works it determined were plagiarized.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>The Tribunal Supremo upheld a lower court’s ruling that narrative theory researcher Franciscó Álamo Felices, a professor at the University of Almería in Spain, plagiarized a colleague’s work in two books and seven articles. José R. Valles Calatrava, a literary theory professor at the same university, sued Felices in 2019 for infringement of his intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>That <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sentencia-audiencia-1197-Almeria.COPIACIEGA_redacted.pdf">lower court</a> found Felices responsible for “a huge amount of plagiarism at different times and in different articles, revealing a systematic and conscientious parasitic attitude and a desire for appropriation,” according to a translation of the ruling by DeepL Translate. In an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SUPREMO.SENTFIRMEyNOarecursocasacion_Redacted.pdf">October 2025 decision</a>, the Tribunal Supremo dismissed an appeal by Felices against the ruling, finding he failed to demonstrate any fundamental errors of law.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134061"></span>



<p>Felices is obligated to withdraw the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Felices_books_articles.pdf">two books and seven articles</a> or to “clearly mark them as plagiarism,” according to the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Felices told us he did not plagiarize the works, and that the pieces simply expanded upon entries in a book he cowrote with Calatrava: <em>Diccionario de Teoría de la Narrativa</em>. The dictionary contains nearly 1,000 terms in various fields of narratology, Felices said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the university dismissed a complaint about this issue, he told us in Spanish, finding no plagiarism occurred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“However, the judge interpreted it from a different legal perspective, which we must respect,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Felices has had work <a href="https://scispace.com/pdf/el-concepto-de-ficcionalidad-teoria-y-representaciones-41i1r5taqy.pdf">retracted in the past</a> for duplication of his own prior work.</p>



<p>In his complaint, Calatrava accused Felices of writing nine texts plagiarizing work in three of Calatrava’s books.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calatrava’s books were published between 1990 and 1999, and Felices’ two books and seven articles were published between 2009 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to <em>Diccionario de Teoría de la Narrativa</em> published in 2002, the two professors cowrote <em>Fundamentos de la semiótica narrativa</em>, published in 2000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calatrava learned about the plagiarism through a Google reference to one of his quotes when he returned to the university in mid-2017 after traveling, he told us. The first article Calatrava came across was “only the tip of the iceberg of a whole series of plagiarism,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Felices plagiarized Calatrava’s work in two books, the court ruled — <em>La literatura y su estudio: Teorías literarias</em> and <em>Principios teóricos y metodológicos de teoría de la narrativa</em> . The court also deemed literary research articles in seven different journals plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Felices denied appropriating Calatrava’s works, arguing more than half of the texts consisted of direct quotations, and that a substantial part of the publications “contained abundant indirect references made in accordance with the standard procedures in the citation and bibliography,” according to a translation of his defense in court documents. Felices’ texts also consisted of “a modest portion of vocabulary used in the discipline and employed in all works related to the subject, which excludes the possibility of plagiarism,” he argued. He also contended the alleged plagiarism came from his collaborative works with Calatrava.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Court records indicate the University of Almería dismissed a complaint filed with the university with the same allegations. Judges noted, however, the university determined “the facts — whether true or not — did not constitute a disciplinary offense of any kind, without ruling out the existence of plagiarism at any time,” according to a translation of court documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SENTENCIA-Mercantil-ALMERIA_redacted.pdf">initial lower court</a> ruled in favor of Calatrava, and Felices appealed. After reviewing the texts, appeals judges found striking similarities, concluding with “overwhelming certainty” that Felices’ texts were written with Calatrava’s in mind, with “a clear parasitic intent, changing only the least relevant terms in terms of their significance, maintaining even the arrangement and rhythm of the sentences and, of course, the original scientific or discipline-specific terms,” according to a translation of the appeals court decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It should also be borne in mind that in the particular case of copying/plagiarism without attribution, the figure of the author is being erased, and it is no longer a question of violating the integrity of the work or infringing purely economic rights, but rather of breaking the link between the author and his work in order to simply appropriate the result of the author&#8217;s creative activity,” a translation of the appeals ruling states. “Thus, the infringement of removing the author and stealing their work is the most serious form of infringement of moral rights, as it amounts to depriving them of their authorship.”</p>



<p>The appeals court added because both Felices and Calatrava belong to the same university department, the impact to Calatrava is greater due to the academic relevance, “the commotion it has undoubtedly caused, and the considerable impact on coexistence and the working environment within the workplace,” according to a translation of the ruling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tribunal Supremo threw out Felices’ second appeal. In addition to withdrawing the works, Felices was ordered to pay Calatrava 5,000 euros for moral damages caused.</p>



<p>Calatrava was pleased with the legal outcome, he said. While his reputation and research career have not been affected, the ordeal has created psychological distress and caused him to take time off work, he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In my opinion, victims of plagiarism are poorly understood and even less supported,” he said. “But believe me, the ultimate triumph of justice, albeit belated, puts everyone in their place and soothes the wound.”</p>



<p>At least four texts have since been withdrawn, including articles in <a href="https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/DICE/article/view/77266"><em>Dicenda</em></a>, <a href="https://revistacronopio.com/tag/teoria-definiciones-y-clasificaciones-de-los-subgeneros-novelescos/"><em>Cronopio</em></a>, <a href="https://dialnet.unirioja.es/ejemplar/259817"><em>Anuario de Estudios Filológicos</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://papiro.unizar.es/ojs/index.php/tropelias/en/article/view/590"><em>Tropelías</em></a>.</p>
