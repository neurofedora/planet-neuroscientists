<p>A study purportedly of scars left by caesarean sections included women yet to undergo the surgery, say sleuths. But an investigation into the research by the author’s employer and the journal that published it found no evidence of research misconduct.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/uog.22053">paper</a>, published in Wiley journal <em>Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>, was flagged on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C4B219054CCC81FAEA0509E6E4A93A">PubPeer in February</a> by Ben Mol, an ob-gyn researcher at Monash University in Australia <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">whose efforts have led to scores of retractions and corrections</a>, and Jim Thornton, emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Nottingham, in the UK. The study looks at how the scar left behind on a woman’s uterus after a c-section is affected by the dilation of her cervix at the time of the procedure.</p>



<span id="more-129178"></span>



<p>One of the senior authors of the article, Baskaran Thilaganathan, director of fetal medicine at St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundations Trust, in London, is currently editor emeritus at the journal. He did not respond to Retraction Watch’s requests for comment.</p>



<p>The other senior author on the paper, Sherif Negm, and the corresponding author Rasha Kamel, who both work the maternal-fetal medicine unit at Cairo University in Egypt, did not reply to requests for comment either.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mol and Thornton began looking at the study in detail when they noticed its <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tqX3Evcg3V8UsSyoemk1BsY6IjkKVsNV0Of12WPhHvU/edit">peer-reviewed advance online version</a> reported more than half the 400 study participants had a c-section after previously giving birth vaginally, which is relatively uncommon. So they asked authors to share their data.</p>



<p>Upon inspection of the data, Mol and Thornton found 84 of the more than 400 women involved in the study had ultrasounds to look at their scars before the operation took place, according to the researchers’ post on PubPeer. “Some [of these cases] could be date formatting issues, but this does not explain all,” they wrote.</p>



<p>The pair point out other potential irregularities in the data, including the fact that the information reported in the method section of the paper about the time between c-section and ultrasound scan often did not agree with what was reported in the data. More than half the women also fell into groups who not only had c-sections on the same day but also their subsequent ultrasound scan on the same day as each other, which Mol and Thornton call a coincidence.</p>



<p>Mol and Thornton said they shared their concerns with the authors, who explained some women were mistakenly classified as having given birth before when they had not, but they did not correct this error in the published paper.</p>



<p>The authors also addressed some of their other concerns by making changes to the description of the study design in the final version of the published paper. Mol and Thornton said on PubPeer these changes made the coincidental surgery and scan dates “even less plausible.” The data set in the paper omitted “the most obvious markers of a problem” &#8211; the procedure and scan dates, they added.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Anthony Odibo, the editor of the journal, said the publication takes research integrity seriously. “These concerns have already been raised to the journal, which investigated accordingly,” he&nbsp; told us.</p>



<p>The dataset and research have also been investigated by St George’s NHS Trust, Odibo added. “The institutional investigation found no evidence of fabrication or other research misconduct. COPE reviewed the journal’s investigation process and determined that it was appropriate. As is standard, COPE has advised the journal to abide by the outcome of institutional investigation,” he said.</p>



<p>St George&#8217;s University Hospital NHS Foundations Trust said in an emailed statement to Retraction Watch:&nbsp; “We have formally investigated these claims, as has the journal, and no misconduct was found in either investigation. Research plays an integral part in what we do and we are committed to upholding high standards to the quality of our research.”</p>



<p>We contacted the University of Cairo through a comment form on its website but did not get a response.</p>

The ‘shell-shocked’ soldiers of World War I were understood at the time to be of weak character, although now we might diagnose them with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Victorian women were subject to ‘hysteria’ and fainting fits, something we might now understand as non-epileptic seizures. The way that we understand distress is deeply rooted in our culture and time, but it doesn’t feel like that to us. We tend to think that the way we understand things now is the right way, superior to previous generations and other cultures.</p><p>Which makes our current time a particularly interesting one to be working in mental health. The dominant way to understand mental distress in the West in the last 70 years has been the medical model. This sees distress and unusual behaviour as symptoms of an underlying mental disorder. Diagnosing clinicians compare a person’s experiences to lists of criteria and give them (or not give them) a diagnosis. That diagnosis should lead to treatment, which should then (hopefully) lead to an improvement in symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p>This system is one of categorisation. It matters which diagnosis a person gets because that will affect the services they receive. Get a diagnosis of PTSD and you’ll find yourself offered very different treatment than if you are given a diagnosis of ADHD, even if your symptoms have similarities. The system is pragmatic and structures many mental health services. A psychiatric diagnosis is a description, rather than an explanation. It gives a name to a cluster of symptoms.</p><p>However, in recent decades, the fundamental principles of the diagnostic system have been undermined by neuroscientific and behavioural genetic research. Research has failed to find biological correlates for the diagnostic groupings defined by the manuals (called DSM and ICD). According to behavioural geneticist Robert Plomin, instead of finding ‘genes for schizophrenia’ as expected, large scale studies have shown that many genes combine in tiny, cumulative, and generalised effects. Studies of mental health have consistently found dimensionality. Symptoms such as anxiety, or hearing voices, or low mood vary across the whole population, and a diagnosis draws a line where none exists in nature.</p><p>The implications of this for how we conceptualise mental health are profound. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28333488/">Researchers</a> are working on dimensional frameworks and influential neuroscientists <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730353-000-psychiatry-is-reinventing-itself-thanks-to-advances-in-biology/">argue</a> that a reliance on diagnostic categories is holding back advances in research. It has become increasingly clear that diagnostic groups may be practical, but they don’t reliably reflect distinctions between people.</p><p>However, alongside this revolution in how scientists understand mental health has come the advent of social media and a huge cultural shift. Here the way in which psychiatric diagnoses are understood have also changed dramatically in the last few decades, but in a very different way.</p><p>On social media, psychiatric diagnoses have become identities and online communities have formed around them. ‘Mental health influencers’ post about their symptoms and put their diagnoses in their bios. Some of their followers start to define themselves in the same way, or even to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/145/2/476/6356504">develop new symptoms</a>. We are only just starting to understand how influential social media can be.</p><p>For many, these diagnoses signify far more than a list of symptoms. They provide an explanation as to why they are the way that they are and validation that their life struggles are not their fault. The mainstream media have also adopted this narrative, with articles published with titles like ‘<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/a-new-life-being-diagnosed-with-adhd-in-my-40s-has-given-me-something-quite-magical">My New Life: Being Diagnosed with ADHD in My 40’s has Given Me Something Quite Magical.’</a></p><p>This has led us to the strange situation where just as scientists are moving away from grouping people by diagnosis, more people than ever before are thinking of themselves as belonging to a diagnostic category. Many are self-diagnosing, and several clinicians have informed me of official complaints after they told service users that they didn’t fit the criteria. If a person sees a diagnosis as the key to something magical, it’s understandable that they are furious if it is withheld.</p><p>There has always been a gulf between how the general public understands mental health and how scientists and clinicians conceptualise it. What perhaps is new is that many now see a diagnosis as their route to compassion and community, as an affirmation of who they are. This was not what the medical model was designed for, and it is not well-suited to the task. Psychiatric diagnoses were intended to identify pathology in order to provide treatment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Waiting lists soar as a result, and when a person finally does see a clinician, expectations can be very different to the reality. Anger grows when people are not able to get the diagnosis they feel they need or when their diagnostic assessment doesn’t provide the validation they were hoping for.</p><p>We’re in the middle of a cultural clash in the way that we understand mental health. As science is pushing us towards reconsidering diagnostic categories, those same categories are becoming ever more important in popular culture. This inevitably leads to tension. ‘Mental disorder’ or ‘something magical’—can a diagnosis be both at the same time? Or are there other ways to understand mental distress entirely?</p><p><em><sub>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@brookecagle?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Brooke Cagle</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/shallow-focus-photo-of-person-in-white-scoop-neck-t-shirt-TWiphGp4Fao?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/891143333/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/891143333/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f04%2fFisher-featured-image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/891143333/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/the-hidden-toll-of-war/">The hidden toll of war</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/unlocking-the-moons-secrets-from-galileo-to-giant-impact/">Unlocking the Moon&#8217;s secrets: from Galileo to giant impact</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/02/of-language-brain-health-and-global-inequities/">Of language, brain health, and global inequities</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>The journal <em>Cureus </em>has retracted a 2022 paper on cancer and the environment just weeks after Retraction Watch raised questions about apparent plagiarism in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/05/cureus-reviewing-paper-alleged-to-plagiarize-lancet-article/">we reported</a> in early April, the paper, “Causes of Cancer in the World: Comparative Risk Assessment of Nine Behavioral and Environmental Risk Factors”, had a bit of a twinsies thing going with a 2005 article in The Lancet – sharing a title, figures, and wording that “follows the Lancet one on a sentence-by-sentence level while using tortured phrases,” according to the anonymous tipster who informed us of the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The April 19 <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/109423-causes-of-cancer-in-the-world-comparative-risk-assessment-of-nine-behavioral-and-environmental-risk-factors/retraction#!/">retraction notice states</a>:</p>



<span id="more-129174"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted by the Editor-in-Chief. The title and figures have been taken directly from a 2005 article published in Lancet: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2</a>. Additionally, the article appears to follow the Lancet article on a sentence-by-sentence basis with evidence of tortured phrases. The journal regrets that these issues were not identified during the plagiarism check at the time of submission. The authors agree with this decision to retract.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we’ve noted elsewhere in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">report on the team that developed the phrase</a>, “Tortured phrases are what happens to words that get translated from English into a foreign language, then back to English — perhaps by a computer trying to generate a scholarly publication for a group of unscrupulous authors.”</p>

<p>The <em>Scottish Medical Journal</em> has retracted more than a dozen papers dating back to 2020 after concluding the articles were likely produced by one or more paper mills.</p>



<p>The articles, all by researchers in China, covered a range of topics including back pain, pancreatic cancer, hand hygiene and sepsis. Most were meta-analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00369330241240826">blanket notice</a> for the 13 papers, which the publisher, Sage, lists by url but not title:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129158"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>After an internal investigation Sage has become aware that the submissions contain indicators of third-party involvement.</p>



<p>Due to concerns around author contributions to these articles, as well as concerns around the integrity of the research process, Sage and the Journal Editor retract these articles.</p>



<p>The authors have been informed of this decision using the email addresses provided at submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Sage told us: &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We became aware of issues with these papers because multiple submissions to this journal showed indicators of paper mill activity. As a result, we rejected these submissions and investigated further published articles.  </p>



<p>The 13 papers show indicators of paper mill activity and together with the editor, we have decided to retract them following COPE guidelines. We have been in contact with the authors of these articles.  </p>



<p>Correcting the scientific record is incredibly important to us. Once we become aware of any misconduct, we are dedicated to carrying out a full and fair investigation. We are supporting the journal’s Editorial team to make sure they have the proper tools and training to identify and reject suspicious submissions before publication.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the retractions were originally posted, readers who clicked through those links to the articles themselves (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00369330231187655">such as this one</a>) – or who landed on the article pages by other means – could be forgiven for not knowing the papers have been retracted. “View retraction” appeared in regular type after various metadata, without any other flag.</p>



<p>Asked by Retraction Watch last week about the formatting, the spokesperson added that “there were errors which we are working urgently to correct.” Indeed, the article titles now include “RETRACTED.”</p>

<p>A psychology researcher already under fire for several questionable studies has had her PhD revoked by a university tribunal that found it likely she fabricated data in her thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ping Dong, who was a doctoral student at the University of Toronto from 2012 to 2017, had already earned retractions for two papers based on her thesis before the tribunal’s decision to cancel her degree and give the thesis a failing grade. A <a href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201490.pdf">summary of the case</a> the school has made available online reveals those retractions, which we’ve previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/11/28/psychology-journal-to-retract-study-claiming-that-people-fear-contagion-less-in-the-dark/">reported on</a>, arose from more serious misconduct than previously publicized and were also subject to an institutional investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dong’s research concerned how moral violations and unethical behavior, such as tax evasion or adultery, influence consumer choices.. According to the university’s report, her thesis had an “improbable level of duplication” in the answers research participants gave to open-ended questions. Dong also allegedly confessed to a former supervisor that her husband impersonated participants in her studies and that she had failed to properly randomize the results – although the supervisor contests that Dong ever admitted this to her. </p>



<span id="more-129150"></span>



<p><a href="https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/78965">Dong’s thesis</a> resulted in three published papers, cited 29 times in total, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science Two of the papers had already been retracted before the tribunal’s decision because of data anomalies found by readers:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>[Retracted] ‘<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617749637">Visual Darkness Reduces Perceived Risk of Contagious-Disease Transmission From Interpersonal Interaction</a>’, published in <em>Psychological Science</em> in 2018.</li>



<li>[Retracted] ‘<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/44/4/778/3738818?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Witnessing moral violations increases conformity in consumption</a>’, published in <em>Journal of Consumer Research </em>in 2017.</li>



<li><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550614542344">Ray of hope: Hopelessness increases preferences for brighter lighting</a>, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science </em>in 2014. </li>
</ul>



<p>According to the tribunal documents, the problems with the thesis began to surface in May 2018 when the then-editor of <em>Psychological Science</em>, Steve Lindsay, contacted Dong and Chen-Bo Zhong, Dong’s coauthor and faculty advisor, after receiving reports from a reader of anomalous patterns in the data in Dong’s article on darkness and fear of infection. Lindsay at the time had asked a statistical advisor to assess the report, and the advisor confirmed that there were problems in the data, he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Dong has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613482946">another paper from 2013</a> also published in <em>Psychological Science </em>that was not investigated. Lindsay said he probably assumed Dong was an early-career researcher and failed to look for any other papers that she had published in the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Zhong confronted Dong about the concerns in the <em>Psychological Science</em> paper, she blamed the issues on “improper, but innocent, randomization” in the data collection process – an explanation the tribunal concluded was “fake”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in early 2019, Zhong received an email in which Dong admitted to falsifying data, according to his testimony for the tribunal. He said Aparna Labroo, who had supervised Dong’s first year paper before leaving the university in 2013, had forwarded an email in which Dong admitted she did not properly randomize data in the <em>Psychological Science </em>paper and that her husband had impersonated participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Labroo disputed these claims in an email to Retraction Watch: “Ping Dong admitted no such thing to me and I never had or ever have had any such email. I had no idea she did not randomize conditions in her 2019 paper with Chenbo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked whether Dong had admitted that her husband had impersonated participants, Labroo wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>My understanding is that Ping and her husband are separate entities, and the Psych Science is different research from Pings [sic] dissertation. What Ping may or may not say about her husband also would be heresay [sic]. So I am not sure about the extent of relevance of this question to an investigation about Pings actions with respect to her dissertation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>At no stage did the University of Toronto reach out to me or ask me anything about this investigation, so any reference to me in their report is pure heresay [sic]. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zhong has not responded to requests for comment, instead deferring to the University’s media relations office. A spokesperson for the university confirmed the existence of such an email, though declined to release any of the documents tendered at the tribunal’s hearing. </p>



<p>“The Tribunal’s reasons for the decision speak for themselves. The University is not in a position to provide further information,” the spokesperson added. </p>



<p>We were also unable to reach Dong, who was not present for the tribunal hearing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the report, Zhong told the tribunal that in August 2019, he noticed Dong had restricted access to the data for the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> paper after editors of the journal had requested a copy for data maintenance purposes. That same month, Zhong consulted a data scientist, Marcel van Assen, to help investigate the paper. Van Assen “concluded that the issues went beyond mere ‘questionable research practices’ and indicated possible misconduct,” the report stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month later, the editors at the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> told Zhong and the university’s research integrity office that there were “credible concerns” about the paper published in the journal. The university began investigating the paper in 2020 and found Dong had fabricated or manipulated data to support her hypothesis and had destroyed data to avoid detection. Zhong requested a retraction after the findings of the university’s investigation. Dong <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/47/4/632/5919265">never responded</a> to the concerns, according to the retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tribunal’s case summary also <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550614542344">cites a third paper connected</a> to Dong’s thesis, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science,</em> although it gives no indication whether the paper was ever investigated by the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christian Unkelbach, the editor of <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> and Margo Monteith, the former editor, said they had not been contacted by the university — nor by Zhong or a concerned reader, as the other editors had — about the paper. Unkelbach said in an email to Retraction Watch that he considers this “an omission by the University of Toronto if they have reason to suspect fraudulent behavior that led to the results in Dong et al. (2015).”</p>



<p>He added if Zhong, or others mentioned in the tribunal’s findings, were able to provide evidence of data fabrication or manipulation in the paper, the journal would take action to protect the integrity of the scientific record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the case summary, Dong also used her “improperly” obtained degree to secure a tenure-track position at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management — a position she <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/09/19/northwestern-psychology-researcher-out-following-retraction/">abruptly left</a> less than a year after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/11/28/psychology-journal-to-retract-study-claiming-that-people-fear-contagion-less-in-the-dark/">earning the retraction in <em>Psychological Science</em></a>. Apart from the two retractions related to her thesis work, Dong has an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/41/3/697/2907534">additional two</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/46/1/53/5035292?redirectedFrom=fulltext">retractions</a> and <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1070#">a correction</a>.</p>

                <p>On April 25, 2024, we met with the 5 speakers for this year&#39;s Annual Neuroscience Symposium at UTSA to discuss epigenetics and nervous system development. We discussed the best known molecular mechanisms that control patterns of gene expression and current limitations faced in studies of those mechanisms. We also discussed the promise of epigenetics to explain the differentiation of nervous system cell types, mechanisms of developmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.  </p>

<p>Here’s a tale of a paper retracted because other articles published years later seemed to plagiarize it – and its unhappy authors, whose behavior the journal says hints at paper mill activity.</p>



<p>On January 16 of this year, Maria Zalm, a senior editor at <em>PLOS ONE</em> and team manager for publication ethics, asked the authors of a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124338">2015 paper</a> to respond to concerns about their work – which had been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EC879C0C0FA015B6C879156E1DD654">flagged on PubPeer</a> the previous November – by February 6, according to an email seen by Retraction Watch. After some apparent back and forth, Zalm wrote to the authors on March 6 to say the journal had decided to retract the article.</p>



<span id="more-129145"></span>



<p>One of the authors, Ming Zhou, responded on March 13 – the deadline Zalm had set for the authors to indicate whether they agreed with the retraction. Zhou, formerly of Cleveland Clinic and now <a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/ming-zhou">chair of pathology at Tufts Medical Center in Bosto</a>n, said he was “seriously concerned” about the journal’s decision. He continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In your decision, you mentioned that “In this case we consider that retraction is warranted due to concerns about results presented in Figures 2, 3, and 4.”</p>



<p>Please consider the fact that this article was received by the journal on 12/18/2014, several years earlier than the other two articles which plagiarized several images from our article (one was received on 2/1/02017, the other one on 3/26/2019).&nbsp; We had no relationship with the authors of the other 2 publications. We are therefore the victim, rather than the perpetrators,&nbsp; of the other two fraudulent publications. If this is the main reason to retract our article, this argument is flawed and has no legal grounds.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In your decision, you also mentioned that “Furthermore, during our editorial assessment, this article was identified as one in a series of articles for which concerns about potential manipulation of the publication process, specifically, the journal has concerns about similarities with other submissions in article content and apparent reuse of images.”</p>



<p>Please provide evidence of this accusation. I am happy to review it&nbsp; for me to make a final decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zhou closed by saying he is “the Chair of the Pathology Department at a major academic medical center in US. I rigorously defend the academic integrity and in no way condone scientific misconduct in any shape and form. However, we need to excise [sic] clear and objective minds when tackling the fraudulent academic misconducts.”</p>



<p>The same day, co-corresponding author Hongquan Zhang, of Peking University Health Science Center in China, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EC879C0C0FA015B6C879156E1DD654#5">responded to Zalm</a>, also objecting and quoting Albert Einstein and Somerset Maugham:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We all disagreed with and felt very angry with your intended retraction of this paper. We did not do anything wrong in this study. The paper was done in my lab with collaboration with the US team when Dr. Huiying He, a pathologist, was working in the States. However, your team’s decision was based on just some pictures in our paper that are similar to or the same with some pictures used in the later publications that were in fact published 3 or 4 years late than us. Could you and your team believed that we can pass across several years to copy somebody else’s work based on Albert Eistein’s [sic] theory of superluminal speed? As a matter of fact, it is somebody else who plagiarizes our published data, but not we copied someone’s. I, here, strongly suggest you carefully revisit the papers and rethink the fact, and finally make a precise decision on this matter. An improper decision will hurt our team, your team and the reputation of PLoS One, except the ones who plagiarize other’s work. By the way, we have reported this matter to our institutional ethics committee for being improper treatment by PLoS One on our paper. We will also report this to our law office to protect our right on this matter. I am sorry that I may write to you a little harsh at this moment. However, does someone can count on people who are improperly treated speaking softly as the US [sic] novelist Maugham advised? In addition, we also sent emails to the corresponding authors of the two papers that contained the similar or the same data with us. We asked them to show their original pictures. In fact, we have those original data in hand. To this end, I suggest a thorough investigation before you make a decision. It will be all clear in the end. We have attached supporting files in this email, in which we showed our pictures in comparison with the other two. We also showed our original data with high resolution. It is already early morning in Beijing I could not translate our attached files into English. I am sorry I just attached these files in Chinese, and if you would like to read them please use Google to translate or otherwise we can translate them for you later if you still interest in reading them.</p>

<p>Zalm responded the next day:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Regarding the concerns with this article, as indicated in the previous decision letter this article was identified as one of a group of multiple articles that are connected by concerns about image reuse; this group of also includes multiple articles published between 2013-2016. In addition to the concerns regarding overlap in the published figures, the publication ethics team has raised additional concerns, including concerns with the extend of panel overlap in the underlying data provided for editorial review (50+ instances of (partial) panel overlaps were detected), concerns with the western blots provided as underlying data (the data provided for review were not uncropped and were insufficient to resolve the concerns with the western blot data), and concerns with the peer-review this article received (involving both concerns regarding undeclared COIs and the quality of the peer-review the article received). The concerns that connect the group of articles are such that PLOS suspects systematic manipulation of the peer-review process, which is sometimes also referred to as “paper mill activity”. As indicated in the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice*loc-manipulation-of-the-publication-process__;Iw!!CYGGtyGZyw!CxqNLmvgcltQOmuY1r0-Aw9Ug5GosX7EycBmvrgb9cAuNStghnGHzvja-zXOSgk6TK5GJ3RUSSEclYJqVuc8-hAIjQ$">PLOS Ethical Publishing Practice policies</a>, in cases of suspected systematic manipulation of the publication process, PLOS may choose not to disclose detailed information about our assessment and specific concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of these concerns, some of which apply across a series of articles and cannot be resolved through discussions or revisions that only address your article, PLOS has determined that a retraction of the article is warranted. We understand that you are disappointed and possibly frustrated by this outcome. As indicated earlier, we have updated the author statement to indicate that you disagree with the retraction decision. If this information is incorrect, please let us know no later than 18 March 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On March 18, Zhang again <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EC879C0C0FA015B6C879156E1DD654#6">raised his objections</a>, to no avail. The paper &#8212; which was cited three dozen times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science &#8212; was <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301575">retracted April 2</a> with a notice that referred to it being tied to a group of nine articles “connected by concerns about image reuse.” Three of those papers had already been retracted by <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>The notice went on to state the concerns “affect Figs 2, 3, and 4,” noting similarities between various panels in those figures and two other articles, one published in 2018 in the <a href="https://medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/909450"><em>Medical Science Monitor</em></a> and one published in 2019 in <a href="https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2019.10636"><em>Molecular Medicine Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding authors “stated they were unaware of the panel duplications,” according to the notice. “They provided data files to support the results presented in this article but the files did not resolve the concerns.”</p>



<p>Zhang and co-corresponding author Huiying He, also of Peking University Health Science Center, once again objected in an email on April 3, calling the decision “typical bias and hegemony.” Zhou also told Retraction Watch he is unsatisfied, saying the “journal so far has not addressed our chief concerns raised in the corresponding authors&#8217; letters.”</p>



<p>David Knutson, a spokesperson for <em>PLOS, </em>told us the decision “is tied to series-level issues involving a group of articles and which cannot be resolved by discussions at the individual article level.” He continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As is explained in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301575">retraction notice</a>, this article was identified as one of a group of ten articles published between 2013 and 2019 that are connected by concerns about image reuse. We note that pone.0124338 was published in 2015, and that the duplications mentioned in this article’s retraction notice were published in 2018 and 2019. However, our investigation into the linked articles found concerns that cast serious doubt on the integrity and reliability of all papers in this group. Thus, in accordance with <a href="https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines">guidelines</a> issued by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and supported by our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-manipulation-of-the-publication-process">policy on Manipulation of the Publication Process</a>, we retracted all four PLOS articles involved. In line with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-manipulation-of-the-publication-process">this PLOS policy</a>, we will not disclose specific details as to the editorial concerns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2024/04/24/why-your-two-photon-images-are-noisier-than-you-expect/">Why your two-photon images are noisier than you expect</a></h4>

              
                <p>This is a blog post dedicated to those who start with calcium imaging and wonder why their live images seem to drown in shot noise. The short answer to this unspoken question: that&#8217;s normal.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Two-photon calcium imaging is a cool method to record from neurons (or other cell types) while directly looking at the cells. However, almost everyone starting with their first recording is disappointed by the first light they see &#8211; because the images looked better, with more detail, crisper and brighter in Figure 1 of the lastest paper. What these papers typically show, is, however, not a snapshot of a single frame, but a carefully motion-corrected and, above all, <em>averaged </em>recording.</p>



<p>In reality, it is often not even necessary to see every structure in single frames. One can still make efficient use of such data that seemingly drown in noise, and you do not have to necessarily resort to <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/08/23/self-supervised-denoising-of-calcium-imaging-data/">deep learning-based denoising</a> to make sense of the data. Moreover, if you can see your cells very clearly in a single frame, it is in many cases even likely that either the concentration of the calcium indicator or the applied laser power is too high (both extremes can induce damage and perturb the neurons).</p>



<p>To demonstrate the contrast between typical single frames before and beautiful images after averaging for presentations, here&#8217;s a gallery of recordings I made. On the left, a single imaging frame (often seemingly devoid of any visible structure). On the right, an averaged movie. (And, yes, please read this on a proper computer screen for the details, not on your smartphone.)</p>



<p><strong>Hippocampal astrocytes in mice with GCaMP6s</strong></p>



<p>Here, I imaged hippocampal astrocytes close to the pyramidal layer of hippocampal CA1. Laser power: 40 mW, FOV size: 600 µm, volumetric imaging rate: 10 Hz (3 planes), 10x Olympus objective. From our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8">recent study on hippocampal astrocytes</a>, averaged across &gt;4000 frames:</p>

<p><strong>Sparsely labeled neurons in the zebrafish olfactory bulb with GCaMP5</strong></p>



<p>Still in love with this brain region, the olfactory bulb. Here with sparse labeling of mostly mitral cells with GCaMP5 in adult zebrafish.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>I hope you liked the example images! Also, I hope that this comparison across recordings and brain regions will help to normalize expectations about what to get from a single frame from functional calcium imaging. If you are into calcium imaging, you have to learn to love the shot noise!</p>



<p>And you have to learn to understand the power of averaging to be able to judge your image quality. Only averaging can truly reveal the quality of the recorded images. If the image remains blurry after averaging thousands of frames, then the microscope can indeed not resolve the structures. However, if the structures come out very clearly after averaging, the microscope&#8217;s resolution (and the optical access) are most likely good, and only the low amount of photons is stopping you from seeing signals clearly in single frames (which is often, as this gallery demonstrates, not even necessary).</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>The following announcement was published by the East African Science and Technology Commission (EASTECO). PLOS is a proud partner of EASTECO and TCC Africa.</p>



<p>The 3rd East African Community (EAC) Regional Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) Conference, held from March 6-8, 2024 in Nairobi, Kenya, marked a significant milestone for the region with the launch of the <a href="http://repository.eac.int/handle/11671/24495">East African Regional Science, Technology and Innovation Policy 2023-2033</a> &amp; the East African Regional Intellectual Property (IP) Policy 2023-2033. However, what truly sets this achievement apart was the inclusion of Open Science principles and guidelines in the new policy framework &ndash; a remarkable first for the region and Africa that will unlock the full potential of scientific research and drive sustainable development across East Africa. The detailed sectoral policy objectives for Open Science are outlined on page 29 of the document.</p>



<p>This historic achievement was the culmination of concerted efforts by a strategic partnership between the Training Centre in Communication (TCC Africa), Public Library of Science ( <a href="https://plos.org/">PLOS</a>), and the East African Science and Technology Commission (EASTECO). The <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">collaboration began in 2022</a>, with the shared vision of promoting Open Science principles and practices and empowering researchers across the EAC Partner States, which include Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Somalia, United Republic of Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are enthusiastic about participating in this process and we take pride in the fact that East Africa, particularly the East Africa Community, is establishing a precedent in Africa by incorporating Open Science into its regional STI Policy,&rdquo; states Ms. Joy Owango, Executive Director of the Training Centre in Communication. &ldquo;This will serve as a basis for understanding and applying this regional policy to meet the specific needs of the East African countries and we are eager to collaborate with them in order to help them achieve their national goals in Open Science,&rdquo; she says.</p>



<p>The journey started with a series of national dialogues, with the inaugural national Open Science dialogue taking place in <a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/tanzanias-national-open-science-dialogue-exploring-challenges-and-opportunities-towards-an-open-science-ecosystem/">Tanzania</a> in February 2023, followed by another session in <a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/the-kenya-national-open-science-dialogue-open-access-principles-and-practices-in-east-african-community-partner-states/">Kenya</a> in September 2023. With the policy groundwork in place, the partnership is now focused on expanding its reach to the remaining EAC nations, including Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Plans are underway to hold similar national dialogues in Uganda and other East African countries, intending to identify each nation&rsquo;s specific needs and barriers to adopting Open Science practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly thrilled to see the inclusion of Open Science in regional STI policy. Open Science has the potential to make the scientific process more transparent, inclusive and equitable,&rdquo; remarked Roheena Anand, Executive Director of Global Publishing Development at PLOS. &ldquo;Our collaboration with TCC Africa and EASTECO has focused on facilitating and supporting both regional and national high-level Open Science policy dialogues with key higher-education stakeholders. These discussions have added to our understanding of the barriers to participation and will enable us to work towards solutions that address them. We look forward to evolving our learning with the remaining EAC countries.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;It is a dream come true for the East African region, considering the efforts being made to increase the capacity of the region to disseminate research findings and to access scientific production from other parts of the world. Through this initiative, we look forward to enhanced visibility and to leverage on the numerous benefits of open science to support widening and deepening of the integration agenda,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Dr. Sylvance Okoth, Executive Secretary of EASTECO.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Sylvance Okoth, Executive Secretary, East African Science and Technology Commission (EASTECO); Prof. Gaspard Banyankimbona, Executive Secretary, Inter-University Council for East Africa (IUCEA), and Prof. Walter O. Oyawa, Director General of the National Commission for Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (NACOSTI) launching the EAC Regional STI &amp; East African Regional Intellectual Property (IP) Policy.</em></p>



<p>Open Science principles promote the free and open dissemination of research outputs, data, and scientific information, facilitating collaboration, reproducibility, and societal engagement in the research process. Its inclusion in the policy unleashes new opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and sustainable development by breaking down barriers to accessing and building upon scientific knowledge. As the EAC embarks on this journey, the partnership between TCC Africa, PLOS, and EASTECO stands ready to support and empower stakeholders in realizing the full benefits of open and equitable research practices.</p>

<p>A professor of aerospace engineering in India who developed a scientific theory critics call “absolute nonsense” said he is suing journal editors and publishers for pulling three papers he claims could help protect “millions of lives.”</p>



<p>The articles, one in Springer Nature’s <em>Scientific Reports</em> and two in Wiley’s <em>Global Challenges</em>, described a highly technical concept eponymously dubbed “Sanal flow choking.” The first <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36260-8">was retracted</a> last summer, the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202470083">other</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202470082">two</a> in March.</p>



<p>“The retractions of our papers are unjustified,” V. R. Sanal Kumar of Amity University in New Delhi told Retraction Watch. “Our legal representatives are actively pursuing a defamation lawsuit against these editors and their illicit agents who were responsible for retracting articles crucial for safeguarding countless lives.” </p>



<span id="more-129140"></span>



<p>He and his team “are in the process of filing the petition,” Kumar added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Disgruntled authors have sued publishers over retractions in the past, as we reported in 2021, but <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/21/court-tosses-50-billion-suit-by-prince-of-panspermia-against-springer-nature/">have not been successful</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Kumar and his coauthors, their work is “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202000012">a scientific breakthrough and a paradigm shift</a>” that could help solve “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94450-8">numerous unresolved scientific problems in physical, chemical and biological sciences</a>.” The many claimed applications include cardiovascular and neurological diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the research has met <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12055-023-01666-6">hefty</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14063">criticism</a> from peers.</p>



<p>“The elementary blunders are so obvious that someone who reads their works for at least 10-15 mins should realise that all of it is absolute nonsense,” <a href="https://iitpkd.ac.in/people/n.ganesh">Ganesh Natarajan</a>, of the department of mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad, told Retraction Watch by email.</p>



<p>Natarajan, who alerted Wiley to his concerns about Kumar’s publications in May 2022, added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The theory of flow of gases through rocket motors simply does not apply to blood flow through human arteries – Sanal and his co-workers completely ignore this aspect citing similarity of geometries between rocket nozzles and stenosed arteries. From here, they blatantly make baseless conclusions on how the ‘Sanal flow choking’ can explain asymptomatic cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, neurological disorders, Moyamoya disease and Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) – all of which makes absolutely no sense.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The identical retraction notices in <em>Global Challenges</em>, published March 25, 2024, state:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Post-publication review by an independent reviewer determined that the article applies the concept of compressible flow to an inherently incompressible flow system. As a result, the article&#8217;s hypothesis and following argument do not scientifically support its conclusions. Therefore, the conclusions are considered unreliable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>An investigation by Wiley and the journal&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief supported this conclusion.</em></p>



<p>The June 6, 2023, retraction notice in <em>Scientific Reports</em> offered more details:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, concerns were raised about the rationale for the approach presented, the assumptions and approximations used and the validity of its application to cardiology. A post-publication review of the Authors&#8217; mathematical arguments revealed a lack of clarity in the terms presented and inferences that are not adequately justified. The main concerns are that the model is based on circular reasoning which makes it non-predictive, that it assumes that blood behaves as an ideal gas, and hypothesizes that quasi-sonic flow velocities exist in the cardiovascular system while all experimental evidence shows that cardiovascular flow velocities are orders of magnitude lower than the speed of sound and do not involve any compressibility effects. The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the conclusions presented.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kumar stood by his work, telling us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It is important to clarify that the retractions and criticisms directed towards our work do not reflect scientific inaccuracies or flaws in the concept of Sanal flow choking. Rather, they appear to be part of a coordinated effort to discredit our research through what I believe to be an international conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Having thoroughly examined the criticisms referenced, including the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22sanal+kumar%22">links to PubPeer</a> and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14063">arXiv article</a>, I maintain that our research methodology is sound and has undergone rigorous peer review.</p>



<p>Furthermore, connected research papers are currently under review by flagship journals.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kumar also forwarded correspondence with Wiley in which he told the publisher his retracted papers were “instrumental in safeguarding millions of lives.”</p>



<p>Natarajan questioned the quality of the original peer review of Kumar’s papers, but welcomed the results of the post-publication reviews. What is “more worrying,” he said, is that two influential physics journals from AIP Publishing – <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/8/2/025315/569923/A-closed-form-analytical-model-for-predicting-3D?searchresult=1"><em>AIP Advances</em></a> and <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/34/10/101302/2846650/In-vitro-prediction-of-the-lower-upper-critical?redirectedFrom=fulltext"><em>Physics of Fluids</em></a><em> </em>– “haven&#8217;t really bothered to consider the matter despite raising complaints.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We contacted the editors of these journals and heard back from Wendy Beatty, director of content experience at AIP Publishing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In light of the retractions in other journals, we will review both your requests and the related material and comments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kumar grabbed headlines in India last May after the country’s Supreme Court upheld his dismissal years earlier from the national space agency. According to <em>The Economic Times</em>, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/sc-trashes-appeal-of-former-isro-scientist-against-dismissal-from-service/articleshow/100232069.cms?from=mdr">the court said</a> Kumar’s former employer “was justified in suspecting his honesty and integrity on account of his unauthorised association with a South Korean institution involved in rocketry research.”</p>



<p>Kumar unsuccessfully challenged the decision and, according to a screenshot he shared with Retraction Watch, in February of this year filed a “curative petition” – a legal last resort – with the court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his papers, Kumar continues to claim the<em> </em>Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as his primary affiliation. He told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Ongoing legal challenges against ISRO&#8217;s actions persist in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, and should a favorable verdict be delivered, I will be reinstated with retroactive service benefits. Consequently, I will continue to assert my VSSC affiliation in my publications pending the final judgment of the Supreme Court of India.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Natarajan said Kumar’s petition doesn’t stand a chance: “His belief in this case is akin to his belief in his works – and sadly both end up being flawed with him on the wrong side of the situation.”</p>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Juggling your thesis and job hunting can be stressful. Here are some tips on finding, applying and interviewing for post-doctoral roles when nearing the end of your PhD journey. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hi, I’m Emma! I have just finished a PhD in Clinical Neuroscience and started my first post-doc role. About a year before I was due to finish my PhD, my supervisor told me I had to start thinking about jobs and consider whether I wanted to apply for a post-doctorate position or go into industry. I knew I wanted to give academia a go, but thought it was pretty far in advance to start thinking about a job. Fast forward and it was only 6 months to go until the end of my PhD, so I thought, “okay, maybe I should start thinking about jobs now” and began to apply to a few post-doctorate roles that I was interested in. All of them came back with the feedback, “we need someone sooner than you can start.” As a result, I found that the sweet spot for applying for job roles was about 3-4 months before finishing a PhD. I know that things can change and sometimes your deadline stretches and stretches, but I found that having a job lined up for afterwards gave me good motivation to finish writing. I also want to acknowledge that it wasn’t easy juggling post-doc applications and finishing a PhD, but hopefully in this article I can give you a few tips to make the process easier!  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Finding a post-doc position</strong></span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When you feel like you are ready and have a bit of time to start applying for post-docs, have a look on websites such as </span></span><u><a href="http://Jobs.ac.uk" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Jobs.ac.uk</span></span></em></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> and </span></span><u><a href="http://findapostdoc.com" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">findapostdoc.com</span></span></em></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. Another good place to look is Twitter (or X as it’s now called), as sometimes job adverts will be put on there before being posted on the official job websites. Making a scientific Twitter account, and following lab groups you’re interested in, is a good way to monitor any positions they might have available. An alternative way that I searched for jobs was to directly email principal investigators (PI) explaining that I was interested in their work and asking if they had any potential roles being advertised soon. Often they didn’t have anything ‘in the works’, but occasionally they had a post-doc role coming up and would send it to me once it was live. This is a good way to get your name recognised during the application process too. If you have any questions about a role that is already being advertised, email the PI for a quick video chat. Most of the time they are happy to do this, and again - it’s a good way of introducing yourself before applying for a job. It can also give you a feel for them as a PI and this is just as important as being interested in the research project itself. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Writing your CV and supporting statement</strong></span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The first job application is always the hardest to do because you have to start from scratch with little idea of what to expect. When writing a CV, the best thing you can do is look at what other people have done; I found relevant CVs online and looked at the post-docs in my current lab to see how scientific CVs were laid out and the information they included. Everyone has their own style, so make it your own, but the most important thing is the content! Also, get your current supervisor to review your first draft, as they have probably seen hundreds of CVs so know what they would look for in a potential candidate. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Supporting statements are a bit tricker as they should be tailored to the job role. Make sure you keep in mind the job specifications when you write the supporting statement! The way I set mine out included:</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_ef3e6ba3d5814ae1bb472ff2479b4794~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> An introductory paragraph about you, your skills and what you have achieved.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The next paragraph demonstrates why you want the role and why you would be suitable based on the knowledge, skills and personality you have. </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The final paragraph summarises everything and reiterates why you think you would be a good addition to the team. </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The great thing about writing your supporting statement is that you can re-use this for other jobs you apply for. All you need to change are the technical parts such as the job name (research associate/research fellow etc), the PI/research group name, and the skills that are specified in each of the job specifications. Make sure you’re honest in your statement - you won’t have every skill they are looking for and it’s fine to say you haven’t used a specific method but that you are keen to learn new techniques and develop your skillset. </span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Application and interview process</strong></span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Most institutions will have their own job portal. It can be quite a long process filling out all the forms, but I tried to allocate a certain time each week to fill out these applications to ensure I was keeping on top of everything whilst also writing my PhD thesis. Make sure to take note of the closing dates for each application so you don’t forget!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Don’t be disheartened if you get some rejections – this is a common and universal experience. I can personally say that I applied for many, many post-doc positions and got rejected from most of them. I often found that the feedback they gave was generic and it was usually that they had an applicant with more of the skills they wanted, so there wasn’t much I could do about that. If you get an interview, congratulations! This is often the hardest hurdle to overcome so it’s a massive achievement to get to this point. In terms of the interviews I had, each of these was fairly different but I will give you an overview and some general tips. Most interviews will have a presentation section and then a questions section, for which the lengths can vary. </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_b4a763d0d088495583eae1417e13a3c2~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_688,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I had one interview where they wanted a 5-minute presentation on “why my skills were suited to the role”. Another interview involved a 10-minute presentation on “your previous research which related to this role”. The final interview I had involved a longer presentation and then Q&amp;A. It can be time-consuming making these interview presentations, but as with the CV and supporting statements, you will be able to re-use these documents and adapt them to the requirements of each job role. In terms of the question section of the interviews, my best advice would be to search for general post-doc interview questions and write bullet point answers down for each example. Most questions I was asked in each of my interviews were based on these, so I had pre-prepared answers which helped with general nerves. A tip would be not to recite word for word; make it seem like you are thinking on the spot!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Interviews can be stressful but give yourself time to prepare as much as possible - I know this can be difficult when writing your thesis, but it will help you perform the best you can! </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>Final thoughts!</strong></span></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Make a scientific X account (formerly Twitter)</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Keep your LinkedIn and ResearchGate up to date</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Get feedback from your current supervisor on your CV</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Use the job description when writing your supporting statements</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Find common post-doctoral interview questions and write bullet point answers</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I hope this article has been helpful for anyone that has nearly finished their PhD and is tackling the next stage of applying for post-docs and other job roles. These thoughts were based on my personal experience, but I hope I have given some useful tips and tricks for finding, applying and interviewing for these roles. Best of luck!</span></span></p>
