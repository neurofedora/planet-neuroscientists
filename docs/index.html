                <p><strong>Applying to university can be daunting, especially when you are the first in your family to pursue higher education! Christabelle Asamoah brings us along on her journey, from her initial discovery of neuroscience, to experiencing it first-hand whilst studying at the University of Warwick.</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Neuroscience - an unheard word, course, or career for me, up until 16 years of age. Finding a career choice that encapsulated all of my interests and desires was definitely the hardest decision for 16-year-old me. Unlike many others my age, I wasn’t fortunate to have parents who had undergone higher education, nor were knowledgeable about life science courses. However, I have always been fortunate to have an inquisitive mind – an inquisitive mind that wasn’t afraid to ask questions, wasn’t afraid to be wrong and learn from others, which guided me towards science and research. It was a surprise to realise that the inner workings of my brain - arguably the most important organ in my body, the coordinator of all my emotions and feelings, and the controller of all of my vital bodily functions - was a mystery to me. This curiosity is what led me to begin my exploration of the innovative field of neuroscience. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>My Journey of Sixth Form and A- Levels</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I altered my A-level subjects 3 times before my initial sixth form induction! The first combination was Maths, Economics &amp; Sociology, but once I had discovered the content in the second year of A-level Maths, I decided it would be too complex for me. Subsequently, I changed my A-levels to Economics, Psychology and Sociology. Psychology was always a subject that I knew was commonly chosen and, after watching ‘crash courses’ on YouTube, attracted me to choose it. Although I study a STEM degree now, sciences had always frightened me during my secondary education, which is why I didn’t initially choose any of them at sixth form. However, my friends and family persuaded me to choose a more ‘facilitating’ subject - they were seen by Russell Group Universities as more desirable - so I switched Sociology for Biology. This persuasion worked in my favour - it is funny how a subject that I didn’t initially choose became my favourite out of the three, and ultimately led me here to my neuroscience degree today. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Eventually, I was definite about my choices and commenced sixth form with Biology, Economics and Psychology. Everyone always questions my choice of Economics as it seems to be an outlier in comparison to my other subjects. Economics was always the subject I struggled with the most, yet I don’t regret choosing it. It broadened my insight into world politics and economics and helped me to become  the critical thinker I am today. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My A-level subjects were not conventional choices for the path to a Neuroscience degree, but it is important to do subjects that you enjoy and will inspire you (as long as they don’t close doors of interest to you!).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Choosing Universities</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Once I decided to study BSc Neuroscience, the following difficulty was deciding which universities to choose. Unfortunately, I was exempt from many London universities, since many required Chemistry A level which I did not do. Many also required A*AA and so would not be an option, as I was predicted AAA. Rejection from these London universities was a blessing in disguise, although it didn’t seem like that at the time; living in London my whole life, I now believe it was important for me to experience another city/environment.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_3e315890b3e0429096f9093be04993ad~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_828,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I had chosen 5 universities, ranging geographically from London to the midlands, with grades ranging from AAA to AAB. I was fortunate enough to attend the Warwick </span></span><u><a href="https://summerschools.suttontrust.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Summer School Sutton Trust</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, a programme centred around first generation or state school students, exploring the University of Warwick on a 5-day residential programme, free of any cost! This residential programme was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of what higher education would be like and the independence alongside it. The Sutton Trust was my first experience of higher education, its platform motivates state students, like myself, to feel more confident about our futures and aspire to access leading universities. I always recommend the Sutton Trust to first generation sixth-form students.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I was in awe of Warwick’s campus university, the greenery, and its sophisticated buildings, and this convinced me to ‘firm’ the University of Warwick - they even lowered their preferred grades to ABB for Neuroscience for me as I achieved a contextual offer. At the end of sixth form, I achieved AAB - the As in Psychology and Biology, exceeding my Warwick offer!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Delving into the UCAS application</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As a first-generation university student with no older siblings, the UCAS process was novel to my parents and I. How do I write a personal statement? How do I compare universities? How do I apply for student finance? These were some of the questions I battled daily during this process. I didn’t want to bother my parents, knowing that this process was foreign to them too. It almost felt like I would endeavour this overwhelming process alone, until I was introduced to some sites which are still valuable in my educational journey. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><a href="https://www.zerogravity.co.uk/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">ZeroGravity website</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> was</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> one of them; this website successfully paired me with a mentor, who was in her 3rd year of her Neuroscience degree. This platform, alongside LinkedIn and </span></span><u><a href="https://blackexcellencenetwork.co.uk/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Black Excellence Network</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> (BEN)</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> mentorship encouraged me to communicate with mentors who were currently studying Neuroscience, or had recently graduated, and ask them questions about the modules of the degree, the UCAS process and future career prospects. They proof-read my personal statement multiple times, aided my comparison of university choices and ultimately supported my decision in firming the University of Warwick. The guidance and support from my mentors were unmatched. My advice, for other first-generation sixth form students, is to not “suffer in silence”. There are resources out there for you! Being inquisitive, curious and unafraid to ask for support and guidance led me to these resources, and these are characteristics that you should employ throughout higher education.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>My Experience of Neuroscience</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Initially, attending the University of Warwick for a STEM degree made me anxious. As Warwick is renowned for its economics and politics courses, I was afraid that, as a STEM student, I would be forgotten, or wouldn’t have the same exceptional learning experience as my social sciences friends. But, as my first year of university is quickly coming to an end, I can happily say I wouldn’t want to study </span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">anything </span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">else, </span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">anywhere </span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">else. It has been intriguing to learn and understand the brain.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">But, what does a neuroscience degree actually entail? - this is a common question asked by my non-STEM friends. As it is classified as a biological science, we cover molecular biology and biochemistry in much greater depth - </span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">deeper</span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> than A-level Biology, which I didn’t even think was possible! Understanding the fundamentals of biology and chemistry is essential for all life science degrees. </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_028f16ecb241427599110be5699f5ed3~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In my first year, many of my modules have overlapped with the adjacent life science degrees, such as Biomedical Science and Biochemistry. Initially, learning in bigger lecture halls of 400 students was daunting, however, it has quickly become a community. It has been exceptional making friends and studying together with different life-science courses. It is always fascinating to hear about their own journeys into life sciences, many of which were different to my own. We also have our core Neuroscience module, “Cell Biology of Neurons”, which consists of novel information, fascinating research and provides a good foundation to the course. For example, we have been studying navigation systems in the brain, which asks questions like: How do we perceive time and the use of our cognitive maps to navigate locations, using different cells in our brains? The Neuroscience research conducted at Warwick always exceeds my imagination. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>My Future</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Although many perceive Neuroscience as a niche degree with narrow career prospects, it has already taught me many transferable skills, which make this degree very employable. I am excited to become more immersed in my University community and find life-long friends. Ultimately, I am excited to achieve more than I could ever imagine.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a href="http://imagine.At" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">At</span></span></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> the moment, I’m not entirely sure what I would like to pursue in the future, be it academia, industry, or healthcare etc. But platforms, like WiNUK, are so helpful to me and other unsure neuroscience students. I am excited for the upcoming years of my degree, engaging in innovative and evolving neuroscience research and discoveries. </span></span></p>

<p><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">But for now, I’m going to leave you with my top tips:</span></span></em></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Changing your mind, changing your passions and changing your career options is normal</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> - you are not expected to have your life meticulously planned </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Outsourcing to social mobility platforms is essential</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> - seek advice and access career opportunities from these platforms, especially as a first generation student</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Connect with individuals who have been in the same position as you</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> - foster a community with those that share similar goals to you, as they can offer valuable information and resources that can help you navigate your own goals</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Be inquisitive and curious</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> - no-one will shame you for asking questions, if you are unsure of a process, ask questions and seek solutions</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Choose a degree that fascinates you always</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> - this is 3-4 years of education and learning, it is vital to choose a degree that engages your mind</span></span></p></li>

<p>An academic editor at Wiley who <a href="https://archive.fo/05wC1">vowed</a> to “uphold publication ethics” is being investigated by the company for allegedly publishing three of his papers twice, in violation of journal policies, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471595323001920">One</a> of the duplicates, which appeared last year in <em>Nurse Education in Practice</em>, an Elsevier title, has already been slated for retraction, according to emails we have seen. The other offending articles were published in Wiley journals.</p>



<p>The editor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-joseph-berdida-0960281b2/">Daniel Joseph Berdida</a>, is a nurse and faculty member at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, the Philippines. He joined <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jonm/editors/">the editorial board</a> of Wiley’s <em>Journal of Nursing Management </em>four months ago, <a href="https://archive.fo/05wC1">announcing on LinkedIn</a> that he would “be serving with integrity and uphold publication ethics.”</p>



<span id="more-129110"></span>



<p>After being confronted about the duplicate publication by Roger Watson, editor-in-chief of <em>Nurse Education in Practice, </em>Berdida acknowledged his transgression, explaining he had been “on health leave” for the past eight months and “a breakdown in communication” with his research assistant had “led to the current situation.”</p>



<p>“I fully acknowledge my responsibility in this matter,” Berdida wrote in a March 13 email. “If it is within your discretion, I would appreciate it if you could consider retracting the manuscript from your journal, given the circumstances.”</p>



<p>But Berdida had made the same excuse to one of the Wiley journals, and Watson was unconvinced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As with all violations of publication ethics, this is a most unfortunate set of duplications,” he told us. “It is doubly unfortunate for the author that the editors-in-chief of three of the publications involved are very close colleagues and regularly consult one another for advice. In this way we were able to tie the three incidences of duplication together. Let’s hope there are no more.”</p>



<p>The three duplicate articles are:</p>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471595323001920">The mediating roles of moral courage and moral resilience between nurses’ moral distress and moral injury: an online cross-sectional study</a>.” (A duplicate of “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10943-023-01873-w">Moral distress, moral resilience, moral courage, and moral injury among nurses in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mediation analysis</a>.”)</li>



<li>“<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.16526">Nurses&#8217; professional values and competency in Saudi Arabia: A structural equation modelling approach</a>.” (A duplicate of “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1322769623000380">Structural equation modelling of ethicomoral values and competence of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.”)</li>



<li>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12946">Safety climate, quality of care, adherence to and compliance with standard precautions among nurses: Structural equation modeling</a>.” (A duplicate of “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12960">Nurses&#8217; safety climate, quality of care, and standard precautions adherence and compliance: A cross-sectional study</a>.”)</li>
</ul>



<p>On March 20, Watson wrote to Berdida:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This is to inform you that Elsevier will be retracting your article in Nurse Education in Practice and due to the fact that we are aware of further duplications in other journals we are not satisfied with your response. Under these circumstances we consider that it is necessary to inform your dean.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mark Hayter, editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Clinical Nursing</em>, in which <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.16526">one</a> of the duplicate papers appeared, confirmed his publication was “involved in this matter,” adding, “It is currently being investigated by the Wiley publication ethics team.”</p>



<p>Berdida has not responded to our request for comment. The dean of his university’s College of Nursing, Rowena L. Escolar Chua, declined to comment, explaining, “I do not know the full story and the matter is still being investigated.”</p>

<figure id="attachment_13538" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13538" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 178px"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-13538" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Nasonia.png" alt="" width="168" height="96" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13538" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">Fig.1 Brink et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Epigenetic changes, based on dynamic DNA methylation patterns, have been consistently associated with aging processes. However, much about aging is currently based on two model organisms, Drosophila and C. elegans, that lack detectable DNA methylation. This study introduces Nasonia vitripennis, the jewel wasp, as an innovative model for the epigenetics of aging. Like current model organisms, Nasonia is easy and cheap to keep in a laboratory, has a short, characterized life cycle, and a sequenced genome. In addition, it features a functional DNA methylation system, although it has not been studied in the aging process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To fill the gap, the authors measured for the first time its methylome using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing followed by methylation analysis. They identified several sites that are age- and sex-specifically methylated and they constructed an epigenetic clock containing 19 sites correlating epigenetic changes and chronological age. Contrary to mammalian aging, in Nasonia DNA methylation increases with age; females, generally living longer than males, display lower methylation levels as they age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there is no direct correspondence between epigenetic clocks in Nasonia and humans, some intriguing functional overlaps exist, delivering Nasonia a first success as a model organism. Only time will tell if the jewel wasp can help suggest potential anti-aging interventions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-13543" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/unhealthy_food.png" alt="" width="177" height="118" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/unhealthy_food.png 421w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/unhealthy_food-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px" />Spain has one of the highest prevalence of obesity in Europe, mainly affecting lower class people. Socio-economic inequalities regarding eating habits and obesity are linked to the influence of advertising on food preferences and consumption. In this study, the exposure to advertising of foods and drinks is measured using a remote control device among 1590 Spanish children and adolescents, and crossed with the nutrient content profiles defined by the World Health Organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The results show an average of 10 commercials received per day, with most food and drink commercials being about unhealthy products and occurring within the evening, the peak child-audience time in Spain. The exposure of lower class participants to unhealthy products was double compared to higher social ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The observed exposure to unhealthy food and drink advertising is accounted for by the absence of regulation in Spain: there is nothing more than a voluntary code of conduct on food advertising targeting under-12 children, and it does not regulate the nutrient profile of the advertised products nor the broadcasting frequency. A recently proposed statutory regulation has been opposed by food and advertising industries, while civil society organizations are concerned not only to protect Spanish children from exposure, but also to reduce health-related social inequalities.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_13542" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13542" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 185px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-13542 size-full" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/needle-1.png" alt="" width="175" height="126" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13542" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">Fig.1 Reynoso-Mejia et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Metal surgical devices such as trocars can generate metal artifacts in interventional procedures guided through computed tomography, used for example in biopsies. This makes the detection and visualization of target elements more difficult, which is a problem especially in operations where precise positioning is essential. Recently, specific proprietary algorithms have been proposed for metal artifact reduction, but these may modify the non-artifactual image data while processing the artifact area and are not always available for real-time application, required in interventional imaging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this study, the authors investigate the use of a 0.5 mm silver filter to reduce metal artifacts The proposed method is based on the already known capacity of silver, similar to tin, to harden the X-ray beam, increasing the effective beam energy. A number of parameters were evaluated at different locations and different beam energies on an anthropomorphic phantom, describing image quality and the significance of the artifact along the trajectory of the needle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The study shows that the use of a silver filter can significantly reduce metal artifacts, improving the visibility and the correct location of target structures without changing the overall image quality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Higher risks of complications during and after pregnancy are associated with inadequate prenatal care, often rooted in systemic factors such as institutional racism, and social and economic inequities. Equity, conceptualized as the absence of differences in access and use among population groups, should be the ultimate goal of consistent health policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This umbrella review, including 68 quantitative and qualitative systematic reviews, aims to explore barriers and facilitators of equity in prenatal care. While the first authors of the systematic reviews were mainly from the UK, Canada and US, those of the studies included in those reviews were mainly from Africa and Asia. Although patterns are not always generalizable, similar determinants were found across countries and contexts, with pregnant women belonging to socially disadvantaged groups experiencing difficulties in accessing or receiving care in a wide range of prenatal services. Individual and social factors such as education level, socioeconomic status, rigidity of traditional gender roles led to a greater risk of adverse outcomes and lower utilization of care. Discrimination related with race, ethnicity, culture, language and religion was more common in North America, Europe, and Oceania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a global perspective suggests the need to overcome barriers implementing specific interventions to favor inclusive access to health services. This includes awareness: the authors report that, ironically, the majority of studies did not define equity nor use any conceptual framework.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Visualization of risk, although it seems trivial, is a hard task. To be effective, it should simplify complex information, be intuitive, and take into account people’s beliefs and experiences. For example, regular breast cancer screening offered at the population-level can cause false positives, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. According to the experts, the benefit-harm trade-off might be improved by screening women at high risk more frequently than women at medium risk. However, the idea of potential harms in preventive health can be counterintuitive and women in lower risk categories may experience anxiety or feelings of unfairness due to a lower screening frequency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this participatory study, women’s perspectives are investigated to develop an effective quantitative and qualitative visual strategy to best inform on risk categories and breast cancer risk-based screening. The involved women wanted to understand their assignment to a certain risk category, preferably visualized in an icon array, and to get advice on risk reduction and self-examination; there was a general misconception that most risk factors are modifiable, while women tended to be unaware of breast density as a risk factor. Therefore, the resulting visual emphasized that risk is given by a combination of factors, including breast density. Similarly, the presented information sheets, reviewed by a board of experts, communicated risk to answer counterintuitive questions and reassure concerned women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> This work is a successful example of how non-specialists can help improve communication in the context of preventive health.</span></p>

<p>Earlier this year, a group of lecturers in Malaysia received a WhatsApp message from a colleague who had made a disturbing discovery. </p>



<p>The colleague, who wished to remain anonymous for this story, was looking through Google Scholar and noticed their name, and many others from their department, repeatedly appeared alongside that of an unfamiliar author: Kumba Digdowiseiso, dean of the economics and business faculty at Universitas Nasional in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>



<p>“We didn’t even know who this person was,” said Safwan Mohd Nor, an associate professor of finance at the university, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, adding that he was “extremely angry” when he first found out his name had been used. </p>



<span id="more-129106"></span>



<p>Nor received unwanted bylines on four papers published in journals not indexed by Clarivate’s Web of Science. The journal editors have not responded to requests for comment. “It seems that this is like fraud or predatory journals,” Nor told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least 24 staff at the university have been unwittingly added to the list of authors on the dean’s papers, Nor said, citing an internal survey documenting the extent of the issue that faculty have not made available despite several requests. Digdowiseiso has been in contact with one lecturer at the university and told Retraction Watch that the matter has been resolved, but many of the staff’s names <a href="https://mail.jsss.co.id/index.php/jsss/article/view/837/1024">still remain</a> <a href="https://mail.jsss.co.id/index.php/jsss/article/view/784/950">published online</a>.</p>



<p>The university’s Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Development, where the affected staff are based, declined to comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Digdowiseiso has published at least 160 papers in 2024 alone, according to his Google Scholar profile, which casts a wider net for publications than other indexing services such as Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dean had visited the Malaysian university last year, according to the deputy dean of Academic and Student Affairs, Azwadi Ali. Ali said Digdowiseiso met with management to discuss student mobility, guest lectures and potential research collaboration. “But we did not know that this might happen,” Ali said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to Nor, Digdowiseiso did not meet with the faculty lecturers and a collaboration was never agreed upon. “He just came to visit and suddenly we noticed our names in those papers,” Nor said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His name has since been removed from one of the papers, but the <a href="https://mail.jsss.co.id/index.php/jsss/article/view/784/950">remaining three</a> <a href="https://mail.jsss.co.id/index.php/jsss/article/view/837/1024">still list Nor</a> <a href="https://radjapublika.com/index.php/IJEBAS/article/view/1334">as an author</a>. “I have never been involved in any of these papers, never consented to the use of my name without my direct research involvement, and never collaborated with Kumba Digdowiseiso or his co-authors my whole life,” Nor said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added that some of the staff’s names have been removed from the main page of the paper, but remain in the PDF versions and are still indexed by Google Scholar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nor, Ali and Fahirah Syaliza Mokhtar, another lecturer in the faculty and the university’s legal advisor, said they have attempted to contact Digdowiseiso but have not received a response. Mokhtar requested that he “ensure that our names would be retracted from the article, and that the article should be retracted from the journal,” she told us. “If [Digdowiseiso] wants to proceed with the journal publication, we have no problem with that, but we want to ensure that our names have been retracted from the journals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali said Digdowiseiso is in contact with Jumadil Saputra, one of the lecturers at the Malaysian university, who has not responded to our requests for comment. “When we asked him to retract our names, he actually replaced the names with [Saputra’s],” Ali said. Saputra is listed as an author on six publications alongside Digdowiseiso since the start of 2023, according to his Google Scholar profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nor said Saputra told him Digdowiseiso is in the process of deleting the names. “Our names, however, are still there in the system, and deleting them later does not change the fact that Kumba Digdowiseiso has committed a serious academic offence,” Nor wrote in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our questions, Digdowiseiso wrote that the matter was “already resolved” between the faculties, but did not respond to follow-up questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s weird, many of our names are still used illegally and displayed in those journal websites and Google Scholar,” Nor said of Digdowiseiso’s response. “Also our faculty is planning to organize a meeting with him, so how come he claimed the issue is resolved?”</p>

With the constant increase in the use of data for both digital health and research purposes, ethics and data privacy are important consideration in this increasingly digital world. Matters such as the implications for future generations of storing genetic information, transparency when it comes to consent, human bias when handling data and considerations on benefits versus risks of storing certain types of information are some examples. Solutions for and conversations about cyber security and local storage vs online databases come into play.</p>
<p>The Collection <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/BEDP">Bioinformatics ethics and data privacy</a> welcomes submissions on new computational approaches, tools, and databases to address issues and open questions in bioinformatics ethics and data privacy, including anonymization, encryption and data deposition.</p>
<p>In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal SDG 16, which seeks to promote just, peaceful, and inclusive societies, this collection emphasizes the importance of respecting and upholding the right to privacy and access to information.</p>

<p><em>Toxicologic Pathology</em> – a Sage title – has issued expressions of concern for six papers that were among the subjects of an investigation by Azabu University that concluded in November 2022.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01926233241238763">expression of concern</a>, dated March 7, 2024, includes a list of the six articles and reads:</p>



<span id="more-129101"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>Toxicologic Pathology</em> was contacted by the author, Shin Wakui, requesting retraction of these articles. Despite multiple attempts at gaining further information on the reasons for retraction, we have not received anymore communication regarding this case.</p>



<p>This expression of concern will remain in place until further evidence is provided to Sage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The university <a href="https://www.azabu-u.ac.jp/important/2022/1124_40217.html">issued</a> a <a href="https://www.azabu-u.ac.jp/important/files/kouhyoubunsyo221124.pdf">report about the misconduct findings</a> in November 2022, which Lemonstoism, author of<a href="http://blog.goo.ne.jp/lemon-stoism"> World Fluctuation Watch</a>, sent us at the time and which we forwarded to Sage once we saw the expressions of concern. The university investigated 31 papers, of which at least <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dWakui%252c%2bShin">two have been retracted</a>.</p>



<p>The authors did not share that report when they contacted the journal in November 2023, a Sage spokesperson told Retraction Watch. “At this point it’s too soon to say how the report might impact any future action with the article,” Sage told us.</p>



<p>Wakui’s Azabu email address bounced, and we were unable to find other contact information for him.</p>



<p>Here are the six papers:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wakui S, Takahashi H, Mutou T, et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0192623312457272">Atypical Leydig Cell Hyperplasia in Adult Rats with Low T and High LH Induced by Prenatal Di(n-butyl) Phthalate Exposure</a>. Toxicologic Pathology. 2013;41(3):480-486.</li>

</ul>



<p>Collectively, the papers have been cited just shy of 100 times, with just a handful of those citations coming after the university report was published in 2022.</p>

It also “follows the Lancet one on a sentence-by-sentence level while using tortured phrases,” an anonymous tipster told us.</p>



<p>As we’ve noted elsewhere in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">report on the team that developed the phrase</a>, “Tortured phrases are what happens to words that get translated from English into a foreign language, then back to English — perhaps by a computer trying to generate a scholarly publication for a group of unscrupulous authors.”</p>



<span id="more-129078"></span>



<p>Graham Parker, <em>Cureus</em>’ director of publishing and customer success, told us to his knowledge,  “the journal has not been contacted with any concerns regarding this article. Now that we are aware of a concern, we will examine both articles in question to see if any action is required.”</p>



<p>Neither Khizer K. Ansari, the corresponding author of the <em>Cureus </em>paper and a student at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College in Wardha, India, nor Majid Ezzati, the corresponding author of&nbsp; the article in <em>The Lancet</em>&nbsp; and a professor at Imperial College London, responded to requests for comment.</p>

                <p>On April 4, 2024 we had a chance to talk to Kara Marshall about the membrane protein PIEZO2, which is responsible for sensory transduction of many of the mechanical senses, including light touch, vibration, and proprioception. We especially focused on its function in sensing internal pressure and movement, including bladder pressure and blood pressure.</p>
