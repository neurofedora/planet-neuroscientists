</div>


<p>The Supreme Court of Spain has ordered a literary scholar to pursue retractions of nine works it determined were plagiarized.     <br><br>The Tribunal Supremo upheld a lower court’s ruling that narrative theory researcher Franciscó Álamo Felices, a professor at the University of Almería in Spain, plagiarized a colleague’s work in two books and seven articles. José R. Valles Calatrava, a literary theory professor at the same university, sued Felices in 2019 for infringement of his intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>That <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sentencia-audiencia-1197-Almeria.COPIACIEGA_redacted.pdf">lower court</a> found Felices responsible for “a huge amount of plagiarism at different times and in different articles, revealing a systematic and conscientious parasitic attitude and a desire for appropriation,” according to a translation of the ruling by DeepL Translate. In an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SUPREMO.SENTFIRMEyNOarecursocasacion_Redacted.pdf">October 2025 decision</a>, the Tribunal Supremo dismissed an appeal by Felices against the ruling, finding he failed to demonstrate any fundamental errors of law.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134061"></span>



<p>Felices is obligated to withdraw the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Felices_books_articles.pdf">two books and seven articles</a> or to “clearly mark them as plagiarism,” according to the judgment.    </p>



<p>Felices told us he did not plagiarize the works, and that the pieces simply expanded upon entries in a book he cowrote with Calatrava: <em>Diccionario de Teoría de la Narrativa</em>. The dictionary contains nearly 1,000 terms in various fields of narratology, Felices said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the university dismissed a complaint about this issue, he told us in Spanish, finding no plagiarism occurred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“However, the judge interpreted it from a different legal perspective, which we must respect,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Felices has had work <a href="https://scispace.com/pdf/el-concepto-de-ficcionalidad-teoria-y-representaciones-41i1r5taqy.pdf">retracted in the past</a> for duplication of his own prior work.</p>



<p>In his complaint, Calatrava accused Felices of writing nine texts plagiarizing work in three of Calatrava’s books.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calatrava’s books were published between 1990 and 1999, and Felices’ two books and seven articles were published between 2009 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to <em>Diccionario de Teoría de la Narrativa</em> published in 2002, the two professors cowrote <em>Fundamentos de la semiótica narrativa</em>, published in 2000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calatrava learned about the plagiarism through a Google reference to one of his quotes when he returned to the university in mid-2017 after traveling, he told us. The first article Calatrava came across was “only the tip of the iceberg of a whole series of plagiarism,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Felices plagiarized Calatrava’s work in two books, the court ruled — <em>La literatura y su estudio: Teorías literarias</em> and <em>Principios teóricos y metodológicos de teoría de la narrativa</em> . The court also deemed literary research articles in seven different journals plagiarism. </p>



<p>Felices denied appropriating Calatrava’s works, arguing more than half of the texts consisted of direct quotations, and that a substantial part of the publications “contained abundant indirect references made in accordance with the standard procedures in the citation and bibliography,” according to a translation of his defense in court documents. Felices’ texts also consisted of “a modest portion of vocabulary used in the discipline and employed in all works related to the subject, which excludes the possibility of plagiarism,” he argued. He also contended the alleged plagiarism came from his collaborative works with Calatrava.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Court records indicate the University of Almería dismissed a complaint filed with the university with the same allegations. Judges noted, however, the university determined “the facts — whether true or not — did not constitute a disciplinary offense of any kind, without ruling out the existence of plagiarism at any time,” according to a translation of court documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SENTENCIA-Mercantil-ALMERIA_redacted.pdf">initial lower court</a> ruled in favor of Calatrava, and Felices appealed. After reviewing the texts, appeals judges found striking similarities, concluding with “overwhelming certainty” that Felices’ texts were written with Calatrava’s in mind, with “a clear parasitic intent, changing only the least relevant terms in terms of their significance, maintaining even the arrangement and rhythm of the sentences and, of course, the original scientific or discipline-specific terms,” according to a translation of the appeals court decision. </p>



<p>“It should also be borne in mind that in the particular case of copying/plagiarism without attribution, the figure of the author is being erased, and it is no longer a question of violating the integrity of the work or infringing purely economic rights, but rather of breaking the link between the author and his work in order to simply appropriate the result of the author&#8217;s creative activity,” a translation of the appeals ruling states. “Thus, the infringement of removing the author and stealing their work is the most serious form of infringement of moral rights, as it amounts to depriving them of their authorship.”</p>



<p>The appeals court added because both Felices and Calatrava belong to the same university department, the impact to Calatrava is greater due to the academic relevance, “the commotion it has undoubtedly caused, and the considerable impact on coexistence and the working environment within the workplace,” according to a translation of the ruling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tribunal Supremo threw out Felices’ second appeal. In addition to withdrawing the works, Felices was ordered to pay Calatrava 5,000 euros for moral damages caused.</p>



<p>Calatrava was pleased with the legal outcome, he said. While his reputation and research career have not been affected, the ordeal has created psychological distress and caused him to take time off work, he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In my opinion, victims of plagiarism are poorly understood and even less supported,” he said. “But believe me, the ultimate triumph of justice, albeit belated, puts everyone in their place and soothes the wound.”</p>



<p>At least four texts have since been withdrawn, including articles in <a href="https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/DICE/article/view/77266"><em>Decenda</em></a>, <a href="https://revistacronopio.com/tag/teoria-definiciones-y-clasificaciones-de-los-subgeneros-novelescos/"><em>Cronopio</em></a>, <a href="https://dialnet.unirioja.es/ejemplar/259817"><em>Anuario de Estudios Filológicos</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://papiro.unizar.es/ojs/index.php/tropelias/en/article/view/590"><em>Tropelías</em></a>.</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/math-pregnancy-Gemini_Generated_Image.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="642" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/math-pregnancy-Gemini_Generated_Image.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-134046" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/math-pregnancy-Gemini_Generated_Image.jpg 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/math-pregnancy-Gemini_Generated_Image-300x188.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/math-pregnancy-Gemini_Generated_Image-768x482.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Image generated by Google Gemini</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I had grown weary of the constant stream and abuse of spam invitations to submit manuscripts to journals and to attend fake conferences on the other side of the world, a trend <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/leap.1500">extensively</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/leap.1450">studied</a> in academia. The last straw: a solicitation from the <a href="https://www.obstetricgynecoljournal.com/index.php/cjog"><em>Clinical Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em></a>, well outside my work in mathematics education. </p>



<p>Accepting the challenge, I decided to submit a deliberately nonsensical, AI-generated manuscript in response to observe how the individuals behind these supposed journals operate.</p>



<p>In October 2025, I wrote to someone named Henry Jackson, who had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/initial_email.pdf">sent the article invitation</a> in August (despite the fact that no such person is listed on the journal’s website). I sent a manuscript generated entirely by ChatGPT to test how far a publication created with zero genuine effort could go and whether there was any filtering mechanism in place to prevent a meaningless article from being published.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134045"></span>



<p>I proposed the following title in my reply: “Obstetric Paradoxes and Didactic Equations: The Impact of Mathematical Teaching on Childbirth and Beyond.” The abstract read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In an unprecedented quantum leap in interdisciplinary research, we introduce the concept of ‘Gyneco-Obstetric Algebraic Didactics’ (GOAD). This paper explores the impact of teaching mathematical models using obstetric metaphors on the cognitive flexibility of third-trimester patients and first-year mathematics students alike. Through the introduction of the Ovary-Function Theorem (OFT) and the application of the Cervix-Dilation Equation <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="97" height="44" class="wp-image-134050" style="width: 97px;" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.png" alt="">, the study reveals that explaining non-Euclidean spaces through pelvic retroversion significantly improves calculus test scores and reduces birth anxiety by 13.7%. A case study with pregnant mathematicians and aspiring gynecologists demonstrates that integrating the Fibonacci sequence into labor progression charts induces spontaneous appreciation for abstract algebra and mild cravings for prime numbers. These findings challenge the traditional boundaries between prenatal care and set theory, suggesting that mathematical didactics and obstetric gynecology, when merged, can birth new paradigms in both fields. Further research is encouraged, especially in the context of cesarean matrices and post-partum group theory.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On October 29, I received the following response from someone named Amelia Sandra, from the journal’s editorial office (who is also not listed among the journal&#8217;s staff): “We request that you submit the full-length article on your research so that we can forward it to our quality department for evaluation.” I asked ChatGPT to generate a full article (clearly absurd and entirely fictitious) consistent with the submitted title and abstract. I deliberately included graphs that explained nothing and results that were entirely implausible. The conclusions were patently unbelievable. A cursory glance at the paper would have been enough to realize it made no sense whatsoever.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/diago23quadrat_headshot.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="819" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/diago23quadrat_headshot.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-134047" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/diago23quadrat_headshot.jpg 600w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/diago23quadrat_headshot-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pascual D. Diago</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>At this point, I resorted to a small deception and submitted the article under a pseudonym, as I had no intention of gaining any benefit from the publication, nor of having it appear among my genuine academic works. I chose a pseudonym similar to my real name, “Pascual Chiago,” since I had to submit the manuscript from my official university email account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I left other obvious signs that the article was a joke, such as references to non-existent journals and authors with rather explicit surnames (e.g., Sneakydez, Trickón, Sneakarez, Hoodvez, Cheatillo) hoping that anyone would clearly see the false nature of the article. On November 3, I submitted the AI-generated article on the impact of mathematics education on unborn children.</p>



<p>Minutes later, I received a response from Amelia stating that my article had been forwarded to their “professional review team.” At this point, I assumed my experiment would end there.</p>



<p>I was wrong. On November 12 a certain <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Susan_Lee_Alert_-Revision-Submission-Requires-Your-Attention.pdf">Susan Lee</a> (also not listed on the journal’s website) demanded an immediate response within 24 hours to the review comments on the submitted paper, even though I had not previously received any email with review comments. The tone was threatening and insisted on payment of the invoice. I received six identical emails with the review comments.</p>



<p>Fortunately — or amusingly — the manuscript was rated as “ACCEPTED WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS.” The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Article-Peer-Review-Report-CJOG0253.pdf">review letter</a> praised the manuscript as “fairly written and interesting” and commended my “hard work.” Among the requested revisions were suggestions that made little sense, including demands that I cite unrelated journals such as the <em>Journal of Molecular</em> <em>Liquids</em> and <em>Spectrochimica Acta</em>.</p>



<p>Pressed for time and increasingly irritated, I resubmitted the same file five minutes later, randomly highlighting passages in yellow and making no actual changes. I also added the requested citations without checking their existence, inventing authors and titles to further test whether anyone was genuinely overseeing the process. The references included authors explicitly named to suggest fabrication (e.g., “Me-Lo, I.” and “Nvent, O.”, names that, when read in Spanish, sound like ‘me lo invento’, meaning ‘I&#8217;m making it up’).</p>



<p>Within less than an hour, I received final acceptance from the editor. Shortly after, I was sent <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cjog-aid1197-Invoice.pdf">an invoice for APCs</a> amounting to USD $2,949, payable within two to three days.</p>



<p>Naturally, I had no intention of paying such a sum. So when I received <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251118-1st-reminder_-Pascual-Chiago-cjog-aid1197.pdf">a payment reminder</a> email on November 18 signed by Robbie Williams, I decided to extend the joke slightly further so they might realize they were the ones being deceived this time. I <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251118-Re_-1st-reminder_-Pascual-Chiago-cjog-aid1197.pdf">replied angrily and embedded references to songs</a> by the singer Robbie Williams (the real one), with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PaidInvoice.png">a fake receipt attached</a> from the “CheatBank of Spain” generated by AI. Perhaps the fake invoice was excessive, but it felt like poetic justice.</p>



<p>I assumed the matter would end there. However, a few days later, after recounting the story to a colleague, I discovered that the article <a href="https://www.obstetricgynecoljournal.com/index.php/cjog/article/view/cjog-aid1197">had indeed been published</a> on the journal’s website with an assigned DOI. I had assumed that without payment, publication would not proceed.</p>



<p>My email of November 18 was my last communication with them. Since then, Robbie Williams has continued to email me every five or six days requesting payment.</p>



<p>The paper has somehow brought me back to where I started. This week I received an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Obstetric-Paradoxes-and-Didactic-Equations-conference-invite.pdf">unsolicited email</a> from the conference manager of an <a href="https://www.gynaecology.scientexconference.com/">upcoming gynecology meeting</a>. It seems my paper “was identified as pertinent to themes under consideration.”</p>



<p>What was my intention in doing all this? Even today I am not entirely sure, but I suppose that, first, I was seeking a kind of vendetta against the malicious spam emails that academics receive daily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, I wanted to demonstrate what we are repeatedly told in training courses about predatory journals: The machinery designed to exploit the academic system is devoid of scientific rigor and ethical standards. But I don’t think I needed AI to tell us that. </p>

                The force-activated ion channels underlie the senses of touch and proprioception. Now scientists are using them as a tool to explore molecular mechanisms at work in internal organs, including the heart, bladder, uterus and kidney.

<p>A journal published by an organization that develops technical standards is retracting 147 papers for problematic peer review — and the publisher expects more to follow.&nbsp;<br><br>The American Society For Testing And Materials&nbsp; (ASTM) International started an investigation into its <em>Journal of Testing and Evaluation</em> after an ASTM vendor noticed some “irregular patterns in the peer review” in a special issue, spokesperson Gavin O’Reilly told Retraction Watch. When the publisher confirmed those patterns, ASTM decided to investigate several related issues, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation revealed the peer review process in the special sections or issues had been compromised, each of the retraction notices says.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134031"></span>



<p>“We have been informed that those patterns of compromised peer review could indicate a paper mill, though it&#8217;s outside of our scope of work to make that determination,” O’Reilly told us. “We’re continuing to focus on early and proactive measures, from technology to procedures, to ensure the integrity of our journal peer review process.” The journal has issued four batch retraction notices so far. O’Reilly told us they expect at least one more to come.</p>



<p>The papers were published between 2019 and 2024 in the journal, which began publishing in 1973, according <a href="https://store.astm.org/journal-of-testing-and-evaluation.html#issues">to its website</a>. The journal joins 75 others with at least 145 retractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass retraction includes 48 papers in its “<a href="https://dl.astm.org/jte/article-abstract/doi/10.1520/JTE20269996/30680/Retraction-of-48-Articles-Due-to-Publication?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Special Issue on Testing and Evaluation of Internet of Things for Smart City</a>” and another 43 articles in the “<a href="https://dl.astm.org/jte/article-abstract/doi/10.1520/JTE20269995/30679/Retraction-of-43-Articles-Due-to-Publication?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Special Issue on Advanced Internet of Things for Smart City (Part 2)</a>. The publisher retracted two more batches from a special issue on <a href="https://dl.astm.org/jte/article-abstract/doi/10.1520/JTE20269997/30678/Retraction-of-31-Articles-Due-to-Publication?redirectedFrom=fulltext">the future of cognitive computing in healthcare</a>, and a special section <a href="https://dl.astm.org/jte/article-abstract/53/5/1323/29416/RETRACTION-STATEMENT-Retraction-of-25-Articles-Due?redirectedFrom=fulltext">on advanced intelligence in information science and communication systems</a>. Guest editors oversaw all of the issues and sections facing retractions.</p>



<p>The journal typically publishes 200 to 300 articles per year. The retracted papers represented 9 to 25 percent of the articles published in a given year.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total articles published</td><td>Articles recently retracted</td><td>% of total</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>279</td><td>25</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>304</td><td>79</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>192</td><td>43</td><td>22%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In the first batch of 25 retracted papers, seven affiliations show up more than once, including Vellore Institute of Technology University in India, which is listed 23 times among the retracted papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subbiah Janakiraman of Pondicherry University in India is an author on three of the retracted papers. Janakiraman did not respond to our requests for comment. &nbsp; An S. Janakiraman with the same affiliation had <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/9856102">a 2022 paper in<em> Journal of Sensors</em></a> retracted as part of a mass retraction of nearly 12,000 articles by Hindawi to address an infiltration by paper mills of its special issues.</p>



<p>K. Chandraprabha was a coauthor on the same three retracted papers. He is listed with two different affiliations in the articles:&nbsp; R.V.S College of Engineering and Technology and JPJ Lending Library, both in India. Chandraprabha did not return messages seeking comment.</p>



<p>The 25 articles in the 2019 special section were cited a total of 62 times, the 31 articles in the 2023 special issue on the future of cognitive computing garnered 37 citations, the 48 papers in the 2023 special issue were cited 62 times, and the 43 papers retracted from the 2024 special issue were cited a total of 19 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recent retractions spotlight an ongoing pattern of peer review abuse within special sections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, Hindawi <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">temporarily suspended</a> publishing special issues because of “compromised articles.” In 2024, a Springer Nature journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/26/springer-nature-journal-pulls-nearly-three-dozen-papers-from-special-issues/">retracted 34 papers</a> from special issues for “compromised editorial handling and peer review process” and that same year, <em>Annals of Operations Research </em><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/01/we-authors-paid-a-heavy-price-journal-retracts-all-23-articles-in-special-issue/">retracted an entire special issue</a> over concerns about “compromised” peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07563">a study</a> posted at arXiv.org examined how often guest editors publish in their own special issues, defining special issues with more than 33 percent of articles authored by at least one editor as “Published in Support of Self (PISS).” Research shows special issues have also become <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">particularly vulnerable to paper mills</a> in recent years. </p>



<p>ASTM brings in about $100 million in annual revenue, according to <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/231352024">publicly available tax records</a> from ProPublica&#8217;s Nonprofit Explorer. In 2024, the society generated nearly $82 million from “publications sales,” according to <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/231352024/202523179349307292/full">its 2024 filing</a>.</p>
