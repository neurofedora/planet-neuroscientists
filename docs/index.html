<p>A paper coauthored by geneticist George Church has been retracted following an internal review at a university where several coauthors are based.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2121499119">The article</a> appeared in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> in 2022. The work supports an anti-aging gene therapy developed by BioViva, a company for which Church serves as an adviser. The paper’s authors claim cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be a gene therapy vector for a treatment for “aging-associated decline” that can be inhaled or injected monthly.</p>



<p>The work has been cited 41 times, two of which are citations from corrections to the article, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<span id="more-132571"></span>



<p>Besides <a href="https://genetics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/george-church">Church</a>, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston and health science professor at MIT in Cambridge, Mass., the other coauthors include Elizabeth Parrish, the CEO of BioViva; other researchers from the company; and a team of scientists from the Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Genetics at Rutgers University Medical School.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parrish and six colleagues disagreed with the retraction, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2519570122">the notice</a>, published Monday. The retraction “feels like part of the ongoing effort to block real longevity science from reaching the public,” Parrish told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move follows an “internal review” at Rutgers, according to the notice. The institution requested <em>PNAS </em>retract the paper for “data discrepancies” in two of the figures.</p>



<p>Church told us leading up to the study, he recommended the use of larger viral vectors — CMV — in the study, recommended preclinical animal trials, and helped design and review the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Church said he was “on the fence” about the retraction, and that he considered the “evidence both pro and con” to be “weak.” The notice reports that he agreed with the retraction.</p>



<p>“The main issue that I saw was that the raw datasets were not adequately backed up,” he said, but also said he “respects” the claims of the article. There is a “strong possibility that this was merely sloppy, rather than wrong,” Church told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Church said problems with the figures were “small, possibly accidental and did not affect the conclusions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction is the first for Church, who has authored over 700 papers. But critiques of the paper, and the work surrounding it, predate the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Sleuth and image expert Elisabeth Bik noted the discrepancies cited in the retraction notice <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9B76A71C2995A92B90D37AC1BE0693">on PubPeer in 2023</a>, writing two panels in one of the figures “appear to be showing the same specimen.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bik told us she first encountered concerns with the paper on X, where science writer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-swain-60a67192/">Frank Swain</a> had posted about the over-saturated blots and different black values of one of the figures. Bik then found the duplication in a separate figure, she told us. Swain has since <a href="https://x.com/sciencepunk?lang=en">deleted his X account</a>, but screenshots of the tweets can still be seen on the PubPeer thread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9B76A71C2995A92B90D37AC1BE0693">same thread</a>, BioViva CEO Parrish responded to the concerns: “it takes time to take a drug from research to human use. It is required that the reviewers have expertise in what they are reviewing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Bik called Parrish’s comment “bewildering,” saying Parrish “appeared to discredit” the commenter’s concerns “because we had no expertise in the matter.” Another commenter, “Apareia labialis,” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9B76A71C2995A92B90D37AC1BE0693">wrote</a> Parrish’s response “seems like a <em>non sequitur</em>” and said the paper had “less than unbiased reviews.”</p>



<p>The authors issued a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2212836119">correction</a> in August 2022 to update the competing interest disclosure to clarify the paper’s reviewer, <a href="https://sierrasci.com/dr-bill-andrews/">William Andrews</a>, a former board member of BioViva, “did not become associated with BioViva until after the article was accepted for publication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper received a second <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311483120">correction</a> on July 31, 2023, to address the image duplication Bik identified. Blot oversaturation wasn’t mentioned in the correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bik wrote on PubPeer in 2024 the new corrected figure “appears to have a different resolution/compression than the originals.” She then asked if the authors could clarify whether the images were produced during a new experiment or the original study, a question that went unanswered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not clear when Rutgers intervened, but Rutgers University Office of Research Regulatory Affairs requested the article be retracted “following an internal review of data discrepancies in Figs. 1 and 3,” the notice states. We reached out to the university for more information, and Dory Devlin, assistant vice president of media relations at Rutgers, told us: “We do not comment on investigations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hua Zhu, co-corresponding author, was a principal investigator for BioViva, and his Rutgers laboratory received funding from the company, according to the 2022 correction. In response to a request for comment, Zhu told us, “I have retired and I am in Greenland. I do not have to talk to you.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabbu-kumar-jaijyan-39790128/?originalSubdomain=in">Dabbu Jaijyan</a>, the lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at Rutgers, said he did “not have any specific comment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the retraction, Parrish commented on PubPeer the images “were updated and had no material effect on the outcome of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parrish told Retraction Watch the authors are “deeply shocked that our paper is being retracted over a non-material image issue—one that was already corrected a year ago.”</p>



<p>BioViva was “not informed of or included in the investigation,” Parrish said, stating that if the university does not provide the investigation documents, “this matter will likely end up in court.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our advice: is to never again place blind trust in big institutional interests,” she concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parrish reported in 2018 that <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2325556/liz-parrish-live-forever">she herself</a> had injections of BioViva’s gene therapy. In 2021, <em>STAT News</em> <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/03/six-patients-with-dementia-went-to-mexico-for-unproven-gene-therapy-biotech-ceo-claims/?utm_campaign=rss">reported</a> the company sent six dementia patients to Mexico to be injected with the experimental treatment since it wasn’t approved in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BioViva’s <a href="https://biovivasciences.squarespace.com/why-bioviva">website</a> says the “core CMV gene therapy” is the subject of a pending patent application, and “will revolutionize the way we treat disease.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Church serves on <a href="https://biovivasciences.squarespace.com/advisory-board">the advisory board</a> for the company, telling the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/24/elizabeth-parrish-gene-therapy-ageing"><em>Guardian</em></a> in 2016: “I advise people who need advice and they clearly need advice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Church also told us he has been a shareholder in the company, but did not immediately clarify whether he still is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Church helped initiate the Human Genome Project in 1984. Church’s was the fifth whole genome ever sequenced, and he was the first to make his DNA publicly available to researchers. According to <a href="https://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/">his website</a>, Church has coauthored 716 papers and confirmed to us this was his first retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from his contributions to research, Church is a serial entrepreneur and his lab has helped found <a href="https://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/newco.html">over 50 biotech companies</a>, according to his website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An astronomical society journal has issued its first retraction in its 10-year history — for work done by a NASA researcher and a high school student. The duo set out to confirm an astrophysics law using calculations that assumed the law was true.</p>



<p>The journal, <em>Research Notes of the AAS,</em> is published by the<a href="https://aas.org/"> American Astronomical Society</a>. It is not peer-reviewed, nor is it indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science. The retraction has prompted the journal to revise its policies on reviewing work before publication.</p>



<p>One of the two authors on the retracted <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad74d9">2024 article</a> is Jadon Lam, who at the time was a student at Pleasant Grove High School in Elk Grove, California. Lam is now at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena studying astrophysics, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadon-lam-6aa259313/">LinkedIn profile</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132562"></span>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve come across a young researcher who lost a paper. In 2012, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/10/19/high-school-whiz-kid-retracts-plos-one-herd-immunity-paper/">covered a case</a> of a high school student who initiated the retraction of his own work after realizing he made a mistake, a move that didn’t end up <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/12/22/retraction-paper-nathan-georgette/">hurting his future career</a> in science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Caltech <a href="https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/first-year-applicants/application-requirements">admissions website</a>, research papers are considered supplementary but can be included in applications.</p>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/jonathan/">Jonathan Jiang</a>, a researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a NASA-sponsored lab at Caltech where the collaboration took place, confirmed Lam is currently enrolled at Caltech but told Retraction Watch Lam’s admission to the university “was based solely on his academic record and overall merits.”</p>



<p>Jiang told us Lam was a “volunteer researcher driven by his curiosity in physics and astronomy” and called the article a “school project.” Lam did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad83c3">October retraction notice</a>, “the values used for the semimajor axis had, in fact, been calculated rather than being independently measured, implicitly assuming Kepler&#8217;s third law,” according to the notice. <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/orbits-and-keplers-laws/">Kepler’s Third Law</a> describes planetary orbit patterns around the sun, and in this case was applied to planets orbiting other stars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Lintott, the editor of <em>RNAAS </em>and astrophysicist at the University of Oxford in England<em>,</em> told us the journal was alerted to issues with the project after it went online, when readers started raising concerns on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://science.gmu.edu/directory/peter-plavchan">Peter Plavchan</a>, associate professor of physics and astronomy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, <a href="https://x.com/PlavchanPeter/status/1839666210306130211">posted on X</a> in September. When we asked Lintott if this was the thread which alerted the journal, he told us he was “pretty sure” he encountered the critiques on Bluesky. </p>



<p>&#8220;The Note compares two properties of planets &#8212; the semi-major axis and period &#8212; for a sample drawn from NASA&#8217;s Exoplanet Archive, which is a repository of data from many disparate sources,&#8221; Lintott told us. &#8220;Rather than including independent observations, the Exoplanet Archive calculates the semi-major axis for many planets from the observed period, and so what the authors had assumed was data were actually these calculated values.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lintott clarified the journal publishes “works-in-progress, negative results, short observing reports or communications which may not make a full paper, and for student projects.”&nbsp; He said he moderates the contributions, “assisted where necessary by the rest of the AAS Journals editorial board,”&nbsp; and the journal has “no filter for how notable or otherwise a result is.” The retraction was the first for the journal, which has published over 2,000 “notes,” Lintott said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also told us the journal “altered our procedure for checking archival data sources” after the retraction.</p>

                <p>We all encounter systemic challenges in our everyday research practice. From outdated assessment systems and misaligned funding models to barriers in transparency and societal impact, it&rsquo;s clear that the way we &ldquo;do&rdquo; research often falls short of its potential. Many of us carry ideas, experiences, and visions for how things could be better. What we often lack, however, are the time, tools, and support structures to actually implement change.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s exactly where the <em>Responsible Research in Action</em> unconference steps in.</p>



<p>Built on the idea that the most meaningful conversations often happen over coffee or in the corridors between sessions, unconferences flip the script of traditional events&mdash;putting informal exchange, collaboration, and peer-driven problem-solving at the center.</p>



<p><a href="https://rr-in-action2025.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Registration</a> is open for this event, which takes place in Berlin from September 22&ndash;24, 2025, the <a href="https://rr-in-action2025.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Responsible Research in Action</em></a> unconference will bring together not just researchers, but a diverse mix of funders, publishers, institutional leaders, patient representatives, and other key stakeholders. Participants will work side by side to co-create outputs and actionable solutions for more responsible, inclusive, and effective research practices.</p>



<p>The setting is equally conducive to bold thinking. Conversations will spill over from working sessions into shared meals and informal exchanges&mdash;including a networking dinner held among towering fossils in the iconic dinosaur hall of Berlin&rsquo;s Natural History Museum. In a space that holds the traces of deep time and evolution, participants will reflect on what kind of research culture they want to help shape for the future&mdash;and how we might get there together.</p>



<p>Because lasting change requires more than good ideas. It requires shared ownership, mutual understanding, and the kind of ecosystem-wide collaboration that this unconference aims to spark.</p>



<p>At the heart of the unconference are ten projects, selected through a global open call by our international program committee&mdash;comprising experts from diverse research backgrounds, including representatives from PLOS. The selected projects span a range of key challenges in research culture. Three major themes guide this year&rsquo;s work:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reproducibility</h3>



<p>Several projects focus on improving reproducibility. This includes pilot testing a checklist of core reproducibility checks, collaboratively developing a reporting guideline for reproducibility studies, and co-creating stakeholder-specific roadmaps to improve the uptake of pre-registration and reporting guidelines in biomedical research.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Research assessment reform</h3>



<p>Two projects address the challenge of how we evaluate research and researchers. One group will create a guide to help researchers and administrators address common objections to research assessment reform, based on existing evidence. The second group will focus on misaligned incentives. Rewards and incentives for researchers often reward undesirable behaviors, while encouraging problematic ones. Participants will address this problem by collaboratively developing use cases to help academics apply a value-based evaluation framework across different disciplines and evaluation settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Improving research culture</h3>



<p>Participants will co-create a roadmap to implement <a href="https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/a-vision-framework-for-research-cultures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science Europe&rsquo;s proposed vision</a> for improving research culture, by participating in a highly interactive design-thinking workshop.</p>



<p>A full list of the ten projects, along with short video presentations, is available <a href="https://rr-in-action2025.org/registration-and-presentation-of-the-available-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Each project brings together participants from multiple sectors of the research landscape, ensuring solutions are co-created with the diverse perspectives they need to succeed&mdash;right from the start.</p>



<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a researcher, funder, publisher, policymaker, or community representative, the Responsible Research in Action Unconference offers a unique chance to step out of your silo, join forces, and help shape a more trustworthy, transparent, and impactful research system.</p>



<p>Beyond producing concrete outputs, participants can expect to walk away with a new international network of peers committed to driving change across the research ecosystem. Refined skills in design thinking and how to drive behavior change, honed through dedicated workshops held during the event.</p>



<p>This event is hosted by the QUEST Center for Responsible Research at the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) at the Charit&eacute; in Berlin, the Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research, and the EXCELScIOR ERA Chair at the University of Coimbra &mdash; with funding kindly provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Berlin University Alliance (BUA).</p>

<p>The U.S. Office of Research Integrity has barred a former lab technician at Washington State University from participating in federally funded research for three years after finding he had committed misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The case dates back more than five years. Ryan Evanoff was a scientific assistant in the Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology at the university’s Pullman campus. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/16/caught-in-the-act-veterinary-researcher-caught-fabricating-gene-data-resigns-from-university-job/">we reported in 2020</a>, colleagues in the department had discovered he had been fabricating gene sequence data. The falsified data led to the retraction of <a href="https://beva.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evj.13092">two</a> <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01963-20">papers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A draft of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/01/13/exclusive-how-a-researcher-faked-data-and-gaslit-a-labmate-for-years/">the university’s investigation</a> obtained through a public records request stated Evanoff engaged in “a repeated and measurable pattern of research material manipulation, changing of data, omission of critical research procedures and findings in lab notebooks, and making up data and results” from at least 2015 through 2019, when he left the university.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132555"></span>



<p>“This is an old story that was covered extensively years ago,” Robert Mealey, chair of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences at WSU, told Retraction Watch. “I am glad ORI completed their investigation and published their results to finally close the book on it.”</p>



<p><a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-evanoff-ryan">The finding</a> is only the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/03/18/liping-zhang-baylor-college-medicine-ori-debarment-image-manipulation/">second</a> ORI has released this year. The office <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case_summary">released</a> six rulings in 2024 and 10 in 2023. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/27/exclusive-us-federal-research-integrity-departures-ori-nsf-oig/">reported earlier this year</a> that ORI and the National Science Foundation’s Office of Inspector General had several personnel changes as a result of mass firings of probationary employees and people taking voluntary buyouts. ORI’s staff page <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/ori-staff">remains missing</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI also did not respond to a request for comment on this case and why it took so long to issue the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Evanoff’s misconduct came to light after a postdoc in the lab noticed her results and Evanoff’s weren’t lining up, the university&#8217;s report stated.</p>



<p>She noticed “Mr. Evanoff was generating a significant amount of research data that was not consistent with the hours of laboratory work he was putting in,” the report stated. The postdoc, whose name was redacted in the report, took these and other concerns to supervisors in the department, who were able to confirm Evanoff fabricated sequencing results for a specific study. </p>



<p>But the committee’s investigation found evidence of fabrication that went far beyond that one instance, finding “Mr. Evanoff’s deception was systematic and over several years and several projects.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation found Evanoff fabricated plasmid sequencing data, peptide sequences, T-cell response data, data related to metabolic pathways for maladaptation to training syndrome in horses, and more. The committee also found his lab notebooks were “almost useless.” The report stated: “His lack of stewardship in keeping useful and reliable lab notebooks and documenting his daily research efforts … is a form of misconduct that lies outside the realm of proper lab practices.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After leaving the university, Evanoff received a master’s degree in teaching, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-evanoff-754a32210/">LinkedIn</a> profile. He is now a teacher at Clarkston High School, according to the <a href="https://www.csdk12.org/staff?id=1102869">district’s website</a>. Evanoff did not reply to an emailed request for comment or a message sent via LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university’s report had a pointed conclusion about the consequences of Evanoff’s misconduct: “Falsification and fabrication of data and materials especially negatively impacted the career of [the postdoc] and her work related to hepacivirus,” the report stated. The postdoc “will leave the … lab after four years of research effort without a single publication in this area as a postdoctoral fellow.”</p>



<p>Mealey told us he has stayed in contact with the postdoc, and was able to share some good news. “She recently obtained a full-time assistant professor faculty position, so she has definitely landed on her feet and has been very successful despite the setback,” Mealey said.</p>

                <p>A new <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420092122"><em>PNAS</em> study</a> uses openly available articles to map the scale of paper mill and peer review ring activity across scholarly publishing. Three facts give essential context:</p>



<p>1 An industry-wide threat, not a PLOS-specific problem</p>



<p>Paper mills have challenged many publishers for years. PLOS counters them through rigorous pre- and post-publication checks and joint initiatives with COPE, the STM Integrity Hub, and United2Act. The <em>PNAS</em> findings expand the toolbox for detecting misconduct and confirm why collective action remains vital.</p>



<p>2&nbsp; Openness made the analysis possible</p>



<p>The authors focused on <em>PLOS One </em>for a case study because we publish rich, machine-readable metadata&mdash;including the handling editor for every article. Transparency is a deliberate feature of our open science mission: scrutiny strengthens integrity.<strong><br></strong></p>



<p>3&nbsp; Our actions to safeguard research integrity</p>



<p>The <em>PNAS</em> case study includes issues PLOS had already acted on through prior investigations into paper mill activity and peer review manipulation, including editor&ndash;author networks. These earlier actions led to the removal of editors from our boards and the retraction of affected articles before the study&rsquo;s publication.</p>



<p>PLOS continuously strengthens its integrity screening in response to emerging risks. Enhancements made between 2021 and 2025 have enabled <em>PLOS One</em> to identify and decline concerning submissions before publication, and this work is ongoing as we continue to evolve our safeguards to address new and emerging threats.</p>



<p>Editorial board integrity is safeguarded through careful vetting of members. Manuscripts are assigned to editors via industry standard algorithms or by experienced staff; Authors cannot select editors to handle their submissions and concerns about editor conduct are investigated promptly and addressed decisively.</p>



<p><strong>Our commitment</strong><br>PLOS is committed to improving the ways in which research is discovered, assessed and recognized for its academic rigor, transparency, and utility to the broader scholarly community.We will continue to refine our safeguards, share best practice with the wider community, and keep stakeholders informed of significant developments. We thank the <em>PNAS</em> authors for leveraging PLOS&rsquo; open data to advance joint defences against organised research fraud.</p>

                Researchers utilize calcium imaging to track neuronal activity in the brain, highlighting the role of calcium as a signaling molecule. Recent studies investigate intracellular calcium dynamics, particularly its coupling between organelles and its influence on synaptic plasticity in dendrites. Findings emphasize the necessity of in vivo methods for accurate insights into neuronal behavior. <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/08/11/interesting-papers-on-the-role-of-cell-organelles-in-neuronal-dendrites-for-calcium-signaling/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

<p>A governmental ministry in Bulgaria has concluded a dean at Sofia University is not guilty of plagiarism. But it appears the inquiries might not be complete.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/10/dean-in-bulgaria-accused-of-plagiarism/">we reported</a> in December, <a href="https://scholar.google.bg/citations?user=TpJ45YkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Milen Zamfirov</a>, dean of the faculty of educational sciences at the university, had been accused of plagiarism in a 2021 paper that “seems to have significant overlap” with two other works. In February, two researchers <a href="https://www.dnevnik.bg/obrazovanie/2025/02/25/4747574_dekanut_v_sofiiskiia_universitet_milen_zamfirov_e/">filed a complaint</a> to the country’s Ministry of Education and Science, alleging Zamfirov plagiarized other works in multiple papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ministry assigned three reviewers to assess the articles in question, all of whom are identified only by initials <a href="https://www.mon.bg/nfs/2025/07/signal_vh94-571_07.02.2025_09072025.pdf">in its report</a>, released July 9.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132539"></span>



<p>The first reviewer determined Zamfirov was guilty of plagiarism and self-plagiarism, according to the document, while the second and third evaluators disagreed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://ecatalog.nbu.bg/default.asp?V_Year=2025&amp;PageShow=teacherpresent&amp;P_Menu=teachers&amp;Fac_ID=2&amp;P_ID=1354&amp;T_ID=5072&amp;l=0">Hristo Chukurliev</a>, a researcher of foreign languages and cultures at New Bulgarian University in Sofia, confirmed to Retraction Watch he was one of the reviewers of the ministry probe. Chukurliev’s initials indicate he was one of the reviewers who found Zamfirov to be not guilty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a translation of the report, Chukurliev argued there wasn’t sufficient grounds to conclude plagiarism had occurred. He also stated the complaint itself was “contrary to academic practice,” suggesting&nbsp; the complainants should have established if plagiarism had occurred and had external experts confirm it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do not know the content of the other two reviews and cannot comment on any differences,” Chukurliev told us in an email. “I do not know Prof. Zamfirov or the authors of the complaint, and I am not affiliated with the institution they are connected to.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chukurliev says he does not know whether the ministry is taking any further steps in Zamfirov’s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when we reached out to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bozhidar-Angelov">Bojidar Angelov</a>, also based at Sofia University, to ask about the case, he told us he couldn’t comment, as an investigation by the ministry’s academic ethics commission “is ongoing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, a supreme administrative court ruled that the country’s Ministry of Education and Science had terminated multiple plagiarism investigations on incorrect legal grounds, <a href="https://www.dnevnik.bg/obrazovanie/2025/06/12/4775700_potvurdeno_ot_suda_ministerstvo_blokiralo_proverkite/84623f667d2c441b5fcd9df61818eef4/">Bulgarian media reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last May, the Ministry of Education and Science <a href="https://www.bta.bg/en/news/bulgaria/672653-pythagoras-science-awards-presented-in-sofia">honored Zamfirov</a> with a plaque, diploma and a cash prize 8,000 BGN (US $4,300) as part of the agency’s prestigious Pythagoras Science Awards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zamfirov has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>
