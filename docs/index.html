<p>The year 2026 did not start off kindly for <a href="https://rvu.edu.in/team/dr-vijayalakshmi-s/">Vijayalakshmi S</a>, an economics researcher at RV University in Bengaluru, India. She received a rejection letter from a journal noting that a paper of hers was highly similar to another published study by other researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>S couldn’t understand why that was — until she realised someone had somehow gotten hold of her study and published it as their own. She <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/drvijayalakshmis_retract-academicintegrity-academictheft-ugcPost-7413514795720716288-vKpV/">took to LinkedIn</a>, expressing her concerns and tagging the authors responsible. The post attracted a comment from another individual, also based in India, with inside knowledge of how paper mills work. Using keywords from S’s study, he found reasons to believe authorship slots on the stolen paper had been sold on Telegram for less than $200 each.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After S’s LinkedIn post went live, she heard from someone apologizing on behalf of a researcher who had allegedly mistakenly published her paper as a coauthor. That person was now offering her a different study on a related topic that she could publish under her name.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134010"></span>



<p>“I was shocked to my core,” S told Retraction Watch. “He is telling me that he will give me a paper in exchange.” S disclosed the emails in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413915601611440128/">separate LinkedIn post</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years earlier, in January 2024, S had submitted the study to <em>Discover Energy</em>, which ultimately rejected her paper during peer review, suggesting revisions. She also later presented it at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay’s (IIT Bombay) Young Scholar Initiative Conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know where this paper was leaked,” S said. She had decided against posting the paper as a preprint due to concerns that “blinded” peer reviewers who might later referee her manuscript at a journal could find out her identity. </p>



<p>We contacted IIT Bombay for a comment but have received no response. Tim Kersjes, research integrity manager at Springer Nature, which publishes <em>Discover Energy</em>, said the publisher is investigating the concerns S raised.</p>



<p>In April 2024 – three months after S had submitted her paper to the Springer Nature journal – someone submitted the study to EnPress Publisher’s <a href="https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/jipd"><em>Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development</em></a> (<em>JIPD</em>). It was <a href="https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/jipd/article/viewFile/5939/3988">published</a> in September 2024, listing authors based at institutions in Oman, India, and Saudi Arabia. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/30/in-four-years-a-psychosocial-counselor-co-authored-seven-papers-on-disparate-medical-topics-how/">Retraction Watch</a> and others have reported, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00344-w">unlikely co-authorship networks</a> can indicate the activity of&nbsp; <a href="https://cen.acs.org/research-integrity/One-academic-papers-journey-through/101/i29">paper mills</a>, which churn out subpar or plagiarized studies, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/russian-website-peddles-authorships-linked-reputable-journals">sell authorship slots</a>, and artificially inflate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01672-7">citations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2025, Scopus <a href="https://www.enpress-publisher.com/journal/JIPD/760/169#:~:text=Indexing%20of%20JIPD-,View%20All,longer%20be%20indexed%20in%20Scopus.">stopped indexing <em>JIPD</em></a>. Some observers <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_the_Journal_of_Infrastructure_Policy_and_Development_a_predatory_journal">have suggested</a> that may be because the journal has recently had a sudden surge in the number of papers it is publishing — often seen as a sign of lowering standards for publication.</p>



<p>S didn’t know that the <em>JIPD</em> paper presenting her work had gone live until she resubmitted her paper to a different journal. The editor there rejected it, noting that it had too many similarities to the <em>JIPD</em> paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After being pointed to the publication, S went through the whole article line by line and realised that every single data point she had used, all the literature she referenced, and the citations she included were the same. “This is not their paper at all,” she said. “This is my paper, which I have written without anybody’s help.”</p>



<p>S is now calling for the <em>JIPD </em>paper to be retracted. We reached out to one of <em>JIPD</em>’s associate editors, <a href="https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/jipd/about/editorialBoard">Jun Xie</a>, who is the president of the Asian Digital Development Bank and president of the Asia-Pacific Investment Development Bank, for a comment but didn’t hear back.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://ccba.du.edu.om/mohammed-ahmar-uddin/">Mohammed Ahmar Uddin</a> of Dhofar University in Salalah, Oman, who is listed as the first author on the <em>JIPD </em>paper, told us the study was checked for plagiarism before publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The data used in the research were publicly available from government sources,” Uddin said. “Furthermore, several published research studies are already available related to this topic and our research was aimed at providing additional insights. Upon receiving the complaint I have also written to the journal and [am] awaiting their reply.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with us, Uddin denied that he bought an authorship slot on the paper or being in touch with any paper mill. Uddin said he doesn’t know any of the listed coauthors and was introduced to them via a mutual researcher contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“On my part, I assure you that I am capable enough and would never consider publishing a paper by dubious means,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The man who discovered that S’s paper was probably sold on Telegram knew about paper mills because he had had personal experience with one. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashutosh-ind/?originalSubdomain=in">Ashutosh Tiwari</a>, who runs the counseling firm <a href="https://mindglass.in/">Mindglass WellBeing</a>, told us that after he saw S’s post about her study having been stolen, he searched keywords from the <em>JIPD </em>paper on Telegram and <a href="https://t.me/paperpublicationopportunity">found a matching advertisement</a> dated December 29. Authorship slots had been sold for 15,000 Indian rupees (INR; around $165) for first author, 15,000 INR ($110) for second author, and 5,000 INR ($55) for the remaining slots, Tiwari said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tiwari knew about the inner workings of paper mills because he had previously himself used the services of such a shady service without realising it was unethical. Although the paper Tiwari ultimately published was his own, he paid 10,000 INR with the hope of receiving help in publishing quickly in a journal indexed by Scopus.</p>



<p>“I was not guided in the family, in my friend circle, [on] how to write, [or] how to submit,” he said. Tiwari ultimately retracted that study and republished it after revisions in a different journal. “That was a fast process because I requested them that it is a matter of my Ph.D.,” he said.</p>

The Institutional Award went to the <strong>Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative</strong>, a nationwide effort to systematically evaluate research results in laboratory biology and the largest coordinated replication effort in the field worldwide, showcasing the transformative potential of country-level research improvement efforts. The Early Career Award was won by <strong>Maximilian Sprang </strong>for his project <strong><em>Erring Rigorously</em></strong>, which improves reproducibility in functional genomics by distinguishing true biological signals from technical errors in high-throughput sequencing.</p>

                Imagine two children born in the same year, into families with similar incomes, but living in US states where income is distributed very differently. One grows up where income is fairly evenly distributed; the other where a small portion of people hold most of the wealth. According to a new analysis of brain scans from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, this broader social environment — measured with each state’s Gini coefficient — is linked to notable differences in...

</div>


<p>Mike Rossner had never seen anything like it. At first, the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PubPeer-comment-1.jpg">anonymous comment on PubPeer</a>, which claimed a lane of a western blot in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-019-0309-0">a research paper</a> had been duplicated, seemed nothing out of the ordinary to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-rossner-a3731a6">Rossner</a>, who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/24/dont-trust-an-image-a-new-company-can-help/">specializes in detecting image manipulation</a> in biomedical research. The surprise came when he looked closer at the magnified images the commenter had provided to support their allegation.</p>



<p>While the two enlarged lanes in the anonymous comment were indeed identical to each other, close inspection of the original image from the paper, which the comment included, clearly showed two different lanes. It wasn’t hard to see how the fakery had been achieved: A single lane had been copied and pasted on top of an adjacent lane.</p>



<p>“I have looked at thousands of PubPeer allegations, and this is the first time I have come across what appear to be fabricated allegations,” Rossner told us.</p>



<span id="more-133974"></span>



<p>Intrigued, Rossner searched for other posts by the same person, who had commented under the pseudonym Ecionemia acervus. He found several. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PubPeer-comment-2.jpg">two of</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PubPeer-comment-3-scaled.jpg">them</a>, the commenter again appeared to have fabricated the supporting evidence, as Rossner described in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Fabricated_PubPeer_Allegations.pdf">a short report</a> detailing his analysis.</p>



<p>The three fake comments all targeted papers by the same senior researcher, <a href="https://pure.kaist.ac.kr/en/persons/byung-hyun-park/">Byung-Hyun Park</a>, a professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology in Daejeon, South Korea. Park is a corresponding author or coauthor on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22Byung-Hyun+Park%22">16 articles</a> that have been flagged on PubPeer.</p>



<p>Park told us he was aware of the comments but had “no knowledge of who made these allegations and no interest in their identity.”</p>



<p>“The National Research Foundation of Korea has reviewed the original uncropped Western blot data for the papers in question and found no evidence of data manipulation,” Park said. “We have also recently received an inquiry from [the <em>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology</em>], and our university has initiated an official investigation into this matter and all related PubPeer comments. We will fully cooperate with this process.” One of the fabricated comments was directed against <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jasn/fulltext/2025/07000/p21_activated_kinase_4_and_ischemic_acute_kidney.7.aspx">a paper</a> in the <em>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology</em>, which has also been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4845B87A19412034DAE2E95110C67D#2">flagged by another commenter.</a>.</p>



<p>Park added that, “for the papers for which I am responsible, I am able to provide clarification and respond to most of the concerns raised. I will determine whether retraction is warranted based on the findings of the ongoing investigation.”</p>



<p>All of the allegations Rossner traced to the anonymous commenter were directed toward papers by either Park or <a href="http://www.erstresslab.com/aboutus.php">Han-Jung Chae</a>, a professor and dean at Jeonbuk National University in Jeonju, where Park worked until 2023. Chae, who has had <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22Han-Jung+Chae%22">nearly three dozen papers flagged</a> on PubPeer, did not reply to a request for comment.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/10/wafik-el-deiry-nci-director-candidate-science-guardians-twitter-pubpeer-sleuths/">some </a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/04/cyberstalking-pits-harvard-professor-against-pubpeer/">researchers</a> have worried about sleuthing being “weaponized,” Rossner said he wasn’t certain what to make of the fake claims he found.</p>



<p>“This case is particularly strange, because there are numerous allegations by this person (under the same pseudonym and other pseudonyms) that appear to be legitimate,” he wrote in an email. “Why would this person make up just a few allegations when there are already many allegations made against this author that appear to be legitimate?”</p>



<p>PubPeer deleted the cooked-up allegations after we contacted them for this story. (Disclosure: Retraction Watch’s cofounder Ivan Oransky sits on PubPeer’s board of directors but is not involved in the site’s operations.)</p>



<p>“The images in the comments appear to be quite carefully designed to mislead our moderators,” a PubPeer spokesperson who wishes to remain anonymous told us. “The true images were sufficiently small and low-resolution such that the moderators did not notice the difference. Such misleading comments are, naturally, forbidden on PubPeer and we have disabled them.”</p>



<p>“Although such bad-faith comments are very rare,” the spokesperson added, “our moderators try to be alert to the possibility when checking comments before they appear and will react very promptly when alerted to potential problems in posts already made public.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://bjoern.brembs.net/2026/01/retraction-data-are-still-useless-almost/">Retraction data are still useless – almost</a></h4>

              
                <p>Retractions of scholarly articles are a rare event, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10485848/">affecting</a> only about 0.02-0.04% of articles in total (but yearly rates are <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty">going up</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00455-y">dramatically</a>). This means that data about retractions are not even close to being representative of the scholarly literature at large. In particular, when the non-retracted literature contains anything from 40% to over 80% of <a href="https://bjoern.brembs.net/2024/02/how-reliable-is-the-scholarly-literature/">unreliable work</a>, even today&#8217;s retraction rates of around 0.2% or so seem totally negligible, in the grand scheme of things. After all, what is worse: a literature where 0.04% of articles are clearly marked as unreliable, or one where 40-80% of articles are equally unreliable, but completely unmarked?</p>



<p>Then again, one the one hand, some retractions can be high-profile and draw public attention to a science scandal, and on the other hand, despite their tiny numbers, retraction data have been analyzed and it was found that, e.g., articles from <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/iai.05661-11">higher ranking journals</a> and those with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335059">male corresponding authors</a> tend to be marred by higher than average retraction rates.</p>



<p>It is understandable why such findings catch attention, despite the statistically negligible retraction rates. In addition to the tiny numbers, another aspect that makes retraction data so useless is that it is exceedingly difficult to tease apart if high retraction rates are due to increased scrutiny (i.e., detection) or overall lower quality. It is no surprise, therefore, that both <a href="https://bjoern.brembs.net/2015/06/are-more-retractions-due-to-more-scrutiny/">high-ranking</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2014.15951">journals </a>and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03796-w">male authors </a>defended themselves by exclaiming (without evidence) that their publications were scrutinized more, hence the increased retractions.</p>



<p>Mirroring previous discussions where the evidence suggested that increased retraction rates at more prestigious journals was likely not due to more scrutiny, but due to <a href="https://bjoern.brembs.net/2015/06/are-more-retractions-due-to-more-scrutiny/">lower quality work</a> being published there, new evidence also points to the science published by women being held to a higher standard and hence receiving fewer retractions for quality reasons. </p>



<p>Two arguments have recently been published, supporting the notion that female authors publish higher quality work than male authors. The first is more like an anecdote from a single journal: <em>Nature </em>magazine finds that they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00640-5">reject</a> more work from female authors, suggesting they hold them to a higher standard than men. This year, in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003574">proper study</a> of the biomedical literature, it was found that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>By analyzing all articles indexed in the PubMed database (>36.5 million articles published in >36,000 biomedical and life sciences journals), we show that the median amount of time spent under review is 7.4%–14.6% longer for female-authored articles than for male-authored articles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So now we have two areas where it seems that increased retraction rates are likely not due to increased scrutiny of published articles, but, rather, due to lower quality publications. I would still not bet that these data will help sway any of the &#8220;increased scrutiny&#8221; proponents.</p>

</div>


<p><em>Science</em> has issued a permanent expression of concern for a paper reporting a meta-analysis of a database including studies critics have said were “experimentally manipulated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aee6983">notice</a>, published today, applies to a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax9931">2020 meta-analysis</a> measuring population patterns of freshwater and terrestrial insects and predicting what might drive changes in population numbers. According to the notice, the move comes after critics raised concerns about a database, called InsectChange, on which the meta-analysis was based. The database itself was <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3354">published in 2021 in <em>Ecology</em></a>, a journal of the Ecological Society of America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Science</em> article has been cited 820 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The <em>Ecology</em> paper has been cited 23 times.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133983"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.idiv.de/staff/roel-van-klink/">Roel van Klink</a>, a researcher with the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, was the lead and corresponding author for the <em>Ecology</em> paper on InsectChange. He does not agree with the expression of concern and told us in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Van-Klink-full-email-1-20-26-.pdf">written statement</a> he did not agree with critics’ assessments. He said the dispute was largely over inclusion criteria – for example, whether it was appropriate to include studies in which researchers manipulated the environments or studies of environments that had been recently changed by invasive species.</p>



<p>“What is also unclear til this day is whether different choices of inclusion criteria would have led to different outcomes” in the meta-analysis, he said. “I would have loved to see a counter analysis based on a different data selection, but that has also not happened during these 5+ years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7647-7321">Laurence Gaume</a> and <a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/marion-desquilbet">Marion Desquilbet</a>, along with eight others, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd8947">critiqued the meta-analysis</a> in a comment published in <em>Science</em> in December 2020, eight months after the publication of the paper. “No attempt was made to weight studies according to their representativeness in terms of geographic location, anthropogenic impact (including farming methods and pesticide use), protected status, or insect assemblages,” they wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaume, a researcher at the University of Montpellier in France, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Full-statement-Gaume_Desquilbet-1-22-26.pdf">told us</a> this week that the submitted comment had “prompted a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf1915">minimalist erratum</a>” of the <em>Science</em> report, published in October 2020. She and Desquilbet, an economics researcher at the Toulouse School of Economics in France, wrote a much more extensive <a href="https://peercommunityjournal.org/articles/10.24072/pcjournal.469/">critique in <em>Peer Community Journal</em></a> about the post-corrected version. That piece was published in 2024.</p>



<p>The “vast majority of problems we presented require a complete restructuring of the database of the meta-analysis,” Gaume said. She told us the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Full-statement-Gaume_Desquilbet-1-22-26.pdf">statement</a> she emailed Retraction Watch was cosigned by Desquilbet.</p>



<p>Desquilbet and Gaume wrote in their critique that “in more than half of the original studies, the factors investigated were experimentally manipulated or were strong — often not natural — disturbances.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two pointed to errors in insect count and sampling bias, among other issues. They say they uncovered over 500 mistakes with InsectChange’s methodology and statistical analyses, as BBC’s <em>Science Focus</em> <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/comment/insect-decline-worse">reported last year</a>.</p>



<p>“We argue that the datasets selected by the authors to build their database are not representative of the diversity of insect living conditions around the world and that the database is biased and cannot serve to estimate insect change,” Gaume continued.</p>



<p>Other critics flagged issues with the database <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wat2.1506">in <em>WIREs Water</em></a> in 2020, noting van Klink and his coauthors “suggested that water quality has been improving, thereby challenging recent reports documenting drastic global declines in freshwater biodiversity.” Those critics argued the results of the meta-analysis “should not be considered indicative of an overall improvement in the condition of freshwater ecosystems.”</p>



<p>Gaume said a retraction of the <em>Science </em>paper was warranted, but said the expression of concern was “better than nothing.” She also said she believed <em>Science</em> should have addressed the issue in 2020, when the first critique was published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from <em>Science </em>told us the new expression of concern on the paper will be permanent and “has the goal of alerting potential users to ensure they use the most up to date version.” They said they do not plan on looking into any other papers using the InsectChange database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaume expressed&nbsp; unhappiness with the decision. “Marion [Desquilbet] and I are shocked by the way <em>Science</em> is ‘kicking the can down the road’ by essentially referring the problem back to the database, which is supposedly either fixed or in the process of being fixed, while the biased results of the meta-analysis are not being questioned and continue to be cited and influence public opinion, conveying a reassuring message on insects,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: One sentence of this article was slightly amended on Jan. 23, 2026, to clarify the timing of Gaume and Desquilbet&#8217;s critique. The original read: &#8220;She said none of the issues they had identified in 2020 was addressed in the erratum, prompting her and Desquilbet&#8230;to write a much more extensive critique&#8230;&#8221; The sentence now reads, &#8220;She and Desquilbet wrote a much more extensive critique&#8230;&#8221; The full statement is available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Full-statement-Gaume_Desquilbet-1-22-26.pdf">here</a> and linked above. </em></p>
