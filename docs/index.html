              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/obesity-semaglutide-wegovy-heart-attack-stroke">The weight loss drug Wegovy lowered heart attack risk in a large trial</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PHILADELPHIA ­</strong>—&nbsp;At the recent American Heart Association meeting, a cavernous room full of doctors erupted into applause. Cleveland Clinic cardiologist A. Michael Lincoff had just presented the dramatic&nbsp;—&nbsp;and at times enigmatic&nbsp;—&nbsp;results of a new clinical trial on the weight loss drug semaglutide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drug, sold under the brand name Wegovy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/?_ga=2.241453762.1720669771.1692203876-1411015482.1692203876#!/10871/presentation/16575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut patients’ risk of major cardiovascular problems</a>&nbsp;by 20 percent, Lincoff reported November 11. It also reduced the risk of dying&nbsp;—&nbsp;from any cause&nbsp;—&nbsp;over the roughly 40 months patients participated in the study on average.</p>





<p>Lincoff’s work notches yet another role for semaglutide, which doctors currently use to treat diabetes and obesity. Previous work had already uncovered a cardiovascular benefit in people with type 2 diabetes. The new study, which targeted overweight or obese patients with cardiovascular disease, is the first to show that semaglutide can help the hearts of people without diabetes too.</p>



<p>That’s important because it expands the number of people who could benefit from the drug, says Tiffany Powell-Wiley, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the National&nbsp;Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. In the United States alone, more than 6 million obese or overweight people have cardiovascular disease but not diabetes. Semaglutide could be a game changer for these people, says Powell-Wiley, who was not part of the new trial. Still, she and others at the meeting recognized the limitations of the study&nbsp;—&nbsp;and the limitations of the drug.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As much as we may want a quick fix for the rising levels of obesity seen around the world, Powell-Wiley says, “it’s important to understand that this isn’t the panacea.” We still don’t know how well semaglutide works in a diverse group of people, she says. And the drug doesn’t fix the&nbsp;societal, environmental and social factors that lead to obesity — and its potential health consequences — in the first place.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Semaglutide reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke and death</h4>



<p>Semaglutide is one among a family of drugs gaining popularity for treating obesity. On November 8, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-medication-chronic-weight-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved&nbsp;a new one</a>: tirzepatide, a relative of semaglutide that goes by the brand name Zepbound.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic-strokes-heart#faq">[See also:&nbsp;<strong>Semaglutide FAQ</strong>&nbsp;]</a></p>



<p>Semaglutide, sold under the brand name Ozempic, first came on the market for treating diabetes in 2017. Since then, the drug’s slew of uses has kept growing. In 2020, the FDA OK’d it for cutting cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes and heart disease. And in 2021, treatment for obesity (with the higher dose Wegovy) joined the list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lincoff’s semaglutide trial, called SELECT, included more than 17,000 people, half of whom received weekly injections of semaglutide for roughly three years; the other half got a placebo.&nbsp;By the end of the trial, 8 percent of the people in the placebo group had had a nonfatal stroke or heart attack or died due to cardiovascular causes. That number&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped to 6.5 percent in the semaglutide group</a>, Lincoff reported at the meeting and online November 11 in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk reduction</h3>



<p>In a trial of 17,000 adults, those taking the drug Wegovy were less likely to experience nonfatal heart attacks, nonfatal heart strokes or death due to cardiovascular causes than those taking a placebo. This reduction in risk occurred early in the trial — before participants had lost a lot of weight. That suggests the drug may somehow be boosting heart health directly.</p>

<p>The difference between the two groups may not sound like much, but “it’s a massive result,” says Amit Khera, a cardiologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas who was not part of the trial. One can’t underestimate the importance of finding a new treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The illness is “the largest source of mortality in the world,” Lincoff said at a news conference on November 10, and there’s no single therapy that can eliminate it. Instead, doctors try to chip away at it with various treatments that offer incremental benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For overweight or obese people with heart disease, Khera says, semaglutide is another tool in cardiologists’ toolkits.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Questions remain about how the drug works — and for whom</h4>



<p>The new study results flesh out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic-strokes-heart#faq">earlier news of the trial released by funder Novo Nordisk in August</a>&nbsp;<em>(SN: 8/29/23</em>). At the time, doctors wanted to know who the drug helped, how it worked and what side effects it set off. The latest report offers answers to some questions but kicks others wide open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants on semaglutide were slightly more likely to drop out of the trial than those taking the placebo. That difference seemed to be driven by the drug’s gastrointestinal side effects, which include nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. The number of serious issues that occurred, like cancer or infection, was slightly lower in the semaglutide group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though semaglutide offered clear cardiovascular benefits for patients, one mysterious aspect of the data snagged researchers’ attention. The drug’s protective effects became apparent early in the trial&nbsp;—&nbsp;well before participants had shed lots of pounds.</p>



<p>That’s a big deal because it suggests semaglutide may be boosting heart health directly, perhaps in addition to the typical benefits that accompany weight loss, says&nbsp;Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. She was not involved in the study but is on Novo Nordisk’s scientific advisory board. Lincoff said his team is “working feverishly” on analyzing the SELECT data to better understand semaglutide’s actions.</p>



<p>Those data include demographic and medical information on thousands of trial participants. But the trial does have one “huge limitation,” says Powell-Wiley: 84 percent of the study’s participants were white and 72 percent were men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expanding the diversity of people represented in clinical trials like these is crucial, she said. It’s a point she brought up in a panel discussion after Lincoff’s talk, and one that — like the trial’s results — garnered widespread applause. In the United States, African-American, Hispanic and Indigenous people are most impacted by obesity, Powell-Wiley says, and the new trial doesn’t tell us much about how semaglutide works in those groups.</p>

<p>A former PhD student at Auburn University in Alabama relabeled and reused images inappropriately in a grant application, published paper, and several presentations, a U.S. government watchdog has found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Office of Research Integrity says Sarah Elizabeth Martin “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally or knowingly falsifying and/or fabricating experimental data and results obtained under different experimental conditions,” according to a <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/case-summary-martin-sarah-elizabeth">case summary</a> posted online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The published paper, “<a href="https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/27/9/1102.short">The m6A landscape of polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA and its related methylome in the context of KSHV replication</a>,” appeared online in advance of publication in <em>RNA</em> in June 2021. The journal <a href="https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/28/2/274.full">retracted</a> the article last year, with the following notice:</p>



<span id="more-128267"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>RNA</em> is retracting the above-mentioned article because the authors have lost confidence in the validity of some of the data and conclusions drawn from them. This action has been agreed to by all of the authors. The authors regret any inconvenience that this has caused to the scientific community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited a total of nine times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science, seven of the citations coming after the retraction.</p>



<p>ORI’s findings include an extensive and detailed list of images Martin reused and relabeled to represent different experiments, including original gel images in PowerPoint presentations she provided to <em>RNA</em> to support her data. </p>



<p>We sent an email requesting comment to Martin’s Auburn email address and did not immediately receive a response or a bounce back. Martin’s former advisor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-sztuba-soli%C5%84ska-phd-18830094/">Joanna Sztuba-Solińska</a>, was the principal investigator on the grant application ORI said contained fake data. That grant garnered $188,451 in funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Sztuba-Solińska now works in vaccine development at Pfizer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martin agreed to a three-year ban from all federal contracting, including grant funding, as well as a two-year supervision period for any federally-funded research to begin after the ban lapses. During the five-year period, Martin may not serve in any advisory or consulting role with the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the National Institutes of Health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-scans-how-teens-handle-pandemic-stress">Brain scans give clues to how teens handle pandemic stress</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON </strong>— Brain scans could be used to predict how teenagers’ mental health will fare during a stressful time, an analysis that spanned the COVID-19 pandemic suggests.</p>



<p>The findings, presented November 13 in a news briefing at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, may help explain <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10892/presentation/22261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why some people succumb to stress</a> while others are more resilient.</p>



<p>For a lot of research, “the study happens, and you report on the results, and that’s about it,” says Margot Wagner, a bioengineer at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved in the new work. But this research followed hundreds of teenagers over time, a study design that “means you can intervene and help way sooner than otherwise,” Wagner says.</p>





<p>The pandemic was particularly tough for many teenagers, as isolation, worry and upheaval of daily routines affected them in ways that scientists are just now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-prematurely-aged-teens-brains">starting to see</a> (<em>SN: 1/3/23</em>). A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boys-experience-depression-differently-girls">record number of young people</a> are struggling with depression and anxiety, a mental health crisis that some scientists are calling “the second pandemic” (<em>SN: 6/30/23</em>).</p>



<p>While many teenagers struggled during the pandemic, others did OK. Computational neuroscientist Caterina Stamoulis of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital investigated why responses differed using data collected as part of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development, or ABCD, study. That larger study — involving scientists at 21 research sites across the United States — aims to figure out how teenagers’ brains grow over the years.</p>



<p>“This is the first time in history we’re looking at thousands of participants and getting these measures over time,” Wagner says. “It’s truly remarkable.”</p>



<p>The ABCD study, begun in 2015, was well under way when COVID hit, so researchers possessed brain scans from before the pandemic. “Without the pandemic, we would not have been able to understand the impact of a long-lasting adverse event” that deeply affected the participants’ lives, changing their interactions with their family and friends, Stamoulis says.</p>



<p>At the outset of the project, fMRI brain scans measured blood flow — a proxy for brain cell activity — in 1,414 teenagers, a subset of the more than 11,000 adolescents enrolled in the ABCD study. The fMRI images recorded how certain regions of the brain behave in tandem with each other, a clue that those regions work together in what neuroscientists call a brain circuit.</p>



<p>“Neuroimaging data is particularly useful for developing predictive models of future outcomes,” says neuroscientist and engineer Vince Calhoun of Georgia Tech, “including resilience to stress, depression and many other things.”</p>



<p>In May 2020, as the world shut down, researchers started surveying the teenagers in the study about how they were holding up. These surveys, sent every few months, measured aspects of mental health, stress and sadness, among other things.</p>



<p>Teenagers who had weaker neural connections between certain parts of the brain before the pandemic fared worse than teenagers with stronger neural connections, the team found. These brain regions included the prefrontal cortex, a brain area that gets drastically reshaped during adolescence, and the amygdala, a structure on each side of the brain that’s involved in emotions. Weaker brain connections were associated with kids having more sadness and stress during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Weaker and more fragile networks predicted harder times during the pandemic, Stamoulis says. But “stronger and more resilient brain networks predicted better mental health, lower stress and lower sadness.”</p>



<p>She and her colleagues plan to study these brain circuits as time goes on. As brains develop, they respond to experiences and environments. If those are positive, Stamoulis says, they can be “protective factors for the brain and how its circuits evolve and become wired.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/AdobeStock_610377029-1-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Oral cancer, also known as mouth cancer, refers to cancers that develop in any part of the mouth including the lips, tongue, gums, palate, inner cheeks, and minor salivary glands. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common oral cancer and ranks as a “top 10” cancer globally in the male population. Annually, approximately 370,000 new cases of oral cancer are recorded worldwide, with an incidence rate of 7.1 per 100,000 people. Moreover, approximately 200,000 deaths related to oral cancer are estimated each year, with a mortality rate of 3.8 per 100,000 people. The highest mortality rates are observed in Eastern Europe, South Asia and Southeast Asia as well as in Latin America. Incidence and mortality rates are higher in men than in women across all age groups.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13388" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13388" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-13388" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/AdobeStock_116110879-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13388" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© freshidea / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Disparities in the worldwide occurrence of this disease are primarily attributed to differences in lifestyle and exposure to risk factors, such as tobacco, alcohol, betel quid and sun exposure, in the case of lip cancer. Although it may not be as widely discussed as other types of cancer, oral cancer is a significant health issue that affects people of all ages. It not only results in significant mortality but also causes extensive facial disfigurement, loss of oral functionality (including speech and swallowing), economic and psychological burden.</p>
<h3><strong>The importance of early diagnosis</strong></h3>
<p>Early diagnosis and effective treatment play a pivotal role in improving patient outcomes and reducing the mortality rates associated with oral cancer. However, most cases are detected at a late stage, when treatment is complex, costly, and yields poor results. Early diagnosis is a cornerstone of mitigating the impact of oral cancer, but its importance is a particularly critical dimension in a global context. Access to healthcare services, awareness, and resources varies significantly from region to region. Therefore, it is paramount to develop strategies that can be effectively implemented in diverse healthcare settings to ensure equitable access to early diagnosis at a global scale.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the current perspectives on global oral health?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2015, the United Nations formulated 17 <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) within the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">Agenda 2030 Action Plan</a> to achieve peace, prosperity, and well-being for all by 2030. <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">SDG 3</a> aims to ensure a healthy life and promote well-being for people of all ages. However, achieving this goal is not possible unless countries adopt integrated approaches to address non-communicable diseases, including strategies to combat the burden of oral diseases.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/inequalities-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© Natalia / stock.adobe.com</div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, oral health is not explicitly mentioned or addressed within the context of SDG 3. Conditions such as dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer affect a staggering 3.58 billion people worldwide, making them the most common and preventable non-communicable diseases afflicting humanity, so oral health is fundamental to achieving good health and well-being and serves as the foundation for SDG 3.</p>
<p>In response to this, the International Dental Federation (FDI) and the International Association of Dental Research (IADR) have issued a <a href="https://www.fdiworlddental.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/fdi-wha72-11_4_implementation_sdgs_0.pdf">joint statement</a> advocating for the inclusion of oral health in Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interplay between oral health, general health, and overall well-being is undeniable and should not be underestimated. It is imperative to raise global awareness within the dental and oral health sciences community to prioritize oral health care, promote oral health, and ensure universal health coverage.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategies for reducing risk</strong></h3>
<p>Strategies to reduce the risk factors associated with oral cancer, such as tobacco and alcohol cessation, as well as promoting regular oral examination, must be tailored to the unique challenges faced by communities worldwide. Cultural factors, socioeconomic disparities, and healthcare infrastructure/access play a role in shaping the landscape of prevention efforts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13387" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13387" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-13387" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/iStock-1403523137-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13387" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© fizkes / Getty Images / iStock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oral cancer disproportionately affects economically vulnerable individuals, and reducing social inequalities necessitates the implementation of national policies coordinated with broader health and social initiatives. This approach, known as the common risk factor approach, is based on controlling the environment, ensuring access to safe water, providing adequate food, conducting public and professional education campaigns on early signs and symptoms, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment, applying evidence-based treatments appropriate to available resources, and offering thoughtful rehabilitation and palliative care.</p>
<h3><strong>Call for Papers!</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dentalhealth.org/mouthcanceractionmonth2023">Mouth Cancer Awareness Month</a> is an annual initiative that encourages individuals and communities to learn more about the disease, its risk factors, and, most importantly, how early detection and prevention can be achieved to save lives. In line with this alarming international scenario, <em>BMC Oral Health</em> has recently launched a new Collection ‘<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/EDPOC">Early detection and prevention of oral cancer</a>’ dedicated to recruiting cutting-edge research advancements, innovative methodologies, and clinical insights for the early diagnosis and prevention of oral cancer.</p>
<p>By promoting knowledge sharing and collaboration, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat this disease.</p>

<p>A public health journal intends to retract an article that estimated how many unintentional pesticide poisonings happen each year worldwide, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the authors hired a lawyer to represent them in contesting the retraction, and maintain the journal’s decision “undermines the integrity of the scientific process.” This is the second time within a few months that the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/04/authors-file-complaint-with-publisher-as-journal-retracts-vaping-paper/">retracted an article</a> through a process authors said was problematic.</p>



<span id="more-128259"></span>



<p><em>BMC Public Health</em> published the article, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09939-0">The global distribution of acute unintentional pesticide poisoning: estimations based on a systematic review</a>,” in December 2020. It has been cited 145 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors are all affiliated with the Pesticide Action Network, a collection of organizations “working to replace the use of hazardous pesticides with ecologically sound and socially just alternatives,” as they disclosed in the paper. In their review, they concluded that unintentional pesticide poisoning “is an ongoing major global public health challenge” and “a problem that warrants immediate action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Wolfgang-quote-for-retraction-watch.docx.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch, first author Wolfgang Boedeker called the journal’s process for deciding to retract the paper “problematic from the beginning.” He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There was no information provided to the authors about any kind of investigation into our paper prior to being informed about the planned retraction. We, the authors, were piece-wise informed about the reasons, only after repeatedly asking for them. We learned by email that the details of the investigation remained confidential.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper previously attracted criticism from the pesticide industry. In October 2021, the journal published a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0#author-information">letter to the editor</a> in which employees of Bayer and CropLife International claimed the numbers in the article “appear to overestimate the global burden of pesticide poisonings.” The authors <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11941-z">responded</a> that the critics “do not seem to have understood our estimation method.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the journal informed Boedeker’s group of a separate critique from a reader alleging they had overestimated the number of pesticide poisonings in France. The authors responded, but their response was apparently unsatisfactory. In April, an editor told the authors that the journal would retract their article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the authors’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/retraction-BMC-PH-final-080523.pdf">rebuttal</a> to the retraction, they were told the decision was based on the assessment of one editorial board member. After further back-and-forth, the authors learned the critical reader and editorial board member had concerns about the data the authors had sourced for other countries in addition to France. They defended their methods in detail in their rebuttal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boedeker told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The critique suggests that using an ‘ever’ prevalence of poisoning to denote annual frequency may result in an overestimation. We agreed on this and discussed this at length as a possible source for bias in our publication. However, the question is if such an overestimation has taken place. We detailed in our rebuttal that the prevalences used in our extrapolations are not higher than “true” annual ones and therefore no overestimation has taken place. For countries without a strict annual prevalence the effect on the extrapolations is negligible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On May 24, Natalie Pafitis, senior editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, emailed the authors saying the journal would still retract the article following “further advice” from an editorial board member on their rebuttal. Pafitis shared the editorial board member’s comments and wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As stated previously, and in light of the advice received above, we no longer have confidence in the data you are reporting in your study and will be proceeding with a retraction using the following text:</p>



<p>============</p>



<p>The Editor has retracted this article because concerns were raised about the use of&nbsp; ‘ever’ prevalence of pesticide poisoning to represent annual frequency in the extrapolations. Expert assessment has confirmed the validity of this concern and also concluded that the assumption of annual exposure for countries where the time frame is not reported is unreliable.&nbsp; The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented. [The authors agree/do not agree with this retraction].</p>



<p>===========</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pafitis has not responded to our request for comment. Last month, the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/27/exclusive-public-health-journal-says-it-will-retract-vaping-paper-for-questions-authors-say-were-addressed-in-peer-review/">retracted a paper</a> on e-cigarettes and smoking rates, also following a reader critique and assessment by an editorial board member, which the authors of that paper said was flawed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the pesticide paper <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rebuttal-BMC-PH-retraction-extension.pdf">responded</a> to the editorial board member’s new comments, disputing them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On July 14, their lawyer sent the journal a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-07-14-Letter-Resp.-to-Editors-re-Global-UAPP-Article-Retraction.pdf">letter</a> arguing that the retraction would be “inappropriate.” The lawyer proposed that the paper receive an expression of concern instead of a retraction notice, and that the authors be allowed to republish it elsewhere. The letter stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Authors feel strongly that the importance of the topic of their work requires more scientific debate, not the complete elimination of their findings from scientific discourse.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Boedeker said the journal should have asked the critical reader to submit a letter to the editor, “which would have generated an interesting dialogue on the science around estimations of pesticide poisoning,” and “could have encouraged further discussion of how to improve on data collection on pesticide poisonings, by governments and other institutions, in order to work towards preventing harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if the critique of the paper was correct, Boedeker said, the effect on the study’s results would be negligible, and the journal’s decision to retract wouldn’t line up with its own <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#corrections+and+retractions">policies</a>. &#8220;The retraction of our paper is an unacceptable result from an unacceptable process,&#8221; he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/huntingtons-disease-development-gene-brain">Why Huntington’s disease may take so long to develop</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> <strong>— </strong>Scientists have uncovered a clue about why it takes so long for Huntington’s disease to develop. And they may have a lead on how to stop the fatal brain disease.</p>



<p>Huntington’s is caused by a mistakenly repeated bit of a gene called <em>HTT.</em> Until recently, researchers thought the number of repeats a person is born with doesn’t change, though repeats may expand when passed to future generations.</p>



<p>But in some brain cells, the repeats <a href="https://eppro01.ativ.me/src/EventPilot/php/express/web/planner.php?id=ASHG23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can grow over time to hundreds of copies</a>, geneticist Bob Handsaker reported November 2 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. Once the number of repeats passes a certain point, the activity of thousands of other genes in the brain cells changes drastically, leading the cells to die.</p>





<p>These findings suggest that adding repeats to the <em>HTT</em> gene in vulnerable brain cells is what is driving Huntington’s disease, says Handsaker, of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Mass. The research also suggests that preventing the repeats from growing may stop the development of the disease.</p>



<p>The new work gives “serious insight into the disease mechanism,” says Russell Snell, a geneticist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>About 41,000 people in the United States have symptomatic Huntington’s disease, and another 200,000 are at risk of developing it. Inheriting just one copy of a repeat-riddled <em>HTT</em> gene produces symptoms.</p>



<p>Even though individuals are born with the disease-causing gene, symptoms don’t usually appear until people are in their 30s to 50s. Those symptoms include depression, mood swings, forgetfulness, balance problems, involuntary movements and slurred speech. Eventually, a person with the disease may be paralyzed and can die from complications such as pneumonia or heart failure.</p>



<p>In one part of the <em>HTT</em> gene, the DNA bases cytosine, adenine and guanine — CAG — are repeated over and over. Most people have 26 or fewer repeats, but people who have 40 or more repeats will develop Huntington’s disease. The more repeats, the earlier symptoms start.</p>



<p>Previously, researchers thought that long-term exposure to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/signs-huntingtons-show-brain-childhood">toxic huntingtin protein</a> — made from the disease-causing version of <em>HTT</em> — damaged and killed brain cells, much like smoking does to lung cells, Snell says (<em>SN: 10/18/15</em>).</p>



<p>In the new research, Handsaker and colleagues examined individual brain cells in donated brains from people with and without the disease. After measuring the length of the repeated genetic bit in all the cells, the researchers found a “dramatic expansion” of the repeats in brain cells called striatal projection neurons, also known as medium spiny neurons, in people with Huntington’s, Handsaker said. The extra DNA wasn&#8217;t found in other types of brain cells in people with or without the disease.</p>



<p>“Some cells had up to 1,000 CAG repeats,” Handsaker said. The additions “occurred only in the vulnerable cell types that are lost to” Huntington’s disease. Exactly why the repeats grow longer in those cells and not others is not yet known.</p>



<p>Only a few cells had such long stretches of repeats. Most spiny neurons had added more modest numbers, he said. Based on the ages of the donors when they died and on computer simulations, the researchers noticed an unusual pattern to the ever-accumulating repeats. It can take decades to go from about 40 repeats to 80, but then the process picks up steam. It takes only a few years to go from 90 repeats to 100s, Handsaker said.</p>



<p>It wasn’t clear at first whether additional repeats affected the brain cells. So, the researchers examined the activity of thousands of genes by charting RNA levels in the donated cells. The activity of those genes remained stable until the disease-causing version of <em>HTT</em> had about 150 repeats. Then, gene activity altered drastically: Thousands of genes increased activity, while thousands of others decreased.</p>





<p>Since precise levels of activity are needed to keep cells healthy, it’s probably this change that leads to the death of the cells within months of reaching 150. “It looks like a switch,” Snell says. “It looks like you’re OK, more or less, to 150.”</p>



<p>But, Handsaker said, why things are generally fine until that point and then go awry is another mystery. “We really don’t know what goes wrong at 150.”</p>



<p>Regardless, keeping the growth of the repeats in check may be a way to stop the disease from progressing. CAG sequences might inadvertently get added when a protein called MSH3, which is involved in repairing DNA, loses its place. Lowering levels of that protein may prevent the expansion, Handsaker said.</p>



<p>Current experimental techniques for managing Huntington’s focus on lowering the levels of huntingtin. Another insight of the new research, Snell says, is these strategies may not be necessary.</p>



<p>The “work represents a very interesting potential paradigm shift for [Huntington’s] research,” says Leora Fox, Assistant Director of Research and Patient Engagement for the Huntington’s Disease Society of America in New York City. “Huntingtin lowering is not dead, but targeting [DNA] instability holds therapeutic potential.”</p>



<p>Computational biologist Liana Lareau agrees. The work is “a success story for single-cell sequencing,” which the researchers used to examine DNA and RNA in individual cells. The new insights would not have been possible without examining how DNA changes and gene activity are coordinated, says Lareau, of the University of California, Berkeley. And brain donations were also key, she says. “We can’t see this type of thing when we look at cells … in a dish. You need the full complexity of the natural environment.”</p>

                <p>Smallpox, measles, mumps. These are among the contagious diseases that European colonists likely brought to the Americas at the turn of the 16th century, prompting the collapse of Indigenous populations. But the exact viruses that caused the millions of deaths remain unknown.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks to solve that historical puzzle. An evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, he uses cutting-edge tools to study ancient viruses and illuminate how they have shaped human evolution and history. In recent work, Blanco-Melo and colleagues reconstructed two viruses circulating in Mexico at the time of European colonization.</p>



<p>“Our research on ancient viruses is really appealing to the curiosity of the people and how we can study history,” Blanco-Melo says. But this work also holds personal meaning for Blanco-Melo as someone who was born and raised in Mexico. Through genetic sleuthing, he is able to study “something that is very dear in my heart,” he says, “really understanding, with molecular biology, those historical events.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Viruses shape human evolution</h4>



<p>Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school when he had a chance encounter with Matt Ridley’s book <em>Genome</em>. Blanco-Melo had bought it as a Father’s Day gift for his dad but ended up reading it himself. Later, with encouragement from his biology teacher, he enrolled in an undergraduate program in genomics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, campus in Cuernavaca.</p>



<p>He had his first encounter with ancient viruses as a Ph.D. student at the Rockefeller University in New York City. His research focused on particular viruses called endogenous retroviruses, remnants of past infectious viruses that have become integrated into a host’s genetic instruction book.</p>



<p>Blanco-Melo first cataloged the genetic remains left behind by an ancient retrovirus called HERV-T that spread among our primate ancestors tens of millions of years ago. Further analysis revealed that a gene responsible for producing the virus’s outer envelope stuck around throughout primate history; even modern humans retain an inactive version. This gene encodes the envelope protein that helps the virus enter and infect a cell by interacting with another protein on the cell surface.</p>



<p>Why would such a viral gene be so well preserved, Blanco-Melo wondered. What kind of evolutionary advantage could it have offered? Based on studies of cells in a lab dish, he hypothesizes that ancient primates <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/22519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must have co-opted the viral gene</a> and used the related protein to get rid of the cell surface protein, essentially blocking the virus’s entry into cells.</p>



<p>This example highlights how a virus’s own genetic material, over the course of evolution, can be used against it. “This project not only satisfied my curiosity, but we were able to push it into a full-blown story of how a virus evolved, emerged, but also how that virus ceased to exist,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>



<p>Perhaps today’s researchers can exploit similar strategies to combat current retroviruses — “the big goal being HIV,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Delineating historical events</h4>



<p>More recently, Blanco-Melo has teamed up with María Ávila-Arcos, an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM and an old friend, to study viral epidemics that largely wiped out Indigenous populations in the Americas.</p>



<p>Blanco-Melo, Ávila-Arcos and a team of researchers extracted and isolated viral DNA from skeletal remains that they dated to somewhere between the 15th and 17th centuries. These remains come from mass graves at a colonial hospital and a chapel in what is now Mexico City. Archaeological and hospital autopsy records suggest that the remains in the graves belonged to Indigenous people and enslaved Africans who were victims of epidemics that occurred during the 1540s and 1570s.</p>





<p>Based on those findings, the team reconstructed the genetic instruction books of two viruses not previously known to be circulating at that time — human parvovirus B19 and a human hepatitis B virus.</p>



<p>The study, published in 2021 in the journal <em>eLife</em>, is perhaps the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first to obtain ancient viral sequences from the Americas</a>, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutch who wasn’t involved in this work.</p>



<p>“Knowing about the ancient viruses that were infecting people hundreds of years ago is of great scientific and historical interest throughout the world, but especially of interest in the Americas,” Bloom says.</p>



<p>The team found that the ancient viruses were similar to contemporary African strains. They “seem to have arrived in Mexico shortly after the European arrival,” Blanco-Melo says, “but they did not come from Europe. They came from Africa, basically through the transatlantic slave trade.”</p>



<p>Through the collaboration, Blanco-Melo has been careful to avoid helicopter research, where outsiders come to a place, get the data and take credit for the resulting work. “These samples should stay in Mexico, should be analyzed by Mexican researchers … and all those results are, of course, going to be communicated back into the communities. That’s our goal,” he says.</p>



<p>Though the two viruses the team identified aren’t likely to have caused massive epidemics, they could have exacerbated some of the symptoms of other diseases. Ongoing projects based on the same samples from Mexico are looking for other viruses and even peptides to get a fuller picture of the viruses from that time — and perhaps pin down big culprits. “There&#8217;s a lot more research that needs to be done in order to capture those other causative agents,” Blanco-Melo says.</p>

<p>Around Christmas last year, Preston Sowell received an unpleasant delivery. </p>



<p>An archaeologist who knew about Sowell’s work in southeastern Peru sent him a paper about new findings in a particular part of the country Sowell, an independent environmental scientist, was familiar with. The paper, written by several of Sowell’s former colleagues, contained a “shocking” surprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I almost immediately recognized there were errors in the paper,” Sowell said. “I recognised, literally with my first read, some of those artifacts.”</p>



<span id="more-128243"></span>



<p>Artifacts that Sowell recognized as findings from his own projects years earlier had been published without permission. He also said the authors misidentified the location of the artifacts, and falsely claimed the objects had been collected from excavations, not obtained at the surface of the sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2011, Sowell initiated archaeological research in the vicinity of Peru’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Sibinacocha">Lake Sibinacocha</a>, the subject of the paper, after finding artifacts believed to be pre-Incan submerged in the lake. He also runs a nonprofit focused on the protection and conservation of the watershed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No one had notified Sowell when the paper had been published in May 2022. “Which is pretty disturbing,” he says. “Considering my long history at the site and how much I contributed to all this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/00934690.2022.2072161?needAccess=true">Pastoral Paleoclimate Palimpsests of the South-Central Andes: High-Altitude Herder Dwellings in the 2nd Millennium a.d.</a>,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Field Archaeology</em> and has no citations to date. Earlier this year, the journal retracted the article after the authors confirmed the work contained “fundamental errors”. Sowell says the retraction “doesn’t fully characterize the issues of the paper” and adds that he had to complain several times before the journal pulled the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sowell first decided to email <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8195F9EDB2ED622106724A5FAFB7A0">a complaint about the paper</a> to Christina Luke, editor of the <em>Journal of Field Archaeology</em>, in January, alleging that several artifacts included as findings in the author’s 2019 field work were not found at the sites nor on the dates listed in the paper. Instead, Sowell alleges, many of the artifacts were collected under his own projects in the area in surface collections beginning in 2015.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also claims the authors used data from his projects without permission, and that the paper includes a number of miscitations, misinformation and incorrect observations.</p>



<p>Luke wrote back to Sowell in March, informing him that an erratum would be published for the paper, and that his concerns about authorship, permissions and claims of falsified data should be directed to the home institution of the author. “It was shocking and confusing,” Sowell says of the response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sowell had also been in contact with the Office of Research Integrity and Ethics at Washington University, the home institute of Sarah Baitzel, lead author of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, a research integrity officer from the university emailed Sowell with his assessment of Sowell’s allegations. The officer wrote that Baitzel had agreed to publish a correction for one of the figures in the paper. The officer described the reason for the correction as “an honest error, which does not constitute research misconduct under our Policy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If this was an honest error, it would be easy to refute,” Sowell says. </p>



<p>The email continues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Therefore, I do not find that the evidence supports initiating research misconduct proceedings and the allegation is dismissed. The concerns, other than those related to Figure 8 raised in your communication, would not constitute research misconduct under our Policy and are either differences of scientific opinion or matters outside of the scope of our policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In May, Sowell sent another complaint to the Office of Research Integrity and Ethics. He wrote the follow-up complaint as a formal document that compiled information from several of his emails and included some additional errors and his issues with the erratum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July, he received a response from the office, confirming the paper would be retracted. The email included a note from Baitzel addressed to Sowell:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In response to your letter, I am writing to inform you that I have discovered an error in the article and as a result, I and my coauthors have decided to retract the article. I have already spoken with the editor of JFA, Dr. Luke, to initiate the process.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2023.2249332">retraction notice</a>, published in August this year, states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since publication, concerns have been raised about the integrity of the data in the article. When approached for an explanation, the authors checked their data and confirmed there are fundamental errors present. Therefore, they have agreed to the retraction of this article. The authors apologise for this oversight.</p>



<p>We have been informed in our decision-making by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retractions.</p>



<p>The retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly record, but it will be digitally watermarked on each page as “Retracted”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Baitzel, Luke, nor research integrity committee members responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Taylor &amp; Francis, the journal’s publisher, wrote in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We were first made aware of this issue in January 2023. We followed standard COPE guidelines in looking at the claims made, working with the Editor of the journal to address the concerns raised. This ultimately led to the corresponding author acknowledging there were fundamental errors present in the paper, which resulted in the decision to retract the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The representative replied to a follow-up email requesting more detail:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I’m afraid we have no further information to provide outside of what is already in the retraction notice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Sowell, who has tried to protect the Lake Sibinacocha archaeological area from mining, says the errors are “egregious.” The area “is a blank spot on the map relative to archaeology and cultural heritage,” he says. “[The authors] have contaminated the archaeological record up there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before making his complaint, Sowell contacted Payson Sheets, a research professor in archaeology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who has not been involved with this work. Sheets underscored the enormity of such an error, helping Sowell understand why it was important to make the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to other fields of research, “replication testing can never be done in archaeology,” Sheets says. “Once excavations are done, that can never be duplicated, it cannot be replicated, it cannot be tested. It is a moral and ethical imperative for us to be very thorough.”</p>

                <p>For PLOS, increasing data-sharing rates&mdash;and especially increasing the amount of data shared in a repository&mdash;is a high priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research data is a vital part of the scientific record, essential to both understanding and reproducing published research. And data repositories are the most effective and impactful way to share research data. Not only is deposited data safer and more discoverable, articles with data in a repository have a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20citation%20prediction,studies%20%5B24%E2%80%9328%5D.">25% higher citation rate</a> on average.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">support from the Wellcome Trust</a>, we&rsquo;ve been experimenting with two solutions designed to increase awareness about data repositories and promote data repository use among both authors and readers. One solution didn&rsquo;t achieve its expected outcome in the context we tested it (a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; result) while the other shows promise as a tool for increasing engagement with deposited data. The mixed outcomes are an example of why it&rsquo;s so important to share all research results regardless of their outcome &ndash; whether &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo; results. We hope that our experiences, what we&rsquo;ve learned, and above all the data and results, can help the scholarly communications community to develop new and better solutions to meet the challenges we all face, and advance Open Science.</p>

<h2>PLOS data repository experiments, 2021-2023</h2>



<h3>Experiment 1: Using iconography to highlight data shared in a repository</h3>



<p><strong>Question</strong></p>



<p>Does highlighting data in a repository linked to published research articles with an eye-catching graphic in the form of an Accessible Data icon increase access to the associated dataset?</p>



<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>



<p>We hypothesized that:</p>



<ol><li>the Accessible Data icon would be associated with a statistically significant increase in engagement with datasets, and&nbsp;</li><li>the icon would motivate authors to deposit their data in a repository in order to have the icon applied to their article</li></ol>



<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>



<p>An Accessible Data icon automatically appeared on any article published after 2014 that included a link in its Data Availability Statement to one of three popular data repositories (Dryad, Figshare, and OSF) beginning on March 29 2022. Readers can see and click on the icon from any eligible PLOS journal article and be directed straight to the data in the repository.</p>



<p><strong>Data</strong></p>



<p>Usage data relating to the number of Accessible Data icon link clicks, and internal data from Figshare, one of three selected repositories. A survey of 4,898 researchers, and follow-up interviews with 12 researchers.</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>In the first 12 months of the experiment (April 2022-March 2023) we recorded more than 20,000 reader clicks on the icon across all PLOS properties. Through analysis of 543 Figshare datasets linked to PLOS articles, we observed that in the 12 months prior to the launch of the icon, the average number of views received per month was 2.5, rising to 3.0 in the 12 months following the launch (a statistically significant relative increase of 20%).</p>



<p>Survey respondents who were aware of the Accessible Data feature and who had used a repository were asked to what extent the feature influenced their decision to use a repository: 51% answered that they were influenced either somewhat or strongly by the existence of the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked about the impact of the Accessible Data feature on their future likelihood of submitting to a repository: 40% were more or much more likely to use a repository.</p>



<h3>Experiment 2: Integrating Dryad into the Editorial Manager submission system for <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> to ease repository use</h3>



<p><strong>Question</strong></p>



<p>If authors have the option to submit their data to a repository as part of journal submission, will repository use increase?</p>



<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>



<p>We predicted an absolute increase of 10 percentage points in the use of data repositories by <em>PLOS Pathogens </em>authors, from the 2020 baseline of 25% to 35%.</p>



<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>



<p>A new option appeared on the Attached Files screen in the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> Editorial Manager submission system on October 5 2021, allowing authors to upload research data to Dryad. Authors were redirected into the Dryad system via a popup window where they entered the required information and files and received a Dryad DOI, which they could then include in the Data Availability Statement later in the submission process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details and instructions were added to the journal submission guidelines, Editorial Manager submission system, and PLOS website, and the offering was promoted through established channels including email, social media, and advertising.</p>



<p><strong>Data</strong></p>



<p>Usage data from the Editorial Manager submission system and Dryad. Survey data from 654 researchers who submitted to <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>About 2% of submitting<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> authors (44 submitting author groups) used the integrated repository feature. <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>&rsquo; repository use for the first half of 2023 was 33%, however this appears to be part of an ongoing organic increase that began prior to the experiment.</p>



<p>Among the 574 survey respondents who did not share or plan to share data using the Dryad integration, the biggest reasons included lack of awareness (35%), uncertainty in how to use the integration (26%), and that data had already been uploaded to another repository (21%).</p>



<h2>Our next steps</h2>



<p>As a result of these experiments and our findings, we&rsquo;ve made the decision to discontinue the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> integration with Dryad. PLOS will continue its publisher membership of Dryad and our authors are still encouraged to use it to share data in their own workflows. We look forward to exploring other ways to increase use of repositories. Because of the promising results from the Accessible Data icon, we decided to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">extend the service</a> to include an additional six repositories, for nine total. We look forward to seeing&mdash;and sharing&mdash;the outcomes from this next phase of work.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Paul Moggridge will talk about his conference paper entitled &quot;On Instance Weighted Clustering Ensembles&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Ensemble clustering is a technique which combines multiple clustering results, and
instance weighting is a technique which highlights important instances in a dataset. Both
techniques are known to enhance clustering performance and robustness. In this research,
ensembles and instance weighting are integrated with the spectral clustering algorithm. We
believe this is the first attempt at creating diversity in the generative mechanism using
density-based instance weighting for a spectral ensemble. The proposed approach is
empirically validated using synthetic datasets comparing against spectral and a spectral
ensemble with random instance weighting. Results show that using the instance weighted
sub-sampling approach as the generative mechanism for an ensemble of spectral clustering
leads to improved clustering performance on datasets with imbalanced clusters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/moving-overseas-for-your-phd">Moving overseas for your PhD</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Through this series, we will be sharing first-hand advice on applying for postgraduate courses. Here, Carly Hood reflects on her own experience moving from Australia to the UK for her PhD with plenty of practical advice. </strong></p>

<p>I am a PhD student at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, originally from Brisbane, Australia. As a member of the Genomic Disorders and Cognitive Development Lab, I work with children who have intellectual impairment of known genetic origin and their families. My research aims to use computational and network approaches to examine how genes mediate brain structure, brain function and cognition with a view to develop targeted support for these kids.</p>

<p><strong>What lead to my decision to move overseas? </strong></p>
<p>Prior to my PhD, I did both my Bachelor of Speech Pathology and Masters in Neuroscience in Brisbane. My clinical work with children who have rare genetic conditions lead to my research interest in isolating biological mechanisms of neurodevelopment. The rarity of these genetic conditions, however, meant that the few institutions working in this area were all located in overseas in countries with larger populations, <a href=""  >namely the United Kingdom, United States and Europe.</a> I had always wanted to move overseas, so this was an excellent opportunity to do so while advancing my professional interests. </p>

<p><strong>Why did I decide to come to the UK?</strong></p>
<p>From the outset, I felt the length and structure of the US programmes were less aligned with what I wanted from a PhD. They are approximately 5- 7 years, as opposed to 4 in the EU and the UK, with the first two years largely comprised of coursework and lab rotations. Given that I had already done a masters and knew the exact research question I wanted to address, the UK and EU programme structures were better suited.</p>

<p><strong>How did I choose programmes to apply to?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to preface here that, often, starting a PhD overseas is a matter of securing both a place in a programme and funding. I first identified the programmes and researchers I was interested in and then noted specific funding requirements. I compiled an excel sheet where I listed all the programmes and their deadlines as well as respective funding options (which may have a separate deadline). </p>
<blockquote>You have to prepare yourself for a prolonged process with pinch-points, but the experience on the other side is incomparable</blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on funding</strong></p>
<p>International students incur fees about triple those of home students and are often eligible for far fewer funding schemes. Further, the dwindling research funds following Brexit has made finding funding even more of a challenge. Each programme will differ. Some offer funded positions, others direct you to other potential sources of funding and others accept self-funded students. Many EU institutes for example provide a generous salary, compared to a tax-free stipend in the UK. I also investigated broad funding schemes that were for Australian students to pursue post-graduate studies overseas. Note that these deadlines are often before the programme application deadlines - sometimes over a year in advance, such as in the case of the John Monash Scholarship in Australia. In writing this article, I’m taken back to the number of late nights I sat hunched, 20 links deep and trying to figure out my eligibility for various funding schemes. PhD applications are time consuming and taxing at the best of times, let alone with the added layer of finding funding. There is a sweet spot between too few and too many applications -  what worked for me was choosing a limited number of programmes (I seriously considered about 4 and prepared applications for 2) where you can really see yourself spending 4 years and focus the funding search to these. </p>

<p><strong>How did I approach my applications?</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the 4 programmes I would actively consider, I started my research. I spoke to each Principle Investigator (you are interviewing your supervisor as much as they are interviewing you), their students (it is indicative of a good work-place culture when supervisors put you in touch with their students specifically) and people I knew of in the field. Another advantage of talking to supervisors is that they may know of other funding opportunities and can provide tailored advice you may not get from admissions websites. Then it came to constructing the application which involved writing research proposals and personal statements, requesting references, and filling out funding applications. </p>
<blockquote>I’ve had to actively remind myself that settling in will take time - eventually I’ll come to a semblance of balance between life in the UK and home</blockquote>
<p><strong>Eventually… the move </strong></p>
<p>Following a protracted process, I was very fortunate to be offered a funded position at the MRC CBU in Cambridge which I promptly accepted. Though this was a huge relief, I now needed to consider the logistics of moving country. This process was tiring and at times stressful, but at least the finish line was in sight. It involved making arrangements for leaving Australia (suspending health insurance, registering for overseas voting, notifying banks etc) and for living in the UK (applying for visas, registering with the NHS, arranging insurance, opening a bank account, transferring funds etc). Of note, your visa requirements may specify an arrival date or periods of time where you cannot be in the country. In my case, my offer conditions needed to be fulfilled so I could be issued a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) to use in my application for a student visa before arriving. It is also important to not underestimate the cost of moving on top of paying for visas immigration health surcharges and general cost-of-living. You may need to save accordingly throughout the process of applying. <a href=""  >A  further consideration is paying any living expenses upfront (as was the case with the college system at Cambridge).</a></p>

<p><strong>Starting the PhD  </strong></p>
<p>As for starting the PhD, I certainly underestimated the challenges of starting a highly involved programme whilst also adjusting a new place of residence. Even coming from somewhere with a reasonably comparable culture with the same language, there have been various points of difference to navigate. I’ve had to actively remind myself that settling in will take time - eventually I’ll come to a semblance of balance between life in the UK and home. It takes time to figure out how to best maintain long-distance relationships with family and friends at home (don’t get me started on the time difference…). I also remind myself that this will be in flux throughout my time here. </p>

<p><strong>Overall… </strong></p>
<p>For anyone who is considering pursuing higher degree research and has also considered moving overseas, my advice is to just start looking! Yes, you have to prepare yourself for a prolonged process with pinch-points as I outlined, but the experience on the other side is incomparable. Higher degree research is a particularly flexible time where you are largely responsible for your individual progress and are therefore afforded periods of flexibility that can be leveraged. In my case this is to travel - it is still astounding to me that I can visit another country for a weekend – and also pursue other personal interests. The added benefit of moving to Cambridge, which has a vibrant international community, is that I have met many like-minded individuals who have gone through similar processes. Thus far, I have relished the experience of moving to a completely unfamiliar country and how this has enriched my life, both personally and professionally. </p><hr><p>This article was written by Carly Hood and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-water-molecules-evaporate-heat">Light, not just heat, might spur water to evaporate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Green light means “go.” That might apply to evaporating water molecules too.</p>



<p>Visible light, especially that of a greenish hue, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312751120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might spur water to evaporate</a>, researchers report in the Nov. 7 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. In experiments, water evaporating under visible light showed a higher evaporation rate than possible based on heat alone, MIT mechanical engineer Gang Chen and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Coupled with other observations, they say, the finding suggests that when light shines on water, individual particles of light, or photons, can sever the bonds that connect water molecules, releasing clusters of molecules into the air.</p>





<p>“This is super exciting stuff,” says Yuki Nagata, a chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany, who was not part of the research. He notes that the hypothesis needs additional checking. “We are not 100 percent sure this is really the mechanism,” he says. But if it is, it’s “totally new.”</p>



<p>Normally, heat is what gets evaporation going, causing water molecules in the liquid to jostle more vigorously. That extra energy can break some of the bonds between molecules in the liquid, allowing molecules to escape as water vapor. Based on how much heat goes in, scientists can calculate the amount of evaporation expected. Visible light can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/turning-water-steam-no-boiling-required">help water evaporate</a> due to the heat it imparts (<em>SN: 3/8/16</em>). But until now, it wasn’t thought to directly break the bonds between water molecules.</p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers shone light on water contained in porous hydrogels, materials that greedily sop up water. The proposed effect occurs where air meets water, and the hydrogels the researchers studied contain innumerable crannies where the two meet, allowing the water to be cleaved off and escape. In some cases, the evaporation rate was more than double the expectation based on heat. What’s more, the evaporation rate varied with the wavelength of the light. Green light produced the highest evaporation rate.</p>



<p>That wavelength dependence is convincing support for the researchers’ hypothesis, says thermodynamicist Janet A.W. Elliott of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. “If you just shine [visible] light on something, how do you know if it’s the light or the heat from the light that’s doing your job? But if it’s wavelength dependent … that’s evidence that the light part of it matters.” Additionally, she says, the excess evaporation didn’t occur when a heater was used instead of light.</p>



<p>When heat drives evaporation, molecules typically escape one at a time. But measurements of the temperature of the vapor above the hydrogel suggest that when light is driving the evaporation, water molecules escape in clusters. Then the clusters themselves evaporate, breaking into individual water molecules, cooling the vapor in the process.</p>



<p>In general, the measured vapor temperature was higher closer to the hydrogel, just as steam is hottest directly above a boiling pan. But in a pocket of vapor between about 8 to 14 millimeters above the surface, the temperature didn’t vary with height. That, the researchers say, is evidence of a region where the air is saturated with individual water molecules, and where clusters continually evaporate and recondense.</p>



<p>“It’s pretty convincing that, in this particular experimental setup, you can see clumps of molecules coming off and then those clumps evaporate,” Elliott says.</p>



<p>But, Elliott says, “there’s still lots of questions to be answered.” For example, the researchers don’t explain in detail how the photons could break the bonds or why it works best with green light.</p>



<p>Chen admits that the theoretical explanation involves some handwaving. Still, he hopes that this effect could be put to use for practical purposes, such as more efficient ways of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-desalination-tech-could-help-quench-global-thirst">making freshwater from saltwater</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/16</em>)</p>



<p>The effect might be widespread in nature, Chen says, in water within porous materials like soil or plants, or in foams on the surface of the ocean. “We have a feeling this is really happening daily, widely, and that’s why we’re very excited about this.”</p>

<p>A large U.S. university press has stopped selling two scholarly books about the philosophers Slavoj Žižek and John Venn due to problems with how the authors cited – or didn’t cite – source material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In both cases, the University of Chicago Press stated on its website that the titles, released in 2023 and 2022, respectively, were “no longer available for sale.” But only “John Venn: A Life in Logic” by <a href="https://lukasmverburgt.com/">Lukas M. Verburgt</a> was “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231109100033/https:/press.uchicago.edu/books/Book-Pages/9780226815510.html">retracted</a>,” according to the publisher.</p>



<p>The author of the other publication – “How Slavoj Became Žižek: The Digital Making of a Public Intellectual” – told us he had been afforded a chance to fix his mistakes. These included “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231109095858/https:/press.uchicago.edu/books/Book-Pages/9780226823508.html">several insufficient, missing, or erroneous citations of source material upon which the author builds his argument</a>,” the University of Chicago Press stated.</p>



<p>“The publisher has given me the opportunity to correct the book and resubmit it for review,” said <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/sociology/our-staff/academic/eliran-bar-el/">Eliran Bar-El</a>, a sociologist at the University of York, in England. “In light of it being an ongoing process, I cannot provide further details until there is a review outcome, which will be reflected appropriately in my publication list. At this time, I would like to genuinely thank the observant readers who have brought this to my attention.”</p>



<p>Verburgt, whose work contains “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231109100033/https:/press.uchicago.edu/books/Book-Pages/9780226815510.html">numerous instances of insufficiently cited source material</a>,” does not appear to have been quite as lucky.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128230"></span>



<p>“I regret the fact that it has not been possible to revise and rectify,” Verburgt, a research and project associate at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences, in Amsterdam, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231101152141/https:/lukasmverburgt.com/Home-Page">wrote on his website</a>. “This has saddened me deeply, also since the consequences have taken a serious toll on me, in different ways.”</p>



<p>The University of Chicago Press declined to comment on the two cases.</p>



<p>On his website, Verburgt said he accepted the decision to pull his book. He explained that he made use “of a 2007 dissertation in several of the biographical chapters” and had not been “as careful as I should have been in ensuring accurate referencing at all places. I’m very sorry about this, especially to the author of the dissertation.”</p>



<p>He did not identify the dissertation in question. But in his book, he acknowledged his debt to the authors of two PhD dissertations, only one of which – “<a href="https://oro.open.ac.uk/59947/">Intersecting Sets: John Venn, Church and University, 1834-1923</a>” by Michelle Clewlow – was published in 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clewlow declined to comment. Her former supervisor at the <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/people/jrw3">Open University, John Wolffe</a>, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I was not previously aware of this matter, but naturally concerned to learn about it as The Open University does take plagiarism very seriously. However, Dr Clewlow tells me that she does not want to comment herself, and especially as I have not seen the book, I will follow her lead and not offer further comment. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verburgt, who did not respond to our requests for comment, wrote on his website:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the process of repeatedly revising the manuscript &#8211; over the course of a period of many years &#8211; several things have gone amiss.&nbsp;<br><em><br></em>The crucial final stages came at a time of great personal turmoil for me and my family. On another level, I’ve always been explicit and open about the importance of the dissertation for the book. I’ve hid neither my debt to the dissertation itself nor its significance for the biographical chapters, which sometimes went beyond my immediate expertise: I’ve referred to it multiple times and also mentioned it explicitly in the acknowledgments. This does not justify the lack of accurate referencing. What it does show is that this inaccuracy has, of course, not been deliberate. I’ve been negligent, but never had malign intentions.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In this study, we harness the signal processing potential of neurons, utilizing the
Izhikevich point neuron model to efficiently decode the slope or amplitude of fluctuating
continuous input signals. Using biophysically detailed compartmental neurons often
requires significant computational resources. We present a novel approach to create
behaviours and simulate these interactions in a lower-dimensional space, thereby reducing
computational requirements. We began by conducting an extensive search of the Izhikevich
parameter space, leading to the first significant outcome of our study: i) the
identification of optimal parameter sets for generating slope or amplitude detectors,
thereby achieving signal processing goals using neurons. Next, we compared the performance
of the slope detector we discovered with a biophysically detailed two-compartmental
pyramidal neuron model. Our findings revealed several key observations: ii) bursts
primarily occurred on the rising edges of similar input signals, iii) our slope detector
exhibited bidirectional slope detection capabilities, iv) variations in burst duration
encoded the magnitude of input slopes in a graded manner. Overall, our study demonstrates
the efficient and accurate simulation of dendrosomatic behaviours. Real-time applications
in robotics or neuromorphic hardware can utilize our approach. While biophysically
detailed compartmental neurons are compatible with such hardware, Izhikevich point neurons
are more efficient. This work has the potential to facilitate the simulation of such
interactions on a larger scale, encompassing a greater number of neurons and neuronal
connections for the same computational power.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hummingbirds-fly-spaces-narrow-wings">How hummingbirds fly through spaces too narrow for their wings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hummingbirds are natural acrobats, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/capturing-wonders-hummingbird-flight">twisting their wings</a> in ways that let them fly backward and upside down, unlike any other bird (<em>SN: 1/13/16</em>). New high-speed video now shows how, using a bit of aerial gymnastics, hummingbirds can also slip through gaps narrower than their wingspan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most birds can bend their wings at the wrist, pulling arched wings close to their bodies to navigate their way through dense vegetation like branches. But hummingbird wings aren’t as flexible. Because the wings stick straight out from a hummingbird’s body, getting through tight spaces requires some tricky maneuvering. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Anna’s hummingbirds (<em>Calypte anna</em>) <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.245643" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fly sideways to make it through holes too small</a> for their rigid wings, researchers report November 9 in <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>. To avoid hitting a hole’s sides, the birds also flutter their wings while flying through a tight space rather than using their full range of motion for each wingbeat. After successfully navigating the obstacle a few times, the birds switch it up, flattening their wings against their bodies and shooting through holes like a bullet.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="See in slow motion how a hummingbird navigates a narrow gap | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O3-UrtXCpGQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A male Anna’s hummingbird crosses an 8-centimeter-wide opening, smaller than its 12-centimeter wingspan. Viewed from the side and below, the bird flies though the hole at a sideways angle in the first clip, fluttering its wings to avoid hitting the barrier. In the second video clip, the hummingbird tucks its wings back against its body as it passes through the hole like a bullet. The clips show each style of flight first at actual speed and then one-twentieth normal speed.   </figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is a new insight into the amazing capacity of hummingbirds,” says Bret Tobalske, a biomechanist at the University of Montana in Missoula who wasn’t involved with the research. Sideways flight to maneuver through gaps is “pretty remarkable” and highlights how unique hummingbirds are among birds, he says.</p>



<p>The findings could help engineers develop aerial vehicles or robots suitable for navigating tight, complicated spaces. Hummingbirds are among nature’s best fliers and are fantastic at remembering their spatial environment, says Bo Cheng, a mechanical engineer at Penn State not involved in the study. But “the state of the art in drones hasn’t really reached the hummingbird-level flight capability yet,” he says. The rapid beat of hummingbird wings — around 40 beats per second for an Anna’s hummingbird — gives the birds precise control over flight, and engineering needs to catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because hummingbird wings are so rigid, biologist Marc Badger often wondered how the birds dealt with obstacles and tight spaces. While a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, he would watch the tiny birds sip nectar from a feeder. Sometimes individuals would chase one another through the branches of a nearby bush yet emerge unscathed. “And that got me thinking, how in the world are they doing this?”</p>



<p>He and colleagues caught four wild male Anna’s hummingbirds and trained them to fly between two feeders inside an enclosed flight arena. Once the birds were accustomed to the setup, the team introduced barriers with a hole ranging from 6 to 12 centimeters in diameter, equivalent to about half or a full hummingbird wingspan.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In an experimental setup to study how hummingbirds navigate narrow gaps, wild-caught Anna’s hummingbirds (<em>Calypte anna</em>) had to fit through holes smaller than their wingspan to reach a feeder filled with nectar. How they are able to do that was a mystery: While amazingly acrobatic in the air, the tiny birds have stiffer, less bendable wings than other kinds of birds. Although too fast to see at normal speed, this bird tucks its wings close to its body to dive-bomb through the hole.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To the human eye, hummingbirds flying from feeder to feeder appeared as blurs on computer screens monitoring the enclosure, says Badger, now an engineer at Aescape, a therapeutic robotics company based in New York City. But high-speed cameras placed to the side and below the hole showed that the birds first used sideways flight to shimmy their way through narrow gaps. Then each bird switched to diving through the hole.</p>



<p>“It was a shocking revelation to see the sideways scooch,” says Robert Dudley, a physiologist at UC Berkeley. He’d assumed hummingbirds would just use the ballistic style, flattening wings against their bodies, as many songbirds do. “But to slow it up and then go sideways and not drop in altitude was a novel behavior that had never been seen before.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the hummingbirds learned the navigation techniques in the lab or whether they brought a collection of innate strategies with them, Badger says. But all four birds started with sideways flight and transitioned to the bulletlike technique, which could suggest that the same tactics get used in the wild.</p>





<p>Also unknown is why hummingbirds might use either technique. It’s possible that sideways flight offers flexibility to reverse course around obstacles that might be hiding predators like cats, Badger says. But because the wings continue to flap, feathers can also hit objects and possibly break. “One story that I tell myself,” Badger says, “is that once they get a sense of what’s on the other side and a sense of their surroundings, then they switch over to this ballistic technique to avoid the consequences.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grassland-forest-homes-us-fires">Grassland and shrubland fires destroy more U.S. homes than forest fires</a></h4>

              
                <p>Forest fires can devastate vast swaths of land, but in the United States, another category of conflagrations takes the title of most destructive.</p>



<p>Of the homes destroyed in wildfires across the contiguous United States from 1990 to 2020, 64 percent — nearly 11,000 — were razed by <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk7118" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk7118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grassland and shrubland fires</a>, researchers report in the Nov. 10 <em>Science</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We often think about forest fires because that’s what we see on the news … they’re dramatic, they’re huge, they’re intense,” says ecologist Volker Radeloff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, “but grassland and shrubland fires can also be quite destructive.” For instance, the 2023 Lahaina fire on the Hawaiian island of Maui, fueled by invasive wild grasses, killed at least 98 people and destroyed some 2,200 buildings.</p>





<p>For the new study, Radeloff and his colleagues analyzed three decades of data on wildfire occurrence, land use and housing, hoping to learn more about what factors fuel such destructive blazes.</p>



<p>The team found that about 337,000 square kilometers of grasslands and shrublands burned from 1990 to 2020, compared with about 144,000 square kilometers burned by forest fires. Though forest fires were about twice as likely as grassland fires to burn down homes they encountered, the much larger expanse burned by grassland and shrubland fires helped make them more destructive overall.</p>



<p>The data also revealed that U.S. wildfire risk had risen substantially. Today, roughly 148,000 houses stand in areas where wildfires have burned before — that’s more than twice as many as in 1990. About half of those additional homes were built on land that had already burned prior to 1990, the team found, while the rest were already standing when a blaze burned through.</p>



<p>Radeloff hopes more people will consider their wildfire risk and take steps to prepare, be that planning evacuation routes or fireproofing their homes. Evading wildfire danger, it seems, takes more than getting out of the woods.</p>

<p>A year after the authors of two papers contacted the marketing journal where they had been published requesting retraction, the journal has pulled one, but decided to issue a correction for the other. </p>



<p>In April, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/12/journal-hasnt-retracted-super-size-me-paper-six-months-after-authors-request/">we reported</a> that the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> was investigating “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/38/6/1047/1790951">Super Size Me: Product Size as a Signal of Status</a>,” originally published in 2012, and “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/43/1/68/2379624">Dynamics of Communicator and Audience Power: The Persuasiveness of Competence versus Warmth</a>,” published in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors had asked to retract the papers in October 2022 after other researchers found inconsistencies in the statistical calculations of the “Super Size Me” paper and could not replicate the results. The article had been cited nearly 200 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. It attracted attention from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/us/a-new-linkage-offers-possibilities-in-the-anti-obesity-campaign.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/11/04/142019920/do-people-pick-super-sized-portions-to-boost-their-social-status">NPR</a>, among other outlets, which linked the findings to the rise in obesity in the United States. An analyst also found issues in the 2016 paper, which has been cited 71 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we published our previous story, <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/carolyn-yoon">Carolyn Yoon</a>, the chair of the journal’s policy board and a professor of management and marketing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor’s Stephen M. Ross School of Business, told us the board was still waiting on a report from the special committee investigating the matter. “We hope to have a decision by the end of this month,” she said in April 2023. </p>



<span id="more-128227"></span>



<p>In June, the journal published expressions of concern for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad037/7192126">both</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad036/7192125">articles</a> (which continued to be cited). Both notices stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On October 22, 2022, the journal’s Policy Board received information about problems with the data in this article. We alert readers that the Policy Board’s assessment is ongoing. In the interim, we advise them to exercise caution when interpreting the data, results, and conclusions in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On October 29 of this year, the journal retracted the “Super Size Me” paper and published a correction to the other article. The policy board also published a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad057/7325346?searchresult=1">note</a> about the two articles that stated: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It was the initial understanding of the Journal’s Policy Board that after the authors identified methodological issues with both articles in 2022, they disagreed about how best to address them and asked the Policy Board, which comprises organizational representatives appointed by its sponsoring organizations, to determine how to proceed. In the interim, Expressions of Concern were published in June 2023.</p>



<p>The 2012 article has since been retracted at https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad055. A correction to the 2016 article has also now been published at https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad056.</p>



<p>The Policy Board thanks the investigative committee members for their handling of the latter case.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad055/7325344?login=false">notice</a> read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article is being retracted following the discovery of a set of statistical errors in studies 1 and 6, which cannot be explained as the authors no longer have the data. Given these errors, the authors concluded that the claims of the paper are significantly challenged, and the authors no longer have confidence in the results as reported. The authors state that the hypothesized link between power and consumption deserves future empirical consideration before the field draws any firm conclusions about this relationship.</p>



<p>There is empirical evidence, available upon request from the authors, that the results from study 1 can be replicated and that reexamination of the data for study 3 replicated all the results initially reported.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The correction <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad056/7325345">notice</a> acknowledged that two of the paper’s three authors, <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/rucker_derek_d.aspx#research=page1">Derek Rucker</a> of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Chicago and <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/detail/ag2514">Adam Galinsky</a> of Columbia Business School in New York City, had requested a retraction. The investigative committee recommended a correction, instead. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Reexamination of the data in the article by the investigative committee revealed a newly discovered series of irregular data patterns. None of the tests performed through the reexamination of the data were considered or performed by the authors at the time of publication, and the authors were unaware of these patterns at that time. Of note, reexamination efforts found that test statistics reported in the article were replicable.</p>



<p>None of the omissions in the experimental design were intentional. As the sole individual responsible for data collection, processing, and analysis, the first author assumes full responsibility for the inadvertent lack of communication regarding how the data were collected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rest of the notice detailed a mismatch between the data for one experiment and the results in the paper, reported a corrected statistical value, and explained how “the description of the experimental procedure unintentionally omitted important design elements that could mislead readers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/david-dubois">David Dubois</a>, now a professor at the Fontainebleau, France campus of <a href="https://www.insead.edu/">INSEAD</a>, is the first author of both articles. We emailed him for comment and received an auto-reply that he had “very no email access” and to expect a “significant delay” in getting a response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rucker told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Adam and I don’t have a comment about either the 2012 or 2016 paper. We requested retraction of both papers, and we no longer endorse either paper. However, we also agreed to abide by whatever decision JCR made after their investigative process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Yoon about the length of the investigation, and she told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I don&#8217;t have any comments beyond what&#8217;s stated in the notes accompanying the retraction and correction. We applied due process in accordance with the journal&#8217;s policies.</p>



<p>The investigative committee&#8217;s work took a few months to complete. And then everything else including all communications back and forth with authors, policy board, and the publisher took many more months.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Aaron Charlton, who maintains <a href="https://openmkt.org/">OpenMKT.org</a>, a site aimed at improving evidence quality in academic publications in marketing and consumer behavior, was among the researchers who identified issues in the studies and informed the authors of his findings. Last July, he left a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/12/journal-hasnt-retracted-super-size-me-paper-six-months-after-authors-request/#comment-2174318">comment</a> on our story about the journal’s investigation that said they had decided not to retract the articles.</p>



<p>We asked him what seemed to have changed, and he told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My understanding of the retract/don&#8217;t retract fiasco is this: JCR policy committee had decided not to retract either article. I pointed out that it was ridiculous that they would refuse to retract an article at the authors&#8217; request. Many others agreed. Then, JCR decided they would honor the authors&#8217; request. They now claim that they didn&#8217;t know the authors were united in asking for the retraction of the 2012 article and they thought their purpose was to adjudicate between the authors. Hence the decision not to retract initially. I guess they didn&#8217;t think it was super important, so they didn&#8217;t take their time to gather all of the facts before making their decision.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Charlton also said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;m not super happy with the outcome. Literally all of their communications with the public have been hostile toward whistleblowers and deferential towards the data anomalist. For example, in the retraction statement they point out that the anomalist got the study to replicate but they fail to mention that an independent third party failed to replicate the study (which is what initiated this whole thing really). Who cares if a data anomalist claims they can replicate their own (now retracted) paper? What about source credibility?</p>



<p>I am familiar with the forensic analysis of the 2016 paper, which JCR says is fine. The paper is not fine. Much more information is forthcoming on this. Some of the analysis has already been leaked. Keep in mind that the other two authors both requested retraction of the data due to unexplainable data anomalies that massively supported the hypothesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not JCR&#8217;s only problem. Only one JCR study has ever been successfully replicated by an independent third party. 28 attempts to replicate JCR papers have failed. I maintain the replication tracker for the field of marketing here: https://openmkt.org/research/replications-of-marketing-studies/ They may claim that if you change a thing here or there you can get a study to replicate but I only count exact replications. If you try to exactly replicate a JCR study you can expect to run into difficulty as 28 out of 29 other replication teams have.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-12-months-hottest-record-climate">The last 12 months were the hottest on record</a></h4>

              
                <p>The last 12 months were the <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/earths-hottest-12-month-streak-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hottest in 150 years of recordkeeping</a> — and probably in the last 125,000 years — thanks to human-caused climate change, a new report finds.</p>



<p>From November 2022 through October 2023, the planet’s average temperature was about 1.3 degrees Celsius higher than the average temperature from 1850 to 1900, say researchers with the nonprofit group Climate Central. That’s just shy of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-communication-numbers-goals">1.5-degree threshold often cited</a> as a benchmark for avoiding irreversible impacts on the climate (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>).</p>





<p>And over the past year, about 1 in 4 people around the world experienced a climate change–driven heat wave that lasted at least five days, the scientists found.</p>



<p>The report, released on November 9, comes just ahead of the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, which begins on November 30. That’s intentional, says Andrew Pershing, vice president for science at Climate Central. There is no doubt that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-ipcc-un-report-action-solutions">fossil fuels are driving most of this heat</a>, and it’s to be hoped that the world’s nations will take note of these findings, he says (<em>SN: 4/4/22</em>).</p>



<p>Global average numbers can be hard to grasp. So the new report also quantifies temperatures that people around the world are actually experiencing day-to-day, and how much those are attributable to climate change, Pershing says.</p>



<p>“We have these super important global numbers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">such as the 1.5- or 2-degree warming targets</a>, but that isn’t the experience that people on planet Earth have,” he says (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). “We wanted to develop a way to really localize that experience … to talk about how climate change influenced that day’s temperatures on any given day anywhere in the planet.”</p>



<p>To that end, the analysis used Climate Central’s <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-shift-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Shift Index</a>, or CSI, a system first described by the organization in 2022. CSI is a daily local temperature attribution system that uses a combination of observational data and climate simulations to determine the likelihood that local temperature variations are attributable to climate change.</p>



<p>Extreme heat is a relative term, dependent on both place and time. So, in this report, the researchers considered extreme heat for a given location to be daily temperatures that would have been in the 99th percentile for that place from 1991 to 2020 — temperatures, in other words, that locals would recognize as insanely hot.</p>



<p>Using that index with data from hundreds of countries, states, provinces and major cities, the researchers found that about 90 percent of the world’s population, or 7.3 billion people, experienced at least 10 days of extreme temperatures in the last year that were very strongly affected by climate change.</p>



<p>Those days had a CSI rating of at least 3, indicating that human-caused climate change made those temperatures at least three times as likely. Nearly 3 out of 4 people experienced over a month of those temperatures.</p>



<p>The report also reveals stark inequities in the burden of climate change around the world. Earth’s least developed countries, including many nations in sub-Saharan Africa and in Southeast Asia, had a relatively high average CSI of 2, the report notes, though they have contributed the least amount of fossil fuel emissions.</p>



<p>But climate impacts are also accelerating in many of the world’s richest countries, including the United States. The last 12 months saw brutal heat waves across much of the southern United States. Houston sweltered through a 22-day streak of extreme heat, where each consecutive day topped 38° C (100° Fahrenheit). That was the longest such extreme heat streak of the 700 cities examined with a population of at least 1 million people.</p>





<p>The CSI analysis is similar to the analyses performed by the consortium World Weather Attribution, or WWA, which looks for the fingerprints of human-caused climate change <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-heat-wave-summer">in specific extreme events around the world</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/23</em>).</p>



<p>WWA examined a handful of extreme heat waves over the last 12 months, all of which were strongly attributable to climate change, says Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who has led many of WWA’s attribution studies.</p>



<p>An immediate reduction of fossil fuels won’t shut off some effects of a century of emissions, including heat absorbed by the oceans or melted glaciers, Otto says. But global temperatures would stop rising, and heat waves would stop getting worse, she says. Keeping the planet below a 1.5-degree warming threshold “is in reach,” she says, “if we want it to be in reach.”</p>



<p>The last 12 months <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">saw the onset of an El Niño climate pattern</a>, which can bring higher global temperatures on top of the longer-term global warming trend (<em>SN: 6/15/23</em>). But the greatest temperature impact from El Niño generally takes a year or so to develop, as the heat gets disseminated around the globe, Pershing says.</p>



<p>The previous 12-month record was set from October 2015 to September 2016, as heat from a strong El Niño event spread around the globe. That record — where the global average was 1.29 degrees Celsius higher than the average preindustrial temperature — was tied earlier this year, for the period ending in September 2023.</p>



<p>That means that, as the El Niño pattern continues to develop into next year, 2024 will probably smash records once again.</p>

<p>A business school in Pakistan has fired a marketing professor after finding he had “damaged the repute” of the university and its scholarly journal, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a LinkedIn post, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230605074653/https://www.iba.edu.pk/faculty-profile.php?ftype=&amp;id=mmbutt">Muhammad Mohsin Butt</a>, the now-fired professor, shared a picture of the table of contents of a 2015 issue of <em>Business Review</em>, published by the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), in Karachi. The contents listed seven case studies authored by two other professors at the school:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two authors are still employed at IBA: <a href="https://oric.iba.edu.pk/profile.php?id=nafghan">Nasir Afghan</a> as an assistant professor of marketing, and <a href="https://www.iba.edu.pk/team-registrar.php">Mohammad Asad Ilyas</a> as registrar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal issue “once existed but was taken back immediately after its release internally,” the school’s inquiry found, although the articles’ authors and a former editor of the journal deny this action constituted retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://oric.iba.edu.pk/profile.php?id=habutt">Hilal Butt</a> (no relation to Mohsin Butt), chair of IBA’s finance department and the editor of <em>IBA Business Review </em>at the time of the LinkedIn post, replied with a link to the <a href="https://ir.iba.edu.pk/businessreview/vol10/iss2/">online table of contents</a> for the issue. The webpage showed different article titles and authors, and Hilal Butt wrote that “there is nothing published anything as reported.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Afghan, Ilyas, and Hilal Butt subsequently filed complaints against Mohsin Butt with IBA, according to a copy of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MB-inquiry-report.pdf">grievance committee report</a> obtained by Retraction Watch. Their complaints alleged that Mohsin Butt had posted “factually incorrect information” and publicly damaged “the reputation of the institute and its establishments,” as well as using “inappropriate language and an arrogant attitude.”</p>



<p>Mohsin Butt told the grievance committee he had posted about the issue because “he wanted to expose the corruption of both faculty members and expose the situation at the <em>Business Review</em>,” according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After investigating the matter, the committee concluded that the issue of <em>Business Review</em>&nbsp;&#8220;was once published but was taken back possibly due to multiple reasons, the major being the one that all seven case studies were authored by two faculty members namely Dr. Nasir Afghan and Dr. Asad Ilyas based on students work.&#8221;</p>



<p>The committee also found that Hilal Butt “constantly engaged in concealing the facts” and “took a faulty approach of outright denial of the existence of 10(2) issue of the <em>Business Review</em> that was replaced with the one now available on the journal website.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, IBA issued a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MB-warning-letter.pdf">warning letter</a> to Mohsin Butt in June that stated the grievance committee had determined Afghan and Ilyas’ complaints were “valid,” and he had violated the school’s code of conduct. The letter read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Committee has observed that your LinkedIn post has brought an eight-year-old internal matter related to IBA&#8217;s Business Review journal to public notice. You have deliberately highlighted only a partial view of the case besides using derogatory language which had simultaneously damaged the repute of IBA, the journal, Dr. Nasir Afghan, and Dr. Asad Ilyas.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The warning letter directed Mohsin Butt “to write an unconditional apology in a letter and on LinkedIn within 7 working days to Dr. Nasir Afghan and Dr. Asad Ilyas for damaging their reputation publicly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mohsin Butt did not issue such an apology. On November 2, IBA <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Employment-Termination-Letter-Dr.-Muhammad-Mohsin-Butt.pdf">terminated his employment</a>. The school has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In response to our request for comment, Afghan shared a letter from his lawyer to Mohsin Butt accusing him of defamation and threatening to sue if he didn’t apologize. “Matter is now court jurisdiction,” Afghan said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ilyas told us Mohsin Butt had complaints with IBA about subsidized housing, workload, salary, performance appraisal, and other matters.&nbsp; Because Ilyas’ office denied some of these grievances, &#8220;vindictive/vengeful smear/ bullying campaigns are being run to pressure the institute into giving preferential and against policy benefits.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mohsin Butt denied he had posted about the journal issue because of his grievances with the school. Ilyas’ “claims look like classical diversions from the core issue,” said Mohsin Butt, who has posted extensively about the case on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-mohsin-butt-61697b1/recent-activity/all/">LinkedIn account</a>. He initially posted the photo on LinkedIn because “I just thought its [sic] hilarious to share what they did.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ilyas and Hilal Butt disputed that anything inappropriate had happened with the journal issue, and said it had not been retracted because it had never appeared online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Anything that was never added to the literature and or body of knowledge cannot be retracted,” Ilyas told us. He explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Business Review Special Edition was cases on local businesses of Pakistan, which were submitted to the journal to be published as a separate “special edition”, not part of their regular research publications. The editor-in-chief disagreed with the idea of a special edition and asked to withdraw and cancel/destroy the copies printed. It was never added to any database, archived, uploaded on the website, etc. The editor-in-chief then asked to resubmit for the publication in regular edition to which both prospective authors didn’t agree as the concept was to build a local case repository rather than articles. Additionally, MBA students were recognized in the then-printed copies as well.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The committee investigating the complaints against Mohsin Butt “probably did not do a real in-depth background check on the reasons behind the cancellation of the special edition business review,” Ilyas wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He attached what appeared to be a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Email-from-Dr-Ishrat-Hussain.pdf">2016 email</a> from <a href="https://ishrathusain.iba.edu.pk/">Ishrat Husain</a>, then IBA’s dean and director, directing staff to “withdraw” the issue in which Ilyas and Afghan’s case studies had appeared. Husain has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All the copies of this edition should be returned and destroyed,” stated the email, which also called for the journal’s editor to be replaced and the editorial board “reconstituted.” The email continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Afghan and Mr. Asad [Ilyas] can submit these case studies to the new Editor who would arrange careful scrutiny by the peer reviewers. In case one, a few or all the cases are accepted for publication they should appear in the Case study section of the regular issue of Business Review. No special edition should be allowed in future as this dilutes the quality of the journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another email from Husain, sent earlier this year and seen by Retraction Watch, confirmed he “had instructed withdrawal of&nbsp; all copies of the issue within one hour of its coming out of the Press. Staff&nbsp; were asked to go from desk to desk of the recipients of the issue and get the copies&nbsp; back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hilal Butt, who was editor of <em>Business Review</em> from September 2020 until earlier this year, also told us the 2015 issue with the case studies “had never been issued by the IBA Business Review for the readers, it had never been deposited anywhere, therefore the question of retraction had never been raised.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal did publish a notice “after this episode,” he said. The notice, which appears on the journal’s general information <a href="https://ir.iba.edu.pk/businessreview/about.html">page</a>, states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please be informed that IBA Business Review has never released or archived any Case Studies/SPECIAL EDITION. All officially released volumes and issues of the journal since its inception in 2006 are accessible at https://ir.iba.edu.pk/businessreview, archived at Portico, and indexed in IDEAS, REPEC, JEL, EBSCO, DOAJ, and CrossRef.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hilal Butt further elaborated on his view of what constitutes a retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Now I need not to remind someone from the retraction watch that what retraction entails. But let me give my impression. In the world of academic publications/literature, the term Retraction refers to the process of correction of literature in the event a particular intellectual contribution (published material) is found to be plagued with some form of academic dishonesty, such as forgery, plagiarism and/or other forms of data manipulation etc. This Retraction can only be exercised if the intellectual contribution in question has already become part of the body of knowledge. This can only happen if a particular intellectual contribution is ever deposited to any online repository. If it is not deposited to any online repository, it cannot, therefore, be a part of the literature because it is not available in the public domain. Hence, it cannot be archived, it cannot be cited and would obviously not have any readership base. If something is not part of the literature, then how can a process of Retraction be initiated to correct it from the literature? Retraction, as per COPE, follows a prescribed procedure. First of all, the whole issue cannot be retracted (each case study or a paper has to be retracted on an individual basis). Secondly, Retraction necessitates an editor’s note. Thirdly, there have to be grounds to establish the case of retraction (as part of the formal retraction procedure) – such as forgery, plagiarism etc.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/head-lice-human-migration-evolution">Head lice hitched a ride on humans to the Americas at least twice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lice have been bugging humans for as long as our species has been around, and the insects’ genes record the story of their hosts’ global voyages, a study finds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lice DNA suggests that the scalp stowaways <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rode humans to the New World at least twice</a> — once from Asia many millennia ago, and again much more recently via European colonists, researchers report November 8 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>Head lice (<em>Pediculus humanus capitis</em>) can’t jump or fly. They can disperse only by crawling, leaving them closely tied to the movements of their human hosts, says Marina Ascunce, an evolutionary geneticist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service in Gainesville, Fla.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Ascunce and her colleagues analyzed DNA extracted from 274 head lice found on people from 25 locations around the world, comparing differences between 15 small sections of the louse genetic instruction book. The lice clustered genetically into two groups — one found in Europe and North America, and the other in Asia and Central America, the team found.</p>



<p>Central America’s link to Asian populations, the researchers suggest, is the result of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cave-mexico-stone-artifacts-humans-americas-early">humans crossing a land bridge into the Americas</a> many thousands of years ago (<em>SN: 7/22/20</em>).&nbsp;The other lice group prevalent in the Americas reflects the more recent colonization of the region by Europeans.</p>



<p>By acting as storytellers, lice may not be “all bad,” Ascunce says. “They can help us to see our history also.”</p>



<p>The strong genetic split between European and Asian lice was a surprise to Ascunce and her colleagues. Studying slower-evolving lice genes than what the team studied this time in future research might help researchers solve how that genetic rift formed and possibly yield insights into older events in human prehistory and the evolutionary changes spurred by them, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, studying lice evolution could provide a “fast-forward” perspective on the evolution of humans and other hosts because the bloodsucking parasites have faster generation times and mutation rates, says evolutionary biologist Andrew Sweet who was not involved in the new research. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“You might be able to see [evolutionary] patterns that emerge from the parasites before you would see them in the hosts,” says Sweet, of Arkansas State University in Jonesboro.</p>



<p>Using the team’s approach with other parasites, Ascunce and her colleagues say, could also tell researchers more about the evolutionary history of other host species that are currently poorly understood.</p>

<p><strong>Off to Mercury with a cold glance</strong> —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mercury-cold-glance"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;November 10, 1973</p>



<p>Mercury ho! Mariner 10 is on its way. Venus ho, too. Launched at 12:45 a.m. (EST) on Nov. 3, Mariner should pass within 3,330 miles of Venus on Feb. 5. It will then become the first spacecraft to use a technique … of letting the gravitational field of one planet bend its course around toward a second objective. That’s Mercury, of course, where it will arrive less than two months later.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Mariner 10 arrived on schedule, becoming the first probe to visit Mercury and map a portion of its cratered, moonlike terrain. The gravity assist that Mariner used to reach its destination is now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rendezvous-pluto">a trusted way</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-aiming-sun">get around the solar system</a> (<em>SN: 7/12/15; SN: 7/5/18</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/messenger-mercury">NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft</a> used gravity assists from Mercury, Venus and Earth to reach an orbit around Mercury in 2011, where the probe mapped the rest of the planet’s surface, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smallest-planet-yields-big-surprises">uncovered evidence of past volcanism</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-rock-sun-turns-out-have-ice">spotted signs of water ice and organic compounds</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/11</em>; <em>SN: 3/22/12; SN: 11/30/12</em>). </p>



<p>Today, the international <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">BepiColombo</a> mission is using gravitational assists from Mercury — following one from Earth and two from Venus — to steer itself into eventual orbit around the planet (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>). Beginning in 2025, BepiColombo will investigate Mercury’s innards and magnetic field.</p>
