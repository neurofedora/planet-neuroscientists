<p>Following our coverage this summer of a book with citations that did not exist, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/04/springer-nature-retracts-book-fake-citations-help-us-find-more/">asked you</a> to send us examples of other books with similar issues. One reader took the request as an assignment to find problematic texts.</p>



<p>Michał Wójcik, a Ph.D. student at the Free University of Berlin, saw a link to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/30/springer-nature-book-on-machine-learning-is-full-of-made-up-citations/">our article about the book</a> on LinkedIn. “I started thinking that it shouldn&#8217;t be that hard to check those references automatically,” he said. “I decided to just spend some time on it, and I had a prototype in a few hours.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Python script he wrote searches through books to verify the existence of each citation by checking if the DOI existed in Crossref. He told us he manually checked citations the script couldn’t identify by looking in other databases and searching on Google Scholar, which takes him between an afternoon and a whole day.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133193"></span>



<p>To pick the books, he said he searched for books published in 2025. “To various degrees of certainty, I checked 22 books,” he said. The two he sent to us “were particularly bad, I would say.”</p>



<p>The first of the two texts is about <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-96-5625-7">urban planning</a> for sustainable smart cities. It includes citations with substantial errors or to works that do not exist. The second, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-96-5625-7">on energy storage</a>, describes different technologies and their applications for electrical grids, and was translated, citations and all, into English by artificial intelligence. Both were published by Springer Nature, which also published the book we previously wrote about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we described in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/30/springer-nature-book-on-machine-learning-is-full-of-made-up-citations/">our coverage</a> earlier this year, large language models like ChatGPT <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41032-5">often generate</a> nonexistent and error-prone citations. <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/policies/book-publishing-policies#:~:text=AI%20Policies%20and%20Guidance">Publisher guidelines</a> often forbid wholesale generation of text by AI. However, AI may be used in other aspects of academic book publishing, like copyediting or translation, sometimes with disclosure requirements. </p>



<p>While Springer Nature started using AI to translate books experimentally <a href="https://group.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/archive-2023/first-ai-generated-book/26189712">in 2023</a>, it is not the only publisher pursuing AI translations. In March, the publisher Taylor and Francis <a href="https://newsroom.taylorandfrancisgroup.com/advanced-ai-for-book-translation/">announced plans</a> to start using AI to translate books into English. </p>



<p>The publisher has retracted <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-37105-9_49">individual</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-33957-8_24">chapters</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-37822-5">entire</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-86185-7">books</a> for references that could not be verified. In total, the Retraction Watch Database contains over 240 books with one or more chapters retracted for a variety of reasons by their publishers.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Wójcik’s script identified 40 references missing DOIs in the urban planning book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-97473-1"><em>Urban Morphology and Sustainable Smart Cities</em></a>. We looked into the book ourselves by checking the first 32 citations and were unable to verify 11 of them. Four of these cite documents from the Indian government that have since been taken offline. We contacted the listed authors of the remaining seven works, four of whom responded and confirmed they did not write them or there were substantial errors in the citation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am not sure if this is a fake citation of mine or another author,” Bogdan Ibanescu, a researcher at the Centre for European Studies, told us. Ana Lavalle, an author listed in another citation, confirmed she did not write the paper she was credited with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Manolya Kavakli-Thorne, a professor at Aston University in England, confirmed she did not write an article matching the one cited with her name. She told us one of the listed coauthors is her former Ph.D. student with whom she published multiple papers. “The names involved as authors are from one of those publications,” she said. “I believe this is an example of hallucinations of deep learning.”</p>



<p>Other citations had unusual errors. One citation correctly included an article’s title and journal, but added two extra authors. “That article was written by me only. Not sure why other authors were listed,” Jack Ahern, a professor emeritus at University of Massachusetts Amherst, told us.</p>



<p>One of the authors of this urban planning book, Gouri Sankar Bhunia, is an expert in remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems, according to the book’s preface.</p>



<p>“The citations in question may have arisen due to inadvertent oversight during the compilation and cross-referencing of multiple sources, particularly while integrating notes from various drafts,” Bhunia told us by email.</p>



<p>When asked if generative AI was involved in the writing process, Bhunia said, “we have made very limited use of an LLM tool (such as ChatGPT) in this book, and only for minor purposes such as checking grammatical consistency and verifying citation formats. The use was strictly confined to copyediting support and did not involve generating substantive content.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such use is permitted within <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/policies/book-publishing-policies#:~:text=AI%20Policies%20and%20Guidance">Springer Nature’s AI policies</a>, although the company states: “in all cases, there must be human accountability for the final version of the text and agreement from the authors that the edits reflect their original work.”</p>



<p>Bhunia said all the citations in the book “were prepared and verified by academic professional[s]” and not generated by AI. “While I am aware that citation inconsistencies can sometimes appear in manuscripts, I can assure you that any such errors, if present, are unintentional and purely human in nature.”</p>



<p>The spokesperson for Springer Nature told us the publisher was already investigating both books before we contacted them, “with the majority of enquiries having been completed at the end of August.” For the urban planning book, “a correction is being issued alongside the retraction of three chapters,” the spokesperson said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The second book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-96-5625-7"><em>Electrical Energy Storage Technologies and Applications</em></a>, was published in Chinese in 2020 and translated into English this year. The preface of the book states, “the translation was done using artificial intelligence. A subsequent revision was performed by the author(s) to further refine the work and to ensure that the translation is appropriate concerning content and scientific correctness.”</p>



<p>The citations are in English despite primarily referencing Chinese-language sources. Many do not include DOIs or functioning hyperlinks to the original sources. We were unable to find many of the original works from the references listed in the English-language version of the book. “I think the point of scientific references should be assuring that the reader can get to the resources if desired,” Wójcik said. “That is usually not possible if one translates the titles, especially since many of the references do not provide a (working) link or DOI.”</p>



<p>The first author of this book, Xisheng Tang, did not respond to our requests for comment. All three authors are affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, according to the book’s preface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher will issue a correction for the citations in this book, the Springer Nature spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Errors in book citations “are rare and experienced by all publishers,” the spokesperson for Springer Nature told us. “They are typically identified through a combination of editorial review, peer feedback, and post-publication scrutiny. While some issues may appear straightforward externally, they can be complex to detect — particularly when they involve a number of nuances.”</p>



<p>Wójcik told us he has continued to work on his script to detect sham references. He started using it on papers as well as books, and has checked around 100,000 to date. His script flagged about 1 in every 300 papers, though he has only had time to manually verify 150 of them so far. “Some have small issues like unresolved DOI or DOI entered with a dot at the end, but most have nonsensical references,” he said. “I think such a problem should not exist in scientific literature, especially since links to Google Scholar are provided in the online version, and they are just useless.”</p>

As we have reported, it can also mean researchers are <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">less likely to submit</a> to the journal, given universities rely on such metrics to judge researchers’ work for tenure and promotion decisions.</p>



<p>Clarivate put indexing for the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">on hold last September</a> for concerns about article quality, which the journal has been <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/24/cureus-its-reviewing-and-its-scholarly-impact-quotient/">criticized for</a> in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133190"></span>



<p>Cureus has retracted about <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">125 papers</a> since Springer Nature <a href="https://www.cureus.com/newsroom/news/159">acquired the title</a> in late 2022. Last year, the journal closed six of its academic channels critics described as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/21/mega-journal-cureus-kicks-out-organizations-critics-called-paper-mills/">dressed-up paper mills</a>, and has had to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/journal-retracts-article-for-plagiarized-images-after-trying-to-gag-researcher-who-complained/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/30/cureus-retracts-paper-for-plagiarism-following-retraction-watch-inquiries/">retract</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/05/cureus-reviewing-paper-alleged-to-plagiarize-lancet-article/">plagiarized</a> articles, as we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=cureus">previously reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August, <em>Cureus</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/29/mega-journal-cureus-halts-author-peer-reviewer-suggestions/">eliminated author suggestions</a> for peer reviewers in an attempt to decrease potential conflicts of interest. The journal has had authorship issues in the past, as we’ve previously reported. In 2021, a medical resident in New Jersey <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/03/19/meet-the-medical-resident-who-had-his-wife-peer-review-five-of-his-papers/">invited his wife</a> to review his papers without disclosing their relationship, resulting in five retractions. In 2019, another author <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/04/11/an-author-was-accused-of-faking-peer-reviews-turns-out-he-also-falsified-two-images/">faked reviewer accounts</a> for two well-known neurosurgeons and was discovered only after a routine editorial audit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rebecca Krahenbuhl, a communications manager at Clarivate, told us a journal is removed from the Master Journals List when it “no longer meets” 24 quality criteria. These criteria include appropriate citations, adequate and effective peer review, and primarily original scholarly content, according to the <a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/journal-evaluation-process-selection-criteria/">company’s website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Krahenbuhl also told us journals are typically on hold for an average of around six weeks, but in cases where publishers “engage” with Clarivate, the company allows journals to remain on hold for longer “to allow time for publishers to conduct their own investigations and take corrective action should they decide to do so.”</p>



<p>Graham Parker-Finger, the publishing director at <em>Cureus</em>, told us the journal was “very disappointed” in Clarivate’s decision and noted the journal would continue “to offer fast, affordable, trusted and quality-assured publishing for the global medical community.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/11-john-r-adler-jr-">John Adler Jr</a>., the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal, acknowledged our request for comment, and noted his nearly 16-year tenure as editor-in-chief would be ending this year. In<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-adler-1875b95_httpslnkdingknj-dyx-the-difficulties-activity-7388269231550849024-QJe9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAByWXIBtsn0tXWeQa9YSfv4kSeHd4MCfrg"> a LinkedIn post</a> dated October 26, Adler linked to <a href="https://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/abstract/9900/global_trends_in_the_neurosurgical_literature__a.1921.aspx">an analysis of neurosurgery papers</a> by country income group and wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The journal industry uses an &#8220;aura&#8221; of intellectual exclusivity to protect its obscene profits. Journals protect their business franchize [sic] through both excessively complex editorial processes (WOS, COPE), which notably lack any evidence of social benefit, and high prices, which in combination disadvantage authors from developing countries. Nothing scares the journal world more than democratizing journals. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

                Menopause is an important and inevitable life stage for most women; however, until recently, there was no research looking into how autistic women experience menopause. Do they experience it differently from neurotypical women? Do they have different symptoms, or do they have more severe symptoms? To investigate this, I conducted a systematic review with the aim of collecting and analysing the existing research and highlighting areas for further study.

<p>At the University of Technology in Baghdad,<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/17/exclusive-iraqi-university-forcing-students-to-cite-its-journals-to-graduate/"> students must publish papers citing the school’s own journals</a> if they wish to graduate, as we reported earlier this month. But down the road at<a href="https://uomustansiriyah.edu.iq/"> Mustansiriyah University</a>, one of Iraq’s <a href="https://www.scimagoir.com/rankings.php?sector=Higher+educ.&amp;country=IRQ">highest-ranked institutions</a>, researchers are facing even steeper citation requirements, according to new evidence we obtained.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3_09182025_publish-citation-reqts-Mustansiriyah-University.jpg">In a letter</a> (in Arabic) sent to the school’s six research centers on September 18, the university council requires researchers to be first authors on at least two “of the legal minimum of three research papers” they must publish every year.</p>



<p>Each of these papers must cite at least three articles other faculty members at the school have published in Scopus-indexed journals, as well as one or more articles in the university’s own publications.</p>



<span id="more-133185"></span>



<p>Doing so will contribute “to raising the level of research output and enhancing the university’s position in respected international publications,” according to the council, the school’s highest authority.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stuartmacdonald.uk.com/">Stuart Macdonald</a>, a visiting professor at the University of Leicester in England who has written about<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/05390184221142218"> citation gaming</a>, called the requirement “a new low.”</p>



<p>”Citation coercion is usually more subtle than this,” he told us. ”Perhaps Mustansiriyah University should be congratulated for being so open in its compulsory corruption.”</p>



<p>The newsletter Fraud Factor<a href="https://fraudfactor.substack.com/p/leaked-documents-reveal-systemic"> posted a translation</a> of the letter today, as well as additional documents on citation requirements for postgraduate students.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mustansiriyah-University-citation-reqts-sabbaticals.pdf">Another document</a> we obtained from Mustansiriyah’s College of Engineering sets out identical citation requirements for academics on research sabbaticals. In return for fulfilling the publication requirements, researchers will receive a letter of appreciation from the dean, the document adds. Such letters can earn faculty members extra points on their yearly evaluations, according to an Iraqi academic, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.</p>



<p>Mustansiriyah University did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Iraq has been on<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/dr-alaboudi-iraq-concludes-education-2025-conference-with-strategic-agreement-with-clarivate-amp-announcement-of-its-achievements-in-times-higher-education-world-university-rankings-2025-10-13-20"> a mission</a> to boost the rankings of<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/higher-education-thirtysix-iraqi-universities-obtain-top-scores-in-qs-arab-region-university-rankings-2026-2025-10-16-21"> its universities</a> and<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/during-1st-conference-of-editorial-boards-of-scientific-journals-dr-alaboudi-confirms-doubling-presence-of-iraqi-university-journals-in-international-publications-2025-09-10-19"> scientific journals</a>, which are increasingly<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/higher-education-announces-qualitative-achievement-with-rise-in-citescore-index-for-iraqi-journals-in-scopus-database-2025-07-08-23"> getting indexed</a> in influential international databases. Two of Mustansiriyah’s publications – the<a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijhm/pages/default.aspx"> <em>Iraqi Journal of Hematology</em></a> and the<a href="https://jeasd.uomustansiriyah.edu.iq/index.php/jeasd/about"> <em>Journal of Engineering and Sustainable Development</em></a> – are included in Elsevier’s Scopus, and the former also appears in Clarivate’s Emerging Sources Citation Index.</p>



<p>University rankings, which are often used for advertising, are tied to citation and publication counts. Many rely on Scopus data. While author self-cites are typically excluded, self-citation by institutions is not.</p>



<p>In a country where <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/09/deputy-minister-in-iraq-losing-papers-with-signs-of-paper-mill-involvement/">little or no funding is available</a> to do research, coercive citation may be less of a problem than the mere requirement for publications.</p>



<p>Some researchers “might become really afraid of getting fired, for example, because there is a pressure on them to publish,” said<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lokman-meho-72441131/?originalSubdomain=lb"> Lokman Meho</a>, a university librarian and professor at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, who has developed <a href="https://sites.aub.edu.lb/lmeho/ri2/about/">an index</a> to flag potential research-integrity problems at universities.</p>



<p>“They will do all it takes, even if it is cheating, even if it is unethical, to meet those requirements,” Meho said. “So this is where the government and the universities are incentivizing and forcing people to do unethical things.”</p>

<p>Six years after researchers called for the retraction of more than 400 papers about organ transplantation amid suspicion the organs used in the studies came from executed Chinese prisoners, journals are still working to clear the record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/15/journals-have-retracted-or-flagged-more-than-40-papers-from-china-that-appear-to-have-used-organ-transplants-from-executed-prisoners/">more than 40 papers were retracted or otherwise flagged shortly after the </a><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/2/e024473">2019 study was published</a>, by our count, only 44 of the 445 papers have been retracted to date. At least 17 of the articles marked with expressions of concern in 2019-2020 remain as such. </p>



<p>The analysis, published in <em>BMJ Open</em>, found more than 400 studies of organ transplants in China that didn’t report whether the sources gave their consent for donation, nor assurances the organs involved did not come from executed prisoners. As reported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/06/call-for-retraction-of-400-scientific-papers-amid-fears-organs-came-from-chinese-prisoners">by <em>The Guardian</em></a> in 2019, the study exposed “a mass failure of English language medical journals to comply with international ethical standards in place to ensure organ donors provide consent for transplantation.”&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDn8mkmWqIwC6fPt6bie0u2KNjQEs3u3t2KG7CwBnX0/edit?usp=sharing">Thirteen retractions this year </a>directly cite the Rogers paper.</p>



<span id="more-133168"></span>



<p>The latest retractions came October 10, when an Elsevier journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210740125001822">retracted eight studies </a>of liver transplants. The journal, <em>Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology</em>, was one of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBEVMvAo06yCwTyijJDnKAGDErGgM32W/view?usp=sharing">173 journals</a> named in the <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/2/e024473">2019 study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notices cite the 2019 paper and state the journal “contacted the authors to clarify concerns that pertinent details regarding the source of the organs used, consent of participating individuals, and ethical approval were lacking and/or unclear in the current article. The authors did not respond,” the notice continues.</p>

<p><a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/wendy-rogers/">Wendy Rogers</a>, a bioethics researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who led the 2019 study, told us the recent uptick in retractions may be the result of emails sent by a volunteer in late 2024 and 2025 to each of the named journals. The volunteer, Simone Francis, is the communications officer for the <a href="https://endtransplantabuse.org/">International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China</a>. Some journals didn’t reply at all “while others engaged to some extent,” Rogers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Elsevier confirmed the retractions in <em>CRHG</em> were the result of the organization contacting the journal in August 2023, which was when Elsevier first learned of the issue, the representative said. The “impacted journals promptly initiated an ethics investigation into the relevant publications,” the representative said, but noted “editorial decisions, including whether to retract, are made independently by each journal’s Editor-in-Chief.”</p>



<p>“The broader investigation remains ongoing,” the spokesperson wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/08/14/journals-retract-more-than-a-dozen-studies-from-china-that-may-have-used-executed-prisoners-organs/">As we reported in 2019</a>, Rogers and her colleagues did not follow up with any journals after publishing the call for retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rest of the 2025 retractions appear in four journals published by Karger, all of which note none of the authors responded to the journals’ requests for additional information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is deplorable that many journals have not retracted unethical transplant research in which the transplanted organs came from non-consenting prisoners of conscience who were killed in the process,” Rogers told us. “Journals have strict human rights and business obligations, which are breached by publishing research that raises credible concerns about human rights abuses.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogers also said journal editors are in a “strong position to raise the ethical standards of research by refusing to publish papers that raise concerns about human rights abuses, including organ trafficking and forced organ harvesting.”</p>
