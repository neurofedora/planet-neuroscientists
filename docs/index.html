              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seismic-waves-mars-core">Seismic waves crossing Mars’ core reveal details of the Red Planet’s heart</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mars’ heart is about the size of our moon, and almost twice as dense. Or so suggest the first observed rumblings from a Marsquake and meteorite impact to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217090120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross the Red Planet’s heart</a>, researchers report April 24 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The penetrative reverberations allowed researchers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">refine estimates of the core’s size, density and composition</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Nobody&#8217;s ever seen before a seismic wave going through [Mars’] core,” says seismologist Jessica Irving from the University of Bristol in England. “We waited for more than 900 days for one quake on the farside,” she says. Then “24 days later, there was … a meteorite impact.”</p>

<p>Both were captured by NASA’s InSight lander, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-dart-artemis-space-news-2022">monitored seismic activity on Mars</a> for four years, up until December 2022 (<em>SN: 12/20/22</em>). Over its 1,480-day career, the lander captured the quivers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-volcanic-activity-planet-nasa-insight">over 1,000 Marsquakes</a> and a handful of impacts (<em>SN: 11/3/22</em>). But in all that time, it detected just two rumblings on the planet’s farside.</p>



<p>Analyzing the core-crossing seismicity from the two events, Irving and her colleagues found that Mars’ heart has a radius of 1,780 to 1,810 kilometers with a density of about 6,200 kilograms per cubic meter. That radius is slightly smaller than previously estimated, and about half that of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">combined layers of Earth’s heart</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/23</em>). The cores of both planets comprise about half of their total thickness.</p>



<p>Moreover, the researchers inferred that Mars’ core is mostly made of a liquid iron alloy, with sulfur making up about 15 percent of its mass. A smattering of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon together comprise about 5 percent. The findings roughly align with some previous analyses of Martian meteorite compositions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rocky-planets-early-universe-james-webb-telescope">Rocky planets might have been able to form in the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rocky planets might have been forming since the beginning of the universe. A stellar nursery in a neighboring galaxy <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01945-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the right materials for such planet formation</a>, researchers report April 24 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The overall chemical makeup of the tiny galaxy, called the Small Magellanic Cloud, is akin to that of the early universe. The finding suggests that rocky planets might have been able to develop in the relatively pristine chemical environment that pervaded the cosmos just a couple billion years after the Big Bang.</p>





<p>The Small Magellanic Cloud is one of the Milky Way’s nearest galactic neighbors, though it’s very different from our galaxy. The tiny galaxy has a much lower abundance of heavy metal elements — such as iron, magnesium and aluminum — which are all crucial to the formation of rocky planets. This low-metal environment also mimics that of the early universe, an epoch before stars had enough time to forge the heavy elements and blow them out into space.</p>



<p>Because of the lack of these elements, astronomers have been unsure if rocky planets are able to form in the Small Magellanic Cloud. And previous telescopes did not have the ability to really probe young stars with a mass less than or equal to that of the sun, so astronomers couldn’t measure the star systems’ dust content, which is needed to infer if planets could be being born. But with the sensitivity of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, or JWST, astronomers can now gather more light and see smaller, fainter stars in greater detail (<em>SN: 12/7/22</em>).</p>



<p>Astrophysicist Olivia Jones and colleagues used an infrared camera on JWST to look at a region of the Small Magellanic Cloud called NGC 346, where young stars are forming. “It’s the first time ever we’ve really been able to look at how solar-size stars form in an environment akin to the early universe,” says Jones, of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.</p>



<p>The team detected signatures that suggest that lots of dust is orbiting and falling toward hundreds of stars in the region. As these dust grains orbit, they could begin to stick together and eventually accrete to create rocky planets. </p>



<p>“One of the things we would love to understand better is how the environmental context impacts star formation and then, later on, the planet-forming populations around those young, forming stars,” says Michael Meyer, an astronomer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Because the Small Magellanic Cloud is the nearest example of a cosmic region with a much different chemical composition than the Milky Way, he says, it provides the first touchstone to study how star and planet formation depend on the stellar environment.</p>



<p>The low-metal stellar environment in the Small Magellanic Cloud is comparable to that of faraway galaxies that were developing around 11 billion years ago. During this time, a period called “cosmic noon,” there was a surge of star formation throughout the cosmos. If rocky planets could be accreting around stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, the researchers suggest, such worlds could have been forming in the early years of the universe as well.</p>





<p>The young stars in NGC 346 are also relative lightweights. One reason scientists are interested in studying the possibility of planet formation around low-mass stars is because they are the most common type of stars in the universe and the longest-lived, says Penn State astronomer Kevin Luhman, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>“They offer the longest period of time in which life might form and survive on any planets around them,” Luhman says. “If the most common star in the universe lived for only a million years, then exploded, that would be kind of bad for life.” The fact that these types of stars can potentially form rocky planets, he says, is a good sign for life developing elsewhere in the universe.</p>



<p>Follow-up research will focus on determining what chemical signatures can be found developing around the stars, Jones says. This could clue the researchers in to what the chemical elements are that make up any rocky planets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vegan-leather-fungi-repair-mycelium">A vegan leather made of dormant fungi can repair itself</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine if a ripped leather jacket could repair itself instead of needing to be replaced.</p>



<p>This could one day be a reality, if the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202301875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jacket is fashioned from fungus</a>, researchers report April 11 in <em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>. The team made a self-healing leather from mushrooms’ threadlike structures called mycelium, building on past iterations of the material to allow it to fix itself.</p>



<p>Mycelium leather is already an emerging product, but it’s produced in a way that extinguishes fungal growth. Elise Elsacker and colleagues speculated that if the production conditions were tweaked, the mycelium could retain its ability to regrow if damaged.</p>





<p>That novel approach could offer inspiration to other researchers trying to get into the mycelium leather market, says Valeria La Saponara, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>Elsacker, a bioengineer now at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and her colleagues first grew mycelium in a soup rich in proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients. A skin formed on the surface of the liquid, which the scientists scooped off, cleaned and dried to make a thin, somewhat fragile leather material. They used temperatures and chemicals mild enough to form the leather but leave parts of the fungus functional. Left dormant were chlamydospores, little nodules on the mycelium that can spring back to life and grow more mycelium when conditions are prime.</p>



<p>After punching holes in the leather, the researchers doused the area in the same broth used to grow it to revive the chlamydospores. The mycelium eventually regrew over the punctures. Once healed, the hole-punched areas were just as strong as undamaged areas — however, the repairs were visible from one side of the leather.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="139" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline.jpg" alt="Three photos side by side of squares of light-colored leather being held by a hand from the top right corner." class="wp-image-3123876" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline-330x67.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123876">Chlamydospores are little nodules on fungi’s threadlike mycelium that can spring back to life.

Elsacker <em>et al</em>/<em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>, 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The technique could potentially go beyond a proof-of-concept and into commercialization in the next decade, says study coauthor Martyn Dade-Robertson, codirector of the Hub for Biotechnology in the Built Environment in Newcastle upon Tyne. But first, the team will need to make the leather stronger and determine how to control the chlamydospores’ growth. Otherwise, he says, someone could “walk out in the rain, and then all of a sudden find that [their] jacket is growing, or perhaps [has] mushrooms popping out of it.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/graphene-tattoo-heart-beat-pacemaker">A graphene “tattoo” could help hearts keep their beat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some tattoos truly make the heart go pitter-patter.</p>



<p>In rats, a graphene “tattoo” stuck to the heart could treat an abnormally sluggish beat. Like a futuristic pacemaker, the device <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202212190" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered electrical signals that kept the heart pumping properly</a>, scientists report online March 25 in <em>Advanced Materials</em>.</p>



<p>The electronic device is currently a proof of concept, but a version for use in human hearts could be ready for testing within five years, estimates Igor Efimov, a cardiovascular engineer at Northwestern University in Chicago.</p>





<p>Efimov and his colleagues have worked for years creating implantable devices that conform to the body. A main challenge is how to marry rigid electronics with soft, sometimes throbbing tissues. For most current pacemakers, doctors thread electrodes on long wires through a vein inside the heart. Every time the heart beats, some 100,000 times per day, the wires flex. Enough flexing, and the device eventually breaks, Efimov says. One solution is to use ultrathin materials that ride along with the heart’s movements, like plastic wrap clinging to quivering Jell-O.</p>



<p>In 2021, Efimov saw something that looked promising: a paper on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-00489-8.epdf?sharing_token=nwTP0SrhHXmUfkGcbRj9RdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OMiVvBkaLPGy4yVDu7PE_NOnMmd1OVU3W4IEZLpNRflOILz7IvTycNmeOtTcuBrTcqjvU9OtCQZj2zXEzCWjjStVULnhvf6DO6KuMw_pWVIsuPeHo7wSj4g5hbiMSegCA%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graphene devices applied to the skin like temporary tattoos</a>. Unlike the metal components often used in electronics, graphene is “atomically thin,” says Dmitry Kireev, a biomedical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin who developed the graphene tattoos.</p>

<p>Graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern — is an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worlds-thinnest-material-stretches-bends-twists">appealing material for biomedical use</a>, says Nai-Chang Yeh, a Caltech physicist who was not involved in the work (<em>SN: 3/14/14</em>). “Graphene is very flexible, it’s biocompatible, it’s highly transparent, it’s highly conductive and it’s mechanically strong,” she says.</p>



<p>But Kireev had never placed graphene tattoos on heart tissue before. Efimov contacted him and said, “Well, would you like to try? We can help.” The researchers teamed up and tested the devices in experiments on mouse hearts and inside living rats. In the rats, the heart tattoo could correct an irregular beat by sending pulses of electricity to the organ, the team reports.</p>



<p>The tattoos sandwich a transparent layer of graphene between sheets of stretchy silicone and ultrathin polymer. Gold tape connects the graphene to wires that run to a power source, which sends electricity through the device.</p>





<p>Future versions of the tattoo will be wireless, Efimov says, perhaps using a tiny antenna to pick up electrical signals from an external device placed on a person’s chest. And one day, Efimov envisions graphene electrodes the size of rice grains injected into heart muscle. Such miniature equipment could perform pacemaker duties without the typical clunky components.</p>



<p>That all might sound like science fiction, but the technology is almost here, Efimov says. “Now’s the time to develop it.”</p>

                <h2>PLOS Joins UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, PLOS joined over 290 other publishers in signing the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sdg-publishers-compact/">UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact,</a> an agreement to inspire action among publishers in advancing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by actively seeking and promoting scientific content related to the goals, as well as committing to sustainable actions across our business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SDG Compact provides a framework for publishers to work towards a more sustainable future by seeking and promoting content that advances the SDGs, as well as taking steps to enhance sustainable business practices. This includes a range of activities from how we work with partners, to the opportunities we provide staff to take personal action.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Since our founding in 2001 PLOS has worked to ensure any stakeholder can learn from, build upon, or apply trusted scientific knowledge to advance global progress. By signing the UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s compact, we recognize that Open Science is a critical accelerator for achieving the SDGs and tackling this era&rsquo;s greatest challenges. Through our participation, PLOS seeks to focus and expand the work we&rsquo;re already doing, share and learn best practices from other stakeholders, and collectively harness open research to improve lives across the planet</em></p><cite><strong><em>Alison Mudditt, </em></strong><em>CEO</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<h4>Advancing the SDGs through Open and trusted research</h4>



<p>A significant portion of the articles currently published in PLOS journals are applicable to at least one Sustainable Development Goal and we expect that percentage to grow in the coming years. As with the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new titles</a> we launched in 2021, the SDGs will continue to influence the development of our portfolio and our work with research communities to seek and promote research critical to the health of our planet and its people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the content we publish, the ways in which we surface research and how we represent the broadest spectrum of researchers matter greatly to the success of these goals&ndash; and scholarly publishing more broadly. PLOS is working to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-series">eliminate financial barriers</a> to Open Access publishing and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">partnering with research communities</a> around the world to co-create more equitable solutions for sharing research and ensuring<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> inclusive policies</a> shape our journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our commitment to Open Access and Open Science, we are helping researchers increase the real-world impact of their work by ensuring it can be shared, applied, and reused by anyone who needs it. That commitment extends to research artifacts such as data, protocols, and code that strengthen reproducibility and accelerate progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Representing PLOS and the alignment of our goals with the SDG Publisher&rsquo;s compact, we&rsquo;re pleased to announce Becs Kirk, Publisher, Portfolio Development at PLOS and HESI fellow will act as a spokesperson for PLOS in coordinating our activities and sharing resources with other organizations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>PLOS has a longstanding commitment to working with global research communities who are addressing societal challenges, and to focusing the development of our portfolio to support their needs. I&rsquo;m pleased to represent PLOS in further coordinating our activities and alignment with the UN SDGs. We&rsquo;re shaping journal content, representation on our editorial boards, and the tools we offer researchers to share and promote their work around best practices for advancing a sustainable and inclusive future for all.</em></p><cite><strong><em>Becs Kirk, </em></strong><em>Publisher, Portfolio Development</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<h4>Aligning as an organization</h4>



<p>The strength of PLOS has always been the passionate individuals&ndash;including staff, the researchers to shape our journals, as well as the partners we work with&ndash;who are committed to transforming research communication in ways that build a more equitable foundation for knowledge-sharing.</p>



<p>We strive to live our values inside out, by creating a diverse, collaborative, and conscientious organization that allows these initiatives to flourish. To drive forward our efforts in advancing these goals, we&rsquo;ll be appointing an SDG Steering Committee led by our CEO, Alison Muddit and drawing on the expertise of staff that have led our progress thus far in becoming a more sustainable and inclusive organization. More to come on this soon!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>We built our journal to influence and inform decision-making at every level of society through Open Science.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-peels-bananas">This elephant peels bananas, but only slightly ripe ones</a></h4>

              
                <p>Do you peel bananas from the top or bottom? One elephant goes with a third option.</p>



<p>When handed a slightly browning banana, Pang Pha, an Asian elephant at Zoo Berlin, will use her trunk to break the fruit, shake the pulp onto the ground, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00266-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discard the peel and then shove the pulp into her mouth</a>, researchers report in the April 10 <em>Current Biology</em>. The rare behavior, previously recorded in just a few elephants, could help shed light on how the animals learn complex movements.</p>





<p>When a zookeeper first told neuroscientist Lena Kaufmann of Humboldt University of Berlin that one of the elephants peeled bananas, she decided to test it out for herself.&nbsp;For weeks, Kaufmann and colleagues couldn’t get Pang Pha to replicate the behavior. That’s because the way the elephant eats bananas seems to depend on ripeness.</p>



<p>Pang Pha ate green and yellow bananas whole — peel and all. It was only when Kaufmann offered the gentle giant a brown-spotted banana that she revealed her peeling prowess. But the fruit can’t be too brown, Kaufmann’s team found. Pang Pha rejected completely brown bananas. Initially she would place them gently on the ground in protest. Now she throws them aside.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pang Pha, an Asian elephant at Zoo Berlin, uses her trunk to peel a slightly brown banana before eating it. She breaks the fruit, shakes the pulp onto the ground, discards the peel and then shoves the pulp into her mouth. Researchers think Pang Pha picked up the rare skill by observing her zookeepers.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the company of other elephants, Pang Pha surprisingly ate most yellow-brown bananas whole. She typically saved her peeling trick for the last banana during a social feeding session.</p>



<p>Pang Pha may have developed the peeling ability by observing her human caretakers, the researchers suspect. Elephants learning behaviors from people is extremely rare, the team says, especially a behavior this complex. None of the other elephants at the zoo — including Pang Pha’s daughter — have been observed peeling bananas. That suggests the skill isn’t easily learned from elephant to elephant.<br><br>The new study shows the value of studying individual animals, Kaufmann says. “There’s such a rich landscape of behaviors that we lose if we only look at what all elephants have in common,” she says. “If you look at each individual elephant, you can see that they’re able to do really amazing things.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cavern-west-antarctic-glacier-life">A massive cavern beneath a West Antarctic glacier is teeming with life</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The coastal plain of the Kamb Ice Stream, a West Antarctic glacier, hardly seems like a coast at all. Stand in this place, 800 kilometers from the South Pole, and you see nothing but flat ice extending in every direction. The ice is some 700 meters thick and stretches for hundreds of kilometers off the coastline, floating on the water. On clear summer days, the ice reflects the sunlight with such ferocity that it inflicts sunburn in the insides of your nostrils. It might seem hard to believe, but hidden beneath this ice is a muddy tidal marsh, where a burbling river wends its way into the ocean.</p>



<p>Until recently, no human had ever glimpsed that secret landscape. Scientists had merely inferred its existence from the faint reflections of radar and seismic waves. But in the closing days of 2021, a team of scientists from New Zealand melted a narrow hole through the glacier’s ice and lowered in a camera. They had hoped that their hole would intersect with the river, which they believed had melted a channel up into the ice — a vast water-filled cavity, nearly tall enough to hold the Empire State Building and half as long as Manhattan. On December 29, Craig Stevens finally got his first look inside. It is a moment that he will always remember.</p>





<p>Stevens is a physical oceanographer with New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Wellington. He spent 90 anxious minutes that day in Antarctica with his head buried ostrich-style under a thick down jacket to block the sunlight that would otherwise obscure his computer monitor. There, he watched live video from the camera as it descended into the hole. Icy circular walls scrolled past, reminiscent of a cosmic wormhole. Suddenly, at a depth of 502 meters, the walls widened out.</p>



<p>Stevens shouted for a colleague to halt the winch lowering the camera. He stared at the screen as the camera rotated idly on its cable. Its floodlights raked across a ceiling of glacial ice — a startling sight — scalloped into delicate crests and waves. It resembled the dreamy undulations that might take millennia to form in a limestone cavern.</p>

<p>“The interior of a cathedral,” says Stevens. A cathedral not only in beauty, but also in size. As the winch restarted, the camera journeyed downward for another half hour, through 242 meters of sunless water. Bits of reflective silt stirred up by currents streamed back down like snowflakes through the black void.</p>



<p>Stevens and his colleagues spent the next two weeks lowering instruments into the void. Their observations revealed that this coastal river has melted a massive, steep-walled cavern cutting as far as 350 meters up into the overlying ice. The cavern extends for at least 10 kilometers and appears to be boring inland, farther upstream, into the ice sheet with each passing year.</p>



<p>This cavity offers researchers a window into the network of subglacial rivers and lakes that extends hundreds of kilometers inland in this part of West Antarctica. It’s an otherworldly environment that humans have barely explored and is laden with evidence of Antarctica’s warm, distant past, when it was still inhabited by a few stunted trees.</p>

<p>One of the biggest surprises came as the camera reached bottom that day. Stevens gazed in disbelief as dozens of orange blurs swam and darted on his monitor — evidence that this place, roughly 500 kilometers from the open, sunlit ocean, is nonetheless bustling with marine animals.</p>



<p>Seeing them was “just complete shock,” says Huw Horgan, a glaciologist formerly at the Victoria University of Wellington who led the drilling expedition.</p>





<p>Horgan, who recently moved to ETH Zurich, wants to know how much water is flowing through the cavern and how its growth will impact the Kamb Ice Stream over time. Kamb is unlikely to fall apart anytime soon; this part of West Antarctica is not immediately threatened by climate change. But the cavern might still offer clues to how subglacial water could affect more vulnerable glaciers.</p>



<h4>What’s beneath Antarctica’s ice sheet?</h4>



<p>Scientists have long surmised that a veneer of liquid water sits beneath much of the ice sheet covering Antarctica. This water forms as the bottom of the ice slowly melts, several penny-thicknesses per year, due to heat seeping from the Earth’s interior. In 2007, Helen Amanda Fricker, a glaciologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1136897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported evidence</a> that this water pools into large lakes beneath the ice and can flood quickly from one lake to another (<em>SN: 6/17/06, p. 382</em>).</p>



<p>Fricker was looking at data from NASA’s Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, or ICESat, which measures the height of the ice surface by reflecting a laser off of it. The surface at several spots in West Antarctica seemed to bob up and down, rising and falling by as much as nine meters over a couple of years. She interpreted these active spots as subglacial lakes. As they filled and then spilled out their water, the overlying ice rose and fell. Fricker’s team and several others <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Siegert/publication/259427117_A_fourth_inventory_of_Antarctic_subglacial_lakes_Antarctic/links/550821bd0cf27e990e0915ce/A-fourth-inventory-of-Antarctic-subglacial-lakes-Antarctic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually found over 350</a>&nbsp;of these lakes scattered around Antarctica, including a couple dozen beneath Kamb and its neighboring glacier, the Whillans Ice Stream.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where are Antarctica’s subglacial lakes?</h3>



<p>Hundreds of subglacial lakes have been found scattered across Antarctica. Samples have been taken from a few (Lake Whillans is shown). Red circles show stable lakes discovered through ice-penetrating radar. Blue triangles show lakes that have been observed draining at least once.</p>

<p>The lakes provoked great interest because they were expected to harbor life and might provide insights about what sorts of organisms could survive on other worlds — deep within the ice-covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn, for instance. The layers of sediment in Antarctica’s lakes might also offer glimpses into the continent’s ancient climate, ecosystems and ice cover. Teams funded by Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States attempted to drill into subglacial lakes. In 2013, the U.S.-led team succeeded, melting through 800 meters of ice and tapping into a reservoir called Subglacial Lake Whillans. It was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lake-under-antarctic-ice-bursts-life">teeming with microbes</a>, 130,000 cells per milliliter of lake water (<em>SN: 9/20/14, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Horgan helped map Lake Whillans before drilling began. But by the time the lake was breached, he and others were becoming intrigued with another facet of the subglacial landscape — the rivers thought to carry water from one lake to another, and eventually to the ocean.</p>



<p>Finding these hidden rivers requires complicated guesswork. Their flow paths are influenced not only by the subglacial topography, but also by differences in the thickness of the overlying ice. Water moves from places where the ice is thick (and the pressure high) to places where it is thinner (and the pressure lower) — meaning that rivers can sometimes run uphill.</p>



<p>By 2015, scientists had mapped the likely paths of several dozen subglacial rivers. But drilling into them still seemed farfetched. The rivers are narrow targets and their exact locations often uncertain. But around that time, Horgan got a lucky break.</p>



<p>While examining a satellite photo of the Kamb Ice Stream, he noticed a wrinkle in the pixelated tapestry of the image. The wrinkle resembled a long, shallow trough in the surface of the ice, as if the ice had sagged from melting beneath. The trough sat several kilometers from the hypothetical path of one subglacial river. Horgan believed that it marked the spot where that river flowed over the coastal plain and spilled into the ice-covered sea.</p>



<p>In 2016, while visiting the area for an unrelated research project, Horgan and his companions detoured briefly to the surface trough to take radar measurements. Sure enough, they found a void under the ice, filled with liquid water. Horgan began making plans to study it more closely. He would return twice in the next few years, once to map the river in detail and a second time to drill into it. What he found greatly exceeded his expectations.</p>



<h4>Scientists map a subglacial landscape</h4>



<p>Horgan and graduate student Arran Whiteford of the Victoria University of Wellington visited the lower Kamb Ice Stream to map the river in December 2019.</p>



<p>After weeks on the Antarctic ice sheet, they’d grown accustomed to its monotonous flat landscape, their perception sensitized to even tiny ups and downs. In this context, the surface trough “looked like this massive chasm,” Whiteford says, “like an amphitheater” — even though it slanted no more dramatically than a rolling cornfield in Iowa.</p>



<p>It was a week of scientific drudgery, towing the ice-penetrating radar behind a snowmobile along a series of straight, parallel lines that crisscrossed the trough to map the shape of the river channel under the ice.</p>



<p>Horgan and Whiteford worked up to 12 hours per day, occasionally trading positions. One person drove the snowmobile, straining his thumb on the throttle to maintain a constant 8&nbsp;kilometers per hour. Two sleds hissed along behind. One held a transmitter that fired radar waves into the glacier below; the other held an antenna that received the signal reflected back off the bottom of the ice. The second person rode on the sled with the antenna, his eyes on a bouncing laptop screen making sure that the radar was functioning.</p>

HORGAN</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Each evening they huddled in their tent, reviewing their radar traces. The river channel appeared far more dramatic than the gentle dip atop the ice suggested. Below their boots sat a vast water-filled cavern with steep sides like a train tunnel, 200&nbsp;meters to a kilometer wide and cutting as much as 50&nbsp;percent of the way up through the glacier. The more they looked, the more it resembled a river. “It kind of meanders downstream,” Whiteford says.</p>



<p>All told, Whiteford made two weeklong visits to the trough, snowmobiling over from another camp 50 kilometers away. The first time he was accompanied by Horgan, and the second time by another graduate student, Martin Forbes.</p>



<p>After returning home to New Zealand in January 2020, Whiteford examined a series of old satellite images. They showed that the surface trough — and hence, the cavern — had begun forming at least 35 years before, starting with a blip at the very mouth of the river, where it ran into the ocean. That blip had gradually lengthened, reaching progressively farther inland, or upstream. Whiteford and Horgan <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JF006532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported the observations</a> in late 2022 in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</em> — along with their theory about how the cavern formed.</p>



<p>In other parts of Antarctica where the ice sheet protrudes off the coastline, scientists have found that the ice’s underside <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2018JC013987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is often insulated from the ocean heat by a buoyant layer</a> of colder, fresher meltwater. That protective layer is sometimes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a couple of meters thick</a>. But Horgan and Whiteford suspect that the turbulence of the subglacial river flowing into the ocean stirs up that protective layer, causing seawater — a few tenths of a degree warmer than the subglacial water — to swirl up into contact with the ice. This causes an area of concentrated melt right at the river’s mouth, creating a small cavity where warm seawater can intrude further.</p>



<p>In this way, says Horgan, the focal point of melting is “stepping back over time.” And the cavern gradually burrows farther upstream into the ice.</p>



<p>Whiteford used a different set of satellite measurements — which measured the rate at which the ice’s surface sank over time — to determine how quickly the ice was melting in the cavern below. Based on this, he estimated that in the upstream end of the cavern, the ice (currently 350 to 500 meters thick over the channel) was melting and thinning 35 meters per year. That’s an astronomical rate. It’s 135 times what has been measured 50 kilometers southwest of the cavern, where the ice floats on the ocean. The water temperature is probably similar at both locations. But the turbulence caused by the river transfers the water’s heat far more efficiently into the ice.</p>



<p>Horgan thinks that the cavern at Kamb also owes its dramatic height to another factor. Glaciers in this part of West Antarctica generally flow several hundred meters per year. So the melt caused by a flowing river beneath, over years or decades, would normally be spread out over a long swath of ice. This would erode a shallow channel rather than a deep cleft. But Kamb is an oddball. Around 150 years ago, it stopped moving almost entirely due to the cyclical interplay of melting and freezing at its base. It now creeps forward only about 10 meters per year. The melting is thus concentrated, year after year, in almost the same spot.</p>



<p>Back in 2020, all of this was still conjecture. But if Horgan and his colleagues could return, drill into the cavern and lower instruments into it, they could confirm how it formed. By studying the water, sediment and microbes flowing out of it, they could also learn a lot about Antarctica’s vast subglacial landscape.</p>



<p>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet covers an area three times the size of the Colorado River drainage basin, which sprawls across Arizona, Utah, Colorado and parts of four other states. To date, humans have observed only a tiny swath of this underworld, smaller than a basketball court — represented by several dozen narrow boreholes scattered across the region, where scientists have grabbed a bit of mud from the bottom or sometimes lowered in a camera.</p>



<p>Horgan was eager to explore more. With New Zealand already melting boreholes through ice floating on the ocean, drilling into this coastal river seemed like a natural next step.</p>



<h4>How did the hidden cavern form?</h4>



<p>On December 4, 2021, a pair of caterpillar-tracked PistenBullys arrived at the place where Horgan and Whiteford had visited two years before. The tractors had traveled for 16 days from New Zealand’s Scott Base on the edge of the continent, growling across a thousand kilometers of floating ice as they towed a convoy of sleds packed with 90 metric tons of food, fuel and scientific gear. The convoy lumbered around to the upstream end of the valley and stopped.</p>



<p>Workers erected a tent the size of a small aircraft hangar, and inside it, assembled a series of water heaters, pumps and a kilometer of hose — a machine called a hot water drill. Using shovels and a small mechanized scooper, they dumped 54 tons of snow into a tank and melted it. The workers then jetted that hot water through the hose, using it to melt a narrow hole, no wider than a dinner plate, through 500 meters of ice — and down through the domed ceiling of the cavern.</p>

<h3>The cavern’s size and shape</h3>



<p>This 3-D rendering shows the shape of the cavern, based on radar traces. Scientists think it is being carved back from the coastline as a river flowing beneath the ice meets the ocean and stirs up the water there. The 2-D illustration shows what a rough cross section at one point might look like, with ice above and ground beneath.</p>

<p>The sight of animals inside the cavern generated instant excitement among Horgan, Stevens and the other people at camp. But those first images were blurry, leaving people unsure of what the orange, bumblebee-sized critters actually were.</p>



<p>Workers next lowered an instrument down the borehole to measure the water temperature and salinity inside the cavern. They found the top 50 meters of water colder and fresher than what lay below — confirming that seawater was flowing in along the bottom and a more buoyant mixture of saltwater and freshwater was flowing out along the top. The cavern, says Stevens, “is operating quite like an estuary.”</p>



<p>But those measurements also presented a mystery: The water in the top of the cavern was only about 1 percent less salty than the seawater in its bottom, suggesting that the amount of freshwater flowing in through the river was “quite small,” says Stevens. It’s akin to a shallow creek that a young kid might splash around in. He and Horgan doubted that the turbulence caused by this small flow, even over 35&nbsp;years, could melt the entire cavern — roughly a cubic kilometer of ice.</p>



<p>A likely answer came from a set of samples collected from the floor of the cavern. Gavin Dunbar, a sedimentologist at the Victoria University of Wellington, lowered a hollow plastic cylinder down the hole in hopes of retrieving a core. As he and graduate student Linda Balfoort hoisted the cylinder back up, they found it streaked and filled with chocolaty mud — a strange sight in this world of pure white, where not a speck of rock or dirt can be seen for hundreds of kilometers.</p>



<p>As Dunbar and Balfoort X-rayed and analyzed the cores months later, back in New Zealand, their peculiarities became obvious: They were unlike anything that Dunbar had ever encountered in this part of the world.</p>



<p>Every core that Dunbar had ever seen from the seafloors near this part of Antarctica consisted of a chaotic jumble of sand, silt and gravel — a material called diamict, formed as the ice sheet advances and retreats over the seafloor, plowing and mixing it like a rototiller. But in these cores, Dunbar and Balfoort saw distinct layers. Bands of coarse, gravely material were interspersed with layers of fine, silty mud.</p>



<p>That alternating pattern resembled samples from steep seafloor canyons off the coast of New Zealand, where earthquakes sometimes trigger underwater landslides that sweep for many kilometers downhill. Each flood deposits a single layer of chunky material.</p>



<p>Dunbar believes that something similar happened under the Kamb Ice Stream, possibly in the last few decades. A series of fast-moving torrents gushed through the river channel carrying big gravelly chunks from somewhere upstream that later settled on the cavern floor. “Each of these [coarse layers] represents minutes to hours of sediment deposition” that occurred during a single flood, he says. And the fine, silty layers would have been laid down over years or decades in between the floods, when the river flowed languidly along.</p>



<p>These subglacial floods could explain how this small river carved such a large cavern, Stevens says. Those floods could have been 100 to 1,000 times as large as the flow rates that were measured during the 2021–22 field season.</p>



<p>No one knows when those events happened, but scientists using satellites to study subglacial lakes have <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/10/2971/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted at least one candidate</a>. In 2013, a lake 20 kilometers upstream from the cavern, called KT3, disgorged an estimated 60 million cubic meters of water — enough to fill 24,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p>



<p>Scientists would love to know whether that flood actually passed through this cavern. “Connecting this upstream to the lake system would be extremely cool,” says Matthew Siegfried, a glaciologist at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, who coauthored one of the reports documenting the 2013 flood.</p>



<p>Studying the outflow of this river could also answer other questions about the subglacial landscape upstream. “The vast majority of our knowledge of subglacial lakes comes from surface observations from space,” Siegfried says. But those satellite records, of ice bobbing up and down, permit only indirect estimates of how much water is flowing through. It’s possible, for example, that a lot of water passes through the lakes even when the ice above isn’t moving.</p>



<p>Scientists could also learn about the subglacial landscape by studying the sediment washed downstream. When Dunbar and his colleagues examined the coarse material from their cores, they found it full of microscopic fossils: glassy shells of marine diatoms, needly spicules of sea sponges, and notched and spiky pollen grains of southern beech trees. These fossils represent the remains of a warmer world, 15 million to 20 million years ago, when a few stands of stunted, shrubby trees still clung to parts of Antarctica. Back then, the West Antarctic basin held a sea rather than an ice sheet, and this detritus settled on its muddy bottom. These old marine deposits underlie much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and the few boreholes drilled so far suggest that the mix of fossils differs from one place to another. Those mixes could provide clues to how the flow of rivers changes over time.</p>



<p>To uncover the nuance of what’s happening in the cavern “is mind-blowingly cool,” says Christina Hulbe, a glaciologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who has studied this region of Antarctica for nearly 30 years. “That’s the outlet for a massively big river system, if you think about it.”</p>



<p>By studying the water, scientists could estimate the amount of organic carbon and other nutrients flowing out of the river into the ice-covered ocean. The landscape beneath the ice sheet appears to be rich in nutrients that might sustain oases of life in an otherwise famished biological desert.</p>



<h4>Scientists unveil an oasis of life</h4>



<p>Even as the cavern penetrates farther into the Kamb Ice Stream, it does not necessarily threaten the glacier’s stability. This part of the West Antarctic coastline is not considered vulnerable, because its shallow bed shields it from the deep, warm ocean currents that are causing rapid ice loss in other regions. But subglacial rivers pour out at many other points along the coastline, including some — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">like Thwaites Glacier</a>, roughly 1,100&nbsp;kilometers northeast of Kamb — where the ice is retreating rapidly (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Thwaites and nearby glaciers <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL082182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have collectively shed over 2,000&nbsp;cubic kilometers of ice</a> since 1992. They could eventually raise global sea levels by 2.3 meters if they collapse. Remote sensing studies <a href="https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/10.1144/sp461.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have documented over a dozen low, squat shield volcanoes</a> beneath this part of the ice sheet. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00242-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevated geothermal heat flow</a>, even from inactive volcanoes, is thought to cause high levels of melting under the ice sheet. That melting produces large amounts of subglacial water, which could render these glaciers even more vulnerable to human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>Horgan believes that what scientists learn at Kamb could improve our understanding of how subglacial rivers impact those other, rapidly changing coastlines of Antarctica.</p>



<p>But the most evocative discovery made at Kamb — in purely human terms — may be the blurry, orangish animals seen swarming near the bottom of the cavern. Stevens captured some clearer images a few days later and tentatively identified them as shrimp­like marine crustaceans called amphipods. To see so many of them here, Stevens says, “we really hadn’t expected that.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Video from a camera lowered into a hidden cavern beneath the Kamb Ice Stream showed animals, perhaps amphipods, swimming about. They may subsist in part on nutrients transported by a subglacial river.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Microbes like those previously found under the ice sheet in Subglacial Lake Whillans are known to eke out a living even in harsh conditions. But animals are a different matter. The deepest seafloors on Earth sit only 10 or 11 kilometers from sunlight, and animal life in those places is generally scarce. But the animals in the cavern are thriving 500 kilometers from the nearest daylight, cut off from the photosynthesis that fuels most life on Earth.</p>



<p>The amphipods and their supporting ecosystem must be subsisting on some other food source. But what? Observations in the Kamb ice cavern, combined with those at two other remote boreholes drilled in recent years, offer some tantalizing hints.</p>



<p>In 2015, researchers pierced the ice at another site 250 kilometers from the cavern, where the Whillans Ice Stream lifts off its bed and floats. In that location, a thin sliver of seawater, just 10&nbsp;meters deep, sits beneath 760 meters of ice. A remotely operated vehicle, or ROV, sent down the hole captured images of fish and amphipods.</p>



<p>John Priscu, a microbial ecologist at Montana State University in Bozeman who was involved in the drilling at the site, believes that the glacier itself is sustaining this ecosystem. The bottom 10&nbsp;meters of ice is packed with mud that had frozen onto the belly of the glacier many kilometers upstream. The mud had been dragged to its present location as the glacier oozed forward, 400&nbsp;meters per year. As the ROV navigated about, bits of that muddy debris constantly rained down, released as the ice’s underside slowly melted. That debris is rich in organic matter — the rotting remains of diatoms and other phytoplankton that sank to the bottom millions of years ago when the world was warmer.</p>



<p>“Those amphipods are swarming to the particulate matter,” Priscu says. “They’re sensing the organic matter falling out of that basal ice.” Or perhaps they may be eating the bacteria that live on those organics.</p>



<p>Because the Kamb Ice Stream is barely moving, the supply of dirty ice moving toward the sea is small. But the river flowing into the ice cavern may deliver the same subglacial nutrients that are found in dirty ice. After all, the water’s journey through a series of subglacial lakes down to the river’s mouth may take years or decades. Throughout that time, the river absorbs nutrients from the organic-rich subglacial sediments.</p>



<p>Indeed, when scientists drilled into Subglacial Lake Whillans in 2013, they found its water honey-colored — chock-full of life-sustaining iron, ammonium and organics. “What these lakes are pumping out may be a concentrated source of nutrients” for ecosystems along the dark coastline, says Trista Vick-Majors, a microbial ecologist at Michigan Technological University in Houghton who was involved in the drilling at Lake Whillans. She <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GB006446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has estimated that</a> the subglacial rivers flowing out from under Kamb and its neighboring glaciers may deliver 56,000&nbsp;tons of organic carbon and other nutrients to this section of the coastline every year.</p>



<p>More recently, in December 2019, a team from New Zealand led by Horgan and Hulbe drilled through the ice just 50 kilometers from the Kamb cavern, in a place where the Kamb Ice Stream floats on the ocean. There’s no dirty ice there and no nearby river outlets. The area resembled a famished seafloor desert; it was populated by single-celled microbes with little to eat, and few signs of animals were seen — only a few burrowing traces on the muddy bottom. Priscu sees this location as an exception that proves the point: Subglacial nutrients are the crucial energy source in this dark world under the floating ice, whether they are dragged forward on the undersides of glaciers or spilled out through subglacial rivers.</p>



<p>The mud and water samples collected from the Kamb ice cavern may provide a new opportunity to test that theory. Craig Cary, a microbial ecologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, is analyzing DNA from those samples. He hopes to determine whether the microbes in the cavern belong to taxonomic groups that are known to subsist on ammonium, methane, hydrogen or other sources of chemical energy that originate from the subglacial sediments. That might reveal whether such sources support enough microbial growth to feed the animals observed there.</p>



<p>The team also needs to measure the flow rate of the subglacial river that spills into the cavern, since that determines the nutrient supply. Stevens continues to monitor this thanks to a set of instruments left behind in the cavern.</p>

<p>As people were packing up camp on January 11, 2022, workers pumped more hot water into the borehole, widening it to more than 35 centimeters — and creating a dangerous pitfall. Stevens and his colleagues donned climbing harnesses, clipped into safety ropes and approached the hole one last time. They lowered a series of cylinders the size of caulking guns down the hole. These devices continue to measure the temperature, salinity and water currents inside the cavern, sending the data 500 meters up a cable to a transmitter that beams it home via satellite once a day. That data will reveal how the river’s flow changes over time. With luck, the instruments might even detect a subglacial flood gushing through.</p>



<p>“That would just be outstanding,” Horgan says. For many years, he had to content himself with seeing these rivers and lakes dimly, through the outlines of water on radar and satellite images. This is “one of the first times we’ve got to stand at a river mouth and observe it.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">For much of the past year, we and several colleagues in our field have been trying to convince a publisher to retract a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jwi.org/calendar/challenging-parental-alienation">Advocates are using</a> the text because it contains details on how to advance numerous laws in the United States and throughout the world. The text is also currently being <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/library/publications/questioning-scientific-validity-parental-alienation-label-abuse-cases">used to influence judicial decisions</a> that affect the lives of thousands of families.</p>



<p>The problem is, the work contains a massive amount of misinformation, misquoted sources, plagiarized text, and many other flaws.</p>



<p>We have been so disappointed with the failure of the publisher and the Committee on Publishing Ethics (COPE) to address our concerns and our request for retraction that we have decided to share our experience with the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126939"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On December 3, 2021, Routledge, part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group,&nbsp; published <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Challenging-Parental-Alienation-New-Directions-for-Professionals-and-Parents/Mercer-Drew/p/book/9780367559762"><em>Challenging Parental Alienation: New Directions for Professionals and Parents</em></a><em>, </em>which was edited by Jean Mercer and Margaret Drew. All of the chapter authors in the book have been staunch critics of parental alienation (PA) research and theory, the study of children who, as one of us (JJH) has written, are influenced by a parental figure to reject their other parent for reasons that are exaggerated or not legitimate during and after a divorce. The field has a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0001404">strong scientific basis</a>. Our group, comprised of scientists and practitioners working in the field of PA, purchased the book with the intent of writing a book review for a peer-reviewed journal.</p>



<p>We soon identified a pervasive amount of mis/disinformation about PA, overstated and distorted facts, mischaracterization of extant research, use of secondary and tertiary citations (and nonexistent ones), strawman arguments, and other techniques of science denial across all chapters of the book.</p>



<p>The problems were so extensive, we decided to write a thorough critique of the larger issues and submit a request to the publisher to retract the text from circulation, recall existing physical and digital copies, and issue a public statement that this action was taken. <a href="https://pasg.info/app/uploads/2023/04/Analysis-of-Mercer-Drew-2023-04-04.pdf">The critique and request for retraction</a> was endorsed by 45 organizations studying and working with families affected by PA.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Our organizations – the <a href="http://www.pasg.info">Parental Alienation Study Group</a> and the <a href="https://garipa.org/">Global Action for Research Integrity in Parental Alienation</a> – submitted our critique to Claire Jarvis, senior editor for health and social care at Routledge, and Jeremy North, managing director of books at Taylor &amp; Francis, on August 12, 2022.&nbsp; We also attached a letter that included the following statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is not simply a difference of opinions among professionals with contrasting perspectives on a controversial topic. Rather, our critique centers on factual errors such as distortions of the writings and opinions of other scholars.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Two weeks later, Jarvis responded by stating that the original proposal for the book “was externally reviewed by experts in the field and received two supportive endorsements. Although we appreciate that the field is a contested one, we are happy with the book’s content and will not be withdrawing it from sale.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Realizing that Jarvis and North were not going to address our concerns, we contacted COPE on August 28, 2022. We asked specifically for help obtaining information about the procedures followed by the publisher to reach their decision to publish the book, and to gain assistance facilitating communication and resolution with Routledge. We were informed by Alysa Levine, operations manager at COPE, that we were required to refrain from posting anything about the case while it was under review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A week later, Iratxe Puebla, facilitation and integrity officer at COPE, emailed Jarvis and Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics and integrity at<strong> </strong>Taylor &amp; Francis. Her email stated that COPE’s role was to provide guidance on whether any procedures were followed, or actions taken that were inconsistent with COPE practices or guidelines. She wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Bernet has raised concerns that the book mentioned contains errors and inaccuracies about parental alienation. Dr. Bernet considers that the publisher should consult independent experts in assessing his concerns and withdraw the book from publication. We include below a summary of the concerns raised by Dr. Bernet.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Puelba asked Jarvis and Alam about the review process for the book, and how the publisher and its employees handled concerns about the work. She asked for an update on the current status of the follow-up with us, and whether a resolution had been reached regarding the concerns about the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In mid-September, Jarvis briefly responded to Puebla and Bernet with the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have further discussed this concern with our editorial and publishing directors. They asked me to reiterate the first reply we gave to you which was that we are happy with the reviews we obtained for this project and also with the academic credentials of both editors. Because of this, we will not be withdrawing this book from sale.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Immediately after receiving this message, Bernet responded by pointing out that there still appeared to be no attempt to investigate the concerns we raised about the book, that we had no information about who specifically conducted the reviews of the project or how the reviewers were selected, and that she did not seem to be aware the book’s chapter authors have spent years <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15379418.2018.1557578">publishing derogatory comments and falsehoods about PA</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On September 16, 2022, Puebla emailed to notify us that she had raised our correspondence with Jarvis to the attention of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee at COPE, who would review the matter. She said she would be in touch in “due course.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the next 3 months, Puebla repeatedly asked Jarvis to provide a response to the issues raised in her initial email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jarvis did not respond to any of the requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After Jarvis and her colleagues at Routledge and Taylor &amp; Francis ignored the third deadline that COPE imposed on them, we emailed Puebla on November 28.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time, we brought to her attention a <a href="https://drpeterwilmshurst.wordpress.com/2022/11/15/has-cope-membership-become-a-way-for-unprincipled-journals-to-buy-a-fake-badge-of-integrity/">blog</a> recently posted by Peter Wilmshurst, a cardiologist and whistleblower. In it, Wilmshurst asked, “Has COPE membership become a way for unprincipled journals to buy a fake badge of integrity?”&nbsp;His point was that COPE may be unable or unwilling to sanction large publishers because COPE needs the funds these publishers pay as membership dues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taylor &amp; Francis is a <a href="https://publicationethics.org/category/publisher/taylor-and-francis">member of COPE</a>, and presumably a substantial payer of <a href="https://publicationethics.org/cope-membership-subscription-fees#PublisherJournal">dues</a>.&nbsp;We explicitly asked whether there was any hope that Puebla’s office could help us resolve our disagreement with Taylor &amp; Francis. If COPE was powerless to help sort this out, we needed to know so that we could proceed with another approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day later, Puebla replied stating she raised the email to the attention of relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After receiving no additional response, we again emailed Puebla on December 16, reviewing the chain of events described above. We asked, again, what the next step was—if any. Her response:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This matter is under discussion by relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee. I should note that the COPE office will be closed for a good part of the next two weeks and thus, we may only be able to provide a further update in January.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On January 1, 2023, we emailed Puebla again, this time with information about a new peer-reviewed paper published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bsl.2605"><em>Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law</em></a><em>. </em>The article detailed vast misinformation about PA that has been published and then republished since 1994. We pointed out that four chapters from <em>Challenging Parental Alienation </em>contained this misinformation, something our critique cited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our point was that the errors we identified in the book were not random or accidental. Rather, they represent a larger campaign by the editors and authors of the book to discredit PA research and theory. The chapter authors in the book have made the same false statements in other journal articles, book chapters, formal presentations, and government documents. The conveying of disinformation needs to be interrupted, and that is why we were seeking retraction. We asked again what the next steps are and wrote that it seemed Routledge’s membership in COPE should be suspended for failure to respond to COPE’s inquiries.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Exactly one month later, after receiving no response from Puebla, we emailed her again. We provided an outline of our correspondence regarding the matter since August 12, 2022. We informed her that during the time of this inquiry process, the editors of <em>Challenging Parental Alienation</em> have been promoting the book through book reviews in journals, websites, and government documents in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We again asked her for suggestions on how to resolve our dispute with the publishers, whether they had given up all discussion and negotiations with them, and whether COPE was ready to recommend suspending Routledge’s membership for failure to comply with COPE’s basic expectations regarding the resolution of serious complaints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, we asked whether she was ready to proceed with the next step in COPE’s flow chart of processes for handling this type of problem, which was that the Subcommittee member and Facilitation and Integrity Officer would review all correspondence and draft a report. We also asked whether we could start to share our concerns on social media and other outlets.</p>



<p>On February 4, Puebla responded to say that she, again, had raised the correspondence to the attention of relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee and would be in touch as they provided advice. This is the last communication we have had with COPE.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><strong></strong>Ironically, Routledge has published several books that present PA theory in a responsible, positive manner. But now they have published an extremely negative book replete with misinformation that directly contradicts their previous books on the topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We remain concerned that the publisher has refused to retract a book with obviously false and misleading material—which we believe is likely to damage children and families in many countries—and that COPE seems powerless to intervene.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>NeuroAI is the budding research field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. One of the core concepts used in the field is that artificial neural networks can act as good models of the brain. For example, it’s often claimed that convolutional neural networks can account for the response of the ventral visual stream to images. Similarly, large language models have been found that capture what’s going on inside the language network of the brain. When I have discussions with people outside of our narrow field, this often triggers surprise. Wait, how can a deep neural network be like the brain? What does it mean to be a good model? How can the squishy stuff be like the silicon?</p>



<p>Here I want to get into the specifics of how, mechanically, you compare a brain to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). I give some historical background first, focusing on classic results and methods that originated in the field of visual perception. I will explain the nitty gritty of how correspondence scores between brains and ANNs are calculated. I discuss some of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the classic methods of linear regression and RSA, and explain some of the proposed alternative metrics in Williams et al. (2021). You’ll get the most out of these sections if you’re coming from a math background: statistician, data scientist, computational neuroscientist, etc. Nevertheless, if you’re less math-oriented, I will give intuitive explanations so you can follow along. I conclude with a call to create and use more nuanced and detailed comparisons between brains and neural nets.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">History: the visual ventral stream as a convolutional neural net</h1>



<p>Let’s start with the classic example of convolutional neural networks vs. the ventral visual stream. In the late 80’s, Yann LeCun was inspired by the classic work of Hubel and Wiesel on the physiology of the visual cortex. He created a neural network consisting of sandwiched layers of selectivity and invariance operations, not unlike the simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex. His network, LeNet, was the first example of a convolutional neural net (CNN) trained with gradient descent, and it could classify handwritten digits. Two decades later, this work was then greatly scaled up by Alex Krizhevsky and co. in Geoff Hinton’s lab at the University of Toronto. AlexNet led to the ImageNet moment, in 2012, where a CNN did far better than state-of-the-art classical machine learning methods at image classification, showing that “deep learning has arrived”.</p>



<p>If CNNs were inspired by the brain, and they do the same thing as a brain (image classification), could they be a little like the brain? If it talks like a duck, and it walks like a duck, is it a duck? This is a surprisingly subtle question, and two teams (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1403112111">Dan Yamins in Jim DiCarlo’s</a> lab, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003915">Khaligh-Razavi in Niko Kriegeskorte’s</a>) answered this question with a vigorous “yes, maybe!?” in 2014. They looked at the responses of the ventral visual stream—areas of the brain traditionally associated with shape perception and image classification—and compared them against the ANNs of the time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The mechanics of comparing a brain to an ANN</h2>



<p>So how did they compare a brain to an ANN? They followed what’s now considered a classic recipe. You need three inputs:</p>



<ol>
<li>an ANN trained for some task (e.g. visual classification)</li>



<li>a brain (human or non-human)</li>



<li>a set of benchmark stimuli (e.g. a set of images, sentences, videos, etc.)</li>
</ol>



<p>You then proceed as follows:</p>



<ol>
<li>You probe the ANN with all the benchmark stimuli. You obtain a matrix of responses <strong>X</strong>. Each row is one stimulus (=one image, one movie clip, one sentence, etc.). Each column corresponds to a subunit of the neural network (e.g. the collected intermediate activations of the ANN).</li>



<li>You do the same with the brain. That means, for instance, having someone sit inside the scanner, looking at the same set of images that the neural network was exposed to, and you recording their functional responses. You collect the data into a new matrix. The rows are again exemplars, but now the columns represent something else: physical neurons, EEG sensors, fMRI voxels, etc. This gives us a matrix of responses <strong>Y</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>By construction, <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> have the same number of rows, but different column counts. We’ve thus reduced the problem of comparing a brain and an ANN to the problem of comparing two matrices of different shapes.</p>



<p>There are two now classic ways of doing this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Linear regression: Do multiple linear regression to map one matrix onto the other. Learn a weight matrix <strong>W</strong> such that the residual ||<strong>Y</strong> &#8211; <strong>XW</strong>|| is minimized. This requires some regularization: Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes the sum-of-squares of <strong>W</strong>, might help here. An alternative is to require that the mapping is low-rank using partial least-squares with a limited number of components. This is the path used by Yamins &amp; DiCarlo. The final score is the R2 of the linear regression, perhaps calculated through cross-validation (CV).</li>



<li>Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA): One difficulty with the previous method is that it requires learning a weight vector <strong>W</strong>. This is necessary, in part because the dimensionality of the two matrices might be different. If we form the matrices <strong>XX</strong>’ and <strong>YY</strong>’, however, we obtain two square matrices of the same size. Furthermore, these matrices are invariant to a relabeling (permutation) of the columns. Thus, we can compare the elements of the two similarity matrices via a correlation coefficient. Technically, you could have a negative score, but you could threshold or square to get a score in the 0-1 range. This <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full">is the method pioneered by Niko Kriegeskorte back in 2008</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>These procedures will result in two distinct scores for the similarity of matrices: the linear regression score (really, CV R2) and the RSA score. Both have the property that 0 is maximally misaligned and 1 is maximally aligned. This way, we have reduced the difficult philosophical question of what it means for a brain to be like an ANN to a problem of <em>big number good, small number bad.</em></p>

<p>Using these tools, the two historical papers came to similar conclusions: deep neural nets trained on images have similar representations to the ventral visual stream of the brain. For the Yamins paper, it was with linear regression and with single-cell neurophysiology; for Khaligh-Razavi, it was RSA on fMRI data.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conceptual difficulties with comparing brains and ANNs</strong></h1>



<p>Procedures to map brains to ANNs like linear regression and RSA swap out deep philosophical issues about the nature of perception with a technocratic procedure. In fact, there’s a lot that hides under these scoring procedures.</p>



<p>Both methods are <em>correct</em> at the extremes: if you try to compare two random matrices against each other, you’ll get a score of 0; and if you compare a brain (or an ANN) against itself, you’ll get a score of 1. So a brain is similar to itself but not to random noise: cool. That’s a pretty low bar to achieve, and it’s in the middle scores that we run into conceptual difficulties. What does a 0.5 similarity between the brain and an ANN mean? What are we actually trying to quantify?</p>

<p>There are different ways in which we can conceptualize how the brain can be like an ANN. Let’s name some of these ways:</p>



<ol>
<li>We could ask for a 1-to-1 correspondence: each subunit in the ANN should correspond to a neuron in the brain. That’s a very high bar to clear! Let’s call this 1-to-1 correspondence.</li>



<li>We could ask that distances are preserved in the brain and in the ANN. An analogy in 3d will help. Two three-dimensional shapes (say, rubber duckies, above) can be similar, regardless of their (arbitrary) orientation. Distances between two points on the surface of the duckies are preserved: they are invariants. Let’s call this orthogonal correspondence.</li>



<li>We could ask that one manifold of responses can be morphed into another through a linear transformation. Let’s call this linear correspondence.</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s not clear how traditional linear regression and RSA scores map to these desiderata. You can make a verbal argument that linear regression is similar to linear correspondence (2), while RSA is most similar to orthogonal correspondence (2). However, there are complications in real implementations: regularization in linear regression, selection of voxels with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio in RSA. This means that we might not capture our (unstated) goals in complex ways.</p>



<p>Traditionally, these concerns have been more or less swept under the rug, and each subfield has converged on its own widely agreed-upon scores: RSA for human neuroscience, linear regression for single-cell neurophysiology. The argument goes that whatever score we choose, alternative scores would correlate with it. This encourages papers from using whatever is the most commonly used score in their subfield, which allows the scores to be compared more readily from paper to paper. A perfectly reasonable heuristic, but a little unsatisfying.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Williams et al.&#8217;s solution: computational shape analysis</strong></h1>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14739">Williams et al. (2021)</a> offer a nice treatment of these issues with some good conceptual solutions, casting the problem as one of computational shape analysis: analyzing shapes in high-dimensional spaces with statistical tools.</p>

<p>First, they project the two representations (brain and ANN) onto a fixed, common-sized representation. You could use random projections, subsampling, PCA, etc. to get two matrices with different widths to the same width. Call the resulting matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;hat{&#92;bold{X}}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;hat{&#92;bold{Y}}" class="latex" />. One of their proposed distances is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;min_{T &#92;in G} ||&#92;hat{&#92;bold{X}} - &#92;hat{&#92;bold{Y}}||" class="latex" />. <strong>T</strong> is a transformation within some group <em>G</em> that captures what is it that we mean by “same”. Some potential choices:</p>



<ol>
<li>If you want one-to-one correspondence between the brain and ANN, <em>G</em> can be the set of all permutation matrices</li>



<li>If you want distances to be preserved, then <em>G</em> can be the orthonormal matrices</li>



<li>If you want to allow squishing along arbitrary linear dimensions, you can let <em>G</em> be arbitrary linear transformations</li>
</ol>



<p>It turns out the resulting scores are proper distances that respect the triangle inequality, which has some nice benefits for clustering. They also introduce more metrics for more unusual scenarios. For example, for convolutional neural networks, you’d want something that allows remapping along the channel dimension, but not along the space dimension. Although each metric seems like it requires a brute-force search, it turns out there are clever ways of calculating the optimal transformations in each scenario.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The advantage of axiomatic methods</h1>



<p>Overall, Williams et al. take cues from the recent success of geometric deep learning (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478">Bronstein et al. 2021</a>) to ask deep questions about the metrics we use. More than just an incremental numerical improvement, I think it’s a big conceptual improvement over linear regression and RSA: you know what you’re getting into. An axiomatic approach tells you very explicitly what the underlying assumptions are.</p>



<p>Ironically, this makes it easier to poke holes in some of these scores. For instance, one of the core desiderata that Williams et al. fulfill is that their chosen score should be symmetric. Now, I would argue that a brain can be more similar to a neural network than vice-versa. Modern large language models (LLMs) represent more stuff than humans: GPT-4 knows markdown, latex, English, German, how to write listicles and poems and sound like a pirate. Most people can only do a subset of these things. Divergences for distributions are naturally asymmetric, so there’s nothing inherently fishy about a score that is asymmetric. I’m sure there is a variant of linear regression’s asymmetric R2 which can be properly axiomatized according to the framework laid out by Williams et al.</p>



<p>In the meantime, one can use combinations of these well-justified metrics to answer interesting questions about how brains vs. ANNs represent information. For example, the delta between linear correspondance (metric 3) and the orthogonal correspondance (metric 2) is an index about how much warping is necessary to get two latent spaces to match. This could help reveal whether a brain’s representation is <em>a subset of</em> or <em>a noisy approximation of</em> a particular artificial neural net, which is ambiguous for each individual metric. Williams et al. have made their metrics available in <a href="https://github.com/ahwillia/netrep">this Python package</a>, so you can try this out yourself.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Discussion</h1>



<p>For all their justification, we haven’t seen much empirical work using well-axiomatized scores beyond linear regression and RSA. I think the reason for the status quo is that we’ve been focused on coarse characterizations thus far. This will surely need to change as we go beyond <em>ANNs as metaphors for the brain</em> and start using them as <em>in silico models</em> of the brain.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://xcorr.net/2022/05/18/whats-the-endgame-of-neuroai/">I’m interested in using ANNs as models for the brain for the purpose of neural engineering</a>. What I really want is that when I create a virtual lesion in a neural network, it predicts how the real brain will react to a real lesion. Such a <em>causal manipulation score</em> doesn’t yet exist, but I think it would be both conceptually and practically useful. The axiomatic approach of Williams et al. points us towards ways of building this type of score.</p>



<p>For other purposes, however, it may be that the metrics we have are good enough. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.16.537080v1">This recent paper from Tuckute et al.</a> shows that one can learn a transfer function between a large language model and the brain’s language network using linear regression. The model can predict which sentences drive or don’t drive the brain. Using in silico models to predict the response of the brain is helpful in this scenario, and in a certain meaningful sense it means that the brain <em>is like a neural network</em>, along this prediction axis, but perhaps not according to more stringent criteria.</p>



<p>The work from Williams et al. is just one of a number of recent approaches looking at this problem in depth. We’ve seen <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11665">some of the same authors extend this work to stochastic representations</a>. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/01/01/2022-in-review-neuroai-comes-of-age/">Furthermore, empiricists have pointed out problems that current metrics don’t capture</a>, for example, hierarchical correspondence. I think it’s an exciting time to think deeply about our metrics and what it really means for a brain to be like an ANN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/plos-genetics-to-launch-microbial-section/">PLOS Genetics to launch Microbial Section</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, April 20 at 2pm Eastern</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; PLOS today announced that<em> PLOS Genetics </em>is expanding the scope of its journal with a renamed section called <em>Microbial Genetics. </em>This section will replace the former Prokaryotic Genetics section to emphasize research on microbes more broadly with the aim to publish studies that use genetic approaches to provide insights into how bacteria as well as archaea and their phages/viruses, fungi (including yeasts and filamentous fungi), and protists function and interact with the biotic and abiotic world.</p>



<p><em>PLOS Genetics</em> has an established presence in the fungal genetics community, but this research has not easily found a home within its existing journal sections. Currently, the majority of these submissions, primarily studies in yeast, are handled within the General section of the journal. The new microbial section will rectify that issue.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We believe the new <em>Microbial Genetics</em> section will provide a logical new home for these submissions and reaffirm our continued support for this type of research,&rdquo; said Gregory Copenhaver, Co Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are excited that the relaunch of this section will include a Curated Collection for malaria-related research, which will also include other protozoan parasites,&rdquo; said Gregory Barsh, Co Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Genetics.</em></p>



<p>The new section on Microbial Genetics will be headed by Geraldine Butler, Eva Stukenbrock, Lotte S&oslash;gaard-Andersen and Sean Crosson. These four section editors are supported by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/editorial-board">associate editors</a> with broad expertise in microbial genetics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jellyfish-nervous-system-animal">Comb jellies have a bizarre nervous system unlike any other animal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Shimmering, gelatinous comb jellies wouldn’t appear to have much to hide. But their mostly see-through bodies cloak <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade5645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a nervous system unlike that of any other known animal</a>, researchers report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>In the nervous systems of everything from anemones to aardvarks, electrical impulses pass between nerve cells, allowing for signals to move from one cell to the next. But the ctenophores’ cobweb of neurons, called a nerve net, is missing these distinct connection spots, or synapses. Instead, the nerve net is fused together, with long, stringy neurons sharing a cell membrane, a new 3-D map of its structure shows.</p>





<p>While the nerve net has been described before, no one had generated a high-resolution, detailed picture of it.</p>



<p>It’s possible the bizarre tissue represents a second, independent evolutionary origin of a nervous system, say Pawel Burkhardt, a comparative neurobiologist at the University of Bergen in Norway, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Superficially similar to jellyfish, ctenophores are often called comb jellies because they swim using rows of beating, hairlike combs. The enigmatic phylum is considered one of the earliest to branch off the animal tree of life. So ctenophores’ possession of a simple nervous system has been of particular interest to scientists interested in how such systems evolved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous genetics research had hinted at the strangeness of the ctenophore nervous system. For instance, a 2018 study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0575-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t find a cell type in ctenophores</a> with a genetic signature that corresponded to recognizable neurons, Burkhardt says.</p>



<p>Burkhardt, along with neurobiologist Maike Kittelmann of Oxford Brookes University in England and colleagues, examined young sea walnuts (<em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>) using electron microscopes, compiling many images to reconstruct the entire net structure. Their 3-D map of a 1-day-old sea walnut revealed the funky synapse-free fusion between the five sprawling neurons that made up the tiny ctenophore’s net.</p>

<p>The conventional view is that neurons and the rest of the nervous system evolved once in animal evolutionary history. But given this “unique architecture” and ctenophores’ ancient position in the animal kingdom, it raises the possibility that nerve cells actually evolved twice, Burkhardt says. “I think that&#8217;s exciting.”</p>





<p>But he adds that further work — especially on the development of these neurons — is needed to help verify their evolutionary origin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The origins of the animal nervous system is a murky area of research. Sponges — the traditional competitors for the title of most ancient animal — don’t have a nervous system, or muscles or fundamental vision proteins called opsins, for that matter.&nbsp;But there’s been mounting evidence to suggest that ctenophores are actually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-origins-shift-comb-jellies">the most ancient animal group</a>, older even than sponges (<em>SN: 12/12/13</em>).</p>



<p>If ctenophores arose first, it “implies that either sponges have lost a massive number of features, or that the ctenophores effectively evolved them all independently,” says Graham Budd, a paleobiologist at Uppsala University in Sweden who was not involved in the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If sponges emerged first, it’s still possible that ctenophores evolved their nerve net independently rather than inheriting it from a neuron-bearing ancestor, Burkhardt says. Ctenophores have other neurons outside the nerve net, such as mesogleal neurons embedded in a ctenophore’s gelatinous body layer and sensory cells, the latter of which may communicate with the nerve net to adjust the beating of the combs. So, it’s possible they’re a mosaic of two nervous systems of differing evolutionary origins.</p>



<p>But Joseph Ryan, a bioinformatician at the University of Florida in Gainesville, doesn’t think the results necessarily point to the parallel evolution of a nervous system. Given how long ctenophores have been around — especially if they are older than sponges — the ancestral nervous system may have had plenty of time to evolve into something weird and highly-specialized, says Ryan, who was not part of the study.&nbsp;“We&#8217;re dealing with close to a billion years of evolution. We&#8217;re going to expect strange things to happen.”</p>



<p>The findings are “one more bit of the jigsaw puzzle,” Budd says. “There&#8217;s a whole bunch we don&#8217;t know about these rather common and rather well-known animals.”</p>



<p>For instance, it’s unclear how the nerve net works. Our neurons use rapid changes in voltage across their cell membranes to send signals, but the nerve net might work quite differently, Burkhardt says.<br><br>There are reports of potentially similar systems in other animals, such as by-the-wind-sailor jellies (<em>Velella velella</em>). Studying them in detail, along with nerve nets in other ctenophore species, could determine just how unusual this synapse-less nervous system is.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/northern-elephant-seals-sleep-sea">Northern elephant seals sleep just two hours a day at sea</a></h4>

              
                <p>Northern elephant seals are the true masters of the power nap.</p>



<p>On long trips out to sea, the seals <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snooze less than 20 minutes at a time</a>, researchers report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>. The animals average just two hours of shut-eye per day while swimming offshore for months — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-elephants-clock-shortest-shut-eye-recorded-mammals">rivaling African elephants</a> for the least sleep measured among mammals (<em>SN: 3/1/17</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s important to map these extremes of [sleep behavior] across the animal kingdom to get a better sense of the evolution and the function of sleep for all mammals, including humans,” says Jessica Kendall-Bar, an ecophysiologist at the University of California, San Diego. Knowing how seals catch their z’s could also guide conservation efforts to protect places where they sleep.</p>





<p>Northern elephant seals (<em>Mirounga angustirostris</em>) spend most of the year out in the Pacific Ocean. On these odysseys, the animals forage around the clock for fish, squid and other food to sustain their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-seals-eating-males-huge-death-risk-survival">enormous bodies</a>, which can be as hefty as a car (<em>SN: 2/4/22</em>). Because northern elephant seals are most vulnerable to sharks and killer whales at the surface, they come up for air only a couple minutes at a time between 10- to 30-minute <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-whales-dolphins-seals-dive-so-deep">deep dives</a> (<em>SN: 9/28/02</em>).</p>



<p>“People had known that these seals dive almost all the time when they’re out in the ocean, but it wasn’t known if and how they sleep,” says Niels Rattenborg, a neurobiologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Seewiesen, Germany, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To find out if the seals sleep while diving, Kendall-Bar and her colleagues developed a watertight EEG cap for the animals. Using the cap and other sensors, the team tracked the brain waves, heart rates and 3-D motion of 13 young female seals, including five at a lab and six hanging out at coastal Año Nuevo State Park north of Santa Cruz, Calif. EEG data recorded while seals were slumbering revealed what the animals’ naptime brain waves looked like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kendall-Bar’s team also took two sensor-strapped seals from Año Nuevo and released them at another beach about 60 kilometers south. To swim home, the seals had to cross the deep Monterey Canyon — a locale similar to the deep, predator-fraught waters frequented by seals on months-long foraging trips. Matching the seals’ EEG readings to their diving motions on this journey showed how northern elephant seals sleep on long voyages.</p>



<p>The animals first swim 60 to 100 meters below the surface, then relax into a glide, Kendall-Bar says. As they nod off into slow-wave sleep, the animals keep holding themselves upright for several minutes. But as REM sleep sets in, so does sleep paralysis. The animals flip upside-down and drift in gentle spirals toward the seafloor. Seals can descend hundreds of meters deep during these naps — far below where their predators normally prowl. When the seals wake after five to 10 minutes of sleep, they swim up to the surface. The whole routine takes about 20 minutes.</p>



<p>Looking for that distinct sleep dive motion, the researchers could pick out naps in the dive records of 334 adult seals that had been outfitted with tracking tags from 2004 to 2019. Those sleep patterns revealed that northern elephant seals conk out, on average, around two hours per day while on months-long foraging missions. But the seals sleep nearly 11 hours per day while on land to mate and molt, where they can indulge in long, beachside siestas without worrying about predators.</p>

But at sea, the seals catch only brief snatches of sleep.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123862">Photo by Jessica Kendall-Bar, NMFS 23188</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“What the seals are doing might be something like what we do when we sleep in on the weekend, but it’s on a much longer timescale,” Rattenborg says. He and his colleagues have found a similar feast-and-famine style of sleep in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frigate-birds-fly-nonstop-months">great frigate birds</a>, which fly over the ocean (<em>SN: 6/30/16</em>). “Although they can sleep while they’re flying,” he says, “they sleep less than an hour a day for up to a week at a time, and once back on land, they sleep over 12 hours a day.”</p>



<p>Curiously, northern elephant seals’ sleep habits are quite different from how other marine mammals have been seen sleeping in labs. “Many of them … sleep in just half of their brain at a time,” Kendall-Bar says. That half-awake state allows dolphins, fur seals and sea lions to practice constant vigilance, literally sleeping with one eye open.</p>





<p>“I think it’s pretty cool that elephant seals are doing this without [one-sided] sleep,” Kendall-Bar says. “They’re shutting off both halves of their brain completely and leaving themselves vulnerable.” It seems the key to enjoying such deep sleep is sleeping deep in the sea.</p>

An excess of positrons zipping past Earth suggests that the bubbles are the result of a burp from our galaxy’s supermassive black hole after a meal millions of years ago.</p>



<p>For over a decade, scientists have known about bubbles of gas, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-ways-black-hole-may-blow-bubbles">Fermi bubbles</a>, extending above and below the Milky Way’s center (<em>SN: 11/9/10</em>). Other observations have since spotted the bubbles in microwave radiation and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/x-ray-bubbles-center-milky-way-galaxy">X-rays</a> (<em>SN: 12/9/20</em>). But astronomers still aren’t quite sure how they formed.</p>





<p>A jet of high-energy electrons and positrons, <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/U13.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emitted by the supermassive black hole in one big burst</a>, could explain the bubbles’ multi-wavelength light, physicist Ilias Cholis reported April 18 at the American Physical Society meeting.</p>



<p>In the initial burst, most of the particles would have been launched along jets aimed perpendicular to the galaxy’s disk. As the particles interacted with other galactic matter, they would lose energy and cause the emission of different wavelengths of light.</p>



<p>Those jets would have been aimed away from Earth, so those particles can never be detected. But some of the particles could have escaped along the galactic disk, perpendicular to the bubbles, and end up passing Earth. “It could be that just now, some of those positrons are hitting us,” says Cholis, of Oakland University in Rochester, Mich.</p>



<p>So Cholis and Iason Krommydas of Rice University in Houston analyzed positrons detected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station. The pair found an excess of positrons whose present-day energies could correspond to a burst of activity from the galactic center between 3 million and 10 million years ago, right around when the Fermi bubbles are thought to have formed, Cholis said at the meeting.</p>



<p>The result, Cholis said, supports the idea that the Fermi bubbles came from a time when the galaxy’s central black hole was busier than it is today.</p>

<p>The global sigh of relief was almost audible when a study last year found kids who played video games for hours every day had no worse mental health than non-gamers. In fact, they came out ahead on some cognitive measures.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/generalpediatrics/101377">Video Games May Not Rot Kids&#8217; Brains After All</a>,” one of the <a href="https://jamanetwork.altmetric.com/details/137629755/news/page:1">many news stories</a> about the research trumpeted. Another headline declared: &#8220;<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20221024-video-games-could-improve-kids-brains-study">Video games could improve kids&#8217; brains.</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>Now it turns out the study, titled “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797596">Association of Video Gaming With Cognitive Performance Among Children</a>,” was so flawed it had to be retracted and republished. The updated results show gamers did actually score significantly worse on things like attention and depression, although some of their performance metrics were still slightly better than among non-gamers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797596">republished article</a> in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>:</p>



<span id="more-126935"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Video gaming may be associated with small but improved cognitive abilities involving response inhibition and working memory and with alterations in underlying cortical pathways, but concerns about the association with mental health may warrant further study.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The study <a href="https://jamanetwork.altmetric.com/details/137629755/news/page:1">made headlines across the globe</a>, but has been cited just twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies about the effects of video games are often contentious, as we&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xb89b/two-researchers-challenged-a-scientific-study-about-violent-video-gamesand-took-a-hit-for-being-right">reported before</a>, and this one appears no different. According to the April 10 letter to the editor that serves as the study’s<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2803642"> notice of retraction and replacement</a>, a reader informed the authors of several errors in their work, which caused them to make extensive corrections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter offers a detailed explanation of five key errors, many of which stem from a failure to include, properly account for, and analyze differences between the study’s two groups. There were also errors in the way the study presented data and results, for instance results related to how children performed on two cognitive tests. While the original study found that the children who played video games did better at both tests, a reanalysis showed that they did notably worse on one test and about the same on another compared to children who didn’t play video games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even after the corrections, the authors note that children who played video games still performed slightly better on the study’s motor and memory tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the revised abstract notes that “the Child Behavior Checklist behavioral and mental health scores were higher in VGs , with attention problems, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder scores significantly higher in the VGs compared with the NVGs [non-video gamers].” This contrasts with the original study, which claimed that these scores “were not significantly different” between the groups.</p>



<p>Bader Chaarani, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont, told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As you may have noticed, our main findings and conclusions in the updated version of the article remain unchanged. The most relevant correction is that some of the mental health scores are found to be significantly higher in videogamers, whereas in the original version we stated that mental scores were higher in videogamers without reaching statistical difference. However, these scores remain far from clinical significance. The errors occurred mostly in the table of demographics, mainly because some of the co-authors involved in the analyses used inconsistent lists of participants.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Chaarani nor any of the paper’s other authors have had any previous papers retracted, according to Retraction Watch’s<a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dBader%2bChaarani"> database</a>.</p>



<p>Annette Flanagin, executive managing editor of<em> JAMA</em> and <em>JAMA Network</em>, told us:</p>



<p><em>As the authors report, a reader reported concerns that prompted the authors to identify and correct errors in their analyses and findings. This is the</em><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2652632"><em> standard process</em></a><em> for such errors that, when corrected, result in changes in some findings and the study is considered valid. The authors provide detailed explanations in their Letter, which is published as a notice of retraction and replacement.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urchins-dying-off-caribbean-disease">Urchins are dying off across the Caribbean. Scientists now know why</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since early 2022, sea urchins have been mysteriously dying off across the Caribbean. Now scientists say they have identified the main culprit: a type of relatively large, single-celled marine microorganism called a scuticociliate.</p>



<p>The discovery is a little surprising given that “ciliates are not normally seen as agents of mass mortality,” says Ian Hewson, a marine microbial ecologist at Cornell University. But the evidence, described April 19 in <em>Science Advances</em>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg3200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all points to the organism</a>, <em>Philaster apodigitiformis</em>, infecting the urchins, he says. “In all of my years of investigating marine diseases, this is the one which we are 100 percent confident about.”</p>





<p>Scuticociliates are found across the world’s oceans. Given their ubiquity, it’s unknown what conditions may have allowed <em>P. apodigitiformis</em> to become so detrimental to the urchins. It’s also unclear how it causes infection.</p>



<p>While there are no available treatments for the disease, knowing the pathogen’s identity allows for the development of possible options. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Long-spined sea urchins (<em>Diadema antillarum</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saba-caribbean-island-species-conservation">play a crucial role</a> in Caribbean coral reefs, grazing algae that would otherwise smother corals (<em>SN</em>: <em>9/27/22</em>). In the 1980s, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sea-urchins-death-caribbean">urchins nearly disappeared during a massive die-off</a>, the cause of which remains unknown (<em>SN: 6/16/84</em>).</p>



<p>Decades of restoration efforts had made some progress when an alarmingly similar mortality event began to spread in January 2022, wiping out thousands of urchins. This time, scientists across the United States and the Caribbean sprang into action.</p>



<p>Three teams independently reached the same conclusion about <em>P. apodigitiformis</em>, using different approaches. Hewson’s team compared the entire set of active genes, or the transcriptome,&nbsp;of healthy and sick urchins from 23 sites across the Caribbean. The researchers noticed that some of the active genes in the sick urchins’ transcriptomes weren’t from the urchins but from the microorganism. Meanwhile, teams in Florida and Hawaii observed the scuticociliates in the tissues and fluids of sick urchins, reinforcing the genetic finding.</p>



<p>Upon a closer look, the scuticociliates tended to cluster in the sick urchins’ body walls and at the base of their spines. The microorganisms were absent from healthy urchins.</p>





<p>The next step was to isolate the pathogen and infect healthy urchins. Four days after infection, six of 10 infected urchins lost many spines — a common symptom of sick urchins. None of the uninfected urchins lost spines.</p>



<p>“It was really exciting to see,” says Michael Sweet, a marine disease ecologist at the University of Derby in England, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Scary, but also exciting to see the [ciliate’s] name mentioned in a different context because <em>Philaster</em> has never been related to urchin diseases before.” His research <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110115300095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">points to the involvement of the genus</a> in several coral diseases.</p>



<p>While the scuticociliate clearly plays a pivotal role, Sweet says, there are almost certainly other factors at play, such as other microorganisms or environmental stressors, that could help explain what triggered the start of the recent die-off. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, it’s unknown if the same pathogen was involved in the 1980s die-off. Hewson’s team hopes to answer that question by looking at museum specimens from the period.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/map-human-brain-movement-homunculus">The classic map of how the human brain manages movement gets an update</a></h4>

              
                <p>The classical view of how the human brain controls voluntary movement might not tell the whole story.</p>



<p>That map of the primary motor cortex — the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homunculus-reimagined">motor homunculus</a> — shows how this brain region is divided into sections assigned to each body part that can be controlled voluntarily (<em>SN: 6/16/15</em>). It puts your toes next to your ankle, and your neck next to your thumb. The space each part takes up on the cortex is also proportional to how much control one has over that part. Each finger, for example, takes up more space than a whole thigh.&nbsp;</p>





<p>A new map reveals that in addition to having regions devoted to specific body parts, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05964-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three newfound areas control integrative, whole-body actions</a>. And representations of where specific body parts fall on this map are organized differently than previously thought, researchers report April 19 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Research in monkeys had hinted at this. “There is a whole cohort of people who have known for 50 years that the homunculus isn&#8217;t quite right,” says Evan Gordon, a neuroscientist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. But ever since pioneering brain-mapping work by neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield starting in the 1930s, the homunculus has reigned supreme in neuroscience.</p>



<p>Gordon and his colleagues study synchronized activity and communication between different brain regions. They noticed some spots in the primary motor cortex were linked to unexpected areas involved in action control and pain perception. Because that didn’t fit with the homunculus map, they wrote it off as a result of imperfect data. “But we kept seeing it, and it kept bugging us,” Gordon says.</p>



<p>So the team gathered functional MRI data on volunteers as they performed various tasks.</p>



<p>Two participants completed simple movements like moving just their eyebrows or toes, as well as complex tasks like simultaneously rotating their wrist and moving their foot from side to side.</p>



<p>The fMRI data revealed which parts of the brain activated at the same time as each task was done, allowing the researchers to trace which regions were functionally connected to one another. Seven more participants were recorded while not doing any particular task in order to look at how brain areas communicate during rest.</p>



<p>Testing only a few participants, each for many hours, offers unique insights into neural connectivity, Gordon says. “When we collect this much data in individuals, we constantly start seeing things that people have never really noticed before.”</p>





<p>The team discovered that while the brain-body part connections vaguely follow the pattern discovered by Penfield, the primary motor cortex is organized into three distinct sections. Each represents different body regions: lower body, torso and arms, and head.</p>



<p>Within each of these sections, the outermost body part of that region is mapped to the center of that section. For example, the area of the primary motor cortex assigned to the lower body has the toes in the middle with other leg parts radiating out in each direction from it. As a result, the entire section is organized like this: hip, knee, ankle, toes, ankle, knee, hip.</p>

<p>The team also unexpectedly found three mysterious spots not linked to a specific body part. Dubbed intereffector regions, they connect to an external network involved in action control and the sensing of pain. These regions alternate with the sections devoted to specific body parts. The team suspects that intereffector regions may integrate action goals and body movements involving multiple body parts, while the spaces in between are used for precise movements of isolated body parts.</p>



<p>Using previous data from three large fMRI studies, which include data from around 50,000 people, the team verified that this organization was consistent across a wide swath of people. Similar patterns also appeared in existing datasets from macaque monkeys, children and clinical populations.</p>



<p>“I think it was just easy to miss anything that seemed anomalous — must be noise,” says Michael Graziano, a neuroscientist at Princeton University who was not involved in the research. But with access to these huge datasets, “you get these vast numbers of subjects, and the pattern is crystal clear, and you can&#8217;t ignore it …. This is really the best example I&#8217;ve seen in a long, long time of looking at humans and trying to figure out at a detailed level what is the organization.”</p>



<p>Gordon’s team now plans to see whether these intereffector regions play a role in certain kinds of pain. More broadly, the team hopes their findings will prompt more in-depth research of what specific areas of the brain do. With new techniques and equipment, there is much left to explore, Gordon says. “Brain mapping isn’t dead.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prehistoric-method-clothes-bone-leather">A prehistoric method for tailoring clothes may be written in bone</a></h4>

              
                <p>An animal bone fragment full of human-made pits hints at how prehistoric people in Western Europe may have crafted clothing.</p>



<p>The nearly 40,000-year-old artifact probably served as a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg0834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punch board for leatherwork</a>, researchers report April 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>. They suggest that the bone fragment rested beneath animal hide while an artisan pricked holes in the material, possibly for seams. If so, it’s the earliest-known tool of its kind and predates eyed needles in the region by about 15,000 years.</p>





<p>Found at an archaeological site south of Barcelona, the roughly 11-centimeter-long bone fragment contains 28 punctures scattered across one flat side, with 10 of them aligned and fairly evenly spaced.</p>



<p>The marks don’t seem to have been a notation system or decoration, given that some holes are hard to see and the bone fragment wasn’t otherwise shaped, says archaeologist Luc Doyon of the University of Bordeaux in France. He thought leatherwork could have made the marks. But it wasn’t until he visited a cobbler shop and <a></a>saw one of the artisan’s tools that the hypothesis solidified, guiding Doyon’s next steps.</p>



<p>He and colleagues attempted to re-create the artifact’s holes by puncturing cattle rib bones with tools including sharpened flint, horns and antlers. Piercing leather atop bone with a burin — a pointed stone chisel — by tapping it with a hammerlike tool created pits that resemble those on the bone fragment.</p>



<p>Further experiments suggested the artifact’s 10 orderly punctures were made by the same tool and intentionally aligned and regularly spaced. This hints that holes were created in the leather to make a seam sewn with a threading tool.</p>



<p>Scientists knew that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lice-hang-ancient-date-first-clothes">humans wore clothing long before the oldest-known eyed needles existed</a> (<em>SN: 4/20/10</em>). “What [the new finding] tells us is that the first modern humans who lived in Europe had the technology in their toolkit for making fitted clothes,” Doyon says.</p>

<p>A professor of cell biology in Japan faked data in an influential cancer study published in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> in 2019, according to an investigation by Okayama University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The school, which released a <a href="https://www.okayama-u.ac.jp/up_load_files/news/20230324houkoku01.pdf">report</a> with its findings last month (in Japanese), found no fewer than 113 instances of fabrication as well as problems with several images in the<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0430-3"> paper</a>, titled “Genetic manipulation of autonomic nerve fiber innervation and activity and its effect on breast cancer progression.”</p>



<p>The report identified Okayama&#8217;s<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamiya-atsunori-7b01024b/?originalSubdomain=jp"> Atsunori Kamiya</a> as being involved in the misconduct and recommended retracting the article, which has been cited 134 times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science. The paper has yet to be retracted, but an editor from the journal said they are looking into the case.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126906"></span>



<p>Kamiya also is a former director of the Department of Cardiovascular Control at the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute in Suita, Japan. The center took part in Okayama&#8217;s investigation.</p>



<p>A Google-translated version of the report reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The investigative committees of both organizations judged that the maliciousness was high (large) because it consisted of fictitious experimental results over a fairly wide range and a large number of specific misconducts were recognized.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A third-party investigative committee concluded that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The defendant was found to have failed to comply with the ethical guidelines, and it was determined that the degree of non-compliance was serious.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked for the paper’s underlying data, Kamiya claimed that the hard disk storing them fell and broke during the June 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/osaka-earthquake-japan-61-magnitude-tremor">North Osaka earthquake</a>. The paper versions were destroyed after chemical liquids from refrigerators and shelves fell on them during the earthquake, Kamiya told investigators.</p>



<p>The report also notes that Kamiya claimed the problems with figures in the paper were due to a &#8220;mix-up&#8221; with images.</p>



<p>According to a news <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14869862">story</a> in <em>The Asahi Shimbun</em> about the case, &#8220;The two organizations concluded that Kamiya’s fabrications were so flagrant that he lacked a sense of ethics as a scientist.&#8221; (The newspaper retracted a <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/photo/27472914">2019 story about Kamiya&#8217;s work</a>.)</p>



<p>The study was first<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/64FCCAB9E4267D5A1DBC8A631F0509"> flagged on PubPeer</a> in 2021. The probe also looked into two other studies coauthored by Kamiya, but found no evidence of misconduct.</p>



<p>Elisa Floriddia, senior editor at <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> in the UK, told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are working on this, but haven’t reached a decision (correction or retraction).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kamiya did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/methane-warm-earth-atmosphere-radiation">Methane may not warm the Earth quite as much as previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Methane is a greenhouse gas with dual personalities. It heats Earth’s atmosphere 28 times as potently as carbon dioxide, gram for gram. But its absorption of the sun’s radiation high in the atmosphere also alters cloud patterns — casting a bit of shadow on its warming effect.</p>



<p>So rather than adding even more thermal energy to the atmosphere, as previously thought, methane’s solar absorption sets off a cascade of events that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01144-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces its overall warming effect by about 30 percent</a>, researchers report March 16 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>





<p>“These are really interesting and important results,” says Rachael Byrom, a climate scientist at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo who wasn’t involved in the new study. Nonetheless, she says, “methane still remains a really key gas that we need to target in emissions reductions.”</p>



<p>Humans are responsible for most of the methane entering the atmosphere, where it worsens global warming. Concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/increase-in-atmospheric-methane-set-another-record-during-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have risen</a> about 162 percent since preindustrial times, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://sciencecouncil.noaa.gov/Portals/0/Council%20Products/MethaneFactSheet_AUG22.pdf?ver=2022-11-09-133904-120#:~:text=The%20largest%20share%20of%20methane&#039;s,include%20wetlands%20and%20freshwater%20systems." target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest sources of anthropogenic methane</a> include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gas-flare-leak-methane-burning-climate">fossil fuel use</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/agriculture-fossil-fuels-are-driving-record-high-methane-emissions">livestock, rice farming</a>, landfills and biomass burning (<em>SN: 9/29/22; SN: 7/14/20</em>). Scientists fear that as warming triggers thaw of permafrost in the Arctic regions, this could also lead to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">increased methane emissions</a>, as microbes in the soil consume dead plant material and release the gas (<em>SN: 9/25/19)</em>.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gases like methane exert their strongest effects by absorbing infrared “longwave” radiation emitted from the planet’s surface. Earth emits this longwave radiation when it is struck by “shortwave” radiation coming directly from the sun. Most studies of greenhouse gases focus on longwave absorption.</p>



<p>But scientists are learning that greenhouse gases, including methane, also absorb some of the sun’s shortwave radiation. Recent estimates suggested that methane might contribute up to <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 percent more</a> thermal energy to the atmosphere than previously thought, due to this additional shortwave absorption.</p>



<p>However, the new study reveals that methane’s shortwave absorption has the opposite effect. This finding is based on a detailed analysis of the gas’s absorption at various wavelengths.</p>



<p>The result is “counterintuitive,” says climate scientist Robert Allen of the University of California, Riverside. It happens because of the way that methane’s shortwave absorbance affects clouds in different layers of the atmosphere, Allen and colleagues’ simulations suggest.</p>



<p>When methane absorbs shortwave radiation in the middle and upper troposphere, above about three kilometers, it further warms the air — leading to fewer clouds in that upper layer. And because methane absorbs shortwave radiation high up, less of that radiation penetrates down to the lower troposphere. This actually cools the lower troposphere, leading to more clouds in that layer.</p>



<p>These thicker low-level clouds reflect more of the sun’s shortwave radiation back out to space — meaning that less of this solar radiation reaches Earth’s surface, to be converted into longwave radiation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, upper-level clouds, in addition to greenhouse gases, are known to absorb longwave radiation. So fewer of these clouds means that less of the longwave radiation emitted by Earth is captured in the atmosphere — and more of it escapes to space without contributing to climate change.</p>



<p>With methane’s shortwave absorption, “you expect warming of the climate system,” Allen says. “But these cloud adjustments actually overwhelm the heating due to absorption, leading to a cooling effect.”</p>



<p>Allen and his colleagues conducted the study using a computational model of Earth’s climate. When they took the traditional approach — considering only methane’s longwave absorbance — they estimated that the gas has caused 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming since preindustrial times, out of <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature#:~:text=Earth&#039;s%20temperature%20has%20risen%20by,2%C2%B0%20F%20in%20total." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.06 degrees C total warming</a>. But when they also included shortwave absorbance, methane’s contribution to warming fell to about 0.16 degrees C.</p>



<p>In addition to warming the planet, methane is also thought to increase global precipitation, due to greater evaporation of water with higher temperatures. But the researchers found that inclusion of shortwave absorbance also reduced methane’s precipitation effect, from a predicted 0.3 percent increase in precipitation (based on longwave absorbance alone), down to an increase of about 0.18 percent.</p>

<p>It will be important to include methane’s shortwave effects in future climate projections, says Daniel Feldman, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved in the study. But he thinks that more work needs to be done to clarify those effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-squid-cuttlefish-arms-evolve-taste">Octopus, squid and cuttlefish arms evolved to ‘taste’ different compounds</a></h4>

              
                <p>People have different tastes. It turns out that octopuses, squid and cuttlefish do too.</p>



<p>These soft-bodied cephalopods have proteins on suckers along their tentacles that allow them to “taste” by touching objects. But the species have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05822-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved to detect different compounds</a>, researchers report in two studies published in the April 13 <em>Nature</em>. And the differing tastes may be tied to the species’ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05808-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hunting styles</a>.</p>



<p>All the species have modified versions of proteins called neurotransmitter receptors, which detect brain chemicals. Evolution morphed the brain proteins to take on new roles as taste-sensing proteins. But octopus evolution led them to develop a taste for greasy things, while squid and cuttlefish evolution tweaked the brain proteins to detect bitter compounds, the researchers discovered.</p>





<p>“This is an entirely new sensory system,” says Maude Baldwin, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Seewiesen, Germany, who was not involved in the work. “Together these papers offer unprecedented insight into how sensory systems evolve.” </p>



<p>Studying cephalopod receptors might also shed some light on how human taste-sensing proteins evolved. “It greatly enhances our understanding of how proteins evolve in general,” Baldwin says, as well as how proteins and even entire organisms acquire new functions.</p>



<h4>Octopuses can taste many “greasy, sticky” molecules</h4>



<p>In a previous study, Harvard physiologist Nicholas Bellono and colleagues discovered that barrel-shaped proteins known as chemotactile receptors in the suckers of California two-spot octopuses (<em>Octopus bimaculoides</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-taste-touch-arm-suckers">allow the animals to taste terpenes</a> — “greasy,” insoluble molecules — with their arms (<em>SN: 10/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>To get a detailed look at these proteins, Bellono teamed up with structural biologist Ryan Hibbs of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Hibbs and colleagues used cryoelectron microscopy to examine the three-dimensional structure of the protein.</p>



<p>When looking at the structure of the octopus protein, the researchers found an unexpectedly large molecule stuck in a special pocket used to detect certain chemicals. Finding a molecule stuck in one of these pockets can give clues to the protein’s function.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="452" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline.jpg" alt="A close up photo of the sucker cups on an octopus' arms." class="wp-image-3123752" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline-280x186.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123752">The sucker cups on an octopus’ arms contain taste-sensing proteins that help the animal hunt in the dark and find prey hidden in nooks and crannies.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123752">Anik Grearson</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The mystery molecule turned out to be part of the detergent the researchers used to prepare the protein for the microscope. That’s very different from the types of molecules that bind to the neurotransmitter receptors from which chemotactile receptors evolved, says Hibbs, now at the University of California, San Diego. “Neurotransmitters are small and soluble. This thing is bulky and greasy.”</p>



<p>By testing a variety of molecules collected from neighboring labs, Bellono’s team determined that the octopus receptors can detect a variety of “greasy, sticky molecules” that don’t dissolve in water. Because octopuses feel around for their prey, it makes sense that their taste receptors evolved to detect molecules that remain stuck to underwater surfaces such as crab shells or their own eggs, rather than small chemicals that easily diffuse in water, Hibbs says. &nbsp;</p>





<p>But octopuses don’t seem to find all greasy molecules tasty. In one experiment, the researchers tested the response of a severed tentacle to one such chemical. The arm crawled off the measuring apparatus and right out of the bath.</p>



<h4>Squid and cuttlefish can discern bitter compounds</h4>



<p>To see if other cephalopods share octopuses’ tastes, the researchers turned to genetic analyses. Octopuses have 26 genes that each encode a slightly different chemotactile receptor protein. Those proteins can come together in combinations of five to detect a wide variety of molecules, the team found.</p>



<p>Examining genes from squid and cuttlefish, the researchers discovered that these cephalopod species also have modified neurotransmitter receptors in their suckers. But some of the squid and cuttlefish receptors detect bitter compounds which can diffuse in water, not the greasy ones octopuses taste. (Squid could also taste some terpenes, but not all of the greasy molecules octopuses detect.)</p>



<p>Bitter taste is often a signal that something is spoiled or poisonous, so animals usually avoid bitter compounds, says Harold Zakon, a neuroscientist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Bitter compounds also caused squid to turn up their noses — or in this case, tentacles — at prey. Squid given shrimp soaked in a bitter compound handled the food longer before eating it than they did with undoctored prey. Or the squid rejected the bitter shrimp, something researchers never saw the animals do with regular prey.</p>



<p>The type of receptors the species have reflect their hunting strategies. Octopuses ”explore everything with their arms,” Bellono says, and likely use chemotactile receptors to guide their explorations. While octopuses use sight to catch prey out in the light of day, chemotactile receptors help them hunt in the dark and to find prey hidden in cracks and crevices, Bellono says. Squid and cuttlefish are ambush predators that rely on eyesight alone. The bitter receptors help squid decide whether to eat their prey only after they have it in their grasp.</p>



<p>The octopus and squid receptors evolved about 300 million years ago, early in the species’ histories. But it’s impossible to tell whether hunting style or receptor type came first or if the traits evolved together.</p>



<p>Octopuses also have another type of chemotactile receptor, the researchers found, but they don’t yet know what sorts of molecules those receptors sense.</p>



<p>It will take years to work out the details of what all the cephalopods’ receptors detect and how they influence animals’ behavior, Zakon says. “This is really a first announcement that these receptors have changed in fundamentally important ways.”</p>

<p>Anca Turcu was going over her publication stats a few weeks ago, as she does every year to apply for research awards and update her CV, when she found an “unpleasant surprise.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/politics/person/anca-turcu/">Turcu</a>, a senior lecturer in the University of Central Florida’s School of Politics, Security, and International Affairs, was listed as the sole author of an article entitled “<a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/articles/impact-of-government-intervention-measures-on-recycling-of-wasteequipment-in-china-86363.html">Impact of government intervention measures on recycling of waste equipment in China</a>,” which had been published in the <em>African Journal of Political Science</em> in February 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She hadn’t written the paper, which had nothing to do with her research on <a href="https://www.ancaturcu.com/peer-reviewed-publications">diasporas and voting</a>. But that wasn’t the worst of it.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126912"></span>



<p>As Retraction Watch looked into the case, we found something “very upsetting,” in Turcu’s words. The article with her name on it appeared to paraphrase, sentence by sentence, a paper that had been published in another journal a few months prior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not only are they faking a publication in my name, but they are adding my name to something they have plagiarized?” Turcu asked. “This is absolutely terrible! What is it with these people?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421521005620">earlier article’s title</a> was nearly identical, and it had appeared online in the Elsevier journal <em>Energy Policy</em> in November 2021. It has been cited ten times since, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The one with Turcu’s name on it was received at the journal in January 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We emailed the authors of the <em>Energy Policy </em>paper, who are affiliated with Tongji University in Shanghai, to ask if they were aware of the plagiarism, but they didn’t reply. We also emailed Stephen D. Thomas, senior and coordinating editor of the journal and a professor at the University of Greenwich in London, and got an out of office response.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a> with applications and nominations for this year&rsquo;s awards open until <strong>April 30th, 2023</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>.&nbsp; The awards program honors researchers who&nbsp;reflect&nbsp;<strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong>&nbsp;in their work. To get a flavor of what the Einstein Foundation is looking for we have asked previous finalists and winners to write about their work. Earlier this year we featured the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/the-open-science-atlas/">Open Science Atlas</a>, the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/ape-research-index-ari-quantifying-the-effect-of-previous-experience-in-research-tasks-on-cognitive-skills-in-captive-chimpanzees/">Ape Research Index</a> and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/the-trialstracker-project/">TrialsTracker project</a>.</p>



<p>Today PLOS is providing more information on the <a href="https://manybabies.org/MB5/">ManyBabies 5 </a>project spearheaded by <a href="https://jkosie.github.io/">Jessica Kosie</a> and <a href="https://mzettersten.github.io/">Martin Zettersten,</a> both from Princeton University.</p>



<p>The ManyBabies 5 project is a large-scale and cross-cultural study on influential models in infant attention research. Current theories on this subject are largely only based on studies with a small number of participants, who are primarily from western industrialized countries. The ManyBabies 5 team is a large-scale collaborative effort of more than 200 scientists from 122 laboratories in 40 countries on 6 continents. The overarching goal is to build a more robust and valid developmental science.</p>



<p>Unlike adult subjects, babies cannot tell you what they are thinking. Therefore, researchers studying infant development use looking patterns to understand how babies think and feel about the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-icy-ring-heat-atmosphere-ultraviolet-glow">Saturn’s icy rings are probably heating its atmosphere, giving it an ultraviolet glow</a></h4>

              
                <p>The rings that make Saturn such a spectacle are probably heating its atmosphere and making it glow at ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>



<p>Researchers detected an excess of ultraviolet emission in Saturn’s northern hemisphere that comes from hydrogen atoms. The emission, known as Lyman-alpha radiation, is probably the result of water ice, which contains hydrogen, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/acaf78" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling into the atmosphere from the planet’s rings</a>, the researchers propose March 30 in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>



<p>The detection of similar emission from a distant world could someday lead to the discovery of a Saturn-like planet orbiting another star.</p>





<p>The key to the discovery came after two spacecraft — the Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini — observed Saturn simultaneously in 2017, right before Cassini plunged into the planet’s atmosphere, says Lotfi Ben-Jaffel, an astrophysicist at the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris.</p>



<p>This allowed Ben-Jaffel and colleagues to calibrate the ultraviolet detectors on those spacecraft as well as detectors on Voyager 1 and 2, which flew past Saturn in 1980 and 1981, and the International Ultraviolet Explorer, an Earth-orbiting satellite that also observed Saturn. Comparing these ultraviolet observations revealed a band of excess Lyman-alpha radiation spanning 5° to 35° N latitude on Saturn.</p>



<p>The researchers’ explanation for the extra ultraviolet glow is plausible, says Paul Estrada, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., who was not involved with the new work.</p>



<p>“We know material is falling in from the rings,” he says, because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-rings-age-young-moons">Cassini detected it during the spacecraft’s spiral into Saturn</a><em> </em>(<em>SN: 12/14/17</em>). “The rings are predominantly water ice. It may be the source of the atomic hydrogen” emitting the Lyman-alpha radiation that the researchers have detected, he says.</p>



<p>When icy ring particles fall into Saturn’s atmosphere, they carry kinetic energy with them. “They have to release that energy to the surrounding gas,” Ben-Jaffel says, and that energy heats up the atmosphere. When the icy particles vaporize, they release additional energy, further heating the atmosphere and making it glow at UV wavelengths. The researchers suspect that the emission also appears in the planet’s southern hemisphere.</p>



<p>All the giant planets of our solar system have rings, but only Saturn’s are so bright and beautiful. Astronomers don’t yet know whether any of the thousands of worlds found orbiting other stars have rings that are equally magnificent.</p>





<p>The new discovery may help astronomers identify those spectacularly ringed worlds, if they exist. Future planet hunters could look for the telltale ultraviolet glow of the Lyman-alpha radiation, Ben-Jaffel says, and then further observations could confirm the rings’ existence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-salt-lake-shrinking-utah-drought">The Great Salt Lake is shrinking. What can we do to stop it?</a></h4>

              
                <p>At Antelope Island State Park near Salt Lake City in the fall of 2022, three duck hunters dragged a sled across cracked desert sand in search of the water’s edge. The birds they sought were bunched in meager puddles far in the distance. Just to the west, the docks of an abandoned marina caved into the dust and a lone sailboat sat beached amid sagebrush.</p>



<p>“Biologists are worried that we’re on the brink of ecological collapse of the lake,” says Chad Yamane, the regional director of Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit that conserves, restores and manages habitats for North America&#8217;s waterfowl, and a waterfowl hunter himself.</p>





<p>Last fall, the Great Salt Lake hit its lowest level since record keeping began. The lake’s elevation sank to nearly six meters below the long-term average, shriveling the Western Hemisphere’s largest saline lake to half its historic surface area. The lake’s shrinking threatens to upend the ecosystem, disrupting the migration and survival of 10 million birds, including ducks and geese.</p>



<p>Duck hunters aren’t the only ones worried about the Great Salt Lake. The decades-long decline in lake level is raising alarm bells for millions of people who live in the region. As the lake recedes, its namesake city and surrounding communities face a host of potential problems. The low lake level and increasing salinity threaten to disrupt economic mainstays like agriculture, tourism, mineral extraction and brine shrimp harvesting. Exposed sediments can also reduce air quality and so threaten public health. “It concerns everyone,&#8221; Yamane says. “It’s now on the forefront of every Utahan’s mind.”</p>



<p>And the Great Salt Lake isn’t unique. Many of the world’s saline lakes are facing a double whammy: People are taking more water from the tributaries that feed the lakes, while a hotter, drier climate means it takes longer to refill them.</p>



<p>Found on every continent, saline lakes include the Caspian Sea, the largest lake in the world, as well as the lowest, the Dead Sea. Saline lakes are terminal lakes — they have no drain, meaning no rivers flow out of them. As water evaporates, salts are left behind from the minerals that wash off the surrounding landscape. Since they are usually found in arid landscapes that receive little precipitation, saline lakes are the first in line to be affected by long-term droughts, which are becoming more common with climate change.</p>



<p>At the same time, the people who live in these deserts divert freshwater for crops, homes and industry. Residents siphon water from streams and rivers into canals, pipelines or reservoirs before it reaches the lakes. And as the lakes shrink, their concentration of salt increases.</p>



<p>Lake Poopó, a high-elevation lake in Bolivia that used to stretch 90 kilometers long and 32 kilometers wide, is now a salty mud flat. The Aral Sea in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, once the world’s fourth largest lake, has at times in recent decades withered to a tenth of its historic 68,000-square-kilometer surface area. India’s largest inland salt lake, Sambhar Salt Lake, is in severe decline, as is Africa’s Lake Chad. Some saline lakes, like Nevada’s Winnemucca Lake, dried up so long ago — the waters that fed it diverted to agricultural fields — that most people have forgotten they were ever wet.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://pws.byu.edu/great-salt-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report released by researchers at Brigham Young University</a> in January, the Great Salt Lake will likely also disappear within five years if residents continue their current rate of “unsustainable” water consumption.</p>





<p>The good news is Utahans still have time to halt or even reverse the Great Salt Lake’s decline by using less water. Cutting agricultural and other outdoor water use by a third to half through a combination of voluntary conservation measures and policy changes would allow the lake to refill enough to support the region’s economy, ecology and quality of life, the report says. If Utahans succeed, the Great Salt Lake can be a model for how to save other saline lakes around the world.</p>

<h4>Why is the Great Salt Lake declining?</h4>



<p>Like other terminal lakes, the Great Salt Lake naturally rises or falls based on how much water falls into and evaporates out of its watershed each year. Most of the precipitation falls as snow in the winter, melting each spring to fill streams that eventually empty into the lake. Because it’s surprisingly shallow for its size — an average of just over four meters deep — the Great Salt Lake fills or drains quickly. In the 1980s, for instance, a wet spell swelled the lake’s surface area to nearly 6,000 square kilometers, more than twice as big as it is today.</p>



<p>Despite natural variations, the lake level is undisputedly trending downward. Hydrologic modeling by Wayne Wurtsbaugh and Sarah Null, both experts on the lake based at Utah State University in Logan, shows that if people had not started siphoning water from the rivers and streams in the region in 1847, when Mormon settlers led by Brigham Young arrived, the lake would be 3.4 meters higher than it is currently.</p>



<p>Today, three-quarters of the water consumed within the Great Salt Lake watershed is used to irrigate crops, mainly hay that feeds cattle that produce beef or dairy, the state’s chief agricultural commodities.</p>



<p>Mineral extraction from the Great Salt Lake accounts for 9 percent of the water consumed. Companies divert briny water directly from the lake to extract its minerals and produce table salt, fertilizer or magnesium metal. Another 9 percent of the water consumed in the basin gets piped to cities to supply homes and businesses with water for indoor, outdoor and industrial uses. The remaining 8 percent is lost from evaporation from lakes and reservoirs in the basin.</p>



<p>Climate change has also contributed to the Great Salt Lake’s record lows. The worst megadrought in 1,200 years has ensnared the American Southwest for the last 22 years. The lake isn’t refilling fast enough to keep up with the withdrawals upstream, while higher temperatures spur more evaporation from the lake.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How Great Salt Lake water is used</h3>



<p>The vast majority of water consumed in the Great Salt Lake watershed goes toward agriculture, with mineral extraction, homes, industries and evaporation accounting for smaller proportions.</p>

<p>People use more water to grow crops or keep lawns green when it’s hot and dry, which Patrick Donnelly, a research scientist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Missoula, Mont., likens to a climate tax on our waterways. An agricultural producer needs 20 percent more water to grow the same crops in northern Utah than he did 15 years ago, Donnelly says.</p>



<p>Donnelly and colleagues measured changes in 18 saline lakes in the Intermountain West, including the Great Salt Lake, finding an average surface area decrease of 27 percent from 1984 to 2018. The surface area of wetlands in the region diminished by nearly half. The researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Global Change Biology </em>that these losses were driven <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely by demands from irrigated agriculture coupled with higher temperatures</a> that increase evaporation.</p>



<p>And the demand for freshwater in is only increasing. Utah is the fastest growing state in the United States, and 80 percent of the people live in the Great Salt Lake watershed.</p>



<p>Donnelly says it’s “unrealistic” to think that the Great Salt Lake region can stretch its water far enough to meet current and increasing demands. He points to a proposal to further dam and divert the Bear River — the tributary that provides over half of the Great Salt Lake’s freshwater and is already riddled with canals, ditches and reservoirs — to supply growing communities in Utah. The project would lower the level of the Great Salt Lake by more than a meter and a half and push salinity to over 22 percent, damaging the lake’s invertebrate community, Wurtsbaugh and Null reported in the book <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-40352-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Salt Lake Biology</a></em>, published in 2020.</p>



<h4>The consequences of a dry Great Salt Lake</h4>



<p>The region is already feeling the consequences of a shrinking lake. Mineral extraction industries are finding it increasingly difficult to get water to their ponds and processing plants. Some ranchers worry they won’t be able to take their full allotment of irrigation water from the lake’s freshwater tributaries. Even Utah’s famous ski resorts feel the impact: An estimated 5 to 10 percent of the fluffy powder that draws millions of tourists to the area’s slopes comes from snowfall triggered by the lake’s relatively warm waters.</p>



<p>If the Great Salt Lake dries completely, the consequences become much more dire. Owens Lake in Central California offers an example of what happens when saline lakes are drained for human water consumption. It went dry in 1926, just 13 years after the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power diverted the Owens River into a 375-kilometer-long aqueduct&nbsp;to supply water to Southern California. This engineering feat turned fertile farmlands into an eerie dust bowl and caused health problems for residents in nearby communities.</p>



<p>Once a lake bed is exposed, winds kick up ferocious dust storms. Those windblown sediments contribute to air pollution and can contribute to asthma, lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease, among other health issues. Owens Lake has been among the largest sources of dust pollution in the nation. The City of Los Angeles has spent more than $2.5 billion mitigating the dust through projects at the lake bed such as shallow flooding, seeding and planting vegetation, spreading gravel or tilling the ground.</p>

Randall</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is sobering news for Salt Lake City, which had at least seven times as much lake bed exposed last fall as Owens Lake. “In the summers when we get a strong south wind, you can literally watch a cloud of dust coming off the lake where the lake bed has been exposed because of the low receding water,” Yamane says.</p>



<p>Sediments at the bottom of saline lakes also collect a slew of pollutants from human activities, such as chemicals from urban and agricultural runoff and toxic mine waste. Historical mining and smelting around the Great Salt Lake, for example, deposited heavy metals like mercury and lead that have accumulated in the lake bed’s sediments. Once exposed, these metals can be transported by dust particles and may increase rates of disease associated with air pollution, according to the January report from the BYU team.</p>



<p>The drying is also bad for birds. The Great Salt Lake supports nearly 350 different species, many of them migratory birds that use the lake to rest and refuel as they cruise north or south along the Central and Pacific flyways. While many migrating birds can make do with any lake, fresh or salty, some species are saline specialists, like eared grebes and phalaropes.</p>



<p>According to a 2017 report by the National Audubon Society, more than half of the saline lakes in the West that are most important for birds have shrunk by 50 to 95 percent in their surface area over the last 150 years. “The birds are competing now for a much more limited resource than they did before,” says John Luft, manager of the Great Salt Lake Ecosystem Program at the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.</p>



<p>During some fall migrations, 5 million eared grebes — perhaps 95 percent of the species’ entire population — have stopped over in Utah, Luft says. Each grebe needs to eat up to 30,000 brine shrimp per day from the Great Salt Lake before continuing on its long migratory journey. Brine shrimp flourish between 12 and 17 percent salinity, but they start to decline drastically once salinity passes that threshold — and the south arm of the Great Salt Lake reached 18 percent <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/great-salt-lake-record-salinity-and-low-water-imperils-millions-birds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last September</a>. (For comparison, the ocean averages about 3.5 percent salinity.)</p>

<h4>What to do about Great Salt Lake’s drying?</h4>



<p>While Wurtsbaugh says that “drying is definitely the projection and the worry,” he believes residents can help halt the decline by using less water.</p>



<p>Null agrees. “We can save Great Salt Lake, but it’s a long solution, not something that we’re going to fix overnight.” The most important way to make progress, she says, is for people to care enough to change their behavior.</p>



<p>Utahans have the second highest per capita use of water in the country. Encouraging people to use less water is the simplest — and cheapest — way to begin refilling the Great Salt Lake. This includes using rain barrels, permeable pavement or xeriscaping in urban or suburban areas, as well as improving the efficiency of irrigation structures on farms and ranches.</p>



<p>Permanently mandating water cutbacks would cost between $5 to $32 per person, according to Wurtsbaugh and Null’s <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345220917_Great_Salt_Lake_Biology_A_Terminal_Lake_in_a_Time_of_Change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a>. The BYU team’s report, coauthored by 32 Great Salt Lake experts, emphasizes that conservation is not only the most cost-effective response, but also “the only way to provide adequate water in time to save Great Salt Lake.” Specifically, the report stresses the importance of reducing outdoor water use, especially on agricultural fields.</p>



<p>Last year, faced with withering streams and ominous lake levels, the Utah State Legislature passed a slew of bills focused on voluntary water conservation. “Honestly, I look at this as our time to shine,” says Joel Ferry, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources. “The people of Utah … want to solve the problem.”</p>



<p>Some of the recent legislation calls for obvious fixes — like banning any requirements that residents water their lawns. Before this legislation, fines for not keeping your grass green were common around Salt Lake City. Other laws focus on making sure basic systems are in place to track water use, from the individual to the watershed level.</p>



<p>For instance, the legislature allocated $250 million to install tens of thousands of meters to track people’s outdoor water use. According to Wurtsbaugh, a previous effort to install meters in the Weber River, which flows into the Great Salt Lake, showed that “just knowing how much water you&#8217;re using compared to what your neighbor’s using” meant people used about 25 percent less water. Metering also opens the door to charging people accurately — or more — for the water they use. Currently, most residents pay a flat fee for all outdoor water, regardless of whether they are watering a few flowers or filling an entire swimming pool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since agriculture accounts for three-quarters of the water use in the Great Salt Lake region, Utah is also encouraging farmers and ranchers to conserve water. This shift has the advantage of making operations more drought resilient, says Ferry, who is also a fifth-generation rancher who irrigates with water from the Bear River. “Producers want to be part of the solution. They have to be.”</p>



<p>In 2022, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food’s Water Optimization Program granted <a href="https://le.utah.gov/interim/2022/pdf/00003611.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$70 million</a> to help farmers and ranchers install drip or sprinkler systems that use less water. The Utah State Legislature also appropriated $40 million last year to preserve flows to the lake. Much of that is dedicated to setting up a water trust to lease water rights from farmers or ranchers willing to sell. Essentially, a water trust would pay irrigators to leave some or all of the water they are permitted to use in the stream or river instead of diverting it to water crops. These water leases could last a single summer or several years.</p>



<p>Water leasing is helping restore other ailing saline lakes. In Nevada, purchasing water rights from willing sellers has boosted the level of <a href="https://www.walkerbasin.org/request-for-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walker Lake</a>, about 150 kilometers southeast of Reno. But because water is so valuable in the arid West, it’s an expensive way to refill a lake. The Walker Basin Restoration Program has spent at least $92 million but has only acquired 53 percent of the water needed to support native fish and wildlife in the lake.</p>



<h4>Big infrastructure and Mother Nature</h4>



<p>If water conservation programs don’t work, Utahans might be faced with a more extreme solution to save the Great Salt Lake.</p>



<p>The alternative to conservation measures, says Null, is “hanging our hopes on big new infrastructure projects” that attempt to refill the lake by bringing water from other basins. One example is the Central Utah Project, which has been in the works for more than 80 years and is still incomplete. This project pipes up to 310 billion liters of water from the Colorado River Basin in eastern Utah, infamously over-tapped already, into a series of reservoirs and tunnels to supply water for irrigation, municipal and industrial uses in the Great Salt Lake’s watershed. According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the initial plans for the Central Utah Project put it “among the most complex” water resources development projects ever undertaken by the bureau, estimated to cost $3 billion once all phases are complete.</p>

<p>In the Aral Sea, dikes were built to preserve the remaining sliver of wet habitat, which meant permanently sacrificing the rest of the historical lake area. In California, Mono Lake was saved by a lawsuit based on the public trust doctrine, which says that the government has a responsibility to protect the resources that belong to everyone. The court’s decision cut off water to cities in Southern California that held water rights to the river that fed Mono Lake. Los Angeles made up the difference in part through water conservation measures.</p>



<p>Ferry says Utah isn’t closing the door on any options. Some of the more unorthodox ideas floating around Salt Lake City include cloud seeding to boost precipitation and piping water from the Pacific Ocean to refill the lake. But the most common strategy echoed by the Utahans interviewed for this story: Pray for snow.</p>



<p>“I’m very optimistic that we are at the lowest of lows,” Ferry said last fall, “as long as we get some snow.”</p>



<p>Utah received a record-setting amount of snow this winter, so the situation is looking up … at least for now. But it will take several years of&nbsp;above-average&nbsp;precipitation to reverse Utah’s lingering drought.</p>



<p>“Mother Nature has a huge role to play in this,” Yamane says. “And it’s going to take a mind-set change, a cultural change and policy changes. But along with Mother Nature, we should be able to save it.”</p>

<p>A researcher and former faculty member at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston has been banned from working with animals for a year following repeated cases of abuse under his supervision, according to documents obtained by an animal-rights group.</p>



<p>In an Oct. 26, 2022, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tufts-October-26.pdf">letter</a> to the federal <a href="https://olaw.nih.gov/home.htm">Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare</a>, the university reported &#8220;serious and continuing noncompliance with&#8221; animal-welfare regulations. These breaches included &#8220;injections in mice via an unapproved route/location, failure to provide required analgesia, inadequate supportive care and monitoring, and failure to euthanize mice upon reaching the approved humane endpoints,&#8221; Tufts said.</p>



<p>When asked for his comments, the researcher “refuted most of the allegations and took no responsibility for his actions,” the university added.</p>



<span id="more-126930"></span>



<p>An earlier <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tufts-May-16-letter.pdf">letter</a> from Tufts, dated May 16, 2022, described “a cage of mice containing one adult male with a litter of dead and moribund neonatal pups. Further investigation revealed the dam was misidentified as male and removed from the cage prematurely.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The school has pulled the responsible researcher off the project he was overseeing, revoked his privilege to work as principal investigator on experiments involving animals and suspended him from doing animal research for one year, the university said in the letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare was <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/OLAW-letter.pdf">satisfied with Tufts’ handling of the case</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Tufts spokesperson Patrick Collins, the researcher, whose name is redacted from the documents obtained by Stop Animal Exploitation Now (SAEN), “was performing research for a company that contracted with the university to use its lab space.”</p>



<p>Collins told Retraction Watch:</p>

<p>&#8220;IACUC number B2020-91,&#8221; which is referenced in the Tufts documents, appears in a <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230089267#history">patent application</a> describing several mouse experiments conducted at Tufts. One of the inventors listed is Abdulraouf Ramadan, who is head of immunology at <a href="https://lapix.com/">Lapix Therapeutics</a> and was a research assistant professor at Tufts between 2017 and 2020, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulraouf-ramadan-ph-d-7057a357">now-deleted LinkedIn profile</a>. The two other inventors are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anas-fathallah-8068bb73/">Anas Fathallah</a>, Lapix’ co-founder and CEO, and <a href="https://pharmacy.umich.edu/people/sdlarsen">Scott D. Larsen</a> of the University of Michigan.</p>



<p>Ramadan’s name also appears on one of the emails obtained by SAEN, which includes an attachment titled “Tufts OLAW notification Ramadan 102622.pdf.”</p>



<p>We called Tufts and were told that Ramadan “is listed as a research assistant professor in the department of ophthalmology.&#8221; Ramadan did not reply to our requests for comment, but his LinkedIn profile was deleted shortly after we contacted him at the Tufts email we were provided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lapix-Therapeutics-USPTO-Letter-4-17-23.pdf">letter</a> to the United States Patent and Trademarking Office dated April 17, SAEN took issue with the <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20230089267">patent</a> application that we identified.</p>



<p>The application, filed by Lapix Therapeutics, repeatedly states that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All animal studies were conducted under IACUC number B2020-91 and in compliance with Tufts University/Tufts Medical Center &amp; Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>SAEN called this statement “patently untrue, and therefore fraudulent” given the violations that Tufts reported:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Therefore, since this patent filing is in fact both fraudulent, and connected to “serious and continuing noncompliance” with PHS policy and federal regulations, it must be revoked.</p>

<h4>Sizing up rings</h4>



<p><em>The dwarf planet Quaoar sports a ring that lies outside the orb’s Roche limit, an invisible line beyond which rings aren’t thought to be stable, <strong>Lisa Grossman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-dwarf-planet-quaoar-ring">This dwarf planet hosts an odd ring</a>” (</em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 11<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Henry Leonard</strong> wondered if it’s possible the ring isn’t so unusual, that p­erhaps Quaoar simply has an unexpectedly large mass, resulting in a large Roche limit.</p>



<p>Astronomer <strong>Bruno Morgado</strong> of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro is certain that the dwarf planet’s ring is an oddball. <strong>Morgado’s</strong> team used the orbital motion of Quaoar’s satellite, Weywot, to determine the dwarf planet’s mass. That revealed that the ring is way outside its Roche limit, <strong>Morgado </strong>says.</p>





<h4>Down the drain</h4>



<p><em>Fifty years ago, scientists discovered that Earth’s oceans slowly drain into the mantle. Today, it’s known that some water cycles back into the oceans, but just how much remains unclear, <strong>Erin</strong> <strong>Garcia de Jesús </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-oceans-tectonic-plate-mantle">Oceans may be shrinking</a>” (</em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 4<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Karen Schaffer </strong>wondered how this phenomenon influences sea level rise due to climate change.</p>



<p>The oceans are draining into Earth’s interior via plate tectonics at a much slower rate than they are rising due to modern climate change, says <strong>Clint Conrad</strong>, a geophysicist at the University of Oslo. About 280 million metric tons of ocean water leaks into the mantle every year, <strong>Conrad</strong> says. This seems like a lot, but it represents only a tiny fraction of a millimeter of sea level drop per year, he says. In comparison, Greenland and Antarctica together shed about 420 billion tons of ice into the oceans annually, which contributes<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-sea-level-rise-varies-place-place"> an average of roughly a millimeter each year</a> to global sea level rise (<em>SN Online: 8/17/18</em>).</p>





<p>At the current rate, the ice sheets will completely melt within about 50,000 years, <strong>Conrad</strong> says. But the slow and steady loss of ocean water to the mantle will continue for much of Earth’s lifetime. With that said, “the rapid sea level rise occurring right now is, of course, much more important for human society because it produces notable changes during human lifetimes,” he says.</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Rashad Blount</strong> asked what might happen if the mantle reaches its capacity to hold ocean water. Could that contribute to underwater earthquakes or cracks in Earth’s core?</p>



<p>Setting aside processes that cycle water from Earth’s interior back into the oceans, the mantle and core could probably store all of the seawater on the surface, <strong>Conrad</strong> says. Doing so would affect the planet’s geology. But rather than cause quakes or cracks, it would most likely boost volcanism, he says. Water tends to decrease the melting point of minerals. So “a more hydrated Earth should have more melted rocks — more magma — and thus more volcanism,” <strong>Conrad</strong> says. Indeed, the amount of volcanism the planet experiences today might be different if the oceans were not leaking into the planet’s interior, he says.</p>

<h3>Take a look at fish</h3>



<p>Bluestreak cleaner wrasses (one shown below) recognize themselves in mirrors and photos, suggesting that the animals may be self-aware, <strong>Betsy Mason</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-recognize-photo-self-aware">Fish recognize themselves in photos</a>” (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 13</em>). Many readers were not surprised to learn of the fish’s possible self-awareness. Twitter user <strong>@amphimanifesto</strong> wrote: “I’ve long thought animal self-awareness is probably far more widespread than we think. Our current [underestimation] of its breadth is due to the limits of our current methods of ‘testing’ for it and interpreting the results.”</p>

<h4>Tastemaker</h4>



<p><em>Some farmers in the western United States are forgoing irrigation, saving on water and producing more flavorful fruits and vegetables, <strong>Katherine Kornei</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dry-farming-agriculture-climate-change">Betting on dry farming</a>” (</em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 16<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Bill Taylor</strong>, a former gardener who sold dry-farmed tomatoes and apples, advocated for the quality of dry-farmed produce. Though such fruits and vegetables are often smaller than ones grown with typical irrigation, “the flavor is more enjoyable,” <strong>Taylor</strong> wrote. Their size may even be a perk. “On a mountain above Redwood Valley, Calif., [I grew] a dry-farmed apple&#8230;. These small apples sold well as ‘lunch box apples’ for kids to take to school.”</p>



<p>Online, the story inspired T­witter user <strong>@Rickdalgetty1 </strong>to share their experience eating dry-farmed produce: “The [tomatoes] I purchased from a farmer that were grown with minimal water had such concentrated flavor. It was incredible.”</p>

<p><strong>Twice round the world by Boomerang balloon</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/twice-round-world-boomerang-balloon"><em>Science News</em></a>, April 7, 1973</p>



<p>Scientists recovered for the first time … a balloon scientific payload after a long-duration, twice-around-the-world flight. The project is called Boomerang and is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of using balloons for long-duration research.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Balloons fill an important niche in science, bearing instruments to study physics, atmospheric chemistry and astronomy, or to test technologies for space missions. For instance, data collected by balloons have helped reveal that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/balloon-sounds-out-early-universe">the universe is geometrically flat</a>, that Earth’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-lower-atmosphere-rising-climate-change-troposphere">lower atmosphere is rising</a> due to climate change and how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worst-wildfires-can-send-smoke-high-enough-affect-ozone-layer">wildfire smoke impacts the ozone layer</a> (<em>SN: 10/08/02</em>; <em>SN: 12/18/21</em>; <em>SN: 8/8/19</em>). </p>



<p>Earlier this year, the United States shot down several objects high above the country, one of which is alleged to be a surveillance balloon from China. Others are likely “tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions studying weather or conducting other scientific research,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/16/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-united-states-response-to-recent-aerial-objects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Joe Biden said February&nbsp;16 in a news briefing</a>. Some scientists worry rising concerns over spying could limit where high-altitude balloons go — a tall order for vessels that follow the wind.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-challenges-exploring-hidden-realms">The many challenges of exploring hidden realms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine a young woman who sought to explore the oceans’ depths but was barred from going to sea. From her desk in New York City in the 1950s, she used bits of data gathered by the ships she couldn’t sail on to create maps that revolutionized our understanding of the seafloor and helped revise Earth’s history. Her name was Marie Tharp.</p>



<p>Then imagine other scientists, many decades later. They traveled to Antarctica for mapping projects of their own. Like Tharp, the researchers faced obstacles: The river they sought lies under hundreds of meters of solid ice. So the team patched together clues, including a wrinkle on the surface of a glacier, which led to the discovery of a spectacular river-carved cavern beneath the ice that’s almost as tall as the Empire State Building.</p>





<p>So many challenges in science revolve around exploring the invisible or inaccessible, whether the quarry is subatomic particles, distant galaxies or the genetic code of life. The desire to see, to measure, to reveal drives years of grueling, painstaking work and the invention of new tools for exploration.</p>



<p>In Tharp’s case, technologies refined during World War II made it possible for ships to use soundings to accurately measure ocean depth. As freelance journalist Betsy Mason reports, Tharp used that limited acoustic information to plot two-dimensional vertical slices of seafloor topography, then carefully extrapolated that information to fill in the many blank spots on the map. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-tharp-maps-plate-tectonics-seafloor-cartography">It was a cartographical tour de force</a> — and one that helped scientists realize the reality of continental drift.</p>



<p>Present-day Antarctic researchers use World War II–era technologies including radar to peer under the ice, as well as bulky equipment to melt deep exploratory holes and then lower cameras down. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3123721">It’s tedious work, but the payoff can be thrilling</a>, freelance journalist Douglas Fox describes in this issue’s cover story. He knows firsthand. Fox has traveled to Antarctica six times and was present in 2013 when scientists tapped into a subglacial lake and retrieved water and mud samples for the first time. He remembers the goose bumps he felt upon seeing the first glimpses of the lake’s murky interior, likening it to “seeing the surface of Venus for the first time.”</p>



<p>Scientists got their first view of the long-sought river at the end of 2021; they were astonished when the camera spied orange shrimplike creatures. The world those animals inhabit, almost 500 kilometers from daylight, is a new mystery to explore.</p>



<p>Marie Tharp’s story is part of our Unsung Characters series, which tells the stories of scientists whose work has been underappreciated or little known. We launched this series online as part of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century">our Century of Science project</a>. The profiles proved so popular that we’re bringing them to our print readers and extending the series to elevate the work of both past and present-day scientists. </p>
