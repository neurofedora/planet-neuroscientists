<p>A journal has retracted a study on ‘Tin Man Syndrome’ plagiarized from a decade-old April Fools’ joke —  which the author now admits was fake.</p>



<p>On August 15, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/15/tin-man-syndrome-case-plagiarized-from-hoax-sleuths-say/">we wrote</a> about a “rare case report” published in <em>Medicine</em> in which authors claimed they had encountered a case of “ectopia cordis interna” and described an asymptomatic man with his heart located in his abdomen. Sleuths believed the case report plagiarized images from a <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/cases/april-fools-2015-ectopia-cordis-interna-tin-man-syndrome?lang=us">2015 satirical paper</a> describing a condition of the same name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A week later on August 22, <em>Medicine</em>, published by Wolters Kluwer,<em> </em>retracted the paper and five others — all published this year — with shared authors. None of the papers have been cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted papers are:</p>

</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/08220/asymptomatic_young_male_with_ectopia_cordis.120.aspx">retraction notice</a> for the ectopia cordis interna case states the authors were “unable to provide the necessary documentation, which casts doubt on the credibility of the presented case.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other notices linked above read, in part:</p>



<p>Information brought to our attention during a recent investigation casts doubt on both the authorship and credibility of the presented case, and the Publisher has lost faith in the integrity of the content.</p>



<p>The corresponding author on all six studies is Ashraf Basalilah, a researcher at Hadhramaut Hospital in Yemen. Basalilah <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Megan-Larkin-email.pdf">shared an August 21 email</a> sent to him by journal editor Megan Larkin in which she notes concerns with the other five case studies, “while not enough on their own to justify retraction, taken with the allegations above, present a pattern of submission and authorship that raises serious questions.” She then lists several concerns about authors on the papers, such as lack of public records and contact information to confirm author affiliations, outdated affiliations and incomplete author profiles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As a result of this investigation, we have concluded that we can no longer support the validity of the content submitted by the corresponding author,” Larkin continued.</p>



<p>Neither Larkin nor Maya Workowski, another editor and Wolters Kluwer, responded to our request for comment. Several emails to Medicine’s <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/Pages/aboutthejournal.aspx">listed contact email</a> went unanswered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basalilah <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ashraf-emails.pdf">told us</a> the paper was “a trap made by someone who wants to destroy my career intentionally” and that the person in question, who Basalilah says is not a medical professional, provided the researchers with “all the case details and documentations” regarding the ectopia cordis interna case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I trusted that guy and his documentation done everything based on that, we all the authors were not involved in the patient’s care or management [sic],” Basalilah continued.</p>



<p>At the time of our first article, Basalilah provided redacted versions of what he said were the patient’s file, ethical approval paperwork, hospital and radiology department verification letter and patient consent form. He told us he couldn’t share photos of the patient’s body or face for consent reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the paper was retracted, Basalilah told us: “I admit that Ectopia cordis is not real case based on our investigation and t was faked … to destroy authors’ reputation [sic].”</p>



<p>Basalilah stood by his other five case studies, calling them “real, credible and valid.” He said he disagreed with the retractions of those five, and said the journal “has not found any mistakes or justification for retracting them.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">David Sanders</a>, an image expert and biologist at Purdue University in Lafayette, Ind. who weighed in on the images in our previous story, told us from his experience, “when one finds egregious problems in one article it is probable that other articles from one or more of the authors also violate scientific norms.”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/morisky-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="250" height="250" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/morisky-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-86300" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/morisky-1.jpg 250w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/morisky-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Donald Morisky</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Two journals have retracted papers this year for unauthorized use of a controversial scale whose creator has been known to license use of the questionnaire for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/26/use-research-tool-without-permission-youll-hear/">six-figure sums</a> – and to aggressively pursue those payments from researchers he claims have misused the instrument without prior approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) is named for its creator, Donald Morisky,  now a professor emeritus in community health at UCLA. As the name implies, the measure allows researchers to <a href="https://www.moriskyscale.com/about-the-morisky-scale---mmas-4--mmas-8-the-morisky-scales.html">assess patients’ adherence</a> to drug regimens.</p>



<p>Morisky made a business out of licensing the scale and demanding steep fees for researchers who failed to obtain the proper permissions, as we reported <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pay-or-retract-survey-creators-demands-money-rile-some-health-researchers">in <em>Science</em> in 2017</a>. Researchers who cannot afford the payments Morisky and his business associate demand have been forced to retract their work.</p>



<span id="more-132694"></span>



<p>The tool initially involved four questions but in 2008 expanded to eight. But the paper describing the longer questionnaire was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/24/paper-that-helped-form-basis-of-pricy-research-tool-retracted/">retracted in 2023</a> after one critic claimed the scale was no more accurate than flipping a coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, the authors of a September 2024 paper in <em>Cureus</em> on medication adherence for patients with cardiovascular disease requested the retraction of their paper for “use of a copyrighted scale without the necessary permissions,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding author did not respond to our request for comment, but a representative from <em>Cureus</em> confirmed the retraction notice referred to the MMAS. The journal was “contacted by a representative for the scale owner who alerted us to its use in this paper without the necessary permissions,” and after speaking with them, the authors requested the retraction. The representative didn’t respond to our follow-up request regarding the identity of the person who raised the issue. <em>Cureus</em> did not answer our question regarding how much the authors were asked to pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2023 paper from <em>Journal of Arrhythmia</em> was withdrawn in July “because the authors had not obtained permission to use the MMAS-8 scale reported in the article,” according to the notice. The paper, which describes disease awareness and medication adherence in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation, has been cited once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The journal acknowledged our request for comment but did not answer our questions regarding how they were alerted to misuse of the scale. Nihon Medical School, where the study took place, also did not respond to our email request for comment.</p>



<p>By our count, there have been at least nine retractions for licensing issues related to the MMAS. But not all retractions of papers that use the scale explicitly cite a reason in the notice, so the number is likely higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morisky also has been known to demand researchers who license his scale make changes to publications after they appear – as was this case in this <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/pop.2018.0024">2018 article</a> by Adrienne Casebeer and her colleagues in <em>Population Health Management</em>, which was retracted several months after it appeared in print. According to the notice: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dr. Casebeer&#8217;s team obtained a license to use the MMAS-8 scale from Dr. Morisky prior to conducting the study. Nevertheless, after publication of a separate article in the Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes that also cited the MMAS-8, as the lead author, Dr. Casebeer was contacted by Dr. Morisky who requested that a number of changes be made to the article. Dr. Casebeer and her team have no desire to engage in a dispute with Dr. Morisky and therefore proactively contacted the Editor of Population Health Management and requested that the scale be removed from her published paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/07/journal-pulls-paper-from-ethiopia-for-unlicensed-use-of-questionnaire/">we wrote</a> about researchers who “were not aware that the Donald Morisky medication adherence tool required a fee to use.” When they attempted to reach out to Morisky, he didn’t respond, and their paper was retracted by the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve Trubow, Morisky’s former business partner, told us he is currently policing the use of the scale after a lengthy legal struggle between the two. </p>



<p>Morisky, his family and Trubow have been playing tug-of-war over the scale – and a related “widget,” which belongs to Trubow’s company called MMAS Research LLC –  for years. In 2020, the pair  <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/02/duo-that-used-legal-threats-to-force-scientists-to-pay-for-a-tool-face-off-in-court/">faced off in court</a> over ownership of the scale, a battle which Trubow told us <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/circuit-courts/ca9/24-6568?amp">ended in a settlement</a>.</p>

<p>The mega-journal <em>Cureus</em> is eliminating author suggestions for peer reviewers, a prompt that is <a href="https://crosstalk.cell.com/blog/suggesting-peer-reviewers">standard practice</a> at some journals when submitting a manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Cureus-Email-peer-review.pdf">an email</a> sent August 25 to current and past peer reviewers, the move is “due to the potential conflict of interest” that comes from authors suggesting reviewers who may be mentors and colleagues. </p>



<p>Reviewers recommended by authors are <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/dont-let-researchers-choose-who-peer-reviews-their-work">more likely</a> to give positive feedback on papers. And such recommendations gave way to such practices as peer review rings and self-peer review, vulnerabilities that started to thrive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/515480a">more than a decade ago</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132689"></span>



<p>Some authors at <em>Cureus</em> have taken advantage of this system. In 2021, a medical resident in New Jersey <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/03/19/meet-the-medical-resident-who-had-his-wife-peer-review-five-of-his-papers/">invited his wife</a> to review his papers without disclosing their relationship, resulting in five retractions. In 2019, another author <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/04/11/an-author-was-accused-of-faking-peer-reviews-turns-out-he-also-falsified-two-images/">faked reviewer accounts</a> for two well-known neurosurgeons and was discovered only after a routine editorial audit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, instead of reviewers, authors will suggest five “colleagues or mentors to serve as Advisers,” who will provide “advisory feedback” via inline comments rather than peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reviewers recommended by authors had until August 28 to submit their peer review feedback, according to the email. Anything submitted after that “will be converted to advisory feedback.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/about-hilda-bastian/">Hilda Bastian</a>, a meta-scientist, writer and cartoonist in Australia, called the move a “backward step — it’s increasing the risk of bias in the editorial process,” she said.</p>



<p>“Presenting this as a step to ‘empower’ authors to get feedback from mentors and colleagues is an odd argument. You don&#8217;t need a journal to get advice from your mentors and colleagues,” Bastian continued.</p>



<p><a href="https://medianwatch.netlify.app/">Adrian Barnett</a>, a researcher at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said he “can’t see how these Adviser comments will work.” He raised questions regarding whether the comments would be made public, if the peer reviewers have access to adviser comments, and whether the sudden deadline would cause some existing reviewers to rush their comments or simply pull out. (Barnett’s <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/wdvr9_v1">recent work</a> found researchers who were cited in a study they reviewed were more likely to recommend that paper.)&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Cureus</em> did not respond to our request for comment regarding the role of the “Adviser” and whether those comments would be required for all submissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Springer Nature, which purchased the journal in December 2022, acknowledged our request for comment but did not answer our questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Cureus </em>has retracted <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">125 papers</a> since Springer Nature <a href="https://www.cureus.com/newsroom/news/159">acquired the title</a>, 77 of which were for author issues, like fake, unverified or changed authorship, according to our database. Last year, Clarivate’s Web of Science put the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">on hold</a> for concerns about article quality, which the journal has been <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/24/cureus-its-reviewing-and-its-scholarly-impact-quotient/">criticized for</a> in the past.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first attempt the journal has made to improve its publishing practices. In November of last year, <em>Cureus</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/21/mega-journal-cureus-kicks-out-organizations-critics-called-paper-mills/">closed</a> six of its “channels” after we reported that they were <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">allowing questionable organizations</a> to hand-pick their own editors.&nbsp;</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sonia_melo_portugal.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="256" height="195" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sonia_melo_portugal.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132676"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sonia Melo</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A biochemist who worked as a postdoc at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston has sued the institution to dispute findings of research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.i3s.up.pt/personal-info.php?id=539&amp;idg=22">Sonia Melo</a>, now at the University of Porto in Portugal, alleges MD Anderson did not follow its own policies while conducting its investigation. Melo <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/02/embo-awardee-under-investigation-loses-grant/">lost a prestigious grant</a> in 2016 after one of her papers was retracted for containing duplicated images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MD Anderson&#8217;s investigation concerned <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610814003687">a paper</a> published in <em>Cancer Cell</em> in 2014. On August 7 the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610825003289">marked it with</a> a “temporary Expression of Concern” detailing duplicated and relabeled data found in the probe, which was completed in May 2024. The article has been cited 1,462 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132677"></span>



<p>The investigation “concluded that there are no authentic, original, and uncontested data to verify the results presented in the publication and recommended retraction of the article,” the notice states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Melo “expressly denies the findings of research misconduct made by MD Anderson,” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/amended-petition-melo-mdacc.pdf">according to her lawsuit</a>, filed in Harris County, Texas. She asked the court to declare MD Anderson had infringed her due process rights, and void the institution’s final decision of research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can only reaffirm that I stand firmly behind the claims outlined in the Petition,” Melo told Retraction Watch. “As the matter is subject to ongoing litigation, I am not in a position to provide additional comments at this time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/kalluri-laboratory/lab-members.html">Raghu Kalluri</a>, the corresponding author of the paper and a professor of cancer biology at MD Anderson, told us he had suggested the journal place the temporary expression of concern on the paper until the dispute is resolved.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raghu-kalluri-crop.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="545" height="677" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raghu-kalluri-crop.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132675" style="width:250px;height:auto" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raghu-kalluri-crop.jpg 545w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raghu-kalluri-crop-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Raghu Kalluri</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“The data was found to substantiate every figure in the paper that was in question,” Kalluri said. “The committee just did not like the exact sequence in which the data was recorded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He has requested a correction for some “genuine errors” that “don’t impact the data at all,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The expression of concern states some of the paper’s 14 authors disagree with the investigation’s findings, but does not specify which ones. The authors maintain MD Anderson investigated the article in 2016 and did not recommend retracting it, and “all original data supporting the paper’s conclusions” were provided to the investigation committee, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors of <em>Cancer Cell</em> are reviewing the concerns and will update the scientific community with their conclusion, the notice states. A spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of <em>Cancer Cell</em>, said the company could not comment while the investigation was ongoing.</p>



<p>Kalluri declined to share the investigation report and other documents with us. We filed a request for the report under Texas’ public records law, but have not received the document.</p>



<p>Kalluri served as chair of the Department of Cancer Biology from 2012 until June 1, according to a spokesperson for MD Anderson. He told us the change was “due to family reasons and personal reasons,” and because he decided to devote more time to research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Kalluri’s <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/24813">papers</a>, in the <em>Journal of Clinical Investigation</em>, was <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/135305">retracted</a> in January 2020 after the U.S. Office of Research Integrity found the first author, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/07/reused-over-and-over-again-image-recycling-leads-to-5-year-funding-ban-for-cancer-researcher/">Sudhakar Yakkanti</a>, fabricated data. ORI also recommended the retraction or correction of a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0730882100">paper</a> in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> on which Kalluri and Yakkanti collaborated which has yet to be marked.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Within a year of the publication of the <em>Cancer Cell</em> paper, anonymous users of PubPeer began <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EB26CFF7EAE4F3E766EF305622527B#1">posting illustrations</a> of figures in the paper that appeared identical to other figures depicting different experiments. The findings in the temporary expression of concern match those identified on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MD Anderson conducted an internal inquiry into the allegations on PubPeer in 2016 and “concluded that no further action was warranted,” Melo alleges in her lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in 2016, the European Molecular Biology Organization <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/02/embo-awardee-under-investigation-loses-grant/">revoked</a> an early career grant to Melo of up to 250,000 euros, following the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/02/embo-awardee-under-investigation-there-was-no-effort-to-commit-fraud/">retraction of a paper</a> in <em>Nature Genetics</em> on which she was the first author. At least four of <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMelo%252c%2bSonia%2bA">Melo’s other papers</a> have received corrections — one of them twice. The <a href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(25)00323-X">most recent</a> correction, of a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(10)00344-2">2010 paper</a> also published in <em>Cancer Cell</em>, appeared August 11 and replaced a supplementary figure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Melo’s lawsuit, in January 2019 MD Anderson began looking into allegations regarding the <em>Cancer Cell</em> paper and three patents she co-owns, <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO2015085096">one of which</a> is mentioned in the expression of concern. She alleges the institution did not notify her of the inquiry or subsequent investigation until February 2023, in violation of its policies. She also alleges the investigation took longer than allowed for in the institution&#8217;s policy. She received a draft of the investigation report on April 23, 2024, and submitted a 30-page response disputing the findings, she alleges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark Barnes, an attorney at the Boston firm Ropes &amp; Gray who was serving as MD Anderson’s acting Research Integrity Officer, sent the institution’s final report to Melo <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/barnes-email-melo-mdacc.pdf">in an email</a> dated May 10, 2024. Melo attached the email, but not the report, to her lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peter Pisters, president of MD Anderson, accepted the committee’s findings and recommendations, Barnes wrote to Melo. The institution asked Melo to pursue retraction of the <em>Cancer Cell </em>paper within two weeks, and said it would do so if she did not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MD Anderson also “indefinitely” prohibited Melo from any appointment or employment at the institution, from performing any research there or collaborating with any MD Anderson researchers, and from receiving research-related funding from the institution, Barnes’ email stated. Barnes declined to comment for this story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is committed to the highest standards of scientific integrity and works to uphold these standards through established processes,” a spokesperson told us. “The institution does not comment on pending litigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Melo’s lawyers filed a motion for default judgment against MD Anderson on August 18, as the institution had not submitted a response to her lawsuit in court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The day we asked MD Anderson for comment on the lawsuit, August 21, the institution filed two responses. “Defendant recently learned of the Motion for Default Judgment and immediately filed an answer,” the Texas attorney general’s office <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MDACC-response-to-motion-for-default-judgment.pdf">wrote in the response</a> asking the court to deny the motion. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MDACC-answer.pdf">its answer to Melo’s petition</a>, the attorney general’s office wrote MD Anderson denied “all the allegations and claims” and asserted it was immune from the suit and liability as a sovereign entity.&nbsp;</p>

                Abstract:  The Illinois Newspaper Project has existed in some form for nearly four decades and has evolved through project locations, staffing, and areas of focus. Collaborative efforts of the project have depended on the phase of work, staff levels, and institutional resources, and were strong in the project’s early years but slowed down between 2011-2023. Most recently, as an homage to the project’s early collaborative roots and supported by the institutional resources of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U. of I.), the INP has been well-equipped to serve as a state resource for newspaper preservation and digitization in alliance with the University’s land grant mission. The INP has built partnerships with cultural heritage institutions across the state to preserve and provide freely available access to Illinois historical newspapers through its digital newspaper platform, the Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections (IDNC).

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naohiro-kameta.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="198" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naohiro-kameta.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132666"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Naohiro Kameta</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A chemistry journal has retracted a 2020 review article by a nanotube researcher who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/10/retractions-begin-for-chemist-found-to-have-faked-data-in-42-papers/">fabricated and falsified data</a> in dozens of studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest retraction for Naohiro Kameta brings his total to 40, earning him a place on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">Retraction Watch Leaderboard</a>. </p>



<p>In a 2020 review article in <em>Chemical Reviews</em>, 24 of the 610 works Kameta and his coauthors cited had themselves been retracted following the publication of the paper, according to <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5c00539">the retraction notice</a>. Because these references were “important components” of the review article, “the narrative and claims presented can no longer be upheld,” the notice reads. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00509">The review</a> has been cited 164 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<span id="more-132663"></span>



<p>All 24 of the works mentioned in the retraction notice were <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">among 42 papers identified as fraudulent</a> in a 2024 investigation by Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), where Kameta worked in the Nanomaterials Research Institute <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/au20240731_1.html">until his dismissal</a> last year. The retraction notice does not mention the inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A coauthor on the review was Kameta’s AIST colleague Toshimi Shimizu, who the institution’s investigation stated was responsible for the content of the papers but was not involved in any misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around the same time as the retraction, French computer scientist Guillaume Cabanac posted on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D40E77CF94EA5EEA609FBEDA593EFD#1">PubPeer </a>warning readers to “reassess the reliability of the document” since it contained 23 references flagged by the Problematic Paper Screener, a tool that identifies suspicious papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1557F198FA7DC1569A44B36C1E1942#0">also flagged</a> another article containing references to 18 of Kameta’s retracted works. Shimizu is the sole author of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bcsj/article/91/4/623/7333093">that paper</a>, published in <em>Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan</em>. Shimizu could not be reached for comment via his institutional email. Editors at the journal have not responded to a request for comment. </p>



<p>As AIST <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/Portals/0/resource_images/aist_j/information/240329_anken1.pdf">wrote in its report</a> about the investigation, Kameta repeatedly altered electron micrographs and misrepresented scale bars in the 42 papers they found linked to misconduct so he could publish as many papers as possible. The investigation also found his research records were incomplete and that his samples had been discarded.The misconduct was evident across nearly two decades of Kameta’s work, according to AIST.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">announcement of their findings</a>, AIST warned researchers to “please be careful when citing [the flagged papers], as the content is factually incorrect.” In an email this week, the institution’s media office wrote that individual researchers would not be responding to our questions about other papers citing Kameta, nor would the institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since our earlier reporting on this case, all of Kameta’s articles in journals owned by the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry mentioned in the investigation have now been retracted. The six remaining unretracted papers appear to be published in Japanese language journals or are conference proceedings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the recently retracted papers contained problems with scale bars, with one reported as being <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/cc/d4cc90364a">46 times longer</a> than it should have been. Many also included manually manipulated images and some where the original images <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c03020">couldn’t be found</a>. The retraction notices cite these errors as examples of the scientific misconduct identified by AIST, which recommended the retractions. They also make clear Kameta was responsible for the misconduct, while his coauthors were not implicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kameta, who does not appear to have published any new articles since 2024, could not be reached for comment via his institutional email.&nbsp;</p>
