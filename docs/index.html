<p>Muhammad Zain Yousaf, a postdoc at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, became a scholar of note overnight. Or so it would seem, based on his now-defunct Google Scholar profile: From a modest 47 in 2022 and around 100 in 2023, Yousaf’s citations jumped to 629 in 2024. His <a href="https://scientific-publishing.webshop.elsevier.com/publication-recognition/what-good-h-index/">h-index</a>, a measure combining publication and citation numbers, took off accordingly, reaching levels typical of a senior academic.</p>



<p>But another researcher smelled a rat and took a closer look at Yousaf’s publications. In just two days, Yousaf had <a href="https://www.techrxiv.org/users/859741-muhammad-zain-yousaf">uploaded 10 short documents</a> to TechRxiv, a preprint server hosted by the U.S.-based Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, or IEEE. Each of the documents was chock-full of self-citations. In five cases, Yousaf was an author on all 37 papers in the reference list; the rest of the time, his publications made up nearly two-thirds of the reference list.</p>



<p>”Many of these documents appear to be low quality, as evidenced by their lack of coherence and technical quality,” the concerned researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, said of the preprints in an email to TechRxiv last December.</p>



<span id="more-133557"></span>



<p>The researcher added that Yousaf’s actions were ”a clear attempt to manipulate citation metrics on external platforms such as Google Scholar” and ”undermine the credibility of TechRxiv as a platform for genuine academic contributions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One year later all of the documents remain on IEEE’s server. “IEEE is aware of the concerns regarding these papers and is investigating,” Francine Tardo, corporate spokesperson for the organization, told us.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="511" height="1024" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-511x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-133560" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-511x1024.jpeg 511w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-150x300.jpeg 150w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.jpeg 727w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Yousaf&#8217;s profile on TechRxiv still lists 10 documents uploaded within days of each other in 2024. (Click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Yousaf, an electrical engineer, did not acknowledge our emails laying out the allegations against him and asking for an interview. But on the day we first contacted him, the researcher’s <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&amp;hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;user=ERQykZAAAAAJ">Google Scholar page</a>, which listed his h-index as 21, was taken down; his name on TechRxiv was shortened to “Yousaf” and delinked from <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6664-8235">his ORCID profile</a>; and the ORCID entry describing his current position at Zhejiang University – “Posdoctrate (Space)” (sic) – disappeared. Several more entries were removed later. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1452398125002949">recent paper</a> lists Yousaf’s affiliations as the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Zhejiang University and the Center for Research on Microgrids (CROM) at Huanjiang Laboratory in Zhuji.</p>



<p>Google Scholar has become the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7">go-to source</a> of publication metrics for academics evaluating new job applicants, even at renowned universities in the United States&nbsp; and England. But the tool is exceedingly easy to game for those looking for a shortcut to impressive numbers – the service will index even non-existent papers cited in preprints – as researchers have shown <a href="https://hal.science/hal-00713564">again</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0638">again</a> (and <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/2024/07/18/engineering-the-worlds-highest-cited-cat-larry/">again</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7">again</a> and <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/2025/05/06/google-scholar-is-still-doing-nothing-about-citation-manipulation/">again</a>). We wrote about a high-profile computer scientist in Spain, Juan Manuel Corchado, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/25/how-critics-say-a-computer-scientist-in-spain-artificially-boosted-his-google-scholar-metrics/">who had done just that</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get a better sense of how this tactic inflated the researcher’s h-index, David Robert Grimes, one of Retraction Watch’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/27/meet-the-first-two-retraction-watch-sleuths-in-residence/">Sleuths in Residence</a>, scraped data from Google Scholar on September 10, when Yousaf’s h-index was 19. Excluding self-citations slashed the index to 13, and removing sources with no or minimal peer review, such as preprints and conference proceedings, brought it down to 12. When Grimes excluded both self-citation and sources without peer review, Yousaf’s h-index dropped to 9, a reduction of more than 50 percent. (Yousaf’s h-index according to Scopus, the Elsevier citation database, is <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57204241229">14</a>, up from 13 in November.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="476" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1-1024x476.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-133562" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1-1024x476.jpeg 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1-300x139.jpeg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1-768x357.jpeg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpeg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The position at Zhejiang University shown in this screenshot of Yousaf&#8217;s ORCID profile has since been deleted.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is far from the first time somebody has used non-peer-reviewed archives to manipulate Google Scholar,” said <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/">Reese Richardson</a> of Northwestern University, who studies scientific fraud. “Google Scholar has made it very clear they don&#8217;t intend to fix this. They have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2014.16269">known about this for 10 years</a>.”</p>



<p>Google did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p><a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/yasir-zaki.html">Yasir Zaki</a>, a computer scientist at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, recently published a study describing different ways <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7">Google Scholar metrics can be manipulated</a>. Yousaf’s case, Zaki said, is “in line with what we have seen in the past.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>”Many of our suspicious authors were uploading documents to either ResearchGate or Authorea,” Zaki told us. “On a related note, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03664-7">arXiv has banned</a> computer-science review papers that have not been published for the exact same reason, because some authors are using this as a way to inflate their citations.”</p>



<p>Zaki said he and his colleagues built a tool using data from OpenAlex to visualize collaboration patterns for specific researchers. The tool shows Yousaf had nearly 130 unique coauthors with whom he collaborated only once, and that in 2025, Yousaf had as many as 120 new unique coauthors – both abnormally high numbers, according to Zaki.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.graham-kendall.com/">Graham Kendall</a>, a computer scientist and deputy vice chancellor at Mila University in Malaysia who writes frequently about publications ethics, also noted a steep rise in citations in 2025 on Yousaf’s <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57204241229">Scopus profile</a>. Such an increase raises “a red flag,” Kendall told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Richardson’s view, metrics gaming “is going to happen so long as there&#8217;s a pressure for citations. The question is, who is going to willingly participate in it? So TechRxiv has decided that they&#8217;re going to, Google Scholar has decided that they&#8217;re going to.”</p>

<p><em>Nature </em>has retracted a paper on&nbsp; melanoma after an investigation by the journal found issues with data that rendered certain results statistically insignificant. A separate institutional investigation concluded misconduct wasn’t involved, the lead author says.</p>



<p>The research behind <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17392">the article</a>, published in April 2016, was conducted in the lab of <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3918/ashani-t-weeraratna">Ashani Weeraratna</a>, then at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. The paper has been cited 332 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The study investigated how the tumor microenvironment affected the spread of young versus aged cells.</p>



<p>An editorial investigation found some results in a figure were “no longer statistically significant, which affects the conclusions about therapy resistance,” according to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09719-z">October 29 retraction notice</a>. The inquiry also found&nbsp; “several errors in image and source data consistency,” as well as errors with the sample numbers given in the original study.</p>

<p>Other authors on the paper — of which there are 46 total — are at Yale University, Mass General Hospital, Johns Hopkins, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California, Los Angeles, the National Institute on Aging, and other prominent institutions. Four of the authors agreed with the retraction, 28 disagreed, and 14 didn’t respond, according to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09719-z">notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the authors who agreed with the retraction, <a href="https://www.wistar.org/our-scientists/hsin-yao-tang/">Hsin-Yao Tang</a>, was coauthor on another Wistar paper which was retracted in 2021 for data inconsistencies, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/27/researcher-leaves-wistar-institute-as-he-retracts-a-nature-paper/">we reported at the time</a>. He did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18939">received a correction in 2016</a> for labels in a figure that were &#8220;inadvertently reversed.” In August 2023, the journal placed an expression of concern on the paper alerting readers the “reliability of some of the data presented in this manuscript is currently in question.”</p>



<p>An anonymous user on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8E34890DCC15FE39AAC42910572980">PubPeer</a> posted three comments in September 2022 pointing out inconsistencies in images provided in the raw data versus the published versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A different user commented the following month that the raw data for one of the figures had “many points followed by” asterisks. “If we exclude these points and graph the data, the graph and stats match the published version of the graph,” the user wrote. When the asterisked points were included, “the conclusions are no longer valid,” they added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other commenters noted missing data or further discrepancies between the raw and published data for the experiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weeraratna, the corresponding and lead author on the paper, is now a researcher at Johns Hopkins and a <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/advisory-boards/ncab/members">member</a> of the NIH National Cancer Advisory Board. She told Retraction Watch some results were &#8220;mistakenly labeled as outliers.&#8221; She also told us Wistar had formed an outside committee for an inquiry into the discrepancies. “The inquiry found no scientific misconduct,” she said, but added she could not discuss the matter further because of a confidentiality agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francesca Cesari, chief biological, clinical and social sciences editor for <em>Nature</em>, told us the institute did not contact the journal regarding the investigation. Darien Sutton, the director of media relations at Wistar, declined to comment.</p>



<p>The researchers repeated the experiment in 2023 &#8220;with improved, less toxic, standard-of-care inhibitors unavailable at the time of the original work,” Weeraratna said, which confirmed the paper’s original conclusions.She said the researchers sent the results of this experiment to the journal, but “<em>Nature</em> did not consider these.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cesari told us the experiments &#8220;were not an exact replication of the original work. While we carefully considered the information provided, it did not change our assessment of the concerns raised about the original publication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04774-2">Another <em>Nature</em> paper</a> from the Weeraratna lab <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/297809D35C244918616097F6C6C949">also drew attention on PubPeer</a> shortly after it was published in 2022, with users pointing out similar issues to the retracted paper, such as inconsistencies with raw and published data, excluded values and unexpected image similarities. Weeraratna responded to several of these comments on the PubPeer thread to explain the discrepancies. The authors published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08659-y">correction in January 2025</a> to address the issues. <em>Nature</em> told us they are looking into the paper further.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A review article concluding the weed killer Roundup “does not pose a health risk to humans” has been retracted eight years after documents released in a court case revealed employees of Monsanto, the company that developed the herbicide, wrote the article but were not named as coauthors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The safety of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/opinion/pesticides-health-food-glyphosate.html">hotly debated</a> and currently <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/glyphosate">under review</a> at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, in 2015 <a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/">declared</a> glyphosate “possibly carcinogenic.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The now-retracted <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715?via%3Dihub">article</a> appeared in <em>Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology</em>, an Elsevier title, in 2000. Gary Williams, then a pathologist at New York Medical College in Valhalla, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0960327106080109">Robert Kroes</a>, a toxicologist at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, and <a href="https://www.legacy.com/ca/obituaries/theglobeandmail/name/ian-munro-obituary?id=41533644">Ian C. Munro</a>, a toxicologist at Cantox Health Sciences International in Ontario, Canada, were listed as the authors. The paper has been cited 614 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133515"></span>



<p>Three papers about glyphosate on which Williams was an author <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/09/27/journal-flags-papers-saying-authors-didnt-adequately-disclose-ties-to-monsanto/">received an expression of concern</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408444.2018.1539570">lengthy corrections</a> in 2018 because the authors didn’t fully disclose their ties to Monsanto or the company’s involvement in the articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, internal Monsanto <a href="https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/187series.pdf">documents</a>, including emails between employees discussing scientific publications on the safety of glyphosate, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/update-after-quick-review-medical-school-says-no-evidence-monsanto-ghostwrote">were released</a> in the course of a lawsuit alleging exposure to glyphosate caused people to develop non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In one email, a Monsanto employee proposed “keeping the cost down” to produce a scientific paper with outside scientists “by us doing the writing and they would just edit &amp; sign their names so to speak. Recall that is how we handled Williams Kroes &amp; Munro, 2000.” (The email is on page 203 of the document <a href="https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/187series.pdf">linked here</a> and above.)</p>



<p>Despite the revelation of corporate ghost-writing, the paper continued to be cited in research and policy documents without criticism, as well as in Wikipedia articles, according to scholars who analyzed its impact. The researchers, Alexander Kaurov of Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, and Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001765">published their findings</a> in September in another Elsevier journal, <em>Environmental Science &amp; Policy</em>. They also wrote to the editors of <em>Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology</em> to formally request the paper’s retraction, they wrote in editorials describing their work in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aec4187"><em>Science</em></a> and <a href="https://undark.org/2025/08/15/opinion-ghostwritten-paper-glyphosate/"><em>Undark</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their request “was actually the first time a complaint came to my desk directly,” Martin van den Berg, a co-editor-in-chief of the journal, told Retraction Watch. The article was published long before he took over, said van den Berg, a toxicologist at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, and “it was simply not brought to my attention” until Kaurov and Oreskes’ article. The retraction “could have been done as early as 2017, but it is clearly a case of two parallel information streams not connecting earlier,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kaurov and Oreskes wrote to the editors on July 25, Kaurov told us. The editors’ reaction “was exemplary and professional,” Kaurov said. They replied promptly, he said, and conducted their investigation in one month, which he considered “a reasonable amount of time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715?via%3Dihub">notice</a>, which is more than 1,000 words long, appeared online in November. In it, van den Berg detailed “several critical issues that are considered to undermine the academic integrity of this article and its conclusions.” Most concerns were related to what van den Berg described as “the apparent contributions of Monsanto employees as co-writers to this article” without acknowledgment as coauthors. He also called out the authors’ reliance on unpublished studies from Monsanto for their conclusions that glyphosate exposure did not cause cancer, though other studies existed.</p>



<p>“The concerns specified here necessitate this retraction to preserve the scientific integrity of the journal,” van den Berg wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Van den Berg reached out to Williams, the sole surviving author, but did not receive a response, according to the notice. Williams, now an emeritus professor at New York Medical College, did not respond to our request for comment. An institutional investigation found &#8220;no evidence&#8221; Williams violated a policy against authoring a ghostwritten paper, the college <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/update-after-quick-review-medical-school-says-no-evidence-monsanto-ghostwrote">told <em>Science</em> magazine</a> in 2017. Kroes died in 2006 and Munro in 2011.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Bayer, which bought Monsanto, provided a statement which said the company “believe[s] Monsanto’s involvement was appropriately cited in the acknowledgments, which clearly states: ‘we thank the toxicologists and other scientists at Monsanto who made significant contributions to the development of exposure assessments and through many other discussions,’ and further identifies several ‘key personnel at Monsanto who provided scientific support.’”</p>



<p>“The consensus among regulatory bodies worldwide that have conducted their own independent assessments based on the weight of evidence is that glyphosate can be used safely as directed and is not carcinogenic,” said the company’s statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ghostwritten paper was among the 0.1 percent of most cited articles on glyphosate, Kaurov and Oreskes found in their analysis. Retracting the article “would not erase twenty-five years of influence,” they concluded, “but it would send a clear, overdue message that fraudulent authorship is unacceptable and that the scholarly record will be protected—no matter how old, how cited or how profitable the journal.”</p>
