                Doctors find themselves without critical systems and diagnostic tools—and face the daunting reality that a full recovery could take days—after CrowdStrike’s botched deployment of a software update.

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/KellyMcMasters.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="320" height="400" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/KellyMcMasters.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-129679" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/KellyMcMasters.jpg 320w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/KellyMcMasters-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kelly McMasters</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A 14-year-old paper has earned an expression of concern after an anonymous whistleblower found evidence of image duplication in the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors have had images from several more papers flagged on PubPeer. The corresponding author, <a href="https://louisville.edu/medicine/cancer-research/kellymcmasters">Kelly McMasters</a>, is chair of the Hiram C. Polk, Jr., MD Department of Surgery at the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2010 paper, “<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.25322">Adenovirus-mediated expression of truncated E2F-1 suppresses tumor growth in vitro and in vivo</a>,” appeared in <em>Cancer. </em>It has been cited 12 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129677"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.35435">expression of concern</a> highlights “suspected duplication of elements between figures 2b and 2c.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The author [sic] admitted mistakes were made during preparation of the figures; however, since the paper was published in 2010, they were unable to provide the original raw data for figure 2c. Although the conclusions are not believed to be affected, the journal is issuing this expression of concern to alert readers that blots in figure 2c were inappropriately modified without disclosing the processing in the figure caption.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McMasters did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Carissa Gilman, director of editorial operations for <em>Cancer</em>, told<em> Retraction Watch</em> an “anonymous whistleblower” raised concerns about the paper by email. The person “said they had been aided by ImageTwin, an image integrity analytical tool,” Gilman told us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the inappropriate image modification, Gilman told us the editors did “not believe we have enough evidence that the paper should be retracted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal uses expressions of concern “if there are issues we believe cannot be resolved,” the representative continued. “In this case, since the original blot cannot be found, we cannot satisfactorily resolve this issue.”</p>



<p>A January 2024&nbsp; <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4EEA9BC0C130587E0FA581BD040D60?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">comment</a> in PubPeer from “Actinopolyspora biskrensis” on the 2010 paper points out possible duplications of signals and gel slices in the figures mentioned in the notice, as well as possible differential splicing between gel lanes.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The lead author, <a href="https://medicine.missouri.edu/faculty/jorge-gomez-gutierrez-phd">Jorge Gomez-Gutierrez</a>, an associate professor at the University of Missouri School of Medicine in Columbia, Missouri, was unable to find the original blots “given the age of the paper,” according to Gilman.</p>



<p>Gomez-Gutierrez “agreed that the bands corresponding to actin were inadvertently duplicated during the figure preparation,” but stands by the paper “since they have been able to reproduce the same results in the intervening years multiple times using different cell lines,” according to Gilman.&nbsp;He did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>McMasters has several other papers with PubPeer comments, including a second 2010 paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209007326?via%3Dihub">Developing adenoviral vectors encoding therapeutic genes toxic to host cells: Comparing binary and single-inducible vectors expressing truncated E2F-1</a>.” Actinopolyspora <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/69CE43F4F9F070F8B9D36630521758#1">pointed out</a> image overlap in figure 3C of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gomez-Gutierrez <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/69CE43F4F9F070F8B9D36630521758#">responded</a> on PubPeer with original images. However, a second commenter, “Nerita vitiensis,” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/69CE43F4F9F070F8B9D36630521758#3">created an animation</a> which “only confirms that <em>Actinopolyspora biskrensis</em> was correct – the images do indeed overlap.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212004448?via%3Dihub">second paper</a> in <em>Virology </em>has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/402E118A80645EC794FBD424DAE494">comments on PubPeer</a> pointing out image issues. Actinopolyspora noted in January that “[t]wo images in Figure 6D seem to overlap, but are described differently.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A spokesperson from Elsevier, the publisher of <em>Virology,</em> has confirmed that<strong> </strong>the papers in <em>Virology </em>with PubPeer comments are currently “under investigation.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April, the MDPI journal <em>Cancers</em> issued a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/7/1432">correction</a> for “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/10/5/144">Temozolomide Enhances Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Virotherapy In Vitro</a>,” a 2018 paper for which Gomez-Gutierrez and McMasters are corresponding authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The correction concerns an “error” in figure 1A of the paper, again following a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/67FAA6D7E18ACD49BFBE21FCD3332F?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer comment</a> from Actinopolyspora. According to the correction, “the image of a crystal violet plate of MDA-MB-231 cells was inadvertently duplicated from a previous manuscript,” but a “new set of experiments was performed to replace the duplicated crystal violet plate and generate a new quantification graph.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another <em>Cancers</em> article by McMasters and Gomez-Gutierrez has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C3F66E9F852BDCDBD32DFE3FE376E2?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer comments</a> regarding potential image manipulation. MDPI didn’t respond to our request for comment about any plans to investigate further.</p>

                <p>A Frontiers journal has taken down the abstract of a “provisionally accepted” article about harms from an herbal supplement after the company that sells the products sued the first author for defamation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The author of the paper, <a href="https://www.rajagirihospital.com/Doctor-Profile/Dr.-Cyriac-Abby-Philips">Cyriac Abby Philips</a>, a hepatologist at Rajagiri Hospital in Kerala, India, has over 266,000 followers on his X account “<a href="https://x.com/theliverdr">TheLiverDoc</a>.” In 2020, another of Philips’ papers about harm from supplements was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/22/after-legal-threats-from-herbalife-elsevier-journal-retracts-and-then-removes-a-paper/">retracted and removed</a> after the large supplement company Herbalife, whose products the paper impugned, put legal pressure on Elsevier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Himalaya Wellness, an herbal supplement company which says its products are based on Ayurvedic practices, last year sued Philips for defamation based on his posts on X about the company’s products.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129671"></span>



<p>X <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2023/Sep/29/x-account-of-hepatologist-the-liver-doc-suspended-after-himalaya-obtainsex-parte-injunction-2619366.html">suspended his account</a> following a court order that also barred Philips from speaking about Himalaya or its products. After Philips appealed the order and said he would hide the X posts at issue, a higher court ordered the social media platform to <a href="https://thewire.in/law/karnataka-hc-orders-suspended-the-liver-doc-x-account-to-be-restored-after-hiding-9-tweets">restore his account</a>, but the gag order remains in effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Himalaya filed its lawsuit, Philips had submitted a paper to <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em> describing cases of liver damage linked to one of Himalaya’s products, Liv.52. The journal accepted the article in January and posted it online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after, Philips received an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-3.pdf">email</a> from a research integrity staffer at Frontiers, who wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It has come to our attention that there are ongoing court proceedings involving you and the Himalaya Wellness Company. Alongside this, we have received information suggesting a potential undisclosed financial relationship.

<p>Philips <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-4.pdf">responded</a> that he had an advisory position with the pharmaceutical company Cipla Limited that lapsed in 2020, and had no other conflicts of interest to report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the legal proceedings, Philips wrote they were “irrelevant” to the publication:&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no active legal order from a Court of Law currently in place that precludes Frontiers Journal or the authors from publishing this scientifically accepted peer-reviewed manuscript since the currently ongoing legal proceedings are independent of this publication and the submission, peer-review and final acceptance of the manuscript is independent of current Court proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June, the Frontiers staffer <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-5.pdf">replied</a> the publisher had decided to “place the publication of the article on hold until the legal proceedings in India have been resolved.” The email continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>To explain, based on the information that we have received, we have been advised that publication of the article could already be covered by the current court order, or that the claimant will most likely take measures to this effect. Therefore, until the legal proceedings have been resolved, we will proceed to withdraw your article temporarily from the publication process.</p>



<p>Once the legal proceedings have been concluded, we would of course be happy to reexamine the position. Please kindly keep us informed once the situation has been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Philips and his co-authors subsequently received an automated <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-6.pdf">notification</a> from the <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em> editorial office that their manuscript had been “withdrawn” and “is no longer under consideration for publication in this journal.” The publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-10.pdf">refunded</a> the authors’ payment, and removed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240531063856/https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1276313/abstract">abstract</a> from its website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Frontiers confirmed that the journal had “temporarily withdrawn the article from the publication process pending the outcome of the legal proceedings currently taking place in India.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spokesperson continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We have explained this in writing to Dr Philips, who agreed with our decision. We have also informed Dr Philips that we are happy to reexamine this position once the legal proceedings are concluded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A representative from Himalaya told us “the matter is sub judice,” meaning <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/sub-judice">under consideration</a> in court and not supposed to be discussed publicly. “Based on a Court’s direction the paper was withdrawn.”</p>



<p>Philips was not available for comment. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arifhussaintheruvath/?originalSubdomain=in">Arif Hussain Theruvath</a>, a researcher at Rajagiri Hospital and an author on the paper, said Philips “is currently prohibited by Karnataka Civil Court&#8217;s injunction orders from speaking on Himalaya Wellness company or their products, especially Liv.52.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Theruvath, who provided documentation of Frontiers’ correspondence with the authors, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>There was no reason for Frontiers to hold publication or halt further proceedings on a scientifically accepted publication on [in response to] a “soft threat” based on misleading civil suit from the Ayurveda product manufacturer who had no right to extend the gag order towards scientific publications, rather than only Dr. Philips’ social media posts. …</p>



<p>This has been a disappointing decision from a scientific integrity and moral context for science, and medical scientists – that law and legal can be twisted in any manner to silence important scientific findings that have great impact on public health.</p>

<p>As <em>Retraction Watch</em> recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/12/how-a-widely-used-ranking-system-ended-up-with-three-fake-journals-in-its-top-10-philosophy-list/">reported</a>, three of the top 10 philosophy journals in the highly influential Scopus database turned out to be fakes: Not only did these dubious journals manage to infiltrate the list, but they also rose to its top by trading citations. This news is embarrassing in itself, but it is hardly shocking. Our rankings-obsessed academic culture has proven time and again that it is prone to data manipulation. Rankings for both publications and institutions are routinely hacked by scholars, editors, and administrators who are ready to tweak or even falsify numbers as needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problems with the Scopus journal rankings, however, run much deeper. The issue is not that inflated citation numbers have occasionally propelled impostor journals to the top of the list. Rather, at least in my own field of literary studies, the ranking makes no sense whatsoever: the list is full of journals that have no business being there at all because they belong to entirely different areas of scholarly enquiry, and even when the ranking gets the field right, it systematically places marginal publications close to the top. In what follows, I briefly break down the major ways the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=1208">Scopus Literature and Literary Theory</a> Ranking is not just skewed but downright nonsensical.</p>



<span id="more-129655"></span>



<p>Scopus ranks journals based on SJR (SCImago Journal Rank), which it defines as a “measure of journal’s impact, influence or prestige.” The ranking includes a little over 1,000 titles, but for the purposes of this analysis I have focused mostly on the top 100. My main finding: the majority of journals in the upper part of the list quite simply do not belong to the fields of literature and literary theory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The top 10 are particularly telling. Within that group is exactly one (!) journal – an annual publication dedicated to the work of the Spanish Golden Age dramatist Lope de Vega – that&nbsp; specializes in literature. Another two are wide-ranging humanities journals in which literary scholars do publish, although these also are highly idiosyncratic. The first is <em>South Atlantic Quarterly</em>, a long-standing journal dedicated to “urgent political, cultural, and social questions,” whose editorial board consists primarily of literary theorists, and the second is <em>Journal of Cultural Analytics</em>, a relatively new open-access publication “dedicated to the computational study of culture.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rest of the top 10 belong to translation studies (two), criminology (one), and writing studies (two); one is an interdisciplinary journal with a primary focus on sociology and gender studies, and one (<em>Poetics</em>) has been founded as a literary journal in the 1970s and continues to address issues related to literature (among other topics), but it does so from a distinctly sociological perspective. The editors are sociologists, who also make up the bulk of the contributors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short, Scopus’ list of top 10 literature journals includes one journal specializing in literature, two general humanities journals with some footing in literary studies, one journal that used to specialize in literature but no longer does, and six journals with absolutely no relation to literary studies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>RANK</td><td>JOURNAL TITLE&nbsp;</td><td>ACTUAL FIELD</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Translation Spaces</td><td>Translation Studies</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Criminology and Public Policy</td><td>Criminology</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Anuario Lope de Vega</td><td>Literature</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Journal of Writing Research</td><td>Writing studies</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Men and Masculinities</td><td>Sociology</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Perspectives: Studies in Translation Theory and Practice</td><td>Translation Studies</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Poetics</td><td>Sociology of Culture</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Writing Communication</td><td>Writing Studies</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>South Atlantic Quarterly</td><td>Interdisciplinary Humanities</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Journal of Cultural Analytics</td><td>Digital Humanities</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Table 1. Top 10 journals in the Scopus Literature and Literary Theory Ranking</p>



<p>The situation becomes only slightly better when we analyze the top 100. In that cohort the number of journals belonging to the fields of literature and literary theory rises to somewhere between 35 and 45, depending on how one counts. However, even with that improvement, well over half of the titles on the list&nbsp; do not belong there. They belong to a range of different fields, including primarily language and linguistics, but also education, library science, anthropology, history, theology, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What accounts for this failure of most basic classification? One might assume that the creators of the list have simply lumped literature and some adjacent fields together: Although it is deeply frustrating to scholars who share little in terms of publication venues, research methodologies, and departmental affiliations, the use of joint categories that encompass fields like literature, linguistics, and writing is not unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Scopus seems to be doing something different. The database has a separate category for <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=3310">Language and Linguistics</a>, and although&nbsp; some journals may publish in both fields&nbsp; (none of the remotely good ones do), many of those included in the Literature category are in fact <a href="https://benjamins.com/catalog/sic">pure linguistics journals</a>, full stop. Besides, even if overlapping classifications can account for some of these intruders, one cannot justify the presence of journals like <em>Performance Measurement and Metrics </em>or <em>Men and Masculinities </em>on the list.&nbsp; No methodological choice, however dubious, can explain this ranking. One has to assume that those who created it simply couldn’t be bothered to properly attend to the task at hand.</p>



<p>To make things worse, even when we remove the noise created by the inclusion of journals from other fields and focus only on actual literature journals, the ranking’s ability to identify quality publications does not seem to improve. A look at the top 100 journals reveals that publications with no discernable international footprint systematically outrank highly selective world-leading venues. To use just one startling example, Malaysian pay-to-play publication <em>3L: Language, Linguistics, Literature </em>(40th overall) far outranks almost every major literature journal published in the US and Europe, including such cutting-edge publications as <em>PMLA</em> (59th), <em>English Literary History</em> (110th), and <em>Diacritics </em>(415th).</p>



<p>Many other interesting quirks would require further scrutiny, such as the curious overrepresentation of journals published in Slovenian, a language with barely 2 million speakers, as well as the equally curious overrepresentation of journals focusing on the Spanish Golden Age, an important period in early modern literary history, but surely not one that could plausibly attract more high-quality scholarship than the entire fields of German and French literary studies, Comparative Literature, and Medieval Studies, all of which are completely absent from the top 100. And yet, here we are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Scopus ranking under the rubric of “Literature and Literary Theory” is many things but a meaningful ranking of journals in the field of literary studies, it is not. It contains scores of journals that have absolutely nothing to do with that particular field, and it routinely awards very high rankings to publications with no international relevance whatsoever. On what criteria, it is impossible to say. Unsurprisingly, most of the publications that are ranked highly in Scopus are not good enough to be included in Clarivate’s much more selective Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index. Some have made it into the less selective Emerging Sources Citation Index, but most are not picked up by Web of Science at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wish I could offer some more constructive criticism, but such criticism would imply that the Scopus ranking, such as it is, has some redeeming features, which it does not.&nbsp; How do you improve a list that ranks <em>Criminology and Public Policy</em> as one of the top literature journals? That would be like taking seriously a list that treats <em>Shakespeare Quarterly</em> as a top journal in the field of chemical engineering. It would probably be easier to just start from scratch.</p>



<p>Of course, the biggest problem with Scopus is that, despite its profound unseriousness (at least in my field), it is generally taken seriously and produces real-world consequences.&nbsp; A tenure case at a major US research university is unlikely to hinge on a journal’s standing in Scopus, but in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries, administrators routinely rely on Scopus rankings as a proxy measure of research quality. And yet, in its existing form the ranking is not only an utterly inadequate tool for achieving that goal but may well be counterproductive given the sheer number of marginal journals on which it confers the veneer of respectability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know what the situation in the sciences is, but in the humanities, Scopus must get its act together. Until then, its rankings will not be a serious indicator of journal quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the winners of the 2024 Kavli Prize in nanoscience has threatened to sue a longtime critic, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a cease and desist letter, a lawyer representing <a href="https://mirkin-group.northwestern.edu/people/chad-mirkin/">Chad Mirkin</a>, a chemist and director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology at Northwestern University in Chicago, accused Raphaël Lévy, a professor of physics at the Université Paris Sorbonne Nord, of making “patently false and defamatory” statements about Mirkin’s research.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cease-and-Desist-to-R.-Levy-5_15_20241348054-clean.pdf">demand</a> primarily concerns a letter to the editor Lévy submitted in April to <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> regarding an article Mirkin co-authored, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2306973121">Multimodal neuro-nanotechnology: Challenging the existing paradigm in glioblastoma therapy</a>,” which appeared in the journal in February. </p>



<span id="more-129661"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lévy and Mirkin, who was awarded one quarter of this year’s <a href="https://www.kavliprize.org/prizes/nanoscience/2024">Kavli Prize in nanoscience</a> for his work on spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), have a <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c73ed8f96a00c023285fb7">long history</a>. In 2018, they <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/rna-detection-tool-debate-flares-up-at-acs-meeting--64756">clashed at a meeting</a> of the American Chemical Society, where Mirkin called Lévy a “scientific terrorist.” Lévy has begun an <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7993122">effort to replicate</a> one of Mirkin’s significant papers as part of the <a href="https://nanobubbles.hypotheses.org/">NanoBubbles project</a>, which “focuses on how, when and why science fails to correct itself,” according to its website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Lévy’s <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12746734">letter to <em>PNAS</em></a>, which the journal declined to publish, he wrote Mirkin’s article’s “presentation of SNAs as a ‘powerful class of nanotherapeutics’ is misleading.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>PNAS</em> article had mentioned a clinical trial of an experimental cancer drug from <a href="https://invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/startups/exicure.html">Exicure</a>, a company Mirkin <a href="https://www.invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/invo-spotlights/featured-innovators/chad-mirkin.html">co-founded in 2011</a> to develop SNAs for diagnosing and treating disease, claiming the treatment showed a “33% overall response rate at the highest dosage,” Lévy wrote. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>No reference is provided but the figure appears to come from an interim report presented by the company (press release and presentation at a conference (<a href="https://jitc.bmj.com/content/8/Suppl_3/A257.2">10</a>)). The 33% are in fact 2 patients from a sub-group of 6 patients.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03684785">clinical trial</a> was stopped for administrative reasons, Lévy noted. Exicure <a href="https://investors.exicuretx.com/news/news-details/2021/Exicure-Inc.-Announces-Results-of-Internal-Investigation-and-Implementation-of-Strategic-Measures-to-Reduce-Cash-Burn-and-Prioritize-Pipeline-Focus/default.aspx">announced</a> in late 2021 it would wind down the trial. At the same time, the company disclosed the results of an internal investigation that found Grant Corbett, the former leader of its neuroscience group, had “misreported” preclinical efficacy data about another experimental drug in public presentations and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to its most recent disclosure, Exicure “has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company” but is now “exploring strategic alternatives” after restructuring and suspending its clinical and development work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lévy’s letter concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Public and private funders of scientific research in academia and start-up companies have to make choices about which biomedical technologies or innovative therapies they sponsor. The scientific literature plays a critical role in informing those decisions and must therefore be balanced and accurate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">One month after Lévy submitted his letter to <em>PNAS</em>, he received an email from Mirkin, seen by Retraction Watch, accusing him of making “factually false and damaging” statements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You will be hearing from my lawyer next week regarding the defamation and the serious legal consequences for it,” Mirkin wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cease and desist letter followed on May 15. Lévy’s communications with <em>PNAS</em>, “falsely disparage [Mirkin] and charge him with having a lack of integrity in his profession as a research scientist,” Mirkin’s lawyer wrote. The letter continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are putting you on notice that in the event you do not retract the false statements made to PNAS and cease to disseminate further false statements of and concerning Dr. Mirkin to any third parties or the public generally, Dr. Mirkin will take all appropriate action to obtain relief against you for resulting injuries to his good name and reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the “patently false and defamatory” statement the letter attributes to Lévy does not appear in his letter in <em>PNAS</em>, and he said he did not write those words. Here’s the quotation from the cease and desist letter:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The published article [authored by Mirkin and others] includes uncited data that is misleading due to its small number of participants and the fact that the clinical trial (NCT03684785) was discontinued due of (sic.) a fraud case which found Mirkin’s previous company (Exicure) liable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Mirkin nor his lawyer, Phillip J. Zisook of the Chicago firm Schoenberg Finkel Beederman Bell Glazer, has responded to our queries about the source of the quotation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The letter also accuses Lévy of wanting “to cause injury to Mirkin’s professional reputation through fabricating and disseminating false statements.” Zisook wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Because your false statements disparage Dr. Mirkin in his professional capacity as a research scientist, they will be found to support actions for defamation per se and false light invasion of privacy in a lawsuit against you.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter is “quite astonishing,” Lévy said, containing false assertions and posing “an extremely serious attack on my academic freedom and on academic freedom in general.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zisook’s letter mentions a research misconduct investigation into Lévy at the University of Liverpool, where he worked until 2020, when he left voluntarily for his current position. The investigation – into allegations Lévy downloaded papers from Sci-Hub and harassed other scientists – was closed after the initial assessment for “insufficient grounds to pursue the complaint,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likewise, the letter alludes to complaints against Lévy at his current institution. These were retaliatory complaints after he reported a case of scientific misconduct, Lévy said. We’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/31/journal-pulls-papers-by-embattled-scientist-at-national-research-center-in-france/">covered that case</a>, which has resulted in three retractions so far. The investigations against Lévy have concluded without charges, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the letter, Lévy sent Zisook and Mirkin a copy of his submission to <em>PNAS</em> and asked them to withdraw the cease and desist demand, as the quoted sentences “were very different from what I wrote.” It’s unclear where the passage came from. He also wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>​​In my opinion, the correct way to determine whether this letter should be published or not by PNAS is through editorial evaluation including eventually peer review. Most people would certainly agree that legal threats should not interfere with that process…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zisook refused to withdraw the cease and desist demand. He wrote:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It was not just premised upon a particular statement in the article you recently forwarded to me but rather a persistent campaign to selectively use information and misrepresentations to actively defame Dr. Mirkin, including your recent communications with PNAS which clearly left them with the false impressions described in our Cease and Desist Letter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>PNAS</em> rejected Lévy’s letter on June 17. A representative for the journal declined to comment on the decision, “due to the confidential nature of the peer review process.”</p>

<p>A paper finding kids did worse in school following the Flint water crisis is “severely flawed and unreliable,” according to critics who were deeply involved in exposing the crisis.</p>



<p>The paper has now earned an addendum from the authors, but the critics say it should be retracted.</p>



<p>The authors of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4737">article</a> investigated whether the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know">water crisis</a> in Flint – a period when the drinking water in the Michigan city was contaminated with lead – affected the academic capability of children living there. The authors concluded children in Flint did worse in math after the crisis and more needed special education than before the episode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article was published in <em>Science Advances </em>in March and referenced by major news outlets like<em> </em><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/flint-michigan-water-crisis-ten-years-after"><em>ProPublica</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/03/13/flint-children-school-academic-setbacks/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</p>



<span id="more-129627"></span>



<p>Soon after, <a href="https://envsci.rutgers.edu/profiles/Siddhartha_Roy.html">Siddhartha Roy</a>, an assistant professor of environmental science at Rutgers University in New Jersey, and his colleagues sent an email to Holden Thorp, editor in chief of the <em>Science </em>family of journals, expressing <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EA620BE7EDEB55DF0B1581368C2747">concerns about the analysis</a>. In particular, they noted a “confounding” change in the state testing standards at the time of the crisis in Flint that the authors did not account for in their paper. Roy and his colleagues also wrote that the article did not properly acknowledge previous research, and may have lacked the necessary ethical approval. </p>



<p>The article “reinforces false narratives about the nature of the lead exposure and cause(s) of changing educational performance,” they said in the email seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roy and <a href="https://www.webapps.cee.vt.edu/index.php?category=people&amp;pagetype=bio&amp;do=getprofile&amp;user=edwards.html">Marc Edwards</a>, a distinguished professor of environmental engineering at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/19/after-we-tried-to-correct-claims-about-deadly-water-filters-in-flint-we-were-accused-of-scientific-misconduct-and-that-was-just-the-beginning/">helped expose the water crisis</a> by collecting citywide data with residents that showed elevated lead in water and federal Safe Drinking Water Act violations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edwards and Roy’s group advised the editorial team to launch an investigation based on their concerns. “[I]f found to be legitimate,” they wrote, “we ask that the article be retracted. At a minimum, an expression of concern should be appended immediately while an investigation is underway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, Laura Remis, an editor at <em>Science Advances,</em> said the journal had asked the authors to respond to the concerns and requested they submit an addendum to their article with annotated data source and code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the email seen by Retraction Watch, Remis said the authors’ response was sufficient and “we stand behind the conclusions of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to claims the paper was unreliable, the authors wrote they “dispute this in the strongest possible terms.”</p>



<p>The study’s analysis of math and reading achievement was “invalid” as it compared different years of Michigan state testing when the standards changed significantly, Roy’s team said. The state’s department of education noted that the tests introduced in 2015 are “very different” and should not be compared to the prior 2014 standard. In response, the authors said their analysis compares only relative performance on tests and does not rely on raw comparisons of different years of data.</p>



<p>In contrast to other peer-reviewed articles, this study also “fails to contextualize actual blood lead levels in Flint children,” Roy’s team said – an omission which ​​creates an impression that the primary adverse health effect from the crisis was lead exposure, which the data in the article doesn’t support. Remis’email said the <em>Science</em> editor did not find merit in this point, so did not ask the authors to respond to this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, the article “selectively cites and misrepresents evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes” during this crisis, Roy’s team said. The authors said they believe this concern comes from “a misinterpretation of the text.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While we trust this research project must have required [institutional review board] IRB clearance,” Roy’s team said&nbsp; “the specific IRB approval code and authorization agency are not mentioned anywhere in the article or supplementary information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the authors said: “The University of Michigan IRB determined that our study used only deidentified data that could be [sic] linked to specific individuals and was therefore not regulated by the IRB. All personally-identifiable information was handled and access [sic] by Michigan Department of Education and the Center for Educational Performance and Information.&#8221;</p>



<p>Edwards said they would like to request the raw data from the Michigan Department of Education to redo the analysis themselves, but the cost is prohibitive:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We’ve already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars exposing the [water crisis], and have now years of our lives and hundreds of thousands more, debunking crap science papers about the crisis, so we are doing a cost benefit analysis as to whether it is worth spending another $6000 to possibly correct yet another result that is possibly false. The reality is that because it was already been trumpeted in the media, and many powerful people do not want to see it refuted, even if we exposed the result as crap (and the authors admitted it), it would have little effect to correct the record or perception.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://sociology.princeton.edu/people/sam-trejo">Sam Trejo</a>, an assistant professor of sociology at Princeton University, in New Jersey, and lead author of the paper, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our authorship team took Roy’s concerns seriously, and we appreciated the opportunity for engagement with our research. Ultimately, we concluded that the points they raised did not threaten any of the paper&#8217;s findings. Our team provided Science Advances with a detailed response to Roy&#8217;s concerns, and the journal was satisfied with our response. More specifically, the Science Advances editorial staff did not believe it was necessary or appropriate for us to issue a correction or erratum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This month, the authors issued the addendum – published as an “eLetter” at the very bottom of the article page – explaining their analysis of Michigan’s test scores as well as including a “replication package” to allow others to reproduce their analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The addendum “is a way of just blowing off our legitimate criticism, allowing the authors to have the last word, without ever giving us the first word, or airing dirty laundry,” Edwards told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am surprised that they are calling it an ‘Addendum’ and not an ‘Erratum’ or even a ‘Correction,’” Roy said. “While I am glad the authors were forced to acknowledge that a statewide test change occurred and coincided with the water switch in Flint, they severely downplay its implications.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edwards said he finds the larger context of this paper fascinating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Research that claims to find something horrible in Flint, seems to get published easily, and is picked up and amplified in the media. Whereas papers that point out problems with those analysis, or shows that the narrative is exaggerated, or might even be harming the people it claims to try and help, has a hard time getting published. The best example of that, is [Roy’s] paper, questioning whether we should continue lying to Flint children, and telling them they were brain damaged by an unprecedented harmful lead exposure event, when all the data shows it never happened. They never stop to think, that the harm of this false story (via a nocebo effect), might overweigh the alleged benefits, for the very people they claim to be helping.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After months of prepping and weeks of stressing (and also a late-night panic session reviewing the presentation in a hotel lobby), it is safe to say that a lot of time, effort and passion was poured into this project, which made a huge impact across the event, opening up the discussions on a path to equity in neuroscience!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hosting our first in-person workshop was a large, and important, step forward for WiNUK.

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Our workshop addressed the gender disparities prevalent in dementia research through statistics, advice sharing and interactive audience Q&amp;A. Firstly, drawing from a global survey, conducted in collaboration with the International Society to Advance Alzheimer’s Research and Treatment (ISTAART), Lizzie led the session by shedding light on the systemic challenges faced by women, particularly in senior positions. Shockingly, 80% of women in roles above the postdoctoral level reported experiencing sexism, with less than 25% of women across career stages finding institutional support helpful. These statistics underscored the urgency of addressing gender biases and sexism in scientific academia. This aspect of our session aimed to validate the experiences of female researchers in the audience and help raise awareness about these pervasive issues.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The second half of our session was dedicated to an interactive Q&amp;A, with a fantastic panel of women in dementia research -  Professor Fiona Ducotterd, Professor Afia B Ali and Dr Kamar Ameen-Ali - who provided invaluable insights into the nuanced manifestations of gender bias.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>

<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_384bc6087ea149f5b778adf237686b03~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dr Ameen-Ali poignantly remarked, &quot;Gender bias isn’t as explicit as it used to be; it’s a lot more implicit now, which makes it harder to talk about and easier for people to invalidate.&quot; This observation highlighted the subtler forms of discrimination that persist in professional settings; these may be no less harmful, but are in many ways harder to tackle. This part of the session aimed to help audience members to further recognise these issues, some for the first time.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Stemming from an audience question regarding how to deal with “mansplaining”, Professor Fiona Ducotterd emphasised the importance of individual internal strength and agency in navigating these dynamics. She shared her empowering opinion on dealing with difficult situations by initially assuming good intent. How people communicate does vary and things don’t always start with a bad intention, but managing your response is beneficial for coping, regardless of the intent.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Lastly, we tackled well-documented, traditional stereotypes imposed predominantly on women in the professional world; from being labelled &quot;too strong” or “outspoken&quot; for having an opinion, to being deemed &quot;too ambitious” or “too naïve&quot; for taking risks and leading with authority. These stereotypes reflect an outdated rulebook for women that we are more than happy to discard. At WiNUK, we celebrate the uniqueness of every individual and encourage you all to embrace your strengths to reach your ambitions.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Our workshop not only highlighted the challenges faced by women in dementia research, but also provided actionable advice towards success in the current climate. These discussions touched on the importance of personal resilience, mentoring programs, and advocating for transparent promotion criteria. We also covered strategies for creating more inclusive workplaces to support women and other minoritised identities, including regular training on diversity and inclusion and accessible reporting mechanisms for bias and discrimination. Despite addressing these difficult issues, we aimed to maintain a balanced tone by focusing on positive and actionable points for improvement, inspiring attendees to take proactive steps in their careers and workplaces.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In addition to managing the workshop, our co-founder, Lizzie, had her hands full with presenting her scientific poster, overseeing the exhibition stand, and networking with fellow organisations. However, with the amazing support from the WiNUK volunteer team, we managed to pull it off!</span></span></p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Ever wondered how computer science and neuroscience might fit hand in hand? With our AI, Tech and Computation event coming up next week, Swati Rajwal describes her journey, as a computer scientist, into the world of neuroscience and how her skillset has been instrumental in advancing a huge range of projects!</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have always been intrigued by the complexities of the human brain and the technological intricacies of computer science. The intersection of these two fields is where I found my passion and it led me to a wonderful role as a Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge&apos;s Engineering Department. Here, I&apos;d like to share how my background in computer science has been instrumental in advancing my work in neuroscience.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Background &amp; Career Path</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My earliest memory of using a computer dates back to visiting my dad&apos;s office as a 9-year-old and using the Windows Paint app to draw houses. Amazed by the capabilities of a computer to execute my commands, I knew this would grow to become my career of interest. And so, after finishing my bachelor’s in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, I started working as a Software Engineer. A few years later, I took my interest further by pursuing a Masters in Computer Science. During my Masters, I realised the ubiquitous nature of my skills as a computer scientist through various academic endeavours such as an R&amp;D internship at Accenture, a collaboration with Mayo Clinic practitioners (</span></span><u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10283091/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">paper</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">), a research project at Saïd Business School and many others. I might not have the subject knowledge (e.g., medicine), but give me a dataset large enough and a machine on which to run it, and I shall move the world (rephrasing Archimedes here)!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>Academic Journey at Cambridge</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After my Masters, I joined Cambridge University and started with a project investigating statistical learning in chronic back pain and endogenous pain regulation. The role demanded not only a deep understanding of neuroscience, but also strong computational skills. Leveraging my experience in computer science, and with a team consisting of a neuroscience expert and other members, we were able to design and execute a </span></span><u><a href="https://www.psychopy.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">PsychoPy</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> task </span></span><u><a href=" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027006005772?via%3Dihub" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">(article)</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, published on </span></span><u><a href="https://pavlovia.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Pavlovia</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> platform, as an open source software that efficiently recorded pain and clinical data. Although there is an intuitive builder interface (drag-and-drop based) to create tasks, one needs to have knowledge of Python and Javascript programming languages, along with Git-based software version control to incorporate features and debug any issues.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Another core aspect of my research involved processing large sets of data using Python and RSTAN (a software package for statistical modeling), based on (for instance) </span></span><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">multi-armed bandit algorithm</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. This kind of data analysis is fundamental in neuroscience research, where understanding patterns and anomalies could lead to breakthroughs in understanding, for instance, pain mechanisms. A significant part of my role was contributing to a grant application for the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The application was successful, awarding our team substantial computational resources: 1,216,800 CPU (Central Processing Unit) hours and 1,000 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) hours. CPUs and GPUs are essential for processing large amounts of data quickly, with GPUs providing additional power for tasks involving graphics and simulations. This substantial grant enhanced our lab&apos;s capacity to conduct complex simulations and data analyses, accelerating our research and enabling more ambitious projects. This achievement was not just a testament to the quality of our proposed research but also highlighted the critical role of computational expertise in justifying the requirement of securing resources for scientific experiments.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The skills I gained throughout these years in computer science—data analysis, algorithm design, and system integration—proved to be incredibly valuable in my research at Cambridge. They enabled me to contribute effectively to my team&apos;s research goals, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Moreover, these skills facilitated collaboration with other scientists and helped in articulating complex ideas more comprehensively during team meetings and in drafting research manuscripts. This synthesis of computer science and neuroscience is not just about enhancing research capabilities; it&apos;s also about improving patient outcomes. The models and systems I have worked on at Cambridge are geared towards understanding, and eventually mitigating, pain—a goal that stands to significantly improve the quality of life for patients suffering from chronic conditions.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>What&apos;s Next?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">To all the women in neuroscience, contemplating a similar integration of skills, I encourage you to embrace the possibilities that such interdisciplinary knowledge can bring. The fusion of computer science and neuroscience is a vivid example of how diverse skills can lead to greater innovation and impactful outcomes in science.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This narrative not only reflects my professional journey, but also demonstrates the profound impact that expertise in a seemingly unrelated field can have on another. As I advance in my academic career, my goal would be to enhance my computational skills further and leverage them to build open-source software that promotes equitable healthcare, in collaboration with domain experts. It is a call to all aspiring scientists to look beyond traditional boundaries and explore how their unique skills can contribute to broader scientific advancements.</span></span></p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="212" height="300" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3-212x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129606" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3-212x300.png 212w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>A journal has retracted a letter to the editor and removed the online version from its website “because legal concerns were raised to the Publisher,” according to the notice. The retracted letter had referred to multiple journals as “predatory.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted letter, “A threat to scientific integrity,” appeared in the <em>British Dental Journal </em>in August 2023. The author, <a href="https://dentistry.ed.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/niall-mcguinness">Niall McGuinness</a>, director of the MClinDent / DClinDent programme in orthodontics at the Edinburgh Dental Institute, criticized a May 2023 opinion article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-5848-z">What does the Dentists Act say about orthodontic treatment choice?</a>” for the articles it cited.</p>



<p>In particular, McGuinness called out citations to publications in journals “of questionable probity in regard to publication ethics &#8211; &#8216;predatory&#8217; journals as defined by Jeffrey Beall, of the University of Colorado,” according to an archived version seen by Retraction Watch. He listed four journals cited in the article, including one from the publisher Frontiers and another from MDPI, which appeared on Beall’s list.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129603"></span>



<p>A representative from Frontiers told us they had no correspondence with BDJ or Springer Nature regarding this letter. An MDPI representative said the same.</p>



<p><a href="https://orthotropics.com/dr-michael-j-trenouth-bsc-bds-mds-phd/dr-michael-trenouth/">Michael Trenouth</a>, a retired orthodontist and corresponding author of the original opinion article, didn’t respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The letter was up until at least October 2023, and was cited in “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-6396-2">Identifying Predatory Journals</a>” another letter to the editor published in <em>BDJ</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometime later, McGuinness’ letter was removed from the website and overwritten with the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-6165-2">retraction notice</a>, which isn’t dated. According to <a href="https://publicationethics.org/sites/default/files/retraction-guidelines-cope.pdf">retraction guidelines</a> from the Committee on Publication Ethics, an article should be removed from online publication in “extremely limited cases” if it’s “clearly defamatory, violates personal privacy, is the subject of a court order, or might pose a serious health risk to the general public.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides mentioning the “legal concerns” that led to the paper’s retraction, the notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The <em>British Dental Journal</em> takes no position with respect to the contents of this letter and this retraction is in agreement with the author of this letter.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McGuinness declined our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, a representative from Springer, which publishes the journal, said: “We took the concerns raised very seriously and, with the agreement of the author, concluded that retraction and removal of the letter from the journal website was the most appropriate and responsible action to take.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Labeling publishers as “predatory” often gets pushback. In 2021, a Frontiers<em> </em>editor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/07/authors-object-after-springer-nature-journal-cedes-to-publisher-frontiers-demand-for-retraction/">objected to</a> a <em>Scientometrics</em> study naming the publisher’s journals as predatory, and the paper was retracted. That year, an article in <em>Research Evaluation</em><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/08/article-that-assessed-mdpi-journals-as-predatory-retracted-and-replaced/">calling MDPI journals</a> predatory was retracted and replaced with a less critical version, saying its analysis instead “suggest[s] they may be predatory journals.”</p>
