              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2024/09/13/attention-arxiv-users-arxiv-mirrors-to-shut-down-september-15th-2024/">Attention arXiv users: arXiv mirrors to shut down September 15th, 2024</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is time to say goodbye . . . to the arXiv mirrors. After many years of service, all remaining arXiv mirrors will be officially shut down after Sunday, September 15, 2024.</p>
<p>The arXiv mirrors were originally created in an attempt to provide better local access to the arXiv corpus. In the early days of both arXiv and the internet, local mirrors were the best way to facilitate speed for arXiv users across the globe. arXiv’s mirror network expanded in the late 1990&#8217;s as arXiv grew, and for decades they were heavily used and provided faithful backups and replicas of arXiv’s scientific corpus.</p>
<p>As the modern internet has improved and arXiv has updated to a fully cloud-centric architecture for our services, geographic locality is no longer the determining factor it once was for speed of use for international arXiv users. Now, most users close to arXiv mirrors have better access to the main arxiv.org site than to the “nearby” mirror. Because of this, over time the utility and utilization of the arXiv mirrors has dwindled significantly (many down to near zero). While, until now, arXiv has continued to provide replication services to all mirrors, in the last few years, most of these read-only mirrors have shut down on their own or stopped accepting updates.</p>
<p>The arXiv mirror network served a role &#8211; acting as a backup for the corpus, allowing some degree of load distribution, and providing improved access for users who were geographically closer to a mirror &#8211; that is no longer necessary. arXiv now has multiple backups for the arXiv corpus in place, and the Fastly CDN (Content Delivery Network) that we use to deliver content provides excellent service throughout the world.</p>
<p>The arXiv mirrors took significant effort of both arXiv staff and hosting volunteer institutions to maintain, implement and update, and we are thankful for the volunteers across the world who gave their time, expertise, and effort over the years to maintain them and help arXiv reach users globally.</p>
<p>arXiv shutting down replication services for all mirror sites will not affect arXiv users. If you have questions about this, or other arXiv updates, we welcome your comments below.</p>

<p>A Nobel prize-winning genetics researcher has retracted two more papers, bringing his total to 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/gregg-semenza">Gregg Semenza</a>, a professor of genetic medicine and director of the vascular program at Johns Hopkins’ Institute for Cell Engineering in Baltimore, shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2019/semenza/facts/">2019 Nobel prize</a> in physiology or medicine for “discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis and others began using PubPeer to point out potential duplicated or manipulated images in Semenza’s work in 2019, the researcher has retracted 12 papers. A previous retraction from 2011 for a paper co-authored with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Naoki+Mori">Naoki Mori</a> – who with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dNaoki%2bMori">31 retractions</a> sits at No. 25 on our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> – brings the total to 13.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130011"></span>



<p>The authors requested the latest pair of retractions, published September 4 in <em>Cancer Research</em>, according to the notices, which also mention “an institutional review by Johns Hopkins University.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the papers, “<a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/76/15/4430/613824/RETRACTED-PHGDH-Expression-Is-Required-for">PHGDH Expression Is Required for Mitochondrial Redox Homeostasis, Breast Cancer Stem Cell Maintenance, and Lung Metastasis</a>,” was originally published in 2016 and has been cited 190 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>In October 2020, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C6C2A32E8F6AE46E41F6E2CB466A9B#1">commented</a> that images labeled as representing tissue from two different mice looked “much more similar than expected.” The authors <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/82/6/1153/682056/Correction-PHGDH-Expression-Is-Required-for">corrected</a> the figure in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/84/17/2926/747053/Retraction-PHGDH-Expression-Is-Required-for">notice</a> stated Johns Hopkins’ review determined the two images “had contiguous features, suggesting the images may be from the same mouse,” and “certain raw data” labeled to be from two different mice might also be from the same mouse. “The authors do not have confidence in the integrity of the data,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other recently retracted paper, “<a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/73/11/3285/583992/RETRACTED-Collagen-Prolyl-Hydroxylases-Are">Collagen Prolyl Hydroxylases Are Essential for Breast Cancer Metastasis</a>,” originally published in 2013, has been cited nearly 240 times. . PubPeer comments pointing out potential image duplications, including from <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7877BD3C9973FEC253CE543819DE20#2">Elisabeth Bik</a>, began appearing in October 2020. The Hopkins review found some of the Western blot lanes were duplicated, as flagged on PubPeer.</p>



<p>“The authors apologize to the scientific community and deeply regret any inconveniences or challenges resulting from the publication and subsequent retraction of this article,” the <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/84/17/2927/747054/Retraction-Collagen-Prolyl-Hydroxylases-Are">notice</a> stated.</p>



<p>Semenza has not responded to our request for comment, nor has Johns Hopkins. [See update at end.] Christine A. Iacobuzio-Donahue, editor in chief of <em>Cancer Research</em>, has not responded either.   </p>



<p>Other <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/16/lasker-award-recipient-has-posted-retractions-a-sign-of-strength/">Nobel prize-winners have retracted papers</a> – Frances Arnold did so <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/01/02/nobel-winner-retracts-paper-from-science/">quite publicly</a> in 2020 – but Semenza’s 13 retractions are the most among scientists who have garnered that recognition, as far as we’re aware.</p>



<p>Update, 1800 UTC: Johns Hopkins sent us this statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Johns Hopkins maintains the highest standards for accuracy and integrity in research. We have strict protocols and processes in place to evaluate any allegations of research impropriety and to determine an appropriate path forward, if necessary.

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="333" height="333" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-129915" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius.jpeg 333w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rene-aquarius-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">René Aquarius</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Last March, René Aquarius noticed some overlapping patterns in a figure about a 2016 study on the blood-brain barrier. So he took to PubPeer, an online site where scientists often discuss papers, to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8A0A30197C521C60F66C30EE04ED28#3">raise his concerns</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An author of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394016302233">&nbsp;study published in <em>Neuroscience Letters</em></a> responded saying they are checking the original data to figure out the problem. A month later, when Aquarius, a postdoctoral researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, Netherlands, revisited the paper, the figure had been replaced without any note that the publisher had fixed the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aquarius once again took to PubPeer to express his concerns. “I don’t see any notification when looking at the landing site for the paper: no erratum, corrigendum or a simple log-entry that something has been changed,” he wrote, noting that he had informed Elsevier, the journal’s publisher about the issue. In July, the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394024002131">issued a corrigendum</a> for the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was quite a bit upset about it,” Aquarius told <em>Retraction Watch</em>. “It takes away one of the key elements for any reader to be critical, namely that you know what has happened.”</p>



<span id="more-130008"></span>



<p>What Aquarius uncovered wasn’t an isolated case. He and his fellow research-integrity sleuths, who police various issues in scholarly literature alongside their day jobs, found 130 more cases of what they dub stealth corrections, where journals fix papers without acknowledging that they have done so. They outline their findings in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06852">paper published</a> as a preprint on arXiv on September 10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The fact that they are interested in correcting the record is commendable but the way in which it’s being done is clearly suboptimal and suggests in some cases it’s self serving rather than serving science as a whole,” said Tom Heyman, a statistics and methodology researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aquarius and colleagues found the cases of stealth corrections by revisiting papers flagged on PubPeer and via social media accounts of sleuths. Aquarius said&nbsp; the scale of the problem is unclear.&nbsp; One would need to have access to different versions of papers before and after changes are made to spot any tweaks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the 131 papers in the study sample, 76 were published by the <em>Journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology. </em>None has an associated digital object identifier but all have PubMed IDs. We reached out to the journal and its publisher, <a href="https://bakisproductions.com/">Bakis Productions</a>, for comment but have not heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At MDPI, we broadly agree with the overall sentiment of the article,” a spokesperson for the publisher said. “To this end, we have fully updated our <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark30">correction process</a> to increase the overall transparency of our post-publication updates, using ‘minor correction’ as a way of publicly announcing non-scientific changes to a manuscript.”</p>



<p>But removing articles published in a special issue from the digital special issue website shouldn’t be considered a stealth correction as the paper suggests, the MDPI spokesperson added in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MDPI-statement.pdf">statement provided to Retraction Watch</a>. “[W]e are very transparent [about] our process, and as this change does not impact the scientific record, we do not accept that a public correction notice is required.”</p>



<p>“Articles that have been published shall remain extant, exact and unaltered as far as is possible. However, circumstances may arise where an article needs to be corrected, retracted or even removed,” a spokesperson for Elsevier added. “We do not correct articles without a formal notice and <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/article-withdrawal">our policy</a> outlines this. We will investigate the journal papers that have been brought to our attention.”</p>



<p>Although Aquarius and his team are pleased journals are fixing problems, they argue doing so silently is not the right solution. “You’re never sure who might have read the paper in the meantime and is not aware of the problem that was there and has been addressed,” Aquarius said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue journals have been silently fixing are fingerprints left by generative AI tools like ChatGPT when they are used to write manuscripts, said study co-author Guillaume Cabanac, a computer scientist at the University of Toulouse in France. Cabanac has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02134-0">developed a tool</a> that finds mentions of odd turns of phrases that are indicative of fabricated research papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We would like the authors to be accountable,” Cabanac said. “If they use any technology and don’t disclose it, that’s a problem,” he added. Journals should be asking authors to what extent they used ChatGPT and if they checked the tools’ outputs, Cabanac says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other corrections being fixed quietly include paper titles, authors names, ethical disclosures, images, abstracts, affiliations, among others, Cabanac said. For him, one way to implement what he calls “enforced transparency” might be in the form of blockchain technology. “You cannot cook the books with the blockchain technology,” he said. “Once the information is stored, you cannot alter it without the public knowing about it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julia Rohrer, a psychologist at Leipzig University in Germany who wasn’t involved with the study, called stealth corrections “very troubling.” Rohrer, who previously ran the <a href="https://undark.org/2018/07/02/loss-of-confidence-project-replication-crisis/">Loss of Confidence project</a> — which provided a platform for scientists to document instances when they lose faith in their previous findings — said removing figures, authors, and markers of ChatGPT use is particularly concerning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It feels like we’re not at the level of transparency that we should be as a science as a whole,” Heyman, who co-authored a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200834">2020 study on correction notices issued by psychology journals</a>, added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heyman notes that different types of issues are being corrected publicly and stealthily. For instance, the new study found that many stealth corrections are of the content of papers while Heyman’s 2020 study on publicly issued corrections identified changes in metadata such as information about funders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you look at the content changes that were stealthily corrected, they seem often to involve really impactful changes,” Heyman said. “Whereas, if you look at the public correction notices, they regularly mention that there were changes but they were minor [and] they didn’t affect the conclusions.”</p>



<p>In some cases, corrections may be framed as making minor changes, Heyman said, but they may affect the conclusions. “So you also have a lack of transparency at that level,” he said. “Yes, there the correction is public but then the way the correction is being described is maybe not as transparent as it could have been.”</p>



<p>Journals don’t typically ask peer reviewers to assess corrections, corrigenda and errata, but doing so might make it harder for authors to falsely claim tweaks don’t affect the study’s conclusions, Heyman said. In addition to software companies <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/06/12/want-to-check-for-retractions-in-your-personal-library-and-get-alerts-for-free-now-you-can/">sending researchers notifications when they cite retracted papers</a>, Rohrer said similar alerts should also exist for lengthy corrections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for corrections that are more benign, Rohrer said she is fine with those being corrected stealthily. Recently, Rohrer herself was involved with a stealth correction in one of her papers where she forgot to include her middle initial, which, she noted, raises particular problems in citation management software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think it’s perfectly fine for these instances,” Rohrer said. “Given that people’s attention is a limited resource, I think what we additionally need besides transparently tracking all changes and a complete version history, is some clear guidelines for what needs to be flagged and what does not.”</p>

<p>A professor of biomedical engineering at the Pennsylvania State University today lost a government-funded study in <em>Science Advances</em>, marking her second retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, <a href="https://www.bme.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=dfk5267">Deborah Kelly</a>, is also facing retraction of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959440X22001051?via%3Dihub">a paper</a> in <em>Current Opinion in Structural Biology</em> after a review undertaken by her institution found “serious data integrity concerns” in the work, according to emails obtained by Retraction Watch. Kelly has hired a lawyer to fight the retraction, apparently without success. (Update on Sept. 12: The paper has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2022.102426">now been retracted</a>.)</p>



<p>Today’s <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads9451">retraction</a> of “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1701386">Structural analysis of BRCA1 reveals modification hotspot</a>” cites “unresolved concerns in the integrity of the data presented,” including what appears to be alterations of <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/research/slac-science-explained/cryo-em">cryogenic electron microscopy</a> (cryo-EM) maps using an “eraser tool.” The study was funded in part through <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cAHjJvpF0kW0nyfcmWKFHA/project-details/8984664">a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant</a> for&nbsp;US$353,386 to Kelly.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dr.-Deborah-Kelly-Statement9413593.1.pdf">statement to Retraction Watch</a> sent via her legal counsel, Kelly stood by her work.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129999"></span>



<p>Due to “ongoing confidential proceedings” regarding the proposed retractions, “I consider substantive discussion about them to be premature at this juncture,” Kelly said. “At least one external review has very recently contradicted the conclusions of the journals as presented in the respective retraction notices.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I remain confident that the ultimate results of these ongoing proceedings will confirm that the findings and data presented in these papers remain accurate, reliable, and scientifically sound.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Concerns have been swirling around Kelly, a former president of the Microscopy Society of America, at least since early last year when a scientist at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom began <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Kelly+AND+McCorvie">flagging problems</a> in her work on PubPeer. So far, Thomas McCorvie has pointed out issues with 21 of Kelly’s publications.</p>



<p>McCorvie said he first noticed problems with Kelly’s work when the now-retracted paper in <em>Science Advances</em> appeared in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At the time a colleague emailed Deb Kelly due to our concerns, but the conversation was not productive, and Kelly stopped replying,” McCorvie told us. “As far as I am aware Kelly did not acknowledge the erased regions in their two maps. This was all very suspicious, but we didn&#8217;t follow up on it at the time.”</p>



<p>Then <a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbic.202200310">a paper</a> from 2022 in <em>ChemBioChem</em> rekindled <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/087884F390E53FCF60DE6BD9086CC4">McCorvie’s apprehensions</a>. He also noticed further problems with the 2017 paper in <em>Science Advances </em>that made him suspect the cryo-EM maps had been “fabricated,” he said in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Due to all these issues, I looked further into the Kelly lab&#8217;s work last year,” McCorvie explained. He said the 21 papers he has flagged on PubPeer:</p>

<p>are from the Kelly lab&#8217;s time at Penn State and Virginia Tech. There are also three papers with issues from Kelly&#8217;s time as a postdoc at Harvard medical school. The general concerns cover:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">

<p>Kelly’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deb-kelly-51797110/">LinkedIn page</a> says she is also the executive director of the new non-profit think tank Structural Oncology LLC.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads9451">retraction notice</a> in <em>Science Advances</em>, which follows an editorial <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp1930">expression of concern</a> from March, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>After publication, readers raised concerns that the cryo-EM maps had been altered. As a particular example, the map for EMDB-8834 appeared to be altered using a volume eraser tool to create a spherical hole in the map. These concerns were presented to the authors and an editorial expression of concern was issued on the paper on March 13, 2024. The authors’ response was reviewed by multiple experts in Cryo-EM, and this review concluded that unresolved concerns in the integrity of the data presented in this paper remained. As a consequence, the editors of Science Advances have decided to retract this paper. Some but not all of the authors agree with this retraction, and others have not responded. Dr. Kelly does not agree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McCorvie’s PubPeer comments give <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5E181133A9D26016A8DAC96F45AB7E">a detailed account</a> of the issues with the paper, including the apparent use of an eraser tool in two density maps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Overall, I am incredibly concerned with the state of these maps. They have been clearly edited and their origin appears questionable,” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5E181133A9D26016A8DAC96F45AB7E/#5">McCorvie wrote</a> in one comment, noting in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5E181133A9D26016A8DAC96F45AB7E/#7">another</a> that he kept “finding inconsistencies” in the paper.</p>



<p>McCorvie added a caveat:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Any students involved in this paper should not be judged for the veracity of the findings, and maps. I am sure they are all very capable scientists. Responsibility of the edited maps however lies solely on the PI. This is clear as they are the common denominator across all flagged manuscripts and are the head of the lab. This also applies to other students in the Kelly Lab.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The new retraction comes just a month after the journal <em>Nanoscale</em> pulled a 2021 article titled “<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/nr/d1nr00388g">Microchip-based structure determination of low-molecular weight proteins using cryo-electron microscopy</a>,” for “concerns about the reliability of the electron microscopy data.” (McCorvie described the problems <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/79B2054F275DEB451D9119FC4C4162">here</a>.)</p>



<p>Kelly was the senior and corresponding author, and opposed the retraction, according to the <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/nr/d4nr90151g">notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Independent experts were consulted who were not satisfied with the explanation provided by the authors, therefore this article is being retracted to protect the integrity and accuracy of the scientific record,” the notice stated.</p>



<p><a href="https://med.virginia.edu/faculty/faculty-listing/ehe2n/">Edward H. Egelman</a>, a professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, was one of those independent experts. An editor for the Royal Society of Chemistry, which publishes <em>Nanoscale</em>, contacted him in July 2023 to ask for his assistance in evaluating the article, critiques of the data, and the authors’ response, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Egelman’s assessment, “there are fundamental concerns about the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nanoscale_review.pdf">input</a> from Egelman and another expert, the journal decided to retract the article, the editor informed Egelman in October.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, once the journal sent Kelly the proposed retraction, she responded with a rebuttal, which the journal asked Egelman to review in December. Kelly’s response <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kelly_Rejoinder.docx">did not change his mind</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After some back and forth regarding raw data Egelman suggested the journal request from Kelly, the journal published an <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/nr/d4nr90037e">expression of concern</a> in February “in order to alert readers that concerns have been raised regarding the accuracy” of some of the data in the article. “An investigation is underway,” the notice stated.</p>



<p>Frustrated that <em>Nanoscale</em> still had not retracted the paper, Egelman submitted a concern to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) in March. In August, after the retraction was published, COPE informed Egelman it could no longer consider the concern due to “ongoing legal procedures.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two retracted works have been cited 27 times in total, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Separately, in July Egelman published a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.5125">detailed critique</a> of another of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202103221">Kelly’s papers</a> that appeared in <em>Advanced Materials</em>. “Basic principles in mathematics and physics would need to be violated” to achieve the reported results, he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">McCorvie said <em>Current Opinion in Structural Biology</em> would soon be pulling another paper by Kelly and her colleagues – “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959440X22001051?via%3Dihub">Liquid-EM goes viral – visualizing structure and dynamics</a>” – that he did not flag, and that all of the authors had been informed of the move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That article, which has been cited six times, was the subject of “a lengthy and comprehensive peer review process” undertaken by Penn State and “conducted by three independent experts from outside of Penn State,” according to a July 26, 2024, email from the school’s Office for Research Protections obtained by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The “review process concluded that there are serious data integrity concerns relating to volume and model” in the article, wrote Chief of Staff Courtney Karmelita. She added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In addition, the corresponding author, when asked to produce original research data to justify the data, maps and models in question, did not do so. For these reasons, Penn State recommends that this paper be retracted. The corresponding author who is copied here (along with the other co-authors whose contact information I could find) declined to seek retraction despite having been urged to do so by the peer review panel, thus requiring that I, as Research Integrity Officer, reach out to you directly with this institutional recommendation for retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of <em>Current Opinion in Structural Biology</em>, confirmed they were investigating the article.</p>



<p>Egelman told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The investigation at Penn State concluded in May, and they refused to make any of their report public but passed the matter to ORI [the federal Office of Research Integrity] that they said would ultimately issue a report. Kelly was the Chair of an NIH study section as well as the recipient of funds for many years from [the National Cancer Institute], so there is potential embarrassment for many parties.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement, Penn State said it had “conducted a peer review with external subject matter experts” which “confirmed the presence of unreliable data in several papers.” The university contacted journals to request retraction of the papers and reported its findings to ORI, the statement confirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for ORI said the office was “not able to confirm or deny the existence of any potential pending cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter to <em>Current Opinion in Structural Biology</em> on Kelly’s behalf, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/06/28/lawyer-why-i-defend-scientists-accused-of-misconduct/">Paul Thaler</a>, a <a href="https://www.cohenseglias.com/attorney/paul-thaler/">partner</a> at the Washington, D.C. firm Cohen Seglias Pallas Greenhall &amp; Furman, disputed the retraction. Thaler argued the editors and university investigation had not provided Kelly with sufficient evidence the data in the paper were unreliable.<br>Thaler copied another lawyer, Pittsburgh, Penn.-based <a href="https://www.leechtishman.com/people/heather-s-heidelbaugh/">Heather S. Heidelbaugh</a> of Leech Tishman. (In 2020, Heidelbaugh ran for attorney general of Pennsylvania against incumbent Josh Shapiro (now governor of the state) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/josh-shapiro-wins-heather-heidelbaugh/">and lost</a>.)</p>

<p>A former research fellow at Harvard Medical School faked data and used images from another scientist without attribution in a published paper and two grant applications, according to <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-bhan-arunoday-k">findings</a> from the U.S. Office of Research Integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, Arunoday K. Bhan, was also a former staff scientist at City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, Calif., and first author on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96351-2">Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived platelets loaded with lapatinib effectively target HER2+ breast cancer metastasis to the brain</a>,” which appeared in <em>Scientific Reports</em> in October 2021. The article has been cited eight times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56291-z">was retracted</a> in March. The retraction note cited an investigation by City of Hope and detailed “discrepancies in the data” that match ORI’s findings.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129989"></span>



<p>ORI said it found Bhan relabeled multiple images in the paper as representing different cells than they portrayed, “without appropriate citation to the researcher who generated the image[s].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the agency, Bhan received funding from a <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ZQDwoqbgJ0qOP_TOhnK7cw/project-details/10746810">grant</a> to Boston Children’s Hospital meant to support postdoctoral fellows in transfusion medicine and cellular therapies “enabling them to move on to leading positions in academia or industry.”</p>



<p>Bhan agreed to have his research supervised for four years, and not to serve in any advisory role for the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes peer review committees at the National Institutes of Health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bhan did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his City of Hope address, which did not bounce. We were not able to find information on his current position.</p>

<p>Kashif Barkat, who heads the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan, has had two of his studies retracted and two more corrected, all for issues related to images in the papers. Several more of his studies are flagged on PubPeer for similar reasons. </p>



<p>According to the retraction notice for one of the retracted articles, which appeared in&nbsp; <em>Polymer Bulletin </em>in 2020, Barkat does not agree with the journal’s decision to pull the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “Understanding mechanical characteristics of pH-responsive PEG 4000-based polymeric network for colorectal carcinoma: its acute oral toxicity study,” has been cited three times so far, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00289-024-05366-y">retraction note</a>, issued in June, reads:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129985"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding highly similar areas between the group I and II images in Fig. 11 representing stomach, lung and intestine tissues. In addition, the heart group II and intestine both group images appear highly similar to Fig. 10 heart I and intestine II images, respectively, in [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00289-024-05366-y#ref-CR1">1</a>].</p>



<p>The Editors-in-Chief therefore no longer have confidence in the presented data.</p>



<p>Kashif Barkat does not agree to this retraction. The other authors have not responded to any correspondence from the editor or publisher about this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Barkat has not responded to our request for comment. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The other retraction for Barkat is of a 2022 paper published in <em>BioMed Research International. </em>The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/5883239#">study</a>, “Polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30-Based Crosslinked Fast Swelling Nanogels: An Impeccable Approach for Drug’s Solubility Improvement,” has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10791210/">retraction notice</a>, dated January 9:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted by Hindawi, as publisher, following an investigation undertaken by the publisher [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10791210/#B1">1</a>]. This investigation has uncovered evidence of systematic manipulation of the publication and peer-review process. We cannot, therefore, vouch for the reliability or integrity of this article.</p>



<p>Please note that this notice is intended solely to alert readers that the peer-review process of this article has been compromised.</p>



<p>Wiley and Hindawi regret that the usual quality checks did not identify these issues before publication and have since put additional measures in place to safeguard research integrity.</p>



<p>We wish to credit our Research Integrity and Research Publishing teams and anonymous and named external researchers and research integrity experts for contributing to this investigation.</p>



<p>The corresponding author, as the representative of all authors, has been given the opportunity to register their agreement or disagreement to this retraction. We have kept a record of any response received.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the two corrected articles, Barkat and his colleagues acknowledge errors in the published images but that those mistakes did not affect the main conclusions of the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.55913">correction</a>, issued by the <em>Journal of Applied Polymer Science</em> in June, was for a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.45312">2017 study</a> published by Barkat and colleagues, titled “Oxaliplatin-loaded crosslinked polymeric network of chondroitin sulfate-<em>co</em>-poly(methacrylic acid) for colorectal cancer: Its toxicological evaluation.” That paper has been cited 48 times.</p>



<p>The other <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9846852/">corrigendum</a>, issued in January 2023 by <em>Frontiers in Chemistry</em>, was for a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010646/">2022 paper</a> titled, “Chitosan/Xanthan Gum based hydrogels as potential carrier for an antiviral drug: Fabrication, characterization, and safety evaluation,” cited 88 times.</p>



<p>At the end of the corrigendum, <em>Frontiers in Chemistry </em>published a separate note, which reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>All claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.

</blockquote>



<p>In addition to these four, 10 other studies coauthored by Barkat are <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Kashif+Barkat">being discussed on PubPeer</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/bugs-brain-the-role-of-gut-brain-axis-in-neurological-disorders">Bugs &#38; Brain: The Role of Gut-Brain Axis in Neurological Disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Within our bodies, trillions of cells originating from a single-celled zygote work in harmony to create and sustain us. However, residing in our guts is a vast and complex microbiome that, despite its integral role, remains largely unexplored. “The current estimate is that humans have 10 trillion human cells and about 100 trillion bacterial cells,” says Dr. Martin J. Blaser at the New York University School of Medicine. These microbes play an essential role in supporting healthy digestion, offering infection prevention, and even preserving reproductive health, as well as linking the gastrointestinal tract to the enteric nervous system. Scientifically, the &apos;gut-brain axis&apos; refers to the bidirectional interaction between gut microbiota and the brain, mediated through neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral pathways. This interaction has been extensively demonstrated to influence brain activity.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The gut-brain axis involves complex communication between the central nervous system (CNS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the enteric nervous system (ENS), and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The ANS, including the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, transmits signals between the gut and the brain. For example, in response to stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β can prompt the adrenal glands to release cortisol, a major stress hormone. Beyond neural pathways, the gut-brain axis also operates through the immune system, where gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, such as cytokine production and T cell development. Key gut bacteria, including Helicobacter, Bacteroides, Clostridia, and segmented filamentous bacteria, help balance pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals. For instance, when the intestinal barrier is compromised, gut microbes can trigger immune cells to release pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα into the bloodstream, potentially leading to systemic inflammation.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">These interconnected systems—neural, immune, and endocrine—profoundly affect the brain and mental health. Research has shown that several neurological conditions, including Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD), Parkinson&apos;s disease, anxiety, depression, and Autism Spectrum Disorder, are influenced by the so-called &apos;dysbiosis&apos; of the gut microbiota.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the most well-documented examples of gut dysbiosis associated with a neurological condition is the overgrowth of </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Helicobacter pylori</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> in the intestines of Parkinson&apos;s disease patients. </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">H. pylori</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> infection has been shown to reduce dopaminergic transmission in neurons located in the substantia nigra, a brain region critical for motor control. This reduction in dopamine transmission may correlate with the progressive motor dysfunction, gastrointestinal issues, and cognitive impairment seen in Parkinson&apos;s disease. Additionally, studies have found an increase in bacteria from the families Lactobacillaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Barnesiellaceae in Parkinson’s patients, which may further contribute to disease progression. Meanwhile, a decrease in Prevotellaceae has been linked to reduced production of the hormone ghrelin, which is essential for proper dopaminergic transmission.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gut dysbiosis is also a significant factor in the context of AD. A study analysing stool samples from patients measured the abundance of six bacterial taxa, revealing an increase in pro-inflammatory species and a decrease in anti-inflammatory ones. This imbalance included a reduced population of Firmicutes and a potential increase in Bacteroidetes. While the amyloid hypothesis remains a central explanation for AD, there is limited information related to how gut dysbiosis and the tau hypothesis might also contribute to disease progression.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Given the emerging links between gut dysbiosis and these neurological conditions, several treatments aimed at restoring a healthy microbiome are being explored. In Parkinson&apos;s disease, microbial replacement therapy, which includes the transfer of liquid fecal matter from a healthy donor (fecal microbiota transplantation), has shown promise. Additionally, probiotics containing strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have been effective in alleviating some gastrointestinal symptoms in patients when administered over a period of 1-3 months.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, early studies in Alzheimer&apos;s patients have shown that treatments such as fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics could be beneficial. Although these studies have been conducted on small groups, they offer promising results that warrant further investigation. Nonetheless, research into restoring gut microbiota is still in its infancy and demands more intensive study to gain conclusive results.</span></span></p>

<p>A Swiss medical publisher has ceased operations, including shuttering <a href="https://www.swisshealthweb.ch/de/zeitschriften/">nationally prominent journals</a>, after its parent organization, the <a href="https://www.fmh.ch/">Swiss Medical Association FMH</a>, allegedly forced it into bankruptcy.</p>



<p>According to information on the website of EMH Swiss Medical Publishers, the Swiss Medical Association FMH holds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240905082918/https://www.swisshealthweb.ch/de/article/doi/shw-d.2024.1599284532/">a 55% stake</a> in the firm. But on Aug. 22, 2024, the FMH’s board terminated its collaboration with the publishing house, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240904140042/https:/www.swisshealthweb.ch/de/article/doi/shw-d.2024.1607631223/">including licensing for the association’s journal <em>Schweizerische Ärztezeitung</em></a><em> </em>(Swiss Medical Journal), with immediate effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In doing so, [the association] deprived its own company of its livelihood. EMH filed its balance sheet today and thus opened bankruptcy proceedings,” the publisher said in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240905082516/https://phc.swisshealthweb.ch/de/">a notice</a> posted on its website on September 4, 2024.</p>



<span id="more-129963"></span>



<p>The publisher had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240904140042/https:/www.swisshealthweb.ch/de/article/doi/shw-d.2024.1607631223/">previously announced</a> the move by its parent organization meant it had to discontinue the following journals immediately:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Swiss Medical Forum </em></li>



<li><em>Primary and Hospital Care </em></li>



<li><em>Swiss Archives of Neurology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy</em></li>



<li><em>Cardiovascular Medicine</em></li>



<li><em>Swiss Medical Informatics</em></li>
</ul>



<p>It would also close down its website www.swisshealthweb.ch, the firm said. The site was a major source of conflict with the FMH, which in <a href="https://fmh.ch/files/pdf30/2024-08-15-mm-fmh-emh_fmh_saez.pdf">an Aug. 15 media statement</a> said the IT project was too expensive and did not meet the needs of the association’s members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yvonne Gilli, president of the FMH, told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The FMH regrets that further magazines can no longer be published due to this development. However, the licence rights to these affected journals are held by Petri Holding, not by the FMH. The FMH is therefore unable to make any statements about their future. However, the FMH is prepared to work on sustainable solutions for these journals on request.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the affected titles, the Scopus-indexed <em>Swiss Archives of Neurology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy</em>, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240905085853/https://sanp.swisshealthweb.ch/en/about-sanp/">more than a century old.</a> It has featured works by such academic luminaries as Carl Gustav Jung, Eugen Bleuler, Hermann Rorschach and Michel Foucault<em>,</em> according to Daniele Zullino of Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève, who was co-editor-in-chief of the publication until it folded.</p>



<p>“Everything stopped now,” Zullino said. “We don&#8217;t know what will happen.”</p>



<p>The <em>Swiss Archives of Neurology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy</em> was the only psychiatry journal in Switzerland, a country known for its contributions to that field, and among the most widely read medical journals there, Zullino added. “So we have to relaunch it.”</p>



<p>Other physicians in Switzerland echoed Zullino’s regret.</p>



<p>“From a researcher point of view, it is really sad to see the <em>Swiss Archives of Neurology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy</em> vanishing, as it is a well-respected and Scopus-listed journal,” said a physician-researcher in Switzerland, who asked to remain anonymous. “To cancel all papers under review also seems to be an unusual decision, and I am unsure what happens to accepted, but not yet published papers.”</p>



<p>In the Aug. 26 notice on its website, the soon-to-be erstwhile publisher added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Right up until the very end, we had tried to resume constructive discussions with FMH. With its decision, which was contrary to the contract and surprising to all of us, FMH is obviously knowingly accepting the break-up of its own subsidiary and 27 years of successful development and cooperation. As a result of FMH&#8217;s decision, all 35 EMH employees will lose their jobs. This is not only incomprehensible, but also socially irresponsible, as the impending liquidity shortage has since been addressed by suitable measures.</p>
