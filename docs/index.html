<p>Talking about lead is boring. I would know, I&#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time trudging through papers about lead while writing this post and the best opening I could come up with is just how mind-numbingly boring lead is. Sadly, boredom isn&#8217;t a good indicator for importance. While the days of enthusiastically throwing lead into whatever we could (from water pipes to gasoline to cosmetics to paints for houses and children&#8217;s toys) are over, the lead we&#8217;ve pumped into the environment doesn&#8217;t give up so easily. And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, we&#8217;ve still found some use cases to keep it hanging around (why yes, I&#8217;m talking about batteries).</p>



<p>Ok, but how bad can it really be? The levels of lead are surely not as high anymore, so it&#8217;s not really that dangerous, right? Well… short answer: it&#8217;s a bit more complicated. The long answer is the rest of the article.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-lead">What is lead?</h2>



<p>Lead is a heavy metal. (Little side note: until the writing of this article, I&#8217;ve taken the term &#8220;heavy metal&#8221; pretty much for granted, because everyone knows what a heavy metal is, right? Right? Well… apparently there&#8217;s quite a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals">ambiguity</a> surrounding the term, but lead is one of the few who meets all of the definitions out there. And heavy typically refers to dense and/or less chemically reactive, i.e. not interested in playing well with others.) So lead is a heavy metal and it&#8217;s found naturally in the ground. What makes it pretty neat is that it&#8217;s both malleable, but also durable and versatile.</p>



<p>What makes it less neat is that it&#8217;s so malleable, versatile, durable, and toxic. As I mentioned in the beginning, lead has been used in a lot of products. And it&#8217;s been used since as far back as Roman times. The problem is that lead is so durable, it basically doesn&#8217;t degrade. You see, unlike other fun toxic metals, such as mercury (which can be converted in less toxic forms by bacteria), lead is resistant to chemical breakdown, so once you&#8217;ve got lead particles in the environment, they will stay there kind of forever, unless you actively remove them somehow. In other words, even if we were to completely stop mining for and using lead (which we aren&#8217;t, since the lead-acid battery market is projected to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/18/3044684/0/en/Automotive-Lead-Acid-Battery-Market-to-Reach-USD-40-60-Billion-by-2032-Driven-by-Sustained-Demand-in-Conventional-Vehicles-and-Emerging-Economies-SNS-Insider.html">increase</a> in the next years), we would still need to deal in a safe manner with what has been put out there.</p>



<p>Of course, since we&#8217;ve stopped putting lead in gasoline (and paints, and cosmetics etc.), things have improved. For example, in the US, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/biomonitoring-lead#About%20the%20Lead%20Indicators">levels</a> of lead in blood samples have markedly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.115-a30">decreased</a> since 1976. But a decrease doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ve reached zero. And while many things with negative effects don&#8217;t really harm you in small doses, lead isn&#8217;t one of them. There is no safe level of lead exposure. What&#8217;s more, an average decrease in the US population doesn&#8217;t translate into a decrease of the same magnitude across the world, or even across various subgroups of the US population.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="effects-of-lead-and-mechanisms-behind-them">Effects of lead and mechanisms behind them</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve already established that no amount of lead is safe, but still, the effects of lead exposure on the nervous system don&#8217;t occur in an all or nothing manner. They depend strongly both on the level of lead to which one is exposed (more is worse), and the developmental period when exposure occurs (children are more affected than adults).</p>



<p>Lead usually enters the body via one of two routes: either the gut or the lungs. Children absorb more lead than adults because their gut and lung linings are immature compared to adults, allowing more lead to pass through. They also need more iron, calcium, and zinc, metals with which lead is in direct competition (and obviously winning). In addition, small children can be simply more exposed to lead as they have the tendency to put both their unwashed hands, as well as potentially contaminated objects, in their mouths.</p>



<p>While the half-life of lead in the blood (meaning the amount of time needed for the concentration to drop to half) is relatively short, at only 28 days, that&#8217;s not the same as the half-life in the body. Some of the lead in the blood will not be eliminated, but it will actually go into the soft tissue, i.e. kidneys, liver, brain, where the half-life is a few months, and more annoyingly, into the bones, where the half-life is between 10 to 30 years. What&#8217;s more, from here, lead can leach back into the bloodstream, from where it can once again get into the soft tissue and cause more damage. This happens particularly in pregnancy, thus affecting the unborn babies, but it also occurs during normal ageing, and even more so in conditions such as osteoporosis.</p>



<p>Now, acute effects of lead exposure are pretty clear. If someone were to chomp down on a piece of lead, it would result in seizures, coma, and possibly death. But obviously that&#8217;s an unrealistic scenario and not what most people are exposed to. Chronic lead exposure, on the other hand, causes lead to accumulate in the body and it has been linked to memory problems (including development of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease later in life), as well as cognitive and behavioural problems, including attention deficits, increased aggression, learning problems, and decreased IQ. But here&#8217;s the kicker: in the past, these problems were thought to appear only above certain concentrations: above 10 μg/dL, above 5 μg/dL, above 3.5 μg/dL… And yes, the higher the concentration, the worse the effects. Nevertheless, as research has progressed, it&#8217;s become clearer and clearer that there is no safe exposure to lead. Even very small concentrations can cause <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2019.02.021">neurological effects</a>.</p>



<p>But what are the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2019.03.010">molecular mechanisms</a> behind that? (Side note: directly relating one specific molecular disruption to one specific behavioural outcome doesn&#8217;t really work, but we can correlate the effects we observe at the behavioural level with the <em>in vitro</em> molecular data to get a clearer picture of how lead wreaks havoc on the nervous system.) So far, three main ones have been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-008-0345-3">identified</a>. Lead alters the fluidity of the cellular membrane, it interferes with calcium-based processes, and it generates reactive oxygen species.</p>



<p>Regarding the cellular membrane, it&#8217;s important to understand that it is neither static, nor uniform. On the one hand, there are many proteins embedded in the membrane that basically move around to where they&#8217;re needed. On the other hand, the cell membrane has a lot of traffic in the sense of vesicles that either fuse with it, or bud off from it. In particular for neurons, think of synaptic transmission: vesicles from inside the membrane fuse with it to release neurotransmitters, then new ones form where more neurotransmitters are packed, and all this happens under strict control from membrane proteins. To ensure optimal functioning of this process, the fluidity of the membrane needs to be just right: either too much or too little will mess things up.</p>



<p>Calcium is an ion which plays a very important role in regulating synaptic transmission and thus facilitating communication between neurons. Sadly for it, calcium resembles lead quite a lot, so proteins can easily mistake them, and lead forms stronger bonds with these proteins. But while lead can easily steal calcium&#8217;s spot, due to small differences in chemical behaviour and in shape, it&#8217;s not able to perform the same functions. Instead, it kind of remains stuck in there and jams the system.</p>



<p>Finally, reactive oxygen species, or free radicals, as you might know them, appear partly because of lead&#8217;s interference with calcium signaling, but also because lead inhibits antioxidant enzymes, and disrupts mitochondrial function. Reactive oxygen species, in turn, can damage DNA, lipids, and proteins, further exacerbating negative effects in the nervous system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-there-to-do">What is there to do?</h2>



<p>Panic for the sake of panic is useless (one could even say it&#8217;s harmful). So what can we do? First, we said the effects are worse in children, so if they were exposed to lead, is that it? Are they pretty much doomed to suffer the consequences? Not necessarily. Some <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2012.10.004">studies</a> show that enriched environments and early behavioural interventions can reverse some, if not all effects associated with early life lead exposure.</p>



<p>Still, prevention is better than intervention, but you might be wondering, how big of a thing is lead exposure still? After all, we figured out a long time ago that lead isn&#8217;t good for us (even the Romans knew that) and we&#8217;ve already done a lot to get rid of it, no? Well, yes and no. There have been real improvements, especially in removing lead from gasoline, paint, and plumbing. But, as with a lot of other issues, it tends to come down to where you live. As you can imagine, there are relatively pronounced differences between countries, but even within the same one, your ZIP code still matters. Older housing, industrial sites, ageing infrastructure, and underfunded communities all play a role in how much lead still lingers in your air, water, soil, and body.</p>



<p>A few steps to keep in mind for protecting yourself against lead exposure are the following. If you think you might have lead in your home paint or pipes, try to get rid of them in a safe way. If you know there&#8217;s lead somewhere in your community, try to get involved and push for programs that promote its removal. And even if the issue doesn&#8217;t directly impact you, you can still volunteer to help those who might suffer from it.</p>

<p>A Bangladesh-based organization focused on development economics and its founder have been churning out papers filled with misstatements, inconsistencies, ethical lapses and <a href="https://osf.io/9erj6">“statistically improbable data,”</a> according to researchers involved in an ongoing effort to replicate the work.</p>



<p>One journal has already retracted a paper for falsely claiming to describe a randomized, controlled trial and data collection that failed to adhere to the journal’s ethical guidelines. The study, published in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292118301764"><em>European Economic Review</em></a>, was retracted following <a href="https://osf.io/2axzm/files/osfstorage">a March 11 report</a> from the <a href="https://i4replication.org/index.html">Institute for Replication, or I4R</a>. The group is conducting a broader probe into the Global Development &amp; Research Initiative (GDRI), the organization that implemented the intervention described in the paper.</p>



<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240614151507/https://gdri.org/about-the-founder">GDRI’s founder </a>and the study’s sole author is <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/asadul-islam">Asad Islam</a>, a developmental economist at Monash University in Australia. Since 2022, Islam has received over $2 million in funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and other organizations, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/asad-islam-cv.pdf">a copy of his resume</a>. Islam did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the retraction or the broader concerns about the work. But in a statement posted to his now-deleted account on X, he wrote: </p>



<span id="more-131646"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Given the volume of requests and the complexity of the issues raised, my team and I are diligently reviewing every point to ensure a comprehensive and accurate response. At this stage, these remain allegations, and I urge everyone to allow me the necessary time to address them fully.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Abel Brodeur, the chair of I4R and an economist at the University of Ottawa, said the probe into the GDRI began in November, following a tip from a whistleblower.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brodeur enlisted expert volunteers and assigned them to small teams to review five studies with ties to GDRI. Their job was to review the publicly available data and analysis code and look for any irregularities.</p>



<p>I4R’s review has since expanded to more than 30 studies and working papers listed on Islam’s personal website, resume, and other sources because of overlap in the data sets and concerns that have arisen along the way, according to Brodeur. I4R has requested data for many of these projects, but it only attempts to reproduce papers once they have been published. The group has completed <a href="https://osf.io/23x64/files/osfstorage">10 reports so far</a>, releasing five of them along with a response from the original authors.</p>



<p>“The I4R has reproduced hundreds of studies over the past three years, and we’ve never seen anything of this scale,” said Brodeur.</p>



<p>Since the probe began, Islam and his coauthors have withdrawn two studies that had been accepted for publication at <em>Economic Development and Cultural Change</em> and <em>Journal of the European Economic Association</em> and another study that had recently been submitted, according to I4R’s correspondence with the journals.</p>



<p>Several of Islam’s coauthors <a href="https://osf.io/gfkhd">have either withdrawn</a> their names from published studies, citing the problems raised by I4R, or they have indicated that Islam is no longer involved in research initiated with him. For example, when I4R requested a replication package for a manuscript in review on gender norms in the workplace, development economist Emily Beam of the University of Vermont <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/i4replication.bsky.social/post/3ljxwwb5pwm2x">responded</a>, “Asad [Islam]&#8230; is no longer involved with this project, and the three of us are completing it without him.” (Beam did not respond to a request for comment.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>For <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255392">a 2021 study</a> published by <em>PLOS One</em>, I4R was unable to reproduce the study’s result regarding the correlation between food insecurity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. After I4R shared <a href="https://osf.io/7tzek/">its findings</a> with the authors, all three authors, including Islam, withdrew their authorship, according to correspondence with I4R. </p>



<p>Asked about the status of the paper, David Knutson, head of communications for PLOS, said that he was unable to comment on it because it was an “ongoing case,” but he noted that “withdrawal of authorship is not considered by PLOS or by COPE to be a suitable means of responding to concerns about the integrity, validity, or reproducibility of published results.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The one paper retracted so far, published in 2019 <em>European Economic Review</em>, an Elsevier journal, has been cited 21 times. It claimed to show parent-teacher meetings were a “low-cost strategy” that could produce dramatic gains in students’ test scores.</p>



<p>When Brodeur’s team examined the Islam’s statistical analysis code published with the original paper, they noticed an annotation that read “try to balance the baseline.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This remark prompted us to investigate the study closely for data irregularities, especially in the baseline data,” Brodeur and his colleagues wrote <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292125000716">in their report</a>, which the journal published April 3. Indeed, the baseline scores appeared to have been altered to generate significant results during the follow-up. As the team put it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our analysis uncovered several data irregularities that severely question the validity and, thus, the credibility of the original study’s findings. First and foremost, we find that the school-level treatment allocation has a clear non-random spatial pattern. We demonstrate using permutation tests that the observed allocation is extremely unlikely to have occurred by the school-level randomization described in Islam (2019). Second, baseline test scores for the same students differ systematically across datasets, with discrepancies varying between the treatment and control groups.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://osf.io/5gf89">his response</a> to the replication report, Islam said he stood by the study and its results. He claimed the contractor on the project had failed to follow his instructions to randomize the schools and stated the comment about balancing the baseline was written by an undergraduate student and was “never acted upon.”</p>



<p>When Brodeur’s team asked Islam to provide the underlying data and code from another study, Islam pointed them to the GDRI, which he described as “an NGO that helped us collect the data, but it does not store the data for an extended period.” He added, “we might not have alternative options available at this time.”</p>



<p>Islam is the founder of GDRI and its predecessor, the Initiative for Development Research and Implementation, according to archived versions of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240614144900/https://gdri.org/about-the-founder">the organization’s website</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180728111249/http://users.monash.edu.au/~asaduli/cv.pdf">his resume</a> and his personal homepage from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181011044742/http://users.monash.edu/~asaduli/index.html">2018</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191023035840/http://users.monash.edu:80/~asaduli/index.html">2019</a>.</p>



<p>“I grew up in a rural village in Bangladesh,”&nbsp; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180726143454/http://users.monash.edu.au/~asaduli/">wrote</a> on his personal homepage. “I believe my childhood in a remote rural village and experience working with NGOs and development research organization [sic] helped me to understand better of what I do [sic], and what works in development!”</p>

<p>A paper that <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2025/01/28/veziroglu-journal-of-papermill-energy/">made the rounds</a> last year for its blatantly “irrelevant” citations has now been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier’s <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em> published “Origin of the distinct site occupations of H atom in hcp Ti and Zr/Hf” in November 2024.</p>



<p>Paragraph seven of the introduction consists of a single sentence: “As strongly requested by the reviewers, here we cite some references [35-47] although they are completely irrelevant to the present work.” One of the authors told us they included the references as a “joke” after reviewers pressured them.</p>



<p>All 13 of the references include Sergei Trukhanov as an author, and all but one also includes Alex Trukhanov.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131632"></span>



<p>According to his most recent paper, <a href="https://vestnik.vstu.by/eng/editorial_committee/truhanov-av/">Alex Trukhanov</a> is affiliated with the Scientific-Practical Materials Research Centre of NAS of Belarus in Minsk. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2294-4371">Sergei Trukhanov</a> is listed as a researcher at the National University of Science and Technology in Moscow on his most recent paper. Neither responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319924043957">retraction notice</a>, “the authors were requested by two of the reviewers to insert redundant references. The peer review process is deemed to have been compromised.” The notice also states the reviewers responsible for the citation prompting have been removed from the “journal database, so that they cannot review papers in the future.”</p>



<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0810-8847">Qing-Miao Hu</a>, one of the corresponding authors of the paper and a professor at the Institute of Metal Research Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shenyang, told us in an email he did not want to speculate who the reviewers were. “There are quite a few such kind of reviewers, and the authors suffer from them a lot in recent years,” Hu added.</p>



<p>Hu said the reviewers asked the researchers to add the citations during their second round of edits. He said the phrasing was “to make a joke with the reviewers,” and that they didn’t expect the manuscript “with such a statement” to be accepted for publication. “We were annoyed but did not felt [sic] pressured to add the citation,” Hu said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier told us they were “currently investigating this matter and cannot comment on open investigations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em> has appeared in Retraction Watch before. In 2023, we reported the journal was one of a handful that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/15/who-are-you-dragan-rodriguez-fifteen-studies-have-the-same-fake-author-sleuth-finds/">published papers by an apparently nonexistent author</a>. In 2017, the journal retracted several papers over <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/21/elsevier-retracting-26-papers-accepted-fake-reviews/">fake peer reviews</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors have already resubmitted the paper to the same journal, Hu said, and agreed with the retraction “because it was indeed published without a normal peer review.”</p>
