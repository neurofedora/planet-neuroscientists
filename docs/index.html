                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/PRW-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Any blog about the future of peer review should start with a brief mention of its history. The actual process of peer review can be dated back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century. It has of course evolved since then and one notable step was the introduction of external reviewers in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This model, however, only really became the norm in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>We can only speculate on what the future of peer review will be and how recent challenges and innovations will act to shape it. One thing is however sure: this future will depend on the key players of tomorrow, the ones who will one day hold the reins. The future of scientific research depends on today’s early career researchers (ECRs) and thus they will also play an instrumental role in shaping the future of peer review. Therefore, I decided to reach out to a selection of ECRs to gather their thoughts and hopes about the future of peer review.</p>
<p>I would like to start by acknowledging them as this blog would not have been possible without their contribution and time is a very valuable currency nowadays, especially for ECRs in the demanding research world.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Julia Sanchez-Garrido</strong> is originally from Spain but has been living in the UK for 10 years. She obtained her PhD at Imperial College London in 2018 and has been working as a postdoc there since then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Clemens Falker-Gieske</strong> obtained his Dr. rer. nat. in Biology for his work on the role of exosomal vesicles in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. He then acquired additional expertise in computational biology. He is currently working in animal sciences with a focus on animal welfare issues such as behavior and diseases. He is based in Germany.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Stephanie Tsai</strong> was born and raised in the USA. She has been doing research in the field of regenerative biology since she was in high school and is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Yu Wan</strong> grew up in China. He has been working in research since 2015 and is currently a research associate at the Imperial College London.</p>
<p><strong>Partha</strong><strong> Sarathi Tripathy </strong>is from India and is currently a PhD student in Norway. He has been working in research for the past 8 years.</p>

<p>Now without further ado, we will dive into their answers to the questions I had prepared.</p>
<p>To set the scene, the participants were first asked how familiar they were with the peer review system and whether they had already reviewed a manuscript or worked as an editor. Unsurprisingly, all of them had already reviewed manuscripts and Partha Sarathi Tripathy mentioned that he is working as an editor for an aquaculture journal in India. I then went on to ask them what their opinion of the current peer review system was.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think the current peer review system is working?</strong></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there was a consensus around the fact that there are currently not enough rewards to motivate researchers to dedicate time in their busy schedule to reviewing manuscripts, given the pressure they are subjected to. This issue then leads to difficulty in finding reviewers and can also result in poor quality review reports. However, as Julia Sanchez-Garrido said, “<em>being reviewed by your peers is still the gold standard (who else can review your work?).”</em> Stephanie Tsai also mentioned that she thought the system would benefit from more double-blind and transparent review.</p>
<p>My next question delved more into the specific aspects of the system that they liked or disliked.</p>
<p><strong> Can you tell me one thing that you like about it and one thing that you dislike?</strong></p>
<p>All the participants answered that they liked the fact that constructive criticism from a reviewer can improve a paper, for example by judiciously suggesting additional experiments, provided this reviewer is unbiased, familiar with the field of research in question and that the suggested changes are reasonable. “<em>Editors and reviewers both should be reasonable about considering the time and necessity of those suggestions to the core findings of the work,</em>” said Tsai. Partha Sarathi Tripathy added: “<em>The thing I like about the system is that it helps to ensure the quality and integrity of scientific literature. By having multiple experts review a paper, errors and inaccuracies can be caught before publication”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Being reviewed by your peers is still the gold standard (who else can review your work?)” </em><strong>Julia Sanchez-Garrido</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In a similar fashion, the aspects that they disliked were also centered around reviewers but this time mentioning the bad aspects that can stem from the anonymous status of reviewers, such as being unfair, letting a bias (conscious or unconscious) influence their judgement or suggesting unnecessary changes that might even be wrong. The commercial aspect of the system was also mentioned as a negative trait: “<em>I dislike the peer-review model of some commercial journals, who charge expensive article processing fees (including open-access charges) from researchers, build paywalls for readers, and ask researchers to review articles for free,</em>” said Clemens Falker-Gieske.</p>
<p>My next question prompted them to identify what changes they would implement if they had the chance to do so.</p>
<p><strong> If you had a magic wand and could change anything/everything about the current peer review system, what would you change?</strong></p>
<p>Here again the answers were homogenous and similar changes were suggested. The need for better acknowledgment of the work accomplished by the reviewer was an important concern, along with how this work should be publicly displayed &#8211; similarly to platform such as <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> in order to serve as evidence to advance the career of reviewers. Yu Wan stated: “<em>If a researcher&#8217;s academic contribution is measured by the number and quality of papers that they have published, the researcher&#8217;s contribution to peer review should also be recognized in the same way</em>.” He then went on to add: “<em>I would also promote open/transparent peer review, with reviewers&#8217; comments, names, affiliations shown (with reviewers&#8217; consent) when the paper gets published. Reviewers often play an essential role in improving the paper&#8217;s quality and therefore, their contributions should be recognized as fairly as authors.”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Reviewers often play an essential role in improving the paper&#8217;s quality and therefore, their contributions should be recognized as fairly as authors.” </em><strong>Yu Wan</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A second change that was mentioned several times was the need for more transparency, better rules or guidelines around the peer review process, or even training courses for reviewers as suggested by Tripathy and Sanchez-Garrido to ensure that researchers are aware of predatory journals and ensure that: “<em>the effort and time invested in the review is worthwhile for the field.”</em> Falker-Gieske also mentioned that the lack of clear rules around what is needed for a paper to be accepted can lead to a feeling of randomness for the researchers: “<em>Often it appears quite random if a paper is accepted or rejected because it 100% depends on the assessment of the reviewers and the editor, which usually is a team of only 3 persons.</em>”</p>
<p>Tsai also added that: <em>“agreeing on a formalized acceptable revision plan based on a consensus between the editors and all of the reviewers of what experiments may be required for revisions would greatly benefit authors.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Several of the participants actually anticipated my next question, which was centered around transparent peer review.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the recent changes such as transparent peer review? Do you like this principle and would you like to see more of it?</strong></p>
<p>A very strong &#8220;yes&#8221; was received from all the participants, which was heartening, as transparent peer review is becoming increasingly more present and is already the norm at many journals.</p>
<p>They liked the fact that the history of the review of a manuscript is now accessible and allows a better understanding of the manuscript and a deeper dive. Many ECRs mentioned that they would like to see more transparent review and that all journals should adopt it. The fact that it contributes to research integrity was also mentioned and Tripathy added that: “<em>knowing that their reviews will be public might motivate reviewers to be more thorough and constructive in their feedback,</em>” and then went on to say that “<em>transparency can boost public trust in the scientific process by demonstrating the scrutiny under which studies are evaluated before publication</em>.”</p>
<p>However, Sanchez-Garrido also discussed issues that can stem from open peer review: “<em>On the other hand I would say open peer review, where the reviewer’s identities are revealed, can be problematic as it has the potential to lead to resentment and/or gratefulness towards specific individuals. In my opinion the process should be anonymous in both directions, to also avoid </em><i>favoritism.</i>”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Agreeing on a formalized acceptable revision plan based on a consensus between the editors and all of the reviewers of what experiments may be required for revisions would greatly benefit authors.</em>” <strong>Stephanie Tsai</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>My next question focused more on the future of peer review.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the future of peer review? Do you think the current model will continue <em>ad eternum</em> or do you foresee changes?</strong></p>
<p>Different points of view were shared here. Sanchez-Garrido mentioned that “<em>we have yet to find a better system that works as well and that is sustainable.</em>” Falker-Gieske mentioned the problems of “<em>fake AI-generated papers</em>” and how “<em>the detection of fake results should be the top priority, since fake results in medicine already cost lives.” </em>Tsai hoped for more transparent peer review and “<em>policies to reduce individual reviewer biases such as double blinded review.</em>” Wan stated that “<em>the current model of peer review is not sustainable given the increasing pressure that researchers are facing and therefore, changes must be taken.”</em> Tripathy added:<em> “it&#8217;s clear that the demands of the modern scientific community, combined with technological advancements, will drive changes. The ultimate goal will always be to uphold the quality, integrity, and advancement of scientific knowledge.”</em></p>
<p>My next question was then centered around artificial intelligence (AI) and what they thought of employing it.</p>
<p><strong> What do you think about the inclusion of artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT in the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>The general response was that caution was required with the use of AI and how its use, if permitted, should be limited. Sanchez-Garrido said that she did not think it had reached a stage where it could be used but that it would likely be used in the future. Falker-Gieske mentioned that it could be used for quality checks: language, plagiarism, authenticity. Tsai cautiously stated: “<em>completely removing the scientist would be less than ideal given how peer review is critical for assessing the quality of research being published and the reality of reviewer experiments (time, feasibility etc.).”</em> Wang had a similar answer and mentioned it should be used with caution but that “<em>AI would be a powerful tool for checking plagiarism and image manipulations or to assist reviewers in summarizing the work or searching for relevant publications.</em>” He also added that “<em>human&#8217;s expertise, experience, and accountability will always be pivotal in peer review,</em>” a point that was also made by Tripathy: “<em>the human touch – the expertise, intuition, and critical thinking that researchers bring to the table – will remain invaluable.</em>”</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Transparency can boost public trust in the scientific process by demonstrating the scrutiny under which studies are evaluated before publication</em>.”<strong> Partha Sarathi Tripathy</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I went on to ask them about what changes would be implemented in the next 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think the peer review system will be like 10 years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Tripathy and Sanchez-Garrido postulated on a Hybrid Review System combining human experts in the field with AI use at the initial steps in order to streamline the process. They also mentioned an increase in transparent review, as did Tsai.</p>
<p>My next question was to ask them what changes they would implement if they had the choice.</p>
<p><strong> How would you like it to be if it were up to you?</strong></p>
<p>Sanchez-Garrido answered that she “<em>would like junior researchers to get more of a chance to see how the publishing process goes and get involved in reviewing.</em>” Falker-Gieske added “<em>more transparent, fair and comparable between journals.</em>” Tsai suggested that “<em>editors and reviewers altogether discuss the manuscript in question at the end of their review briefly to come up with a plan for what they envision being required for revisions.</em>”</p>
<p>Wang suggested key points: “<em>1. Fair and transparent review models. 2. Diverse and effective motivations for reviewers. 3. Recognition of peer review in researcher&#8217;s promotion processes and grant applications. 4. Use of AI review assistants.” </em>Finally Tripathy added that “<em>Platforms might emerge that give reviewers formal credit for their contributions, possibly even considering reviews as a form of scholarly output.</em>”</p>
<p>And to conclude I asked them if they had any further comments.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>The detection of fake results should be the top priority, since fake results in medicine already cost lives.” </em><strong>Clemens Falker-Gieske</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you have any comments/advice to give us (BMC/Springer Nature) about the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>An encouraging comment from Sanchez-Garrido: “<em>I like the fact that transparent peer review has become the norm!</em>”; a recommendation from Falker-Gieske: “<em>Make sure editors keep an eye on the quality of reviewer reports.</em>”; and a request from Tripathy: “<em>the system needs to be a faster and accurate.</em>”</p>
<p>To conclude, I feel very hopeful after writing this interview piece. When I set out with the plan to conduct these interviews, I did not know what to expect, whether anyone would actually be interested to share their opinion with me and whether they would be worth reading. It has been so refreshing and helpful to collect all these opinions and write this blog. ECRs have many useful ideas and suggestions and they care! As long as we, publishers, editors and the likes, keep the dialog open, I am confident that we will work together towards a bright future for peer review!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pedestrian-stops-police-civilian-encounters">Curbing pedestrian stops might not reduce police-civilian encounters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Any encounter between police and civilians has the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">potential to go awry</a> (<em>SN: 11/17/21</em>). Stop and frisk, where police pat down pedestrians suspected of carrying contraband, can be particularly fraught, leading to some efforts to limit the practice.</p>



<p>But simply curbing foot stops may not reduce the likelihood of such contentious encounters, suggests a case study of Chicago. A steep decline in pedestrian stops in the Windy City eight years ago <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh3017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coincided with a lasting spike in traffic stops</a>, researchers report September 29 in <em>Science Advances. </em>While the rate of pedestrian stops plummeted by roughly 80 percent over five months in 2015, the rate of traffic stops grew by about the same amount over the next few years.</p>





<p>“This is a really dramatic shift in police activity,” says political scientist Dorothy Kronick of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>The analysis doesn’t prove that the change in pedestrian stops caused the subsequent spike in traffic stops; nor does it delve into the implications of the change. The Chicago Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>But the data do suggest that studying a single change might not tell the whole story about police tactics, the researchers say. “We want to … think about the way that police agencies or other government agencies are going to respond strategically to these changes,” says Kronick, who coauthored the study with Berkeley immigration and criminal law expert David Hausman.</p>



<p>Stop-and-frisk policing peaked in popularity in the United States during the 1990s and early 2000s before declining in the 2010s as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/policing/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/police/paac098/6989602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the practice’s ill effects became clear</a>, researchers noted in January in <em>Policing: A Journal of Policy and Practice.</em> Officers disproportionately targeted Black and other minority populations, the practice reduced well-being among affected residents and crime did not drop by as much as expected.</p>



<p>Pedestrian stops plummeted in New York City from roughly 700,000 stops in 2011 to fewer than 25,000 stops in 2015 — a 97 percent drop. In 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois released a report showing that the rate of pedestrian stops in Chicago <a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/publications/2015-stop-and-frisk-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was quadruple that of pre-reform New York City</a>. That report prompted the Chicago police to require more stringent documentation of pedestrian stops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A stop that might have taken two or three minutes now took 20 with the appropriate paperwork,” administrators for Second City Cop, an anonymous blogging site for Chicago police officers, explained in an email to <em>Science News</em>.</p>



<p>The impact of that policy change was stark: As of August 2015, Chicago officers were stopping more than 20 pedestrians for every 100 Chicagoans per year, the new study reports. Five months later, that rate had dropped to less than 4 out of 100. The proportion of Black civilians stopped remained the same, at about 60 to 70 percent.</p>



<p>Traffic stops over the next four years, meanwhile, climbed. In 2016, Chicago officers were stopping roughly 3 drivers out of every 100 residents per year. Three years later, they were stopping roughly 22 out of 100, Kronick and Hausman report. The demographics of stopped drivers shifted, from 45 percent Black in 2016 to 60 percent Black in 2019.</p>



<p>Police beats once marked by pedestrian stops saw the greatest increase in traffic stops, the authors note. They did not observe a similar jump in traffic stops among Illinois State Police, whose jurisdiction partially overlaps with the Chicago police, or among neighboring suburban police departments.</p>



<p>The findings don’t surprise criminologist Wesley G. Skogan, who observed the same substitution while researching his 2022 book, <em>Stop &amp; Frisk and the Politics of Crime in Chicago</em>. “When you work with the data, you certainly notice the shift from one to the other,” says Skogan, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “The crux of this paper is that policing strategies are to a certain degree fungible, that is, you can switch from one to the other.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>Police pedestrian stops in Chicago, indicated by the black line, plummeted in late 2015 (shaded). That coincided with a sharp and lasting increase in traffic stops, shown by the blue line.

Hausman and D. Kronick/<em>Science Advances </em>2023</span><span class="credit desktop-credit wp-credit-3131925">D. Hausman and D.

<p>Showing cause and effect, however, is tricky. In the new study, Kronick and Hausman draw on posts and comments on Second City Cop suggesting that officers understood that they were supposed to make this substitution.</p>



<p>Current blog administrators concur, noting that the shift to traffic stops seemed like a clear change in policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an observational study, the methodology is sound, says criminologist David Weisburd of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. Ruling out all the underlying reasons for the switch is impossible, though. For instance, were there other changes within the police department that led to this shift in priorities? Were residents demanding proactive policies to thwart crime?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the dramatic rise in traffic stops alone raises questions, Weisburd says. “Why would you switch to traffic stops that have the same problems for the public and greater safety problems for police officers?”</p>



<p>Evidence for similar substitutions in other cities is scant. But the push for proactive policing to thwart crime suggests this sort of switch may not be unusual.</p>



<p>“From research, we know that proactive policing is really the best way to manage crime and manage problems in communities,” says criminologist William Sousa of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. But the line between problematic stop-and-frisk practices and proactive policing, where police increase surveillance in high-crime neighborhoods to keep residents safe, can be fuzzy, he says.</p>



<p>And how to prevent racial profiling in proactive policing remains a thorny question. For instance, the authors of the new study cite a 2019 news story in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> describing how the city’s police drastically increased driver stops to root out people carrying guns or drugs. As with antagonistic foot stops, police disproportionately targeted Black civilians, leading one lawyer to dub the practice “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-traffic-stops-20190124-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop and frisk in a car</a>.”</p>



<p>The study raises many questions, including about the generalizability of the findings, why this switch occurred and, crucially, whether the shift reduced problems associated with pedestrian stops, Hausman says. But it illuminates why looking at a single change in police tactics could cause researchers and policy makers to miss whether the change worked as intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s important to take this first step,” Hausman says. “It’s very easy to assume that reducing this particular type of police-civilian interaction will reduce police-civilian interactions overall.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-mix-frogs-heat-microbiome">The right bacterial mix could help frogs take the heat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of a green frog’s heat tolerance might come from its microbiome.</p>



<p>Put a wood frog tadpole and a green frog tadpole in water and turn up the heat. The two species live in similar environments, but green frog tadpoles just keep swimming in water that’s up to 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer.</p>



<p>But when scientists transferred the gut microbiome of a green frog (<em>Lithobates clamitans</em>) to the eggs of a wood frog (<em>L. sylvaticus</em>), the wood frog larvae <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.07.556683v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could handle short stints at higher water temperatures</a>, Jason Dallas and colleagues report September 7 on bioRxiv.org. The study reveals one reason some species might be more, or less, sensitive to climate change.</p>





<p>Green frogs and wood frogs are closely related but lead different lives. Wood frogs go from egg to adult in only three months in the spring. Green frog larvae can remain as tadpoles through the whole summer, swimming in higher water temperatures as a result. Dallas, a herpetologist at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, was particularly interested in the frogs’ critical thermal maxima — the hottest temperature at which the animal can continue to move.</p>



<p>“Amphibians [and] reptiles are globally imperiled, but still remain understudied,” Dallas says, and it’s not clear just how their microbiomes contribute to how they live their lives. To find out what role the microbiome might play in frog temperature tolerance, Dallas headed out to a local wetland in early spring in search of wood frog eggs. Timing is key. “They’ll breed, and it’ll all be over in basically one or two nights,” he says. “The next day you go, [and] there’s hundreds of egg masses, if not thousands.”</p>



<p>Dallas scooped a few egg masses into a large plastic tub and drove back to campus. Slowly. “You go a little bit slow, which the other drivers may not appreciate but the wood frogs like.” Back at the lab, he and his colleagues washed the eggs in an antibiotic solution to rid them of their own microbiome and inoculated some of them with gut bacteria from green frogs.</p>



<p>When the eggs hatched, the tadpoles ate a little of their egg jelly — gaining a dose of pond water or green frog bacteria in the process. Dallas found that those who had received a dose of green frog gut bacteria could take short periods of water heated to 38.3° C, while those inoculated with their normal pond water or no bacteria at all topped out at 37.7° C. When the researchers analyzed the microbiomes of the larvae, they found that larvae inoculated with green frog bacteria had more diverse microbiomes.&nbsp;</p>

Dallas</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The temperature difference is small, but could be meaningful, says Timothy Colston, a herpetologist at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez who was not involved in the study. “Even 1 degree of difference over a short period of time, if that gives you an advantage to being able to survive and reproduce, then that&#8217;s going to increase your fitness,” he says.</p>



<p>How exactly a frog’s microbiome helps the animals take more heat remains a bit of a mystery. The right bacterial population could be good for the frog’s overall health. If they’re protected, say from viruses or fungal infections, they might be better able to resist a heatwave or two, Colston says. Gut microbes could also affect how a frog’s metabolism functions, or whether and how they express proteins that resist heat.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s probably a lot of cellular mechanisms and other mechanisms in play,” Dallas says. Certainly, this is not an excuse to go around dosing frog populations with bacteria during heatwaves; he and his colleagues were only able to identify broad groups of microbes involved. But it does show one way that some frogs might get hot — or not — in the face of climate change.</p>

<p>The editor in chief, managing editors, and entire editorial board of a mathematics journal all resigned earlier this year following a dispute with their publisher over special issues and article volume. </p>



<p>Changes the publisher wanted to make to the journal “would have the effect of jeopardizing scientific integrity for the sake of financial gain,” the editors wrote in their announcement of their resignations, which took place on January 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass resignation at the <em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics</em>, previously published by the <a href="https://www.aimsciences.org/index/AboutAIMS">American Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> (AIMS), is one of at least five such collective actions journal editors took in 2023, according to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">list Retraction Watch has compiled</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former editors have started a new journal named <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/gm"><em>Geometric Mechanics</em></a> with World Scientific. </p>



<span id="more-127952"></span>



<p>The editors’ announcement, which was emailed to a few colleagues, stated that AIMS “introduced numerous special issues with no consultation with, nor control from, the Editor-in-Chief nor the Editorial Board,” and “insisted that the Board increase by five-fold the number of published papers over the next few years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the managing editors tried negotiating with the publisher “their attempts were largely ignored,” according to the announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5V0GD7IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Manuel de Leon</a>, the editor in chief, told us AIMS had made the journal open access with author fees without consulting the editorial board. In addition to increasing the number of accepted papers, AIMS was giving non-specialist staff editors some control over publications and requiring the editors to publish submitted and accepted papers within two months, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors perceived that the two-month period for submission to publication was “pressure to sacrifice the integrity of the editorial process to increase the number of accepted papers,” de Leon said. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As the Editorial Board, we felt that these new operational and editorial policies for the journal were not commensurate with our view of how to run JGM for the benefit of the geometric mechanics community—and the mathematical community as a whole—by maintaining the highest standards of quality and academic integrity.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The old <a href="http://aimspress.com/journal/jgm"><em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics</em></a> is now named <em>Communications in Analysis and Mechanics</em>, and has a new <a href="http://aimspress.com/cam/news/solo-detail/editorialboard">editorial board</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>De Leon said AIMS was operating “under directorship” of <a href="https://math.missouristate.edu/profile-display.aspx?p=shu">Shouchuan Hu</a>, an emeritus faculty member at Missouri State University in Springfield. Hu is the registered agent for <a href="https://bsd.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/BusinessEntityDetail.aspx?ID=3878143&amp;page=beSearch">AIMS, LLC</a>, a limited liability company based in Missouri.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hu told us the editors’ version of events was “untrue.” But in his correspondence with editorial board members, which he shared with Retraction Watch, he described the planned shift to open access and increased publication volume target as changes to make the journal financially sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email sent to board members after their resignations, Hu wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It appears there might be a communicational [sic] issue between us.&nbsp; Therefore, please view the following facts:</p>



<p>1. the journal has been around for 14 years;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. the journal has 52 editors&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. the journal publishes about 20 articles each year;&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. the journal has less than 10 subscriptions in total;&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. thus the publishing model is not sustainable financially;&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. the trend of journal transformation is weeping the entire industry;&nbsp;</p>



<p>7. thus, we need to follow the trend to develop the journal into Open Access, sooner or later;&nbsp;</p>



<p>8. it has been offered that all papers recruited by any board member will be APC waived;&nbsp;</p>



<p>9. all special issues papers arranged by any board members will be APC waived.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hu also wrote that since some of the journal’s editors had published their work in <em>Mathematics</em>, an open access publication from MDPI, “this approach should be acceptable.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If for any reason you should feel that we modify the approach to make it work better, please let me know. We can also offer the possibility of moving the journal back to be a regular publication again, no more Open Access, if the majority feel it might be a better alternative after the miscommunication is clarified.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In comments to Retraction Watch, Hu said de Leon had published in <em>Mathematics</em>, “therefore, he accepts the model of OA clearly.”</p>



<p>De Leon has not responded to our follow-up request for comment on Hu’s claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email de Leon wrote to Hu last September that Hu shared with us, de Leon elaborated on his concerns, emphasizing the importance “that no quality paper cannot be published because the authors do not have the funds to pay the [open access fee].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Today I saw that there are two special issues to be published in the JGM. This is the first news I have of this; and we cannot work like this. There cannot be a JGM parallel to the current one, every paper or special issue must be previously approved by the director and the managing editors, and the consultation to the editor or editors who are closer to the topics of those papers or special issues. And it must be us, with the help of the EB members, who indicate the referees for each paper. Because if this is not done, all the work of these 15 years will be thrown away, and we will have lost all the prestige we have gained. It is no longer a problem of economics, of [open access], it is a problem of quality and procedures in the publication process. Without the usual standards in mathematics journals that have a prestige of years, the JGM cannot be continued.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Sure, I agree with you in principle,” Hu’s reply began. He continued:&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, as we agreed we need to target about publication of 100 papers next year and the cycle from submission to publication should be within 2 months. Thus, there needs to be a much better communication and efficiency.&nbsp; We will make sure the in house staff editors communicate with you and the board timely, but they need instructions and feedback from the board in days, not weeks, in order for them to perform. Therefore, they should be given some flexibility.&nbsp; Otherwise, the targets next year will not be achieved, and the journal will not be sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We of course do not wish to create a JGM within JGM.&nbsp; We just need to follow others on how to develop an OA journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another follow up, Hu told de Leon he “did not realize that the solicited two special issues are causing an alarm till now,” and “we should then stop the two issues from further development.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hu also wrote that “any future actions should be under your supervision,” and asked de Leon to confer with other board members to develop ideas for potential special issues and contributors, which staff editors for the publisher would handle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After several more emails from Hu, de Leon responded that he was busy with meetings and a student defending his doctoral thesis, and wanted “to think quietly about the future of the JGM.” He proposed meeting over Zoom, as Hu had suggested, in October.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next email in the chain, dated December 7, Hu wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am sure we could iron out our differences and move forward when we have a talk.&nbsp; I don’t feel like intervening with the editorial structure of the journal unless I have to.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On December 26, Hu sent another email complaining de Leon had not replied to him. He called the journal “dysfunctional,” and said he “may intervene if this dysfunction should continue into 2023.” He reiterated an earlier invitation for de Leon to speak at an upcoming AIMS conference, and proposed a meeting at the conference “so that we can try to come up with a working plan for the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weeks later, de Leon and the rest of the editorial board resigned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/j.montaldi/">James Montaldi</a>, a reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester and formal editorial board member, told us the previous <em>Journal of Geometric Mechanics </em>“was a specialized journal which reported much of the best material in the area,” and published special issues proposed and curated by members of the editorial board (rather than the publisher).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The journal worked well from an academic point of view before,” he said, and “we had enough warning of the changes to all resign before they were realized.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-computer-volcanism-killed-dinosaurs-asteroid">New computer analysis hints volcanism killed the dinosaurs, not an asteroid</a></h4>

              
                <p>For decades, scientists have vigorously debated whether an asteroid strike or massive volcanic eruptions ended the reign of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Roughly three-quarters of all life on Earth, including all nonbird dinosaurs, went extinct at that time, putting a dramatic end to the Cretaceous Period.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have devised a new way to identify the true dino killer: Let computers take a crack at it.</p>



<p>The result of that computational effort suggests that massive bursts of gas produced by the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh3875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deccan Traps eruptions were solely capable of causing the extinction event</a>, the team reports in the Sept. 29 <em>Science</em>. Those eruptions, which lasted roughly a million years, spewed massive amounts of gas-ridden lava across what’s now western India.</p>





<p>“Rather than come at it from the perspective of ‘let’s blame the volcanoes and explain why’ or ‘let’s blame asteroids and explain why,’” the goal was to have as little human input or bias in the process as possible, says Dartmouth computational geologist Alexander Cox.</p>



<p>The idea was to work backward using evidence from the scene of the crime. Scientists do have a smoking gun: Cores drilled into deep-ocean sediments contain geologic data pointing to deadly bursts of gas to the atmosphere, particularly planet-warming carbon dioxide and ocean-acidifying sulfur dioxide.</p>



<p>But such gases could have come from the asteroid strike, as it incinerated rocks on the planet’s surface, Cox says, or from the Deccan Traps eruptions.</p>



<p>Previous efforts to understand the source of the gases have focused on timing, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dueling-dates-volcanic-eruption-debate-dinosaurs-death">examining pulses of lava emplacement during the Deccan Traps</a> eruptions, Cox says (<em>SN:</em> <em>2/21/19</em>). But “we only have best guesses about how much initial gas was in [the lava].” Estimated carbon dioxide concentrations in the lava, for example, vary by an order of magnitude, he says. “So that’s why we approached this from a gas-emissions perspective rather than a lava-flow perspective.”</p>

<p>To disentangle the relative contributions of each potential culprit, Cox and Dartmouth geologist C. Brenhin Keller used a statistical model called a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. That approach systematically considers the probability of different scenarios of gas emissions from the different sources, converging toward possible solutions as the results of the simulations move closer and closer to geologic observations.</p>



<p>What made the researchers’ approach particularly powerful is that they harnessed 128 different processors to run scenarios in parallel, Cox says. “All the processors then compared how they’re doing at the end of every model run, like classmates comparing answers.” That parallel computing meant that computations that would otherwise have taken a year took only a few days.</p>



<p>The observations Cox and Keller used were data collected from three cores drilled into deep-sea sediments, each spanning 67 million to 65 million years ago. In those sediments are foraminifera, ocean-dwelling microorganisms whose carbonate shells contain different isotopes, or forms, of carbon and oxygen. The shells’ chemical makeup records the ocean chemistry at the time of their formation, and so <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-gas-bursts-probably-didnt-kill-off-the-dinosaurs">can be used as a proxy to infer past global temperatures as well as how many creatures were thriving in the oceans</a>, and how much carbon was moving between the atmosphere, ocean and land (<em>SN: 1/16/20</em>).</p>



<p>The computer simulations determined that the amount of gas spewed into the atmosphere from the volcanism alone was enough to account for the changes in temperature and carbon cycling determined from the foraminifera data in the drill cores.</p>



<p>As for the asteroid strike, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">formed the massive Chicxulub crater in what’s now Mexico</a>, it probably did not produce a big spike in carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide, the analysis found (<em>SN: 1/25/17</em>).</p>





<p>But many scientists are not convinced that these findings provide the ultimate answer to this long-standing, complex question. “It’s an elegant way to address this problem,” says Sierra Petersen, a geochemist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Modeling in this way “gives the freedom to find the consensus solution, taking multiple proxy records into account. However, like any model, output depends on input.”</p>



<p>Petersen notes that foraminifera shells are not an ideal proxy for ancient temperatures: The oxygen isotope ratios in foraminifera shells can change not only due to temperature but also due to seawater composition. Different temperature proxies would likely lead to different patterns of gas release reproduced in models, Petersen says.</p>



<p>As for the mass extinction culprit, she adds, “it’s a bit of a leap to say that this study shows the impact didn’t cause the extinction. I think what they show is that the impact was likely not associated with a large [gas] release.” But the asteroid, she says, still could have had other deadly impacts on the planet’s environment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, “the Chicxulub impact led to many devastating effects beyond the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions explored in this study,” says Clay Tabor, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.</p>



<p>Those include massive clouds of soot and dust kicked up from pulverized rocks due to the impact, he says. Previous research has suggested this dust may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-impact-volcanism-earth-dinosaurs-deccan-mass-extinction">dimmed the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth</a> by as much as 20 percent, inducing a frigid winter that swiftly killed off plants and destroyed habitats (<em>SN: 7/17/20</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, the new study suggests that the asteroid impact didn’t have a long-term effect on the planet’s carbon cycle, based on carbon isotope data recorded in the foraminifera shells for the million years after the extinction. But there was an abrupt drop in the abundance of those creatures corresponding to the time of the impact, Tabor says. “The rapid rate of change caused by the Chicxulub impact was likely responsible for its effects on life.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Many geochemical records spanning the [extinction event], as well as this modeling work, cannot capture well the rates of change associated with the Chicxulub impact,” he says. “The impact may have released significantly less CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> than the Deccan Traps, but it did so almost instantaneously.” So even if the asteroid impact released fewer gases overall, Tabor says, the speediness of that release could have been devastating all the same.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-sticking-skin-surfaces">How a deadly fungus is so good at sticking to skin and other surfaces</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Candida auris</em>, a fungus that causes sometimes deadly infections, can stick to almost any surface.</p>



<p>In hospitals, “it&#8217;s very tenacious, very difficult to get rid of and ends up on all the surfaces around patients,” where it can fuel outbreaks, says Darian Santana, a microbiologist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. The fungus has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-deadly-fungus-drug-resistance">spreading rapidly</a> since cases first emerged in several locations around the world in 2012 (<em>SN: 3/20/23</em>).</p>





<p>Santana and colleagues have discovered how the fungi stick to a wide variety of surfaces. Most fungi make adhesive proteins that rely on hydrophobic interactions to glom onto surfaces. Think oil and water, says Teresa O’Meara, a microbiologist and geneticist in whose lab Santana works. Oil droplets congregate with other oil droplets, while water is attracted to water. Similarly, hydrophobic fungal proteins attach themselves to hydrophobic, or water-repellent, surfaces.</p>



<p><em>C. auris</em> has hydrophobic adhesion proteins too, but it mainly <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf8972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pastes itself to surfaces</a> using electrical charges, the researchers report in the Sept. 29 <em>Science</em>. The fungus makes protein called SCF1, which contains many positively charged amino acids. The positive charge creates attraction with negative charges on surfaces, including skin and medical devices. It’s similar to the way barnacles stick to boats, Santana says.</p>



<p>The protein allowed the fungus to infect skin samples and colonize catheters in the lab, the team found. Without SCF1, the fungus was unable to spread in infected mice. </p>



<p>The finding may eventually lead to new ways to prevent or treat <em>C. auris</em> infections, O’Meara says. For instance, treatments may turn off production of the protein to prevent the fungus from spreading more widely in infected people, or a vaccine or antibody might stop the fungus from binding to surfaces and head off illness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-images-cosmos-universe-hubble-constant-tension">New JWST images suggest our understanding of the cosmos is flawed</a></h4>

              
                <p>The greatest puzzle in cosmology just got even more puzzling.</p>



<p>Images from the James Webb Space Telescope have confirmed that the universe appears to be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15806.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding significantly faster</a> than it should be, researchers report in a study accepted in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. The observation is in conflict with an esteemed theory, the standard model of cosmology, that describes how the universe has evolved since the first moments after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>The conflict comes down to calculations of the Hubble constant, a number that describes how fast everything in the universe is flying apart. One calculation, based on Planck satellite observations of the oldest light in the universe in conjunction with the standard model of cosmology, suggests the Hubble constant is 67.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec (a megaparsec is about 3 million light-years). Hubble Space Telescope images of stars at various distances from us provide a fundamentally incompatible value — 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec.</p>





<p>The discrepancy is known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">Hubble tension</a>, and new JWST data hasn’t done anything to ease it (<em>SN: 7/30/19)</em>. The telescope took images of the same stars as the Hubble telescope and calculated a very similar Hubble constant. Although the Planck number disagrees from the Hubble telescope and JWST number by less than 10 percent, the discrepancy in the measurements implies that there’s something terribly wrong with our understanding of the universe. Unless an error turns up in one of the measurements, it will take strange new physics to explain the tension.</p>



<p>“Papers in the literature over the last 10 years have invoked anything from weird dark matter to weird dark energy, to another [exotic] particle, to a magnetic field in the early universe to a new field, all kinds of things” to explain the Hubble tension, says cosmologist Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins University.</p>



<p>Some of these explanations “look semi-successful, some of them look like failures, some of them would cause other problems,” he says. Developing a theory that might resolve the tension “is still very much in the skunkworks [or extremely speculative] stage of trying to understand what [the tension] could mean.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">JWST looks to the stars to calculate the Hubble constant</h4>



<p>With the Hubble telescope and JWST, astronomers calculate the Hubble constant by observing flashing stars known as Cepheid variables. The stars flare up periodically at rates that indicate how much light they’re putting out. Comparing a star’s brightness in telescope images with its expected brightness, based on the flare-up rates, gives a measure of the distance to the stars. Shifts in the color of the light coming from the stars reveal how fast they’re moving. Combining distance and speed observations of Cepheid stars leads to a measure of the expansion of the universe.</p>



<p>But Cepheid variable stars tend to sit deep inside galaxies, surrounded by crowds of other stars. That can make it difficult to get good measurements of the Cepheids’ speeds and locations. One simple resolution for the Hubble tension could have been that the Hubble telescope measurements were simply off.</p>



<p>Enter JWST, which can peer through the stellar crowds to clearly make out the color and brightness of Cepheid variables. The higher-resolution JWST images provide data with dramatically lower uncertainties and reduced confusion with nearby stars than the Hubble telescope could manage. The result: The Hubble telescope measurements have been right all along, Riess and colleagues report in their new paper.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>This study alone isn’t enough to convince astronomer Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago. The two galaxies studied are comparatively close to us, on cosmic scales, with the farthest one about 75 million light-years away, she notes. The relative proximity makes it easier to pick out the Cepheids from the stellar crowds. Freedman suspects it will be harder to distinguish Cepheids from the crowds of surrounding stars in more distant galaxies, even with JWST.</p>



<p>“The problem is only going to be worse,” Freedman says. “Because the resolution, it gets worse as you go to a higher distance.” For very distant galaxies, she suspects, stars could appear too close together to pick out the Cepheids from neighboring stars, even for JWST. As a result, &nbsp;Freedman says that Riess’ confirmation of the higher Hubble constant may crumble with analysis of more distant Cepheids.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">JWST’s images leave the Hubble tension untouched</h4>



<p>Hints that the measurements might hold up at larger distances arose in a Sept. 12 presentation at a conference in Baltimore dedicated to the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/events/stsci/2023/september/the-first-year-of-jwst-science-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first year of JWST science</a>. Riess showed preliminary Cepheid data from four more galaxies. One of them is 140 million light-years away — among the most distant galaxies in the Hubble telescope Cepheid studies. JWST data from those stars also line up with the Hubble telescope measurements. Although still awaiting peer review, the images strongly suggest that the JWST has indeed overcome the uncertainties that resulted when light from Cepheids got mixed up with light from nearby stars in the lower resolution Hubble telescope images.</p>





<p>University of Cambridge astrophysicist George Efstathiou, who was not involved in the study, is both convinced that Riess has gotten the measurements right and confounded by the implications. “When they showed me all of that [data],” Efstathiou says, “my reaction was, ‘Well, you know, I&#8217;m stumped.’”</p>



<p>Efstathiou is a member of the Planck satellite collaboration, which studied the oldest light in the universe, called the cosmic microwave background, and found the lower value for the expansion of the universe. The satellite’s calculation is based on images of the patterns in light from the early universe. Together with the standard model of cosmology, the images show that the universe is expanding with a Hubble constant that’s lower than the JWST measurement by about 5.6 kilometers per second per megaparsec.</p>



<p>As it stands, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with the Planck measurement of the Hubble constant or with the JWST observations. The tension between the measurements points a finger at the standard model of cosmology as the problem. But the standard model also appears to be unimpeachable; it’s withstood numerous other challenges without breaking down. The model came about in part due to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-acceleration-discovery-wins-physics-nobel">discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe</a>, which earned Riess and others a Nobel Prize in physics (<em>SN: 10/4/11</em>). The revelation was a key piece in shaping the model to include dark matter, dark energy and other factors, making it the simplest theory that can accurately describe the universe.</p>



<p>Now, though, Riess’ Cepheid-based studies of the Hubble constant show that there’s still more to learn.</p>



<p>“This is a crack, or a surprise that doesn&#8217;t fit,” Riess says. “It&#8217;s left us more in a kind of confused or purgatory state.” The implication, he says, is “there&#8217;s a problem with the standard model. You can revise it, but we don&#8217;t know how to revise it, which direction or in what way.”</p>



<p>People shouldn’t mistake the tension over the Hubble tension as despair. “It&#8217;s more of an opportunity to learn something about the universe with these telescopes,” Riess says.</p>



<p>One possibility is completely new physics.</p>



<p>“If there&#8217;s new physics, that&#8217;d be fun,” Freedman says. “We&#8217;d all like to see something new and interesting&#8230;. Either way, I think it&#8217;s going to be an exciting result — either confirming the [standard] model or showing that there&#8217;s something still in the model that&#8217;s missing.”</p>

<p>Two anthropology organizations co-hosting a conference this fall have removed from the program a panel presentation entitled “Let’s Talk About Sex, Baby: Why biological sex remains a necessary analytic category in anthropology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel had been slated for the joint <a href="https://annualmeeting.americananthro.org/general-info/">annual meeting</a> of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and Canadian Anthropology Society (CASCA), to be held in Toronto in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-Panelist-Letter-1.pdf">letter</a> informing the panelists of the decision, Ramona Pérez and Monica Heller, presidents of the AAA and CASCA, respectively, wrote that the executive boards of the two groups had reviewed the submission “at the request of numerous members” and decided to remove it from the conference program. They wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127933"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This decision was based on extensive consultation and was reached in the spirit of respect for our values, the safety and dignity of our members, and the scientific integrity of the program(me). The reason the session deserved further scrutiny was that the ideas were advanced in such a way as to cause harm to members represented by the Trans and LGBTQI of the anthropological community as well as the community at large.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While there were those who disagree with this decision, we would hope they know their voice was heard and was very much a part of the conversation. It is our hope that we continue to work together so that we become stronger and more unified within each of our associations. Going forward, we will undertake a major review of the processes associated with vetting sessions at our annual meetings and will include our leadership in that discussion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pérez and Heller did not respond directly to our request for comment, but forwarded our message to an association spokesperson, who sent us a statement titled &#8220;<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230925-No-Place-For-Transphobia-in-Anthropology-1.pdf">No Place For Transphobia in Anthropology</a>.&#8221; The association writes, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The function of the “gender critical” scholarship advocated in this session, like the function of the “race science” of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, is to advance a “scientific” reason to question the humanity of already marginalized groups of people, in this case, those who exist outside a strict and narrow sex / gender binary.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The AAA/CASCA decision was a “shock,” according to an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Open_Letter_AAA_CASCA_Meeting_Cancellation-1.pdf">open letter</a> written by <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/klowrey">Kathleen Lowrey</a>, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta who organized the panel, and her co-panelists. In the letter, they said none of the panelists had heard from AAA or CASCA with any concerns about the panel until the letter notifying them of the decision to cancel the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They defended the content of the panel against what they said was the “false accusation” the ideas were harmful. The letter concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Your suggestion that our panel would somehow compromise “&#8230;the scientific integrity of the programme” seems to us particularly egregious, as the decision to anathematize our panel looks very much like an anti-science response to a politicized lobbying campaign. Had our panel been allowed to go forward, we can assure you that lively contestation would have been welcomed by the panelists and may even have occurred between us, as our own political commitments are diverse. Instead, your letter expresses the alarming hope that the AAA and CASCA will become “more unified within each of our associations” to avoid future debates. Most disturbingly, following other organizations, such as the Society for American Archaeology, the AAA and CASCA have promised that “Going forward, we will undertake a major review of the processes associated with vetting sessions at our annual meetings and will include our leadership in that discussion.” Anthropologists around the world will quite rightly find chilling this declaration of war on dissent and on scholarly controversy. It is a profound betrayal of the AAA’s principle of “advancing human understanding and applying this understanding to the world’s most pressing problems”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lowrey’s directory page at the University of Alberta states the institution “has reacted <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/06/12/from-south-american-anthropology-to-gender-crit-cancel-culture-my-strange-feminist-journey/">punitively</a> to my outspoken criticisms of trans activism and gender ideology.” In 2020, Lowrey was removed from an administrative role as associate chair of undergraduate programs for the department of anthropology, <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-professor-says-she-was-dismissed-over-views-that-biological-sex-trumps-transgender-identity-for-policy-decisions">which she attributed</a> to her views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowrey told us that several of the panelists had “spent quite a lot of money on travel arrangements, as the panel was accepted in July, and we were all stunned to receive the letter &#8220;removing&#8221; us on Monday.”</p>



<p>She said she was not aware of another instance when AAA or CASCA had removed a panel&nbsp; from the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowrey told us the implications of the cancellation were “quite unsettling”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The AAA is the largest professional association of anthropologists in the world, and the joint conference with CASCA (which happens every third year, I believe) is the Big Kahuna of anthropology conferences.&nbsp; I organized the panel in order to bring together two kinds of anthropologists concerned with the replacement of biological sex by &#8220;gender&#8221;:&nbsp; one the one hand, scholars like Elizabeth Weiss and Carole Hooven who have an interest in human evolution (for which sexual reproduction is a relevant process!) and on the other, scholars like Silvia Carrasco, Michele Sirois, and Kathleen Richardson who have an interest in feminist issues (for which sex based oppression is a relevant process!).&nbsp; I have interests in both domains, and thought it would be great to bring together scholars concerned for very different reasons with sex as a category of anthropological analysis in order to see where our concerns overlap and where they diverge.</p>



<p>I truly do not understand why anyone who disagrees with any of this wouldn&#8217;t simply turn up to the panel and engage us in discussion. That&#8217;s what conferences are for.&nbsp; I would be sincerely interested to hear AAA and CASCA representatives elaborate on why they think talking about biological sex is threatening and harmful to trans identified people or to what they term the &#8220;LGBTQI&#8221; community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kathleen-Lowrey-Panel-2023-AAA-CASCA-Prelim-Program_Final-1-1.pdf">panel description</a> contained this summary:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While it has become increasingly common in anthropology and public life to substitute &#8216;sex&#8217; with &#8216;gender&#8217;, there are multiple domains of research in which biological sex remains irreplaceably relevant to anthropological analysis. Contesting the transition from sex to gender in anthropological scholarship deserves much more critical consideration than it has hitherto received in major diciplinary [sic] fora like AAA / CASCA. This diverse international panel brings together scholars from socio-cultural anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology who describe why in their work gender is not helpful and only sex will do. This is particularly the case when the work is concerned with equity and the deep analysis of power, and which has as an aim the achievement of genuine inclusivity. With research foci from hominin evolution to contemporary artificial intelligence, from the anthropology of education to the debates within contemporary feminism about surrogacy, panelists make the case that while not all anthropologists need to talk about sex, baby, some absolutely do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lowrey added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The rise in anthropology of multiple schools of thought that cannot withstand any scrutiny, any challenge, or even sustained contentious inquiry, is a growing disaster for the entire discipline.&nbsp; I feel like I&#8217;m trying to shout that the bridge is out ahead and no one is listening.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very frustrating.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trilobite-fossil-hints-scavengers-ate">A one-of-a-kind trilobite fossil hints at what and how these creatures ate</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mysterious, prehistoric marine creature has spilled its guts. For the first time, scientists have unearthed a fossilized trilobite whose final meals were preserved within its digestive system.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Valéria Vaškaninová and colleagues discovered the partially digested meals when they looked at a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06567-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-resolution 3-D scan of <em>Bohemolichas incola</em></a>, a previously known but relatively rare trilobite species that lived 465 million years ago. The contents include fragments of thin-walled shells, bits of echinoderms (a group that includes modern-day sea urchins and starfish), and other bottom-dwellers small enough to be swallowed whole, the researchers report online September 27 in <em>Nature.</em></p>



<p>Many of the more than 20,000 described species of trilobites, a group that existed between 520 million and 252 million years ago, were prominent members of marine ecosystems. Some species may have even had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-trilobites-sported-dual-digestive-tracts">dual digestive tracts</a>, though <em>B. incola</em> did not (<em>SN: 10/31/14</em>). The new find not only provides direct evidence of what some trilobites may have eaten, but it also hints about their physiology and how they foraged.</p>

<p>Tightly packed clumps of shelly bits throughout the tubelike gut suggest that the trilobite fed almost continuously before it died, perhaps by scavenging the seafloor for broken remains of shelled creatures and digesting the soft tissues still attached to them. Trilobites typically didn’t have sturdy mouthparts and thus wouldn’t have had a powerful bite, says Vaškaninová, of Charles University in Prague.</p>



<p>And since the calcium-rich shells in the gut show no signs of being dissolved, the trilobite probably had a gut environment with an alkaline or neutral pH, Vaškaninová and colleagues suggest. That sort of biochemistry would have reduced the amount of dissolved calcium entering its bloodstream, which would be metabolically difficult to get rid of, the team proposes.</p>



<p>In a small bit of turnabout-is-fair-play, the scan also revealed that <em>B. incola</em>’s carcass had been scavenged by other organisms before fossilizing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-falls-down-matter-einsteins-gravity">Antimatter falls like matter, upholding Einstein’s theory of gravity</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s official: Antimatter falls down, not up.</p>



<p>In a first-of-its-kind experiment, scientists dropped antihydrogen atoms and watched them fall, showing that gravity attracts antimatter toward Earth, rather than repelling it.</p>



<p>The study confirms a pillar of Einstein’s general theory of relativity known as the weak equivalence principle. According to that principle, gravity pulls on every object in the same way, no matter what it’s made of. “This concept is at the heart of our comprehension of gravitation,” says physicist Ruggero Caravita, who was not involved with the new work.</p>





<p>Antimatter is the mirror image of matter, carrying the opposite electric charge but the same mass. An electron’s antiparticle, for example, is a positively charged particle called a positron. A proton’s alter ego is a negatively charged antiproton, and so on.</p>



<p>Most physicists didn’t seriously entertain the idea that antimatter could fall up instead of down, says Jeffrey Hangst of Aarhus University in Denmark. But scientists had never been able to directly test it before. “Antimatter is kind of mysterious … so we want to actually confirm that behavior,” says Hangst, who is the spokesperson for the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus, or ALPHA, collaboration, which reported the new result.</p>



<p>Not only did <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06527-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the antimatter fall as expected</a>, but it also dropped with roughly the same acceleration as normal matter, the team found.</p>



<p>The results, described in the Sept. 28 <em>Nature</em>, showcase scientists’ growing control over antimatter, and antihydrogen in particular. Antimatter is a wily substance that can be difficult to work with. If it touches anything made of matter — the walls of a storage container or molecules of air — it quickly annihilates. It has taken decades of work to measure any effect of gravity on antimatter at all, Hangst says.</p>



<p>In the experiment, performed at the European laboratory CERN near Geneva, scientists trapped antihydrogen atoms with strong magnetic fields. Those antihydrogen atoms were made by mixing antiprotons, created at CERN, with positrons from a radioactive source.</p>



<p>The researchers then released the antihydrogen from its magnetic cage, counting how many atoms went up versus down. If gravity treats antimatter and matter equally, most atoms should fall down, with a few flying upward due to the initial jostling motions of the atoms. That’s just what the researchers found.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Just like matter, antimatter falls under gravity’s pull | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnDXj_5Cb0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Researchers contained antihydrogen atoms within the ALPHA-g apparatus using magnetic fields. The team measured how the atoms fell when they were released. As the antimatter escaped, it hit the walls of the apparatus and annihilated. The researchers counted how many atoms went up and down by detecting those annihilations, as depicted in this animation. Most atoms went down, confirming that gravity pulls antimatter toward Earth, rather than repelling it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s a very nice, very neat and very simple concept,” says theoretical physicist Yunhua Ding of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>To further confirm that the antihydrogen behaved as expected, the researchers altered the magnetic fields to push atoms upward, canceling out gravity’s effect. In that test, roughly equal numbers of atoms went up and down. Further varying the magnetic fields likewise matched expectations.</p>



<p>Previous experiments already hinted that gravity treats matter and antimatter the same. In 2022, the BASE experiment, also at CERN, reported that oscillations of confined antiprotons indirectly confirmed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antiprotons-protons-matter-antimatter-differences-physics">matter and antimatter feel the same tug of gravity</a> (<em>SN: 1/5/22</em>). But ALPHA’s experiment is the first to directly observe antimatter particles falling.</p>





<p>The idea that different types of objects fall with the same acceleration far predates Einstein. Legend states that in the 16th century, Galileo dropped different objects off the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate this effect. Scientists have since tested it in a variety of situations, even with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-general-relativity-gravity-microscope-experiment">objects in orbit around Earth</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>). But they’d never done the test with antimatter until now.</p>



<p>Although physicists didn’t expect the antimatter to fall up, some researchers have proposed that antimatter may fall with a slightly different acceleration than normal matter. “If we find even the tiniest difference, this would be an indication that something new is happening,” says Caravita, of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Trento, Italy, who is the spokesperson of the AEgIS collaboration at CERN. AEgIS is one of a cadre of experiments there also working toward measuring gravity’s effect on antimatter.</p>



<p>The current experiment isn’t precise enough to suss out those subtle differences. But new techniques, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-cooled-antimatter-foundations-physics-einstein-gravity">cooling antihydrogen atoms with lasers</a>, could make future tests more precise (<em>SN: 4/5/21</em>). That could help scientists see, when it comes to matter and antimatter, whether gravity is truly agnostic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-ring-galaxies-eye-wallaby-space">This ‘polar ring’ galaxy looks like an eye. Others might be hiding in plain sight</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s big. It’s beautiful. It looks a bit like a sparkly, starry, slightly smooshed Eye of Sauron.</p>



<p>It’s the galaxy NGC 4632, and new radio telescope images suggest that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/525/3/4663/7264229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it sports a rare “polar ring”</a> — a halo of mostly hydrogen gas tilted about 90 degrees from the plane of the galaxy’s disk.</p>



<p>These spectacular structures, which can also contain dust and stars, are thought to encircle only about 1 in 1,000 galaxies. But now it seems that many more — possibly 30 times as many — could be hiding in plain sight, researchers report in the November <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>





<p>“The implication would be that there are tons of these things out there, masquerading as normal galaxies,” says astronomer Ronald Buta of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, who wasn’t involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Astronomers are still puzzling out how any galaxies have polar rings at all. But they’re thought to form as galaxies grow, either by colliding with other galaxies or by gobbling up gas.</p>



<p>“The rings give us clues about how [galaxies] can grow and evolve,” says astronomer Nathan Deg of Queen&#8217;s University in Kingston, Canada.</p>



<p>Deg and colleagues spotted the ringlike structure around NGC 4632 — and one encircling another galaxy, NGC 6156 — in data from the WALLABY survey, a project that is scanning half of the southern sky with the ASKAP radio telescope in Western Australia.</p>



<p>“It immediately strikes you that, hey, look, there&#8217;s something funny going on right here that kind of looks like a ring,” Deg says.</p>



<p>It can be tough to tell rings from warped galactic disks, depending on how galaxies are oriented with respect to Earth. So the team used virtual reality visualizations to help distinguish the galaxies’ disks from the potential rings, and compared the real data with simulated observations of perfect polar rings viewed at different angles.</p>



<p>The scientists report that the stunning structures sported by the two galaxies are indeed probably polar rings, with NGC 4632’s ring spanning roughly 60,000 light-years.</p>



<p>And these two may have plenty of company. The fact that the team has already spotted two potential polar rings in the 592 galaxies included in these first bits of WALLABY data suggests that earlier estimates of the frequency of such structures were too low.</p>



<p>The team’s simulations, which tested how polar ring galaxies look to telescopes when viewed at different angles, indicate a similar conclusion. Altogether, the observations and simulations suggest that as many as 3 percent of nearby galaxies could have overlooked rings, too.</p>



<p>A fruit of these combined efforts is a striking composite image of NGC 4632’s starry disk, viewed in visible light, and the radio glow of its hydrogen halo. Hydrogen emits mostly radio light, so the structure is invisible in visible-light images of the galaxy previously taken by the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. Larger telescopes taking closer looks, Deg says, might be able to spot stars in the halo too.</p>





<p>Thanks to large surveys like WALLABY, Deg says, “we&#8217;re in an era where we can discover these and figure out the rings in a way that we never could before.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/PRW-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>The significant growth of genomic data and bioinformatics tools to analyze them has led, inevitably, to discussions around reproducibility and robustness of software.</p>
<p>For computational research, the code associated with a manuscript is arguably as important as the manuscript describing it; without the code, the hypothesis and finding of such a study cannot fully be assessed and the usability of the code or tool cannot be fully tested.</p>
<blockquote><p>For computational research, the code associated with a manuscript is arguably as important as the manuscript describing it; without the code, the hypothesis and finding of such a study cannot fully be assessed and the usability of the code or tool cannot be fully tested.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://codeocean.com/">Code Ocean</a> is one platform that can be used to peer review code.  It provides “compute capsules” for researchers to upload their code and reviewers to access anonymously to test it. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00388-w">A small cluster of Nature journals</a> have now integrated Code Ocean into their submission system.</p>
<p>However, is this welcomed in the computational science community? How do researchers feel about the peer review of code in general? After all, as we don’t ask reviewers to try and reproduce experimental results in the laboratory during manuscript assessment, so perhaps we shouldn’t ask them to test code either.</p>
<p>I reached out to a number of researchers that serve on the editorial board for the journal <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Bioinformatics</em></a> to find out, inviting them to share their views in response to a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on mandating the sharing of previously unreported code described in a manuscript submitted to a computational journal such as <em>BMC Bioinformatics</em>?</strong></p>
<p>There was a, possibly unsurprisingly, consensus that this was a good idea and that all authors should be required to deposit their code in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> or similar platform.</p>
<p>Dimitris Polychronopoulos from Ochre Bio stated that, in his view,<em> “publishing previously unreported code in code repositories such as Github, Bitbucket or others is a prerequisite for any work that involves computational analyses.”</em></p>
<p>He then went on to explain that this was for two reasons – to <em>“ensure code reproducibility and code robustness for people running on different computer architectures”</em> and <em>“disseminate the work and potentially integrate findings generated from a pipeline to another under development, promoting this way scientific progress.”</em></p>
<p>Miha Moškon from the University of Ljubljana went one step further, mentioning the importance of documentation, <em>“ … a code published without a proper documentation is sometimes as useless as no code at all. The requirement to share the code should thus be complemented with the requirement to also document it appropriately.”</em></p>
<p>Timothy Shaw from the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute points out that it <em>“ … should be a priority of requiring authors to submit ready-to-run code, which should include examples of inputs and outputs.”</em>  Hence platforms such as Code Ocean of course, although interestingly all but one of my respondents hadn’t heard of it.</p>
<p>But were my respondents as keen on the actual process of testing code as part of the peer review process?  Did they see any benefit to it? I asked them.</p>
<p><strong>What might </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>advantages of peer review of code be?</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13354" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13354" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="wp-image-13354 size-medium" title="© joyfotoliakid / Stock.adobe.com" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/AdobeStock_286032339.jpeg.iSers5bZMenXG7NjQA0A.VGBwm8NMI2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13354" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">© joyfotoliakid / Stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>All respondents agreed that peer review would lead to improvements in the code prior to publication.</p>
<p>Bashar Ibrahim from the Gulf University for Science and Technology and University of Jena said that “<em>Peer review of code is a valuable practice in software development that enhances code quality, knowledge sharing, and collaboration. It helps identify and address issues early, leading to more efficient development and better overall tools.”</em></p>
<p>Shaw stated that he <em>“personally benefitted from having users test our software.”</em></p>
<p>Johann Rohwer from Stellenbosch University was of a similar opinion but also cautioned that it may not be possible to inspect everything in detail if the code base is particularly large.</p>
<p>This statement lent itself nicely to my next question.</p>
<p><strong>Can you think of any disadvantages of including the assessment of code in the peer review process?</strong></p>
<p>As with the previous question, there was a general theme, that is, concerns focusing on finding peer reviewers that can test code and the additional time that may be required, which may lead to delays in publication.</p>
<p>Moškon, for example, stated that “<em>finding reviewers with appropriate expertise who are willing to provide timely reviews with high standard is already a challenging task, which editors are facing every day. And finding a reviewer who is competent in assessing, e.g., the biological significance of the results as well as the quality and reproducibility of the published code will sometimes be an impossible task.”</em></p>
<p>Anil Kesarwani from The Jackson Laboratory pointed out that <em>&#8220;reviewers need expertise in both the specific research domain and coding, which may not always be readily available&#8221;</em> and that <em>&#8220;code review can be subjective as different reviewers may have varying opinions on code style and quality.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Boyang Ji from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, who was the one respondent that had any experience of using Code Ocean to peer review code, said <em>“usually I just have a look the core part of the algorithm part. For machine learning projects, I usually have a check to make sure the pipeline is as authors described in the manuscript. Usually, I cannot review the code line by line.”</em></p>
<p>So, perhaps using automated AI-tools such as ChatGPT can help solve the issues around additional resources needed to peer review code. I asked my respondents what they thought about this.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Reviewers need expertise in both the specific research domain and coding, which may not always be readily available.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><strong>Anil Kesarwani, The Jackson Laboratory (USA)</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What are you</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> views on using a ChatGPT tool to assess code automatically?</strong></p>
<p>Here, Ibrahim voiced the opinion shared by almost everyone:</p>
<p><em>“AI-based tools can be highly beneficial for improving code quality, and consistency. However, it is a valuable tool within the broader code review but not a complete replacement for human expertise. The best practice is to combine automated code assessments with regular human code reviews for code quality assurance.”</em></p>
<p>Jia Meng from Xi&#8217;an Jiaotong-Liverpool University was more cautious, stating that they were not convinced that ChatGPT is currently able to perform peer review of code well at present, but this might change in the future.</p>
<p>Polychronopoulos was particularly enthusiastic, stating “<em>I am a big fan. In my mind, assessing code can be largely broken down into two steps; first you check out the whole pipeline to familiarize yourself and get a general idea of what’s going on and then you delve into the specifics. I see ChatGPT being particularly useful at the first step.”</em></p>
<p><strong>How do you see the future of peer review of code?</strong></p>
<p>In essence, most respondents do feel that AI will have a role to play.</p>
<p>Ibrahim commented that <em>“Ultimately, the future of peer review of code review will be shaped by advances in AI, collaboration, and on improving code quality. Embracing these trends can help development teams deliver higher-quality software more efficiently.”</em></p>
<p>Moškon was a little more circumspect: “… <em>the future of peer review of code will rely on the automatic assessment tools. To what degree can we trust these tools is another question. Are we willing to transfer the peer review process to artificial intelligence?”</em></p>
<p>And Sri Krishna Subramanian from the Institute of Microbial Technology concludes the discussion with<em> &#8220;in the foreseeable future, I anticipate widespread adoption of code peer review as a standard practice across reputable journals in all major fields. The task is to find the sweet spot by balancing the integration of AI-driven tools for automated code evaluation, fostering community involvement for comprehensive code testing, and establishing standardized protocols. This approach should be complemented by the expertise of human reviewers to assess both the code and its accompanying manuscript, aligning with the principles of open science and adhering to ethical standards governing code and its associated data.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So, in summary, what do the researchers I reached out to think about the future of peer view of code? In essence, it is laudable and something that should be considered essential when assessing papers describing computational research.  It should lead to higher quality and robust researcher-developed software and algorithms. There are some challenges, such as the difficulties in finding suitable reviewers and authors may have to wait longer for a decision, due to the time it takes to assess the code.  The advent of ChatGPT may, in part, be a solution to these, but it is important that human reviewers are still involved and gudelines incorporated to ensure that the peer review is suitably robust.</p>

<p>In an effort to reproduce the results using reverse-engineering, Kahng and his colleagues found <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/271439-more-details-but-not-enough/fulltext">human experts typically beat Google&#8217;s machine-learning system</a>, as they reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11014">a preprint</a> published earlier this year. However, they had no way &#8220;to replicate the pre-training described in the Nature paper,&#8221; they wrote.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, a Google researcher who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/technology/google-fires-ai-researchers.html">fired after he questioned the paper in <em>Nature</em></a> alleged in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/satrajit_vs_google.pdf">lawsuit</a> earlier this year that the tech giant&#8217;s &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; claims to have revolutionized chip layout using AI were <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/27/google_ai_chip_paper_nature/">tied to efforts to commercialize its software</a>, as reported by <em>The Register</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company referred us to a statement issued earlier to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/technology/google-fires-ai-researchers.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-brain-ai-researcher-fired-tension/"><em>Wired</em></a> by Zoubin Ghahrahmani, vice president at Google DeepMind:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We thoroughly vetted the original Nature paper and stand by the peer-reviewed results &#8212; the authors’ many contributions to chip design have already helped us design more energy-efficient and useful AI hardware. We&#8217;ve open-sourced this work for the external research community, and multiple teams continue to advance this important area of research.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.annagoldie.com/">Anna Goldie</a>, one of the corresponding authors of the paper and formerly a researcher at Google Brain, pointed us to <a href="https://www.annagoldie.com/home/statement">a statement</a> she issued in March with first author <a href="http://azaliamirhoseini.com/">Azalia Mirhoseini</a>, also a former Google researcher.</p>



<p>They noted, among other things:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our [reinforcement learning] method has been used in production for multiple generations of Google’s flagship AI accelerator (TPU), including the latest, and chips with layouts generated by our method have been manufactured and are currently running in Google datacenters.</p>



<p>Being physically manufactured at sub-10 nm is a level of validation that goes far beyond what is present in almost any paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair also took issue with Kahng&#8217;s preprint, which they said &#8220;mischaracterizes&#8221; their work for a number of reasons laid out in their statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ultimately,&#8221; they added, &#8220;we believe that this is just the beginning and that learning-based methods for chip design will have profound impact on both hardware and machine learning itself.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bigfoot-loch-ness-monster-data-pseudoscience">Seen Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster? Data suggest the odds are low</a></h4>

              
                <p>There were drones, there were boats. There were spotters on land and a hydrophone listening for suspicious sounds underwater. In what may have been the biggest search of its kind in 50 years, crowds of people gathered this summer in Scotland to hunt for any sign of a legendary creature: the Loch Ness Monster.</p>



<p>Nearly 6,000 kilometers away, data scientist Floe Foxon emailed the event’s organizers and wished them good luck. “I’m sure it’s going to be a fun weekend,” he said. Foxon wasn’t joining them, but from his home office in Pittsburgh, he has examined Nessie’s lore in his own way — with statistics.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In July, Foxon published a study on <a href="https://xbio.jmir.org/2023/1/e49063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the probability of finding a giant eel in the loch</a>, one of many hypotheses for sightings of the storied sea monster. The answer: Essentially zero. Even the chances of finding a 1-meter-long eel are low, about 1 in 50,000, Foxon reported in <em>JMIRx Bio</em>. But once you get much longer than that — into monster-sized eel territory — the probability plummets.</p>



<p>But don’t call Foxon a myth buster or a debunker. “Absolutely not,” he says. “I think you should approach these things with an open mind and let the data influence your decision-making.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though monsters have captured Foxon’s imagination, his background is in physics, and by day, he’s a data analyst for a health consulting firm. In his free time, he flits through far-flung fields of science, including astronomy, paleontology and cryptology, the study of ciphers. “When you learn data science,” Foxon says, “you find that it can be applied to more or less anything.” Even monsters.</p>



<p>For his Nessie study, Foxon analyzed the mass distribution of eels caught in Loch Ness and other freshwater bodies in Europe. He converted that data to eel length and then calculated the odds of finding eels of different sizes. And in a separate monster study posted online July 20 at biorXiv.org, Foxon looked at data on Big Foot sightings and black bear populations across the United States and Canada. As <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.14.524058v4.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of black bears in a region goes up, Bigfoot sightings tend to increase as well</a>, he found. That doesn’t tell you whether Bigfoot is real, though, Foxon says. “You can’t answer that sort of question without a specimen.” Instead, he thinks about it from a probability standpoint. If you think you’ve seen a sasquatch, he says, it’s probably just a bear.</p>



<p>But people claiming glimpses of Bigfoot or other extraordinary beasts probably aren’t hoaxers, Foxon says. “Most people are very earnest and honest about having an experience that they personally cannot explain.” He thinks scientists should listen to them and take them seriously.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="391" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091823_mr_folk_zoology_inline.jpg" alt="A photo from 1967 supposedly showing Bigfoot." class="wp-image-3131689" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091823_mr_folk_zoology_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091823_mr_folk_zoology_inline-666x383.jpg 666w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091823_mr_folk_zoology_inline-323x186.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131689">Black bears may account for many supposed sightings of Bigfoot. This image depicts the purported creature from footage shot in 1967.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131689">Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin, Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Off the top of his head, Foxon can rattle off the names of supernatural attractions he’s visited around the world, from a museum of curiosities in London to the Flatwoods Monster Museum in Sutton, W. Va. He’s even been boating on Loch Ness (though no sign of Nessie).</p>



<p>Foxon considers his study of sea monsters, sasquatches and other mythical beings folk zoology. He describes the field as the intersection between zoology and indigenous knowledge of animals in folklore. Though Foxon’s work has roots in cryptozoology, which once used the tools of science to investigate mysterious animals, that field has since been “overrun by a lot of pseudoscience,” he says.</p>



<p>It’s not so much the monsters that pushed the field to the fringe, though. Foxon, for instance, investigates all sorts of cryptic creatures, including giant snakes and a hypothetical aquatic animal dubbed Champy, reported to live in North America’s Lake Champlain. But his quest for answers takes a strictly scientific tack that relies on established mathematical methods.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not what you study, it’s how you study it,” says Charles Paxton, a statistician and fish biologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who has published papers on the Loch Ness Monster. Still, when people find out what Paxton studies, some assume he’s a pseudoscientist. “That’s quite frustrating, actually,” he says. “The methods of science can be more widely used than people might think.”</p>





<p>Foxon’s latest study, posted online August 8 at biorxiv.org, uses a statistical method to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.07.552261v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examine eyewitness sightings of a long extinct bird, the New Zealand moa (Dinornithiformes)</a>. Though scientists think the ostrichlike bird went extinct hundreds of years ago, people have reported seeing moa as recently as the 1990s. In an analysis that factored in the reliability of 97 separate moa sightings, Foxon estimated that moa probably were extinct by 1770.</p>



<p>“I’m greatly disappointed by all of my findings,” Foxon says with a laugh. “I really wish that there was a giant eel in Loch Ness,” or a hairy apelike monster in North America’s woods or moa living in modern times, he says. But “there seems to be a very, very low probability.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-renaming-magellanic-clouds">Astronomers call for renaming the Magellanic Clouds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Names have significance, especially when they’re written in the stars.</p>



<p>A group of astronomers is coalescing around an idea to rename two neighbors of the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.</p>



<p>Named after explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the satellite galaxies are visible with the naked eye from the Southern Hemisphere. But Magellan&#8217;s name is not fitting, astronomer Mia de los Reyes and colleagues argue. The leader of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-circling-globe-has-evolved-500-years-since-magellan-voyage">first expedition to successfully circle the globe</a>, Magellan enslaved and killed Indigenous people encountered on the voyage, which set out from Spain in 1519 (<em>SN: 9/17/19</em>).</p>





<p>“Because we’re naming things in the night sky, which belongs to everyone, we think that it’s important to have names that reflect all of humanity,” says de los Reyes, of Amherst College in Massachusetts. She <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls for the name change</a> in an opinion piece published September 12 in <em>Physics</em>. Magellan’s voyage helped pave the way for Spanish colonialism in South America, Guam and the Philippines, says de los Reyes, who is Filipino American. “Many people see Magellan as a villain in the Philippines.”</p>



<p>The Magellanic clouds loom large in the field of astronomy. They’re independent galaxies, but close enough that astronomers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magellanic-clouds-star-formation-birth-galaxy">can observe the individual stars</a> within (<em>SN: 4/1/22</em>). “The Magellanic Clouds are this amazing laboratory for seeing things up close and personal,” says astronomer Sally Oey of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, a supporter of the name change.</p>



<p>Magellan wasn’t an astronomer. The clouds were noted by a member of his expedition, but they were already well-known to many cultures in the Southern Hemisphere, and even to previous European explorers. “It doesn&#8217;t make sense to have them named after any one person, let alone a person who never actually studied them,” says astronomer Gurtina Besla of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>The galaxies have been known scientifically by Magellan’s name <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since only the end of the 19th century</a> — well after Magellan’s voyage. That’s just a blip in the history of astronomy, the researchers argue.</p>



<p><a></a>More than 100 astronomers have expressed interest in the campaign, anchored by a core group of about 50, de los Reyes says. The group aims to bring the proposal to the International Astronomical Union, in hopes of eventually holding a vote on the name change. Other fields of science are undergoing similar debates, with groups of researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">pushing to revise offensive names for certain plants and animals</a>, for example (<em>SN: 8/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>The astronomers are now trying out new names.&nbsp; One popular suggestion is to call them the “Milky Clouds.” That would maintain the commonly used acronyms, LMC and SMC. And it would reflect the galaxies’ connection to something much bigger than any one person — the Milky Way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/future-of-collaboration/">This Peer Review Week, PLOS looks ahead to a future of cooperation and collaboration at all levels of scholarship and scholarly communications</a></h4>

              
                <p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Peer Review Week 2023 will focus on Peer Review and the Future of Publishing. At PLOS, we envision a future in which researchers, institutions, and organizations collaborate fluidly across disciplines and distances. A future of team science, collaborative peer review, multidisciplinary research, and collaboration between researchers in different regions, institutions, and even with the public. We believe Openness and collaboration work hand-in-hand. By removing the walls around research we can improve equity and discoverability, facilitate connections that lead to more innovative approaches, accelerate discovery, and support rigor and reproducibility. The end result is better for science, and society.</p>



<p>And we&rsquo;re not alone. In celebration of Peer Review Week, we asked our community what they think about collaboration, community, and the future of publishing and peer review. Here is just a little of what they had to say.</p>



<h2>International collaboration is key to addressing big global challenges</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Many of the most significant challenges facing our planet&mdash;such as climate change, biodiversity decline, and land degradation/desertification&mdash;require that scientists from different countries work together collaboratively.&nbsp; As an example, COVID19 saw almost unprecedented levels of international scientific cooperation (often on very short and urgent timeframes), where scientists shared knowledge, data, and findings relevant to understanding and treating an emerging issue where we had very little information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>International cooperation amongst scientists remains no less urgent today, as we move towards critical points in our ability to provide the evidence to (hopefully) support real change and decision-making in addressing these challenges at the global level. This is, of course, a central driver of the efforts to achieve Open Science.&nbsp; In making scientific findings more accessible (and hopefully understandable) to a wider audience, we also hope to better support international scientific collaboration.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Transparent, collaborative peer review builds trust</h2>



<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been puzzled by the closed and opaque nature of peer review. If it serves as a community and public scrutiny mechanism, then why should it transpire in isolation, behind closed curtains?</p>



<p>I therefore greatly support experimentation with and evaluation of transparent, open and collaborative review models, which hold the potential to strengthen scholarly communication, fostering greater collegiality and fairness.&rdquo; </p>



<p><em>Serge P.J.M. Horbach, Sociologist of science at Aarhus University</em></p>

<h2>When it comes to multidisciplinary research communication is key</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Working in multidisciplinary teams in biomedical research requires effective communication and bridging diverse perspectives, necessitating a deep understanding of each other&rsquo;s terminology. Harmonizing diverse voices and integrating varied viewpoints enables efficient project design, ensuring every piece contributes to the overarching aim.&rdquo;</p>



<p><em>Natascha Drude, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) at Charit&eacute; &amp; BIH QUEST Center for Responsible Research</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="300" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-214x300.jpg" alt="Photo of Natascha Drude" class="wp-image-21661" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-214x300.jpg 214w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-732x1024.jpg 732w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI-1463x2048.jpg 1463w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/DrudeNI.jpg 1554w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px"><figcaption>Natascha Drude</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Diverse perspectives generate stronger feedback and help us see our work in a new light</h2>



<p>&ldquo;There is no single good/best way to write. That&rsquo;s one principle we emphasize from the beginning, so we are effectively obligated to provide students with diverse writing coaches who come from different areas of science and who have different (sometimes strikingly different) habits and practices in writing. We all enjoy our collaboration very much, which is good because the retreat would be ineffective without that diversity.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Other researchers may have pieces of the puzzle you are trying to solve</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Mapping neural circuits requires a singular drive to complete a particular part of the brain you&rsquo;re focusing on. When done, you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised that your work is worth far more than expected. Turns out, neurons mapped by others elsewhere in the brain reach out and synapse with the ones you&rsquo;ve mapped. These synapses let you make sense of the structure of your neural circuits of interest&mdash;now you know its inputs and outputs&mdash;and enables others to likewise enrich their analysis. A huge win-win.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Collaboration isn&rsquo;t just useful for research&mdash;it helps in skills-building too</h2>



<p>&ldquo;[In our writing workshops] we intentionally create groups so that, as much as possible, people are working on similar things (manuscripts, grants, fellowships, job applications, etc.) and are from very different subdisciplines. There&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers what you do well when writing, and there&rsquo;s a power to hearing from peers in different subdisciplines what might be confusing in your writing.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Researchers aren&rsquo;t the only ones</h2>



<p>Just like the researchers we serve, we&rsquo;re not doing it alone, but through collaboration with like-minded partners. Partners like <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">CSHL</a> and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">EarthArXiv</a>, who enable us to integrate facilitated preprint posting directly into our submission system, so authors can share their work on their own timeline with ease. Or protocols.io, who co-developed and co-host <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/">Lab Protocols</a>, an article type that leverages protocols.io&rsquo;s optimized platform and <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s publishing platform to publish step-by-step protocols in a peer reviewed scholarly journal, without sacrificing utility. Or the Einstein Foundation, with whom we work to recognize <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/plos-partners-with-einstein-foundation-berlin-on-award-for-promoting-quality-in-research/">rigor, reliability, robustness and transparency</a> in research.</p>

<p>Set to launch in Autumn 2023, <em>BMC Methods</em> will be the first Springer Nature open access, peer reviewed journal that will focus on providing updates in methods and lab protocols across various scientific disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, computational and biomedical sciences. In line with BMC’s ethos the journal will champion open science, supported by <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2020/05/04/transparency-openness-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review </a>and <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/open-data">open data policies</a>.</p>
<p>In a world where innovation and transparency are paramount, <em>BMC Methods</em> will serve as a valuable resource for researchers who seek to enhance their experimental techniques, improve study reproducibility, and stay informed about the latest advancements in methodology.</p>
<blockquote><p>At <em>BMC Methods</em> our mission is clear: to facilitate the dissemination of experimental procedures, novel techniques, and innovative methodologies in the natural sciences field to elevate the quality and rigour of scientific research.</p></blockquote>
<p>The journal welcomes submissions of both lab protocols and methodology articles. We particularly welcome lab protocols that have a strong emphasis on providing comprehensive explanations for each step. We’re very happy to receive submissions with links to <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> or from pre-print servers. Our goal is to empower fellow researchers to replicate and build upon your work. As with other <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals">BMC Series journals</a>, <em>BMC Methods</em> does not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. However, submissions to <em>BMC Methods</em> should directly address questions within their respective disciplines as we want to publish methods that contribute to meaningful scientific advancements. Authors are encouraged to demonstrate their method&#8217;s performance compared to existing approaches to allow the scientific community to gauge the true impact and advantages of the work. We are open to manuscripts that explore the theoretical foundations of methods and propose enhancements or optimizations.</p>
<p><strong>Join us on this exciting journey!</strong></p>
<p><em>BMC Methods</em> aspires to be more than just a journal; our goal is to build a community of scientists dedicated to advancing the scientific method. Efforts are now underway to recruit an international Editorial Board with broad and diverse expertise. We invite you to join us in this exciting journey towards greater transparency, reproducibility, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-infected-covid-19-exhale">Here’s how much coronavirus people infected with COVID-19 may exhale</a></h4>

              
                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads through the air. But just how much virus people breathe out over the course of infection isn’t well-defined.</p>



<p>To pin the numbers down, olfactory researcher Gregory Lane and colleagues analyzed over 300 breath samples from 43 people with COVID-19, following them for nearly three weeks. Levels varied between and within individuals, but some people shed a lot, releasing over 800 copies of viral RNA per minute at times.</p>



<p>On average, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.06.23295138v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participants breathed out 80 copies per minute</a> for a full eight days after symptoms began, the team reports September 8 in a preprint posted at medRxiv.org. Only after that point did the viral particles drop to nearly undetectable levels.</p>





<p>Lane, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, and colleagues still need to confirm what percentage of that exhaled viral RNA comes from viruses that can still replicate in another person’s body. And scientists don’t yet know how much virus is required for infection.</p>



<p>But, based on the new data, the team estimates that a high shedder could potentially exhale enough virus to infect someone in a closed space in about 20 seconds, making even elevator rides risky. With an average shedder, infection could take a little under four minutes.</p>



<p>The new study, which will be published in <em>eLife</em>, provides valuable information that both nasal swab studies and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-device-detect-coronavirus-air">one-time aerosol experiments</a> cannot, says infectious diseases researcher Kristen Coleman (<em>SN: 7/16/23</em>).&nbsp; Swabs sample only one part of the respiratory tract. And many aerosol experiments measure the amount of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">virus people spewed while talking, singing or reading aloud</a>, as well as while while breathing, at just a single point during infection <em>(SN: 08/17/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Lane’s team devised a simple and cheap tool — essentially a plastic mouthpiece attached to a closed tube — that participants took home with them and breathed into for 10 minutes at a time. That allowed the team to easily collect samples over an extended period of time and track how emissions changed during infection.&nbsp;But the makeshift tool lacks the precision of advanced machines in laboratories and hospitals, says Coleman, of the University of Maryland School of Public Health in College Park. Even the spike of 876 viral RNA copies per minute seen in the new study may be an underestimate by several orders of magnitude, she says.</p>



<p>In the new study, those who reported more severe symptoms tended to emit more virus. Yet even asymptomatic people or those with mild cases breathed out substantial amounts of viral RNA. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people exhaled similar levels.</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that people who are mildly ill or asymptomatic isolate for at least five days and then mask for another five. Lane would offer different advice: “If my friends or family asked me, I’d say you should isolate through day eight.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541702899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Fragile Moment</a><br><em>Michael Mann</em><br><em>PublicAffairs, $30</em></p>



<p>Over four millennia ago, in the final days of the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia, a drought swept over the region, afflicting lands as far away as Greece and what’s now Pakistan. Probably driven by the eruption of a distant volcano, the drying climate devastated local agriculture. A contemporary text, <em>The Curse of Akkad</em>, noted that “the large arable tracts yielded no grain … the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine, thick clouds did not rain.”</p>





<p>As once-prosperous farmlands collapsed in the northern part of the empire, people fled to the south. The southern Akkadians’ response? Build a more than 150-kilometer-long wall between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, barring entry to any migrants. Soon after, history’s first empire crumbled, dying of thirst in the cradle of civilization.</p>



<p>Climate systems and civilizations are stable only up to a point. In <em>Our Fragile Moment</em>, climate scientist Michael Mann reminds us that today we are pushing the limits of both.</p>



<p>In the book, Mann looks back at episodes of global climate change over the last 4.5 billion years, from eras of deadly heat to wastelands of widespread ice. With each instance, he draws out lessons about what happens to Earth in periods of changing climate. Sometimes, the result is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-activity-convicted-permian-extinction">dramatic mass extinctions</a> or geologic upheavals (<em>SN: 8/28/15</em>). Other times, as with the Akkadians, it’s societal collapse.</p>



<p>Earth’s climate system includes regulating forces that tend to buffer against small shifts in climate; ice caps and low clouds reflect sunlight and help cool the planet, for instance. But pushed too far, regulating forces can be overwhelmed, causing the climate to spiral out of control.</p>



<p>This was the case 55 million years ago. As a steady set of volcanic eruptions spewed carbon dioxide into the air, Earth warmed. The heat may have contributed to thinner and less reflective clouds. This in turn would have made the planet even hotter. Eventually, the low-lying clouds disappeared, and average global temperatures soared to 32° Celsius (90° Fahrenheit) in what is referred to as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eocene-temperature-spike-caused-half-much-co2-once-thought">Hothouse Earth</a> (<em>SN: 11/3/15</em>).</p>



<p>Today, with unchecked greenhouse gas emissions, we may face a similar, though less sweltering, spiral with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-hinterlands-leaking-ice">disappearance of our reflective ice caps</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>But what makes current climate change different is its source — humankind — and our ability to stop it. This is a benefit that is unique to our changing climate. It comes with blame, but it also comes with agency.</p>



<p>That agency is an important source of hope for Mann. Melting ice caps could raise sea levels and displace some 40 percent of the global population. Rising <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">heat could make swaths of the planet uninhabitable</a> (<em>SN: 5/8/20</em>). But if we act, we can preserve a world that looks much like ours. The limit is not geologic or even technological, Mann argues; it is political.</p>



<p>Despite the far-reaching themes Mann weaves throughout the book, it may not be for everyone. There is a strong academic bend to the writing, which leans heavily on jargon. The book also features a dizzying parade of researchers, and Mann often emphasizes his connection to climate researchers and events, at one point reminiscing about how he “was known as a bit of a statistics guru.” The technical terms, acronyms, initialisms and self-referential tangents can distract from the book’s broader arguments and message.</p>



<p>Even though Mann’s dedication to precise academic language comes at the expense of some clarity, climate buffs will appreciate the deep dives into the scientific process. Many of the dense sections reward the reader with a satisfying tidbit of fascinating information or an illuminating insight. On occasion, I laughed out loud at Mann’s puns, jokes and barbs. (A reference to <em>The Princess Bride</em>’s ROUSs — Rodents of Unusual Size — landed particularly well.)</p>





<p>After journeying through the past, Mann brings us to the present and looks toward the future. Though past climates may offer lessons, those lessons only go so far. We are unlikely to bring about another Hothouse Earth, but the climate is warming faster than it has in millennia, thanks to human actions. If current climate policy holds, the best scientific predictions show things will be painful, but civilization won’t end. But climate scientists are not oracles. They can’t be sure. </p>



<p>That uncertainty, rather than being a cause for complacency, should spur us to action, Mann argues. “The impacts of climate change, no doubt, constitute an existential threat if we fail to act,” Mann concludes. “But we <em>can</em> act. Our fragile moment can still be preserved.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/code-policy-interview/">How does mandated code-sharing change peer review?</a></h4>

              
                <p>On March 31 2021, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> introduced a new journal requirement: mandated code sharing. If the research process included the creation of custom code, the authors were required to make it available during the peer review assessment, and to make it public upon the publication of their research article&mdash;similar to the longstanding data sharing requirement for all PLOS journals. The aim, of course, is to <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">improve reproducibility and increase understanding of research</a>.</p>



<p>At the end of the year-long trial period, code sharing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/open-code-at-plos-computational-biology/">had risen from 53% in 2019 to 87%</a> for 2021 articles submitted after the policy went into effect. Evidence in hand, the journal Editors-in-Chief decided to make code sharing a permanent feature of the journal. Today, the sharing rate is 96%.</p>

<p>In addition to increasing reproducibility, <em>Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s mandated code policy has had other, unexpected impacts on the journal process and publication stream. In advance of Peer Review Week we caught up with the senior editorial team, Editors-in-Chief Felim Mac Gabhann and Jason Papin, and Deputy Editor-in-Chief Virginia Pitzer to get their thoughts on the experience, and changes observed at the journal.</p>



<h6><strong>Please tell us a bit about </strong><strong><em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></strong><strong> and your roles there.&nbsp;</strong></h6>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/FMG_750_700-300x280.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-21616" width="300" height="280" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/FMG_750_700-300x280.jpg 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/FMG_750_700.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Feilim Mac Gabhann, Johns Hopkins</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: <em>PLOS Computational Biology </em>is a leading journal in the field of Computational Biology, both for sharing new research results and for describing and disseminating novel methods and software tools. In addition, our journal continues to be a leader in open science (OS), driven by our mission and by our community to, for example, increase the sharing of code used in the studies we publish. As Editors-in-Chief, we provide support and guidance for the editors, reviewers, and authors that make our journal possible. One of our roles is to nurture and broaden the best practices in our field so that the studies we publish can have the highest likelihood of re-use and reproducibility.</p>



<h6><strong>Why is OS/code sharing important to your journal specifically?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Code is an integral part of the research process for all those who publish in our journal and I would say increasingly integral to all research in biology. For research to truly be &ldquo;open&rdquo; and reproducible, we need to know how scientists arrive at the conclusions that are drawn, and where code is a necessary part of that research process, it becomes imperative that the code be shared to evaluate the results and subsequent conclusions.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: That&rsquo;s right, code is every bit as much a key research reagent as an antibody or plasmid would be for experimental work&mdash;and as a research reagent, it should be available for sharing, validation, and reuse. Other researchers should be able to trust it and be able to build upon it in future studies.</p>



<h6><strong>What are the implications of code sharing to the future of peer review?</strong>&nbsp;</h6>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="253" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-300x253.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-21614" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-300x253.jpeg 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-1024x864.jpeg 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-768x648.jpeg 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-1536x1295.jpeg 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PapinHeadShotDec2020-2048x1727.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Jason Papin, University of Virginia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Peer review will need to account for code as it does for all reported methods in a paper. Where reported research does not have proper experimental controls or an experimental design does not properly account for the key characteristics of a method, peer review becomes a necessary part of a process of correction and refinement. Similarly, as the code is evaluated during peer review, it can be corrected and refined in a way that improves the scientific contribution.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: Sharing can also potentially shorten the cycles of review&mdash;for example, where previously a reviewer might have to ask particular questions to probe methods, algorithms, parameters and more, now they can go directly to the code to find what they need and potentially even run the code themselves.</p>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: As code sharing becomes a standard part of the peer review process, it will enhance the reproducibility of computational biology research. If a reviewer finds they cannot understand or run the code underlying an analysis, it will compel the authors to be clearer in their approach and sharing of necessary resources.</p>



<h6><strong>Have you noticed any changes to how editors or reviewers handle peer review since code policies have been introduced? For example, has there been an increase in desk rejects?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Jason</em>: Reviewers certainly are much more deliberate in judging whether there is sufficient code with the submission to reproduce the reported results, and editors will desk-reject papers when code is not provided. But most of the time when an editor or reviewer notes the absence of code, the authors are notified and can readily provide the requested code. I believe the code sharing policy is very much in the ethos of the journal and consequently rarely is the request a surprise to the authors.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: There has not been an increase in desk rejects, but rather an increased ability of the editors to require that code be shared before a manuscript moves forward; and an increased likelihood that authors think about this code sharing before submission. Most of our authors, as members of our Computational Biology community, are in favor of increased sharing and intend to share their code; having the requirement up front helps the authors to get this done earlier instead of relying on post-publication sharing.</p>



<h6><strong>Have you seen changes in behavior to the definition of authorship as a result, such as lab technicians or programmers who assist in cleaning up code receiving credit? Would you like to?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: We certainly encourage authorship to include all those who contributed to the study that is being published. We see the sharing of code, and improving code to increase re-use and reproducibility, as central to a good computational process and study.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Pitzer-YSPH-headshot.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-21617" width="220"><figcaption>Virginia Pitzer, Yale School of Public Health</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: I think at this point, most code is written by one of the lead authors, since it is integral to the analysis. But that may change as it becomes more common for labs to hire people who specialize in programming, and as increasingly diverse or complex datasets come into common use &ndash; this is particularly true for my own work in epidemiology.</p>



<h6><strong>What were the top lessons or surprises each of you learned in implementation among stakeholders?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: I think that the response to implementation shows that the requirement for code sharing really reflected the goals and interests of the authors, and that instituting the requirement just encouraged or facilitated the authors to follow through on what they already wanted and intended to do. The outcome has been a continued increase in code sharing, even above the already-high baseline of code sharing in our field.</p>



<p><em>Jason</em>: I think reviewers and editors have been nearly universally supportive of the policy. Authors have occasionally questioned aspects of the policy, but there are usually simple clarifications that assuage any concerns. For example, the journal helps authors navigate concerns around code sharing and protected intellectual property or code that involves protected health information.</p>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: I think there is still quite a bit of variation in how in-depth reviewers will go in reviewing the code. But now at least most reviewers will check that the code is provided, whereas others may do a more thorough review and actually try to run the code.</p>



<h6><strong>Do you think Computational Biology&rsquo;s policy has influenced data/code sharing outside of PLOS? What would wider adoption of the policy look like to you?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: As an author, I have become more conscientious about sharing my code regardless of what journal I am submitting to and whether or not they have a code-sharing requirement. I think others are also seeing this as a standard part of the publication process.</p>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: While code has always been a key component of our journal&rsquo;s papers, in recent years we can see that codes, whether for data analysis, complex visualization, or other uses, has become a much more common part of papers in all areas of biology and other sciences. There is no reason that the policy would not benefit all fields just as it has ours. The hard part &ndash; writing the code &ndash; has already been done by the authors; and sharing code is now so easy through free publicly available websites. So wider adoption of this policy would benefit the reproducibility and reuse of code throughout science, without imposing substantial additional effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h6><strong>What changes in a manuscript submission system (MSS) would facilitate better code sharing, and how might this be a barrier with our current publishing tools?</strong></h6>



<p><em>Virginia</em>: It would be helpful if the MSS could have a required field in which authors provide the link to the code depository, rather than having this only included within the manuscript itself.&nbsp;</p>



<h6><strong>As an evolving policy, where would you like code sharing to go &mdash; what are the next steps, or dream next steps, both for your journal and more widely?</strong>.</h6>



<p><em>Feilim</em>: The policy empowers the editors and reviewers to do what they already wanted to do, which is review code and encourage sharing of code. Moving the requirement up front in the review process is essential for adoption; a post-review requirement is simply too difficult and time consuming, and doesn&rsquo;t reflect the realities of our busy scientific lives.</p>



<p><em>Jason</em>: I think we would like to see the policy evolve to involve measures of reproducibility; there&rsquo;s a difference between sharing code and sharing code usable code, however the burden on the author to make it usable would likely be a limiting factor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first book of a Yale professor of Chinese history contains a “multitude of problems,” according to a no-holds-barred review published last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674270954"><em>Uncertainty in the Empire of Routine: The Administrative Revolution of the Eighteenth-Century Qing State</em></a><em> </em>appeared last August from Harvard University Press. Its author, <a href="https://history.yale.edu/people/maura-dykstra">Maura Dykstra</a>, is now an assistant professor of history at Yale.</p>



<p>In an extensive <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-chinese-history/article/was-there-an-administrative-revolution/AD2E74A82073AAEAA5105E946BA17823">review</a> that appeared in the <em>Journal of Chinese History</em> on August 31, <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/gqiao">George Qiao</a>, an assistant professor of history and Asian languages and civilizations at Amherst College in Massachusetts, wrote that Dykstra’s book “fails to meet basic academic standards” and is “filled with misinformation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The book’s problems, according to Qiao, include typos, as well as: </p>



<span id="more-127909"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>flawed conception, numerous factual blunders, failure to engage existing scholarship, problematic choice of primary sources, and dubious citation practices.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, he wrote, “the book systematically misrepresents the majority of its primary sources to support an untenable thesis.” Another academic said it “might be the most brutal academic book review I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>Qiao declined to comment, citing the sensitivity of the matter within the field and his lack of tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dykstra told us she would publish a response in the same journal, likely in the January issue, and declined to comment further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.asianstudies.org/uncertainty-in-the-empire-of-routine-an-interview-with-maura-dykstra/">blog post</a> on the website of the Association for Asian Studies soon after the book’s publication, Dykstra told an interviewer that the project had come out of feedback she had received on a manuscript based on her dissertation. She began working on what became <em>Uncertainty in the Empire of Routine</em> “since people seemed very confused by my assumptions and claims about the evolving character of late imperial administration.”</p>



<p>We reached out to the Harvard University Asia Center – the book is in its monograph series – to ask about the review process the manuscript had undergone before publication, which would typically involve sending it to <a href="https://asiacenter.harvard.edu/publications/information-for-authors/preparing-manuscript-peer-review">two experts for feedback</a>. Kristen Wanner, director of the publications program, told us:&nbsp;</p>

It will expedite the review process, improve accuracy, identify biases, and help in handling large volumes of submissions. However, human expertise and judgment will remain crucial in assessing the overall quality and impact of research.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; ChatGPT-3.5</span></p>
<p>For many of us, conversations surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) seem inescapable. For some others, the thought of “let me ask ChatGPT about this” has become routine. Seemingly, AI has filtered into our everyday lives, a scientific innovation with an indiscriminate impact on the way we conduct scientific research. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals with language processing and generation. Under this hierarchy, LLMs are a specific subset of NLP, which draws upon huge training datasets (of typically a billion parameters or more) to generate text, summarize and answer questions. Examples of commonly known LLMs include OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.5 or -4, Microsoft’s Bing Chat and Google’s Bard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As described in a recent </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06221-2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> review, we are already seeing the multifaceted ways AI can be used to aid scientific discovery. From generating hypotheses to designing experiments, we have barely scratched the surface of harnessing this versatile tool. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">While much of the discussion has covered the potential benefits AI may bring, we are increasingly seeing concerns about the risks AI may carry. Echoing the plot of a dystopian sci-fi, some news outlets have gone so far as to state that this technology may pose an </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65746524"><span style="font-weight: 400">existential threat to humankind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Parallel with the rising use of LLMs, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">scientific publishing and academia are not absent from this nervous discourse, with much of the discussion focused around the use of AI tools in generating paper publications and peer review reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Computer-assistance is not a novel concept in scientific publishing. Automated systems have long been integrated into the process to scan references, inspect manuscripts for plagiarism and check their compliance with journal policies. However, the capacity of AI to expand the volume and type of tasks that can be automated poses several risks that could disrupt the peer review system: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLM-generated ‘peer review’ reports are at risk of error: its ability to conflate different sources of information can lead to inaccurate and misleading information (LLM developers refer to this phenomenon as ‘hallucination’).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although a powerful tool for processing and summarizing facts about the world, as their output is limited to the training data they are given, LLMs are not yet able to generate original information: this means that the produced reports may not necessarily be as critical as a human reviewer would be and are very rarely as insightful. They will also be subject to any biases inherent in the data they are fed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Developers and creators of LLMs are often not very transparent about how their models use and retain the prompts they receive, raising concerns about intellectual property and confidentiality. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">At a time when many academics already feel inundated with invitations to review a manuscript, LLMs are at risk of being misused by reviewers to rapidly generate poor quality, unhelpful reviews, thereby diminishing the value of the peer review process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such concerns have led some publishers and funding agencies such as the NIH </span><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-149.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">to ban the use of AI in the peer review process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. While these measures are expected and perhaps advisable as we come to better understand how to work with LLMs, we should not ignore their potential to help peer reviewers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLMs have the potential to support reviewers as writing assistants in assembling constructive and easily readable reports </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">With more than 90% of indexed scientific articles being published in English, English-speaking researchers are at an advantage in science communication, and the use of LLMs could help democratize peer review by allowing researchers who are not fluent English speakers to communicate science in English more effectively. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">While the risks of bias in LLM persist, the potential biases, judgments and subjectivity inherent in manual reviewing can be minimized by using these tools. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">A significant amount of research requires multidisciplinary scrutiny. LLMs could accelerate the assessment of aspects of papers that require significant time, energy and expertise (such as statistical validity)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a complementary tool to one&#8217;s own work, LLMs could expand on the existing human reviewers’ report by providing additional insights and context. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scientific peer review has long been considered the gold standard for ensuring the quality and credibility of research. A way of replicating the research-focused discussions between academics that formed the foundation for the critical yet open-minded approach that defines modern scientific discovery. The use of LLMs in the scientific review process may, to some, feel like the removal of the &#8216;peer&#8217; in peer review and, as such, a threat to science in its entirety. However, if used as a tool to assist the peer review process, rather than as a standalone “robot” reviewer, LLMs could enhance both the quality and efficiency of manuscript assessment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reaching this goal will require a concerted effort from all parties involved in the peer review process. Reviewers who use LLMs to assist with manuscript assessment must take responsibility for the accuracy and value of the reports they submit. Authors can use LLMs to help improve their work but should avoid the trap of assuming these imperfect tools can instantly create a complete manuscript. In turn, publishers must ensure that accountability across the peer review process remains in the hands of experienced human editors. Transparency and honesty about LLMs will be vital in shaping the policies that will help usher in their use.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“AI can bring efficiency to peer review by identifying plagiarism, sorting submissions, and assessing the quality of research. However, it might also lead to job loss for human reviewers, lack of nuanced understanding, and the risk of overlooking innovative but unconventional studies. Additionally, reliance on AI may increase the risk of hacking and manipulation of review outcomes.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; ChatGPT-4.0</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The text at the top of the article was generated by ChatGPT3.5 in response to a prompt asking about the future of peer review. The text above, which provides a considerably more cautious perspective on AI, was created by the next iteration of ChatGPT. LLMs are a technology developing at an incredible pace,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and opinions on its use are likely to shift just as rapidly. Science should strive to work with, rather than against or without, AI whilst recognizing the complexity of the challenges it proposes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever these developments may bring, it is important that science maintains an attitude of critical open-mindedness and adaptability in the face of new tools and developments, like science always has. </span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brainless-jellyfish-eyes-nerves-learn">These brainless jellyfish use their eyes and bundles of nerves to learn</a></h4>

              
                <p>For Caribbean box jellyfish, learning is literally a no-brainer.</p>



<p>In a new experiment, these animals <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01136-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned to spot and avoid obstacles</a> despite having no central brain, researchers report September 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>. This is the first evidence that jellyfish can make mental connections between events — such as seeing something and running into it — and change their behavior accordingly.</p>



<p>“Maybe learning does not need a very complex nervous system, but rather, learning is an integral part of nerve cells, or very limited circuitry,” says Jan Bielecki, a neuroethologist at Kiel University in Germany. If so, the new finding could help trace how learning evolved in animals.</p>





<p>The nervous system of a Caribbean box jellyfish (<em>Tripedalia cystophora</em>) includes four knoblike rhopalia that dangle off the bell of its body. Each rhopalium houses six eyes and about 1,000 neurons. The jellyfish use their vision to help steer between mangrove roots in the tropical lagoons where they hunt tiny crustacean prey.</p>



<p>Weaving between roots is no simple feat. Caribbean box jellyfish judge a root’s distance based on how dark it appears relative to surrounding water — that is, its contrast. In clear waters, only distant roots fade into the background, or have low contrast. But in murky waters, even nearby roots can blend into their surroundings.</p>



<p>Waters can become murky quickly due to tides, algae and other factors. Bielecki and his colleagues wondered if Caribbean box jellyfish could learn that low-contrast objects, which might at first seem distant, were actually close by.</p>



<p>The team put 12 jellyfish into a round tank surrounded by low-contrast, alternating gray and white stripes. A camera filmed the animals’ behavior for about seven minutes. At first, the jellyfish seemed to interpret the gray stripes as distant roots and swam into the tank wall.</p>



<p>But those collisions seemed to lead the jellyfish to treat the gray stripes more like close roots in murky water, and the animals started avoiding them. The jellies’ average distance from the tank wall increased from about 2.5 centimeters in the first couple of minutes to about 3.6 centimeters in the final couple of minutes. Their average bumps into the wall dropped from 1.8 per minute to 0.78 per minute.</p>



<p>“I found that really amazing,” says Nagayasu Nakanishi, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, who has studied jellyfish nervous systems but was not involved in the new work. “I never thought that jellyfish could really learn.”</p>

<p>Neurobiologist Björn Brembs views the results more cautiously, noting the small number of jellyfish tested and the variability in their performance. “I want this to be true, as it would be so very cool,” says Brembs, of the University of Regensburg in Germany. Experiments with more jellyfish could convince him that the animals really do learn.</p>



<p>In other experiments, Bielecki and his colleagues snipped rhopalia off jellyfish and placed those eye-bearing nerve bundles in front of a screen. Sort of like that scene in <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, Bielecki says, except jellyfish eyes don’t have eyelids to hold open. The screen displayed low-contrast, light gray bars, while an electrode gave the rhopalia a weak electrical pulse, which mimicked the sensation of bumping into something.</p>



<p>This training caused the rhopalia to start responding to low-contrast bars that they had initially ignored. They started sending out the types of neural signals they are known to emit when a jellyfish darts away from an obstacle. This suggests that rhopalia alone can learn that seemingly distant, low-contrast obstacles are actually close enough to avoid — which, in turn, hints that the rhopalia are the Caribbean box jellyfish’s learning centers.</p>





<p>“That’s the coolest part of the paper,” says Ken Cheng, a behavioral biologist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “That gets us one step down into the, you know, wiring of how it works.”</p>



<p>For neurobiologist Gaëlle Botton-Amiot, tracing learning to the rhopalia raises new questions. “They have four of these things in their bodies, so how does that work?” she asks. “How is this coordinated?” And if a jellyfish loses one of its rhopalia, does it forget everything those eyes saw and neurons learned? Or do the other rhopalia remember it?</p>



<p>Botton-Amiot’s research at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220685120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints at similar learning abilities in sea anemones</a>. Like jellyfish, they belong to a group of animals called cnidarians. “Showing that cnidarians that are so different [can both learn] means that it’s probably super widespread within them,” she says, and that perhaps their common ancestor could learn too.</p>



<p>“Maybe [learning] actually evolved multiple times in the evolution of nervous systems,” Nakanishi says. Uncovering the cellular and chemical machinery behind learning in jellyfish or other animals could shed light on this. “If there’s a lot of similarities in the mechanism of how they learn, then that would be suggestive of common ancestry,” he says. “But if they evolved independently, then you would perhaps expect very different mechanisms of learning.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx has returned bits of the asteroid Bennu to Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Seven years is a long time to wait for your carrier service to deliver a package. That’s how long it’s been since <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/osiris-rex/in-depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft</a> set off to gather rocks and dust from the asteroid Bennu. But the package has now been safely delivered.</p>



<p>On September 24, the spacecraft flew near Earth and dropped off a capsule containing material <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">collected from Bennu</a> in October 2020 (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>This is the third mission to retrieve bits of an asteroid, and the first for NASA and the United States. The amount of asteroid material onboard this time far exceeds the micrograms that Japan’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/hayabusa-asteroid-sample-return-mission-lands-australia">Hayabusa spacecraft returned in 2005</a>, from the asteroid Itokawa, and the five grams that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">Hayabusa2 collected in 2018</a> from Ryugu (<em>SN: 6/14/10; SN: 12/7/20</em>).</p>





<p>The Bennu sample arrived with a timing and precision that would make most terrestrial delivery services jealous. After a three-year journey back from the asteroid and an initially scorching descent, the capsule released a parachute and descended to its destination at Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, Utah, touching down a few minutes earlier than scheduled at 10:52 a.m. EDT.</p>



<p>“This is a huge deal,” said NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Chief Scientist James Garvin, who was at the air force base to witness the capsule’s landing. “This is the rarest stuff we&#8217;ve ever had on Earth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The capsule will travel on to the Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston on September 25 before the sample canister is opened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the asteroid bits survived the descent, they could help reveal what sort of materials came together to build our solar system. Getting a good look at the stuff that Bennu is made of could also provide insights into the risks that nearby asteroids pose to us, in the event that they are on a collision course with Earth. The asteroid cargo may even hold clues to help answer one of the biggest questions in science — how did life begin?</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m really focused on … trying to understand if these kinds of carbon-rich asteroids may have delivered the seeds of life,” says planetary scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who leads the OSIRIS-REx mission. “So we&#8217;re looking for things like amino acids, which are in our proteins, and nucleic acids,” the building blocks of the genetic instructions that make life possible on Earth.</p>



<p>Lauretta says there’s essentially no chance of finding anything alive on asteroids like Bennu. But in the collected rocks and dust, “we could really see how organic molecular chemistry can evolve before life shows up.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="414" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092123_jr_bennu-return_inline.jpg" alt="An illustration of NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft lightly touching down on the asteroid Bennu." class="wp-image-3131722" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092123_jr_bennu-return_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092123_jr_bennu-return_inline-629x383.jpg 629w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092123_jr_bennu-return_inline-306x186.jpg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131722">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft (illustrated lightly touching down on the asteroid Bennu)&nbsp; dropped off its sample of the asteroid in Utah after a three-year trip back home.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131722">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>At an estimated 250 grams, the asteroid sample in the OSIRIS-REx return capsule is just a bit heavier than a cup of coffee. But it is a huge cache of asteroid material, as far as mission scientists are concerned. The sample size far exceeds the quantity initially hoped for, Lauretta says.</p>



<p>“We came up with 15 grams” as a reasonable sample size to analyze, he says, “which is an enormous amount of material in analytical chemistry these days.” But NASA allows Lauretta and his team to keep only a quarter of the sample for their own use. Some of the remaining portion will be distributed to scientists around the globe, with the rest reserved for future studies.</p>



<p>That meant collecting 60 grams from Bennu would have been enough to ensure that Lauretta and his colleagues had their hoped-for sample. “The fact that we got over four times that is just phenomenally successful,” Lauretta says.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Recipe for an asteroid</h4>



<p>Researchers are already envisioning all they can learn from Bennu.</p>



<p>Physicist Mikael Granvik of the University of Helsinki and Luleå&nbsp;University of Technology in&nbsp;Sweden hopes analyses of the Bennu material will help reveal the potential for mining asteroids for water and raw materials that could supply future space missions.</p>



<p>The asteroid bits could also aid his investigations of how fragile some space rocks might be. “What happens to asteroids of the same type as Bennu when they get closer to the sun?” says Granvik, who is not a member of the OSIRIS-REx team. &nbsp;He and his colleagues propose that the interaction with the sun causes such “rubble pile asteroids,” made of loosely bound material, to break apart. The hypothesis could explain why there are fewer rubble pile asteroids in orbits near the sun than expected.</p>



<p>To test the idea, Granvik exposes samples to harsh conditions that approximate what it would be like near the sun, basically destroying the material. For that reason, he doesn’t expect to use any of the precious Bennu rock. Instead, Granvik hopes to learn the Bennu asteroid recipe and then order up asteroid analogs from suppliers who will blend together materials mimicking the Bennu mix. It’s an example of how the returned sample could expand research opportunities even for scientists who don’t get a share of the real thing.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After a three-year trip aboard the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, a capsule containing dust and rocks from the asteroid Bennu will make a fiery plunge into the Earth’s atmosphere on September 24, as seen in this simulation. Once it releases the capsule, OSIRIS-REx will fire its jets to deflect itself onward to asteroid Apophis under the new name OSIRIS-APEX. Meanwhile, the capsule will fly toward Earth like a fireball. Although jostled during the rough descent, the sample will be protected from the intense temperatures of reentry by the capsule&#8217;s heat shield. As the capsule nears the ground, it will pop a parachute and gently drift the rest of the way down in Utah where, if all goes well, scientists can collect their long-awaited delivery.</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stories Bennu can tell</h4>



<p>For planetary scientist Jessica Sunshine of the University of Maryland in College Park, much of the value in sample return missions is in stories asteroids can tell us about the formation of the Earth and solar system.&nbsp;“We think of them as sort of dead rocks, and they&#8217;re not. I mean, they have undergone significant evolution, both chemical and physical in the 4.5 billion years since they formed,” Sunshine says.</p>



<p>Like Lauretta, Sunshine hopes to learn how those processes ultimately led to the origins of life, but studying near-Earth asteroids is crucial for understanding the threats asteroids pose as well. “In principle, they could have given us life and they could take it away,” Sunshine says, “I mean, from the dinosaur&#8217;s perspective, they did take it away.”</p>



<p>Sunshine is member of the team that sent the DART spacecraft to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">nudge asteroid Dimorphos</a> into a new orbit to see if it was possible to push asteroids off courses that threaten Earth (<em>SN: 10/11/22</em>). &nbsp;“If you&#8217;re worried about the asteroid hazard problem, we pretty much better understand what is the physical and compositional variability of all these things that might hit us,” Sunshine says. “Because depending on what they&#8217;re made of and how they&#8217;re made, it&#8217;s going to change their effect when they hit us. If they ever hit us.”</p>



<p>There may be more than bits of just Bennu in the return capsule, says astronomer Humberto Campins of the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who is a member of the OSIRIS-REx team. Some highly reflective boulders on Bennu don’t match the rest of the asteroid, which is very dark. The most likely reason, Campins says, is that the bright chunks come from collisions with other asteroids.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s no guarantee, but I&#8217;m hoping that in our sample there will be some fraction, some pieces, grains that come from those other asteroids,” Campins says. Remote analyses suggest that some of the bright pieces on Bennu are a good match for the asteroid Vesta. “So we would have a sample return not just from Bennu, but from possibly from Vesta,” Campins says, “or who knows what other asteroid.”</p>



<p>Though this will be NASA’s first sample return of an asteroid, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-nabbed-spacecraft-may-be-outside-solar-system">the Stardust mission</a> in 2006 successfully returned samples of comet Wild-2, also to Utah (<em>SN: 8/14/14</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Next stop: Asteroid Apophis</h4>



<p>OSIRIS-REx’s mission doesn’t end with the package delivery in Utah. “The spacecraft is still healthy,” Lauretta says. After firing a deflection maneuver, “it’s on a route to another asteroid — Asteroid Apophis,” which is about as far away from Earth as Bennu is.</p>



<p>For the extended mission, the satellite gets a new name, OSIRIS-APEX, and is set to orbit Apophis once it arrives in April of 2029, if everything goes to plan. But it won’t be bringing any more samples back to Earth. Unlike your local delivery trucks, OSIRIS-REx was designed to carry only one package and make a single delivery. After Sunday, the spacecraft’s delivery days are done.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouth-taping-trend-sleep-science-slim">Mouth taping may be a trending sleep hack, but the science behind it is slim</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maybe TikTok showed you people putting a little tape on their lips. Or maybe Instagram served you ads for sticky mouth strips. On social media and beyond, a trend called mouth taping is keeping people’s mouths shut at night — helping them breathe through their nose.</p>



<p>Zack Ford, age 38, first tried the trend last month, after recovering from surgery for a deviated septum. Surgery improved his nasal breathing, but at night, he was still sucking air through his lips. In the mornings, Ford says, he’d wake up with a dry mouth and a scratchy throat.</p>





<p>Ford brought up mouth taping during an appointment with his doctor, who didn’t think there was harm in trying. That evening, Ford placed a small square of surgical tape over the middle of his lips and settled into bed. It was the best night’s sleep he’s had in recent memory, he says. “When I woke up, I was like, ‘Holy shit this works!’”</p>



<p>Mouth taping’s benefits have been touted for everything from the dental to the somnial. People may seal their mouths shut to prevent teeth grinding, bad breath, snoring and sleep apnea — or even to boost fitness&nbsp;or get a stronger jaw.</p>



<p>But there’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-6039-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little data yet to support such claims</a>, dentist Jonathan Quigley wrote in a June 23 letter in the <em>British Dental Journal.</em> Before advising patients, Quigley, who works at a dental clinic in England, would like to see more studies and have a better understanding of the potential risks and benefits.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Could taping the mouth improve people’s sleep?</h4>



<p>Some evidence suggests that mouth taping may have merit for helping treat at least one ailment: sleep apnea. Even here, though, the science is skimpy, and the methods are varied. From a thin strip on the lips to a black patch across the mouth, tape types and techniques can differ between people, brands and studies, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions.</p>



<p>Though popularized recently via social media and the 2020 book <em>Breath</em>, the idea of using a device to keep one’s mouth shut while sleeping isn’t all that new. For years, doctors have used chin straps to help some sleep apnea patients keep their mouths closed during continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP treatment, says Krishna Sundar, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine doctor who directs the Sleep-Wake Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People with the condition can have trouble breathing while asleep: muscles relax, the tongue flops back and soft tissues in the throat collapse, blocking the airway. CPAP is the gold standard treatment. The machine delivers air pressure via a mask worn on the face. It’s kind of like pumping up a tire, Sundar says. Turn it on, and the floppy airway inflates. If masks cover only the nose, though, air can leak out the mouth. Chin straps can keep the mouth closed and prevent air leakage. But they don’t work all that well and some people find them uncomfortable, Sundar says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="677" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-677x450.jpg" alt="A photo of a white man lying in bed with a CPAP machine strapped to his head and covering his nose." class="wp-image-3131598" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131598">One treatment for sleep apnea is a CPAP machine, which pumps air into the nose via a face mask. Doctors sometimes pair it with a chin strap to prevent air from venting out the mouth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131598">Alina555/E+/Getty Images Plus</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In sleep studies in his lab, if a person treated with CPAP is venting air through the mouth, Sundar&#8217;s team will stick a tiny strip of tape down their lips to keep them closed. “This teensy tape seems to do the job better than a big chin strap,” he says. It makes the CPAP more effective, which can help people get a better night’s sleep. Sundar calls mouth tape one of the tools in doctors’ tool kits, though he would like to see more data on how well it works.</p>



<p>One effect sleep medicine specialist Andrew Wellman has noticed is that, with people’s lips stuck together, air pumped into their noses sometimes flows into their mouths and puffs out their cheeks. “They look like they’re blowing into a saxophone,” says Wellman, of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Other scientists have also observed this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9992075/#CR16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“mouth puffing” phenomenon</a>, though Wellman’s team doesn’t yet know how it affects sleep apnea. It’s not dangerous, he says, but it might wake you up.</p>





<p>He and his colleagues have combined mouth taping not only with CPAP, but also with a mandibular advancement device for treating the disorder. The device slips into the mouth like a mouthguard and pushes the lower jaw forward, pulling the tongue off the back of the throat. But the device can cause people to breathe through their mouths, potentially rendering the treatment less effective, Wellman says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202109-1050OC?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a study of 21 people with sleep apnea,</a> Wellman’s team covered participants’ lips with clear adhesive strips made by SomniFix, a Maryland manufacturing company that supported the work. Combining the strips with the mouthguard-like device offered an improvement over the device alone, reducing the number of times people stopped breathing per hour, Wellman’s team reported in 2022. It was “a small improvement,” he points out. “We need a bigger study.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bigger trials are needed to test mouth taping’s efficacy</h4>



<p>That seems to be a common denominator of mouth taping research to date. It’s all small preliminary studies, Wellman says. “We don’t have the large clinical trials … that’s what’s missing.”</p>



<p>A 2015 study found that just a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25450408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porous patch on the mouth alone helped treat mild sleep apnea and snoring</a>. And <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9498537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study last year on a different kind of tape</a> reported something similar. But these studies were tiny, with just 30 participants or less. The lack of data from larger trials means that experts’ opinions on mouth taping may be all over the map, Wellman says. “When you ask a doctor about it, you’re going to get all different answers,” he says.</p>



<p>Ear, nose and throat specialist Erich Voigt, for one, isn’t convinced mouth taping is beneficial — or even safe. The trend “definitely raises a few red flags,” says Voigt, of NYU Langone Health. He’s concerned people may impede their breathing or accidentally inhale the tape and choke, though no large studies have tracked this yet.</p>



<p>Mouth taping might be worthwhile in the right scenario, Voigt says, but he advises a cautious approach for anyone trying a new health fad from TikTok. “It&#8217;s probably a good idea [for people] to talk about it with their health care provider before just doing it themselves.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This month's episode of Brain Science features Thomas Metzinger, author of "The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self." Metzinger is a philosopher with a longstanding interest in Philosophy of Mind with a focus on incorporating the findings of neuroscience. We discuss the implications of the discovery that consciousness is a biological process generated by the interaction of the brain, body, and external world. Metzinger also emphasized the importance of considering altered states including dreaming, out of body experiences, and even virtual reality.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href= "http://astore.amazon.com/docartemis-brainscience-20/detail/0465045677"> <em>The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self</em></a><em>,</em> by Thomas Metzinger.</li> <li><a href= "http://astore.amazon.com/docartemis-brainscience-20/detail/0262134179"> <em>Being No One: The Self-Model Theory of Subjectivity</em></a><em>,</em> by Thomas Metzinger.</li> <li>Blanke, et al., "Stimulating Illusory Own-Body Perceptions," <em>Nature</em>, 419:269-270 (2002)  </li> <li>O.
