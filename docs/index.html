                <p>For PLOS, increasing data-sharing rates&mdash;and especially increasing the amount of data shared in a repository&mdash;is a high priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research data is a vital part of the scientific record, essential to both understanding and reproducing published research. And data repositories are the most effective and impactful way to share research data. Not only is deposited data safer and more discoverable, articles with data in a repository have a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20citation%20prediction,studies%20%5B24%E2%80%9328%5D.">25% higher citation rate</a> on average.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">support from the Wellcome Trust</a>, we&rsquo;ve been experimenting with two solutions designed to increase awareness about data repositories and promote data repository use among both authors and readers. One solution didn&rsquo;t achieve its expected outcome in the context we tested it (a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; result) while the other shows promise as a tool for increasing engagement with deposited data. The mixed outcomes are an example of why it&rsquo;s so important to share all research results regardless of their outcome &ndash; whether &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo; results. We hope that our experiences, what we&rsquo;ve learned, and above all the data and results, can help the scholarly communications community to develop new and better solutions to meet the challenges we all face, and advance Open Science.</p>

<h2>PLOS data repository experiments, 2021-2023</h2>



<h3>Experiment 1: Using iconography to highlight data shared in a repository</h3>



<p><strong>Question</strong></p>



<p>Does highlighting data in a repository linked to published research articles with an eye-catching graphic in the form of an Accessible Data icon increase access to the associated dataset?</p>



<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>



<p>We hypothesized that:</p>



<ol><li>the Accessible Data icon would be associated with a statistically significant increase in engagement with datasets, and&nbsp;</li><li>the icon would motivate authors to deposit their data in a repository in order to have the icon applied to their article</li></ol>



<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>



<p>An Accessible Data icon automatically appeared on any article published after 2014 that included a link in its Data Availability Statement to one of three popular data repositories (Dryad, Figshare, and OSF) beginning on March 29 2022. Readers can see and click on the icon from any eligible PLOS journal article and be directed straight to the data in the repository.</p>



<p><strong>Data</strong></p>



<p>Usage data relating to the number of Accessible Data icon link clicks, and internal data from Figshare, one of three selected repositories. A survey of 4,898 researchers, and follow-up interviews with 12 researchers.</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>In the first 12 months of the experiment (April 2022-March 2023) we recorded more than 20,000 reader clicks on the icon across all PLOS properties. Through analysis of 543 Figshare datasets linked to PLOS articles, we observed that in the 12 months prior to the launch of the icon, the average number of views received per month was 2.5, rising to 3.0 in the 12 months following the launch (a statistically significant relative increase of 20%).</p>



<p>Survey respondents who were aware of the Accessible Data feature and who had used a repository were asked to what extent the feature influenced their decision to use a repository: 51% answered that they were influenced either somewhat or strongly by the existence of the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked about the impact of the Accessible Data feature on their future likelihood of submitting to a repository: 40% were more or much more likely to use a repository.</p>



<h3>Experiment 2: Integrating Dryad into the Editorial Manager submission system for <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> to ease repository use</h3>



<p><strong>Question</strong></p>



<p>If authors have the option to submit their data to a repository as part of journal submission, will repository use increase?</p>



<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>



<p>We predicted an absolute increase of 10 percentage points in the use of data repositories by <em>PLOS Pathogens </em>authors, from the 2020 baseline of 25% to 35%.</p>



<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>



<p>A new option appeared on the Attached Files screen in the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> Editorial Manager submission system on October 5 2021, allowing authors to upload research data to Dryad. Authors were redirected into the Dryad system via a popup window where they entered the required information and files and received a Dryad DOI, which they could then include in the Data Availability Statement later in the submission process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details and instructions were added to the journal submission guidelines, Editorial Manager submission system, and PLOS website, and the offering was promoted through established channels including email, social media, and advertising.</p>



<p><strong>Data</strong></p>



<p>Usage data from the Editorial Manager submission system and Dryad. Survey data from 654 researchers who submitted to <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>About 2% of submitting<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> authors (44 submitting author groups) used the integrated repository feature. <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>&rsquo; repository use for the first half of 2023 was 33%, however this appears to be part of an ongoing organic increase that began prior to the experiment.</p>



<p>Among the 574 survey respondents who did not share or plan to share data using the Dryad integration, the biggest reasons included lack of awareness (35%), uncertainty in how to use the integration (26%), and that data had already been uploaded to another repository (21%).</p>



<h2>Our next steps</h2>



<p>As a result of these experiments and our findings, we&rsquo;ve made the decision to discontinue the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> integration with Dryad. PLOS will continue its publisher membership of Dryad and our authors are still encouraged to use it to share data in their own workflows. We look forward to exploring other ways to increase use of repositories. Because of the promising results from the Accessible Data icon, we decided to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">extend the service</a> to include an additional six repositories, for nine total. We look forward to seeing&mdash;and sharing&mdash;the outcomes from this next phase of work.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Paul Moggridge will talk about his conference paper entitled &quot;On Instance Weighted Clustering Ensembles&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Ensemble clustering is a technique which combines multiple clustering results, and
instance weighting is a technique which highlights important instances in a dataset. Both
techniques are known to enhance clustering performance and robustness. In this research,
ensembles and instance weighting are integrated with the spectral clustering algorithm. We
believe this is the first attempt at creating diversity in the generative mechanism using
density-based instance weighting for a spectral ensemble. The proposed approach is
empirically validated using synthetic datasets comparing against spectral and a spectral
ensemble with random instance weighting. Results show that using the instance weighted
sub-sampling approach as the generative mechanism for an ensemble of spectral clustering
leads to improved clustering performance on datasets with imbalanced clusters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/moving-overseas-for-your-phd">Moving overseas for your PhD</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Through this series, we will be sharing first-hand advice on applying for postgraduate courses. Here, Carly Hood reflects on her own experience moving from Australia to the UK for her PhD with plenty of practical advice. </strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_2737008ee0ee4edbaaad8c73004bb3fb~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Image credit: Chad Peltola via Unsplash" ></figure><p><strong>Who am I and what am I interested in?</strong></p>
<p>I am a PhD student at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, originally from Brisbane, Australia. As a member of the Genomic Disorders and Cognitive Development Lab, I work with children who have intellectual impairment of known genetic origin and their families. My research aims to use computational and network approaches to examine how genes mediate brain structure, brain function and cognition with a view to develop targeted support for these kids.</p>

<p><strong>What lead to my decision to move overseas? </strong></p>
<p>Prior to my PhD, I did both my Bachelor of Speech Pathology and Masters in Neuroscience in Brisbane. My clinical work with children who have rare genetic conditions lead to my research interest in isolating biological mechanisms of neurodevelopment. The rarity of these genetic conditions, however, meant that the few institutions working in this area were all located in overseas in countries with larger populations, <a href=""  >namely the United Kingdom, United States and Europe.</a> I had always wanted to move overseas, so this was an excellent opportunity to do so while advancing my professional interests. </p>

<p><strong>Why did I decide to come to the UK?</strong></p>
<p>From the outset, I felt the length and structure of the US programmes were less aligned with what I wanted from a PhD. They are approximately 5- 7 years, as opposed to 4 in the EU and the UK, with the first two years largely comprised of coursework and lab rotations. Given that I had already done a masters and knew the exact research question I wanted to address, the UK and EU programme structures were better suited.</p>

<p><strong>How did I choose programmes to apply to?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to preface here that, often, starting a PhD overseas is a matter of securing both a place in a programme and funding. I first identified the programmes and researchers I was interested in and then noted specific funding requirements. I compiled an excel sheet where I listed all the programmes and their deadlines as well as respective funding options (which may have a separate deadline). </p>
<blockquote>You have to prepare yourself for a prolonged process with pinch-points, but the experience on the other side is incomparable</blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on funding</strong></p>
<p>International students incur fees about triple those of home students and are often eligible for far fewer funding schemes. Further, the dwindling research funds following Brexit has made finding funding even more of a challenge. Each programme will differ. Some offer funded positions, others direct you to other potential sources of funding and others accept self-funded students. Many EU institutes for example provide a generous salary, compared to a tax-free stipend in the UK. I also investigated broad funding schemes that were for Australian students to pursue post-graduate studies overseas. Note that these deadlines are often before the programme application deadlines - sometimes over a year in advance, such as in the case of the John Monash Scholarship in Australia. In writing this article, I’m taken back to the number of late nights I sat hunched, 20 links deep and trying to figure out my eligibility for various funding schemes. PhD applications are time consuming and taxing at the best of times, let alone with the added layer of finding funding. There is a sweet spot between too few and too many applications -  what worked for me was choosing a limited number of programmes (I seriously considered about 4 and prepared applications for 2) where you can really see yourself spending 4 years and focus the funding search to these. </p>

<p><strong>How did I approach my applications?</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the 4 programmes I would actively consider, I started my research. I spoke to each Principle Investigator (you are interviewing your supervisor as much as they are interviewing you), their students (it is indicative of a good work-place culture when supervisors put you in touch with their students specifically) and people I knew of in the field. Another advantage of talking to supervisors is that they may know of other funding opportunities and can provide tailored advice you may not get from admissions websites. Then it came to constructing the application which involved writing research proposals and personal statements, requesting references, and filling out funding applications. </p>
<blockquote>I’ve had to actively remind myself that settling in will take time - eventually I’ll come to a semblance of balance between life in the UK and home</blockquote>
<p><strong>Eventually… the move </strong></p>
<p>Following a protracted process, I was very fortunate to be offered a funded position at the MRC CBU in Cambridge which I promptly accepted. Though this was a huge relief, I now needed to consider the logistics of moving country. This process was tiring and at times stressful, but at least the finish line was in sight. It involved making arrangements for leaving Australia (suspending health insurance, registering for overseas voting, notifying banks etc) and for living in the UK (applying for visas, registering with the NHS, arranging insurance, opening a bank account, transferring funds etc). Of note, your visa requirements may specify an arrival date or periods of time where you cannot be in the country. In my case, my offer conditions needed to be fulfilled so I could be issued a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) to use in my application for a student visa before arriving. It is also important to not underestimate the cost of moving on top of paying for visas immigration health surcharges and general cost-of-living. You may need to save accordingly throughout the process of applying. <a href=""  >A  further consideration is paying any living expenses upfront (as was the case with the college system at Cambridge).</a></p>

<p><strong>Starting the PhD  </strong></p>
<p>As for starting the PhD, I certainly underestimated the challenges of starting a highly involved programme whilst also adjusting a new place of residence. Even coming from somewhere with a reasonably comparable culture with the same language, there have been various points of difference to navigate. I’ve had to actively remind myself that settling in will take time - eventually I’ll come to a semblance of balance between life in the UK and home. It takes time to figure out how to best maintain long-distance relationships with family and friends at home (don’t get me started on the time difference…). I also remind myself that this will be in flux throughout my time here. </p>

<p><strong>Overall… </strong></p>
<p>For anyone who is considering pursuing higher degree research and has also considered moving overseas, my advice is to just start looking! Yes, you have to prepare yourself for a prolonged process with pinch-points as I outlined, but the experience on the other side is incomparable. Higher degree research is a particularly flexible time where you are largely responsible for your individual progress and are therefore afforded periods of flexibility that can be leveraged. In my case this is to travel - it is still astounding to me that I can visit another country for a weekend – and also pursue other personal interests. The added benefit of moving to Cambridge, which has a vibrant international community, is that I have met many like-minded individuals who have gone through similar processes. Thus far, I have relished the experience of moving to a completely unfamiliar country and how this has enriched my life, both personally and professionally. </p><hr><p>This article was written by Carly Hood and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

<p>A large U.S. university press has stopped selling two scholarly books about the philosophers Slavoj Žižek and John Venn due to problems with how the authors cited – or didn’t cite – source material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In both cases, the University of Chicago Press stated on its website that the titles, released in 2023 and 2022, respectively, were “no longer available for sale.” But only “John Venn: A Life in Logic” by <a href="https://lukasmverburgt.com/">Lukas M. Verburgt</a> was “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231109100033/https:/press.uchicago.edu/books/Book-Pages/9780226815510.html">retracted</a>,” according to the publisher.</p>



<p>The author of the other publication – “How Slavoj Became Žižek: The Digital Making of a Public Intellectual” – told us he had been afforded a chance to fix his mistakes. These included “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231109095858/https:/press.uchicago.edu/books/Book-Pages/9780226823508.html">several insufficient, missing, or erroneous citations of source material upon which the author builds his argument</a>,” the University of Chicago Press stated.</p>



<p>“The publisher has given me the opportunity to correct the book and resubmit it for review,” said <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/sociology/our-staff/academic/eliran-bar-el/">Eliran Bar-El</a>, a sociologist at the University of York, in England. “In light of it being an ongoing process, I cannot provide further details until there is a review outcome, which will be reflected appropriately in my publication list. At this time, I would like to genuinely thank the observant readers who have brought this to my attention.”</p>



<p>Verburgt, whose work contains “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231109100033/https:/press.uchicago.edu/books/Book-Pages/9780226815510.html">numerous instances of insufficiently cited source material</a>,” does not appear to have been quite as lucky.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128230"></span>



<p>“I regret the fact that it has not been possible to revise and rectify,” Verburgt, a research and project associate at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences, in Amsterdam, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231101152141/https:/lukasmverburgt.com/Home-Page">wrote on his website</a>. “This has saddened me deeply, also since the consequences have taken a serious toll on me, in different ways.”</p>



<p>The University of Chicago Press declined to comment on the two cases.</p>



<p>On his website, Verburgt said he accepted the decision to pull his book. He explained that he made use “of a 2007 dissertation in several of the biographical chapters” and had not been “as careful as I should have been in ensuring accurate referencing at all places. I’m very sorry about this, especially to the author of the dissertation.”</p>



<p>He did not identify the dissertation in question. But in his book, he acknowledged his debt to the authors of two PhD dissertations, only one of which – “<a href="https://oro.open.ac.uk/59947/">Intersecting Sets: John Venn, Church and University, 1834-1923</a>” by Michelle Clewlow – was published in 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clewlow declined to comment. Her former supervisor at the <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/people/jrw3">Open University, John Wolffe</a>, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I was not previously aware of this matter, but naturally concerned to learn about it as The Open University does take plagiarism very seriously. However, Dr Clewlow tells me that she does not want to comment herself, and especially as I have not seen the book, I will follow her lead and not offer further comment. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verburgt, who did not respond to our requests for comment, wrote on his website:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the process of repeatedly revising the manuscript &#8211; over the course of a period of many years &#8211; several things have gone amiss.&nbsp;<br><em><br></em>The crucial final stages came at a time of great personal turmoil for me and my family. On another level, I’ve always been explicit and open about the importance of the dissertation for the book. I’ve hid neither my debt to the dissertation itself nor its significance for the biographical chapters, which sometimes went beyond my immediate expertise: I’ve referred to it multiple times and also mentioned it explicitly in the acknowledgments. This does not justify the lack of accurate referencing. What it does show is that this inaccuracy has, of course, not been deliberate. I’ve been negligent, but never had malign intentions.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Rebecca Miko will talk about a paper she will soon submit entitled &quot;Decoding the amplitude and slope of continuous signals into spikes with a spiking point neuron model&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In this study, we harness the signal processing potential of neurons, utilizing the
Izhikevich point neuron model to efficiently decode the slope or amplitude of fluctuating
continuous input signals. Using biophysically detailed compartmental neurons often
requires significant computational resources. We present a novel approach to create
behaviours and simulate these interactions in a lower-dimensional space, thereby reducing
computational requirements. We began by conducting an extensive search of the Izhikevich
parameter space, leading to the first significant outcome of our study: i) the
identification of optimal parameter sets for generating slope or amplitude detectors,
thereby achieving signal processing goals using neurons. Next, we compared the performance
of the slope detector we discovered with a biophysically detailed two-compartmental
pyramidal neuron model. Our findings revealed several key observations: ii) bursts
primarily occurred on the rising edges of similar input signals, iii) our slope detector
exhibited bidirectional slope detection capabilities, iv) variations in burst duration
encoded the magnitude of input slopes in a graded manner. Overall, our study demonstrates
the efficient and accurate simulation of dendrosomatic behaviours. Real-time applications
in robotics or neuromorphic hardware can utilize our approach. While biophysically
detailed compartmental neurons are compatible with such hardware, Izhikevich point neurons
are more efficient. This work has the potential to facilitate the simulation of such
interactions on a larger scale, encompassing a greater number of neurons and neuronal
connections for the same computational power.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hummingbirds-fly-spaces-narrow-wings">How hummingbirds fly through spaces too narrow for their wings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hummingbirds are natural acrobats, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/capturing-wonders-hummingbird-flight">twisting their wings</a> in ways that let them fly backward and upside down, unlike any other bird (<em>SN: 1/13/16</em>). New high-speed video now shows how, using a bit of aerial gymnastics, hummingbirds can also slip through gaps narrower than their wingspan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most birds can bend their wings at the wrist, pulling arched wings close to their bodies to navigate their way through dense vegetation like branches. But hummingbird wings aren’t as flexible. Because the wings stick straight out from a hummingbird’s body, getting through tight spaces requires some tricky maneuvering. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Anna’s hummingbirds (<em>Calypte anna</em>) <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.245643" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fly sideways to make it through holes too small</a> for their rigid wings, researchers report November 9 in <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>. To avoid hitting a hole’s sides, the birds also flutter their wings while flying through a tight space rather than using their full range of motion for each wingbeat. After successfully navigating the obstacle a few times, the birds switch it up, flattening their wings against their bodies and shooting through holes like a bullet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="See in slow motion how a hummingbird navigates a narrow gap | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O3-UrtXCpGQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A male Anna’s hummingbird crosses an 8-centimeter-wide opening, smaller than its 12-centimeter wingspan. Viewed from the side and below, the bird flies though the hole at a sideways angle in the first clip, fluttering its wings to avoid hitting the barrier. In the second video clip, the hummingbird tucks its wings back against its body as it passes through the hole like a bullet. The clips show each style of flight first at actual speed and then one-twentieth normal speed.   </figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is a new insight into the amazing capacity of hummingbirds,” says Bret Tobalske, a biomechanist at the University of Montana in Missoula who wasn’t involved with the research. Sideways flight to maneuver through gaps is “pretty remarkable” and highlights how unique hummingbirds are among birds, he says.</p>



<p>The findings could help engineers develop aerial vehicles or robots suitable for navigating tight, complicated spaces. Hummingbirds are among nature’s best fliers and are fantastic at remembering their spatial environment, says Bo Cheng, a mechanical engineer at Penn State not involved in the study. But “the state of the art in drones hasn’t really reached the hummingbird-level flight capability yet,” he says. The rapid beat of hummingbird wings — around 40 beats per second for an Anna’s hummingbird — gives the birds precise control over flight, and engineering needs to catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because hummingbird wings are so rigid, biologist Marc Badger often wondered how the birds dealt with obstacles and tight spaces. While a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, he would watch the tiny birds sip nectar from a feeder. Sometimes individuals would chase one another through the branches of a nearby bush yet emerge unscathed. “And that got me thinking, how in the world are they doing this?”</p>



<p>He and colleagues caught four wild male Anna’s hummingbirds and trained them to fly between two feeders inside an enclosed flight arena. Once the birds were accustomed to the setup, the team introduced barriers with a hole ranging from 6 to 12 centimeters in diameter, equivalent to about half or a full hummingbird wingspan.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In an experimental setup to study how hummingbirds navigate narrow gaps, wild-caught Anna’s hummingbirds (<em>Calypte anna</em>) had to fit through holes smaller than their wingspan to reach a feeder filled with nectar. How they are able to do that was a mystery: While amazingly acrobatic in the air, the tiny birds have stiffer, less bendable wings than other kinds of birds. Although too fast to see at normal speed, this bird tucks its wings close to its body to dive-bomb through the hole.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To the human eye, hummingbirds flying from feeder to feeder appeared as blurs on computer screens monitoring the enclosure, says Badger, now an engineer at Aescape, a therapeutic robotics company based in New York City. But high-speed cameras placed to the side and below the hole showed that the birds first used sideways flight to shimmy their way through narrow gaps. Then each bird switched to diving through the hole.</p>



<p>“It was a shocking revelation to see the sideways scooch,” says Robert Dudley, a physiologist at UC Berkeley. He’d assumed hummingbirds would just use the ballistic style, flattening wings against their bodies, as many songbirds do. “But to slow it up and then go sideways and not drop in altitude was a novel behavior that had never been seen before.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the hummingbirds learned the navigation techniques in the lab or whether they brought a collection of innate strategies with them, Badger says. But all four birds started with sideways flight and transitioned to the bulletlike technique, which could suggest that the same tactics get used in the wild.</p>





<p>Also unknown is why hummingbirds might use either technique. It’s possible that sideways flight offers flexibility to reverse course around obstacles that might be hiding predators like cats, Badger says. But because the wings continue to flap, feathers can also hit objects and possibly break. “One story that I tell myself,” Badger says, “is that once they get a sense of what’s on the other side and a sense of their surroundings, then they switch over to this ballistic technique to avoid the consequences.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grassland-forest-homes-us-fires">Grassland and shrubland fires destroy more U.S. homes than forest fires</a></h4>

              
                <p>Forest fires can devastate vast swaths of land, but in the United States, another category of conflagrations takes the title of most destructive.</p>



<p>Of the homes destroyed in wildfires across the contiguous United States from 1990 to 2020, 64 percent — nearly 11,000 — were razed by <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk7118" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk7118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grassland and shrubland fires</a>, researchers report in the Nov. 10 <em>Science</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We often think about forest fires because that’s what we see on the news … they’re dramatic, they’re huge, they’re intense,” says ecologist Volker Radeloff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, “but grassland and shrubland fires can also be quite destructive.” For instance, the 2023 Lahaina fire on the Hawaiian island of Maui, fueled by invasive wild grasses, killed at least 98 people and destroyed some 2,200 buildings.</p>





<p>For the new study, Radeloff and his colleagues analyzed three decades of data on wildfire occurrence, land use and housing, hoping to learn more about what factors fuel such destructive blazes.</p>



<p>The team found that about 337,000 square kilometers of grasslands and shrublands burned from 1990 to 2020, compared with about 144,000 square kilometers burned by forest fires. Though forest fires were about twice as likely as grassland fires to burn down homes they encountered, the much larger expanse burned by grassland and shrubland fires helped make them more destructive overall.</p>



<p>The data also revealed that U.S. wildfire risk had risen substantially. Today, roughly 148,000 houses stand in areas where wildfires have burned before — that’s more than twice as many as in 1990. About half of those additional homes were built on land that had already burned prior to 1990, the team found, while the rest were already standing when a blaze burned through.</p>



<p>Radeloff hopes more people will consider their wildfire risk and take steps to prepare, be that planning evacuation routes or fireproofing their homes. Evading wildfire danger, it seems, takes more than getting out of the woods.</p>

<p>A year after the authors of two papers contacted the marketing journal where they had been published requesting retraction, the journal has pulled one, but decided to issue a correction for the other. </p>



<p>In April, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/12/journal-hasnt-retracted-super-size-me-paper-six-months-after-authors-request/">we reported</a> that the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> was investigating “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/38/6/1047/1790951">Super Size Me: Product Size as a Signal of Status</a>,” originally published in 2012, and “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/43/1/68/2379624">Dynamics of Communicator and Audience Power: The Persuasiveness of Competence versus Warmth</a>,” published in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors had asked to retract the papers in October 2022 after other researchers found inconsistencies in the statistical calculations of the “Super Size Me” paper and could not replicate the results. The article had been cited nearly 200 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. It attracted attention from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/us/a-new-linkage-offers-possibilities-in-the-anti-obesity-campaign.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/11/04/142019920/do-people-pick-super-sized-portions-to-boost-their-social-status">NPR</a>, among other outlets, which linked the findings to the rise in obesity in the United States. An analyst also found issues in the 2016 paper, which has been cited 71 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we published our previous story, <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/carolyn-yoon">Carolyn Yoon</a>, the chair of the journal’s policy board and a professor of management and marketing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor’s Stephen M. Ross School of Business, told us the board was still waiting on a report from the special committee investigating the matter. “We hope to have a decision by the end of this month,” she said in April 2023. </p>



<span id="more-128227"></span>



<p>In June, the journal published expressions of concern for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad037/7192126">both</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad036/7192125">articles</a> (which continued to be cited). Both notices stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On October 22, 2022, the journal’s Policy Board received information about problems with the data in this article. We alert readers that the Policy Board’s assessment is ongoing. In the interim, we advise them to exercise caution when interpreting the data, results, and conclusions in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On October 29 of this year, the journal retracted the “Super Size Me” paper and published a correction to the other article. The policy board also published a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad057/7325346?searchresult=1">note</a> about the two articles that stated: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It was the initial understanding of the Journal’s Policy Board that after the authors identified methodological issues with both articles in 2022, they disagreed about how best to address them and asked the Policy Board, which comprises organizational representatives appointed by its sponsoring organizations, to determine how to proceed. In the interim, Expressions of Concern were published in June 2023.</p>



<p>The 2012 article has since been retracted at https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad055. A correction to the 2016 article has also now been published at https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad056.</p>



<p>The Policy Board thanks the investigative committee members for their handling of the latter case.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad055/7325344?login=false">notice</a> read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article is being retracted following the discovery of a set of statistical errors in studies 1 and 6, which cannot be explained as the authors no longer have the data. Given these errors, the authors concluded that the claims of the paper are significantly challenged, and the authors no longer have confidence in the results as reported. The authors state that the hypothesized link between power and consumption deserves future empirical consideration before the field draws any firm conclusions about this relationship.</p>



<p>There is empirical evidence, available upon request from the authors, that the results from study 1 can be replicated and that reexamination of the data for study 3 replicated all the results initially reported.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The correction <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucad056/7325345">notice</a> acknowledged that two of the paper’s three authors, <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/rucker_derek_d.aspx#research=page1">Derek Rucker</a> of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Chicago and <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/detail/ag2514">Adam Galinsky</a> of Columbia Business School in New York City, had requested a retraction. The investigative committee recommended a correction, instead. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Reexamination of the data in the article by the investigative committee revealed a newly discovered series of irregular data patterns. None of the tests performed through the reexamination of the data were considered or performed by the authors at the time of publication, and the authors were unaware of these patterns at that time. Of note, reexamination efforts found that test statistics reported in the article were replicable.</p>



<p>None of the omissions in the experimental design were intentional. As the sole individual responsible for data collection, processing, and analysis, the first author assumes full responsibility for the inadvertent lack of communication regarding how the data were collected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rest of the notice detailed a mismatch between the data for one experiment and the results in the paper, reported a corrected statistical value, and explained how “the description of the experimental procedure unintentionally omitted important design elements that could mislead readers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/david-dubois">David Dubois</a>, now a professor at the Fontainebleau, France campus of <a href="https://www.insead.edu/">INSEAD</a>, is the first author of both articles. We emailed him for comment and received an auto-reply that he had “very no email access” and to expect a “significant delay” in getting a response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rucker told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Adam and I don’t have a comment about either the 2012 or 2016 paper. We requested retraction of both papers, and we no longer endorse either paper. However, we also agreed to abide by whatever decision JCR made after their investigative process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Yoon about the length of the investigation, and she told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I don&#8217;t have any comments beyond what&#8217;s stated in the notes accompanying the retraction and correction. We applied due process in accordance with the journal&#8217;s policies.</p>



<p>The investigative committee&#8217;s work took a few months to complete. And then everything else including all communications back and forth with authors, policy board, and the publisher took many more months.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Aaron Charlton, who maintains <a href="https://openmkt.org/">OpenMKT.org</a>, a site aimed at improving evidence quality in academic publications in marketing and consumer behavior, was among the researchers who identified issues in the studies and informed the authors of his findings. Last July, he left a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/12/journal-hasnt-retracted-super-size-me-paper-six-months-after-authors-request/#comment-2174318">comment</a> on our story about the journal’s investigation that said they had decided not to retract the articles.</p>



<p>We asked him what seemed to have changed, and he told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My understanding of the retract/don&#8217;t retract fiasco is this: JCR policy committee had decided not to retract either article. I pointed out that it was ridiculous that they would refuse to retract an article at the authors&#8217; request. Many others agreed. Then, JCR decided they would honor the authors&#8217; request. They now claim that they didn&#8217;t know the authors were united in asking for the retraction of the 2012 article and they thought their purpose was to adjudicate between the authors. Hence the decision not to retract initially. I guess they didn&#8217;t think it was super important, so they didn&#8217;t take their time to gather all of the facts before making their decision.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Charlton also said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;m not super happy with the outcome. Literally all of their communications with the public have been hostile toward whistleblowers and deferential towards the data anomalist. For example, in the retraction statement they point out that the anomalist got the study to replicate but they fail to mention that an independent third party failed to replicate the study (which is what initiated this whole thing really). Who cares if a data anomalist claims they can replicate their own (now retracted) paper? What about source credibility?</p>



<p>I am familiar with the forensic analysis of the 2016 paper, which JCR says is fine. The paper is not fine. Much more information is forthcoming on this. Some of the analysis has already been leaked. Keep in mind that the other two authors both requested retraction of the data due to unexplainable data anomalies that massively supported the hypothesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not JCR&#8217;s only problem. Only one JCR study has ever been successfully replicated by an independent third party. 28 attempts to replicate JCR papers have failed. I maintain the replication tracker for the field of marketing here: https://openmkt.org/research/replications-of-marketing-studies/ They may claim that if you change a thing here or there you can get a study to replicate but I only count exact replications. If you try to exactly replicate a JCR study you can expect to run into difficulty as 28 out of 29 other replication teams have.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-12-months-hottest-record-climate">The last 12 months were the hottest on record</a></h4>

              
                <p>The last 12 months were the <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/earths-hottest-12-month-streak-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hottest in 150 years of recordkeeping</a> — and probably in the last 125,000 years — thanks to human-caused climate change, a new report finds.</p>



<p>From November 2022 through October 2023, the planet’s average temperature was about 1.3 degrees Celsius higher than the average temperature from 1850 to 1900, say researchers with the nonprofit group Climate Central. That’s just shy of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-communication-numbers-goals">1.5-degree threshold often cited</a> as a benchmark for avoiding irreversible impacts on the climate (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>).</p>





<p>And over the past year, about 1 in 4 people around the world experienced a climate change–driven heat wave that lasted at least five days, the scientists found.</p>



<p>The report, released on November 9, comes just ahead of the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, which begins on November 30. That’s intentional, says Andrew Pershing, vice president for science at Climate Central. There is no doubt that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-ipcc-un-report-action-solutions">fossil fuels are driving most of this heat</a>, and it’s to be hoped that the world’s nations will take note of these findings, he says (<em>SN: 4/4/22</em>).</p>



<p>Global average numbers can be hard to grasp. So the new report also quantifies temperatures that people around the world are actually experiencing day-to-day, and how much those are attributable to climate change, Pershing says.</p>



<p>“We have these super important global numbers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">such as the 1.5- or 2-degree warming targets</a>, but that isn’t the experience that people on planet Earth have,” he says (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). “We wanted to develop a way to really localize that experience … to talk about how climate change influenced that day’s temperatures on any given day anywhere in the planet.”</p>



<p>To that end, the analysis used Climate Central’s <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-shift-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Shift Index</a>, or CSI, a system first described by the organization in 2022. CSI is a daily local temperature attribution system that uses a combination of observational data and climate simulations to determine the likelihood that local temperature variations are attributable to climate change.</p>



<p>Extreme heat is a relative term, dependent on both place and time. So, in this report, the researchers considered extreme heat for a given location to be daily temperatures that would have been in the 99th percentile for that place from 1991 to 2020 — temperatures, in other words, that locals would recognize as insanely hot.</p>



<p>Using that index with data from hundreds of countries, states, provinces and major cities, the researchers found that about 90 percent of the world’s population, or 7.3 billion people, experienced at least 10 days of extreme temperatures in the last year that were very strongly affected by climate change.</p>



<p>Those days had a CSI rating of at least 3, indicating that human-caused climate change made those temperatures at least three times as likely. Nearly 3 out of 4 people experienced over a month of those temperatures.</p>



<p>The report also reveals stark inequities in the burden of climate change around the world. Earth’s least developed countries, including many nations in sub-Saharan Africa and in Southeast Asia, had a relatively high average CSI of 2, the report notes, though they have contributed the least amount of fossil fuel emissions.</p>



<p>But climate impacts are also accelerating in many of the world’s richest countries, including the United States. The last 12 months saw brutal heat waves across much of the southern United States. Houston sweltered through a 22-day streak of extreme heat, where each consecutive day topped 38° C (100° Fahrenheit). That was the longest such extreme heat streak of the 700 cities examined with a population of at least 1 million people.</p>





<p>The CSI analysis is similar to the analyses performed by the consortium World Weather Attribution, or WWA, which looks for the fingerprints of human-caused climate change <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-heat-wave-summer">in specific extreme events around the world</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/23</em>).</p>



<p>WWA examined a handful of extreme heat waves over the last 12 months, all of which were strongly attributable to climate change, says Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who has led many of WWA’s attribution studies.</p>



<p>An immediate reduction of fossil fuels won’t shut off some effects of a century of emissions, including heat absorbed by the oceans or melted glaciers, Otto says. But global temperatures would stop rising, and heat waves would stop getting worse, she says. Keeping the planet below a 1.5-degree warming threshold “is in reach,” she says, “if we want it to be in reach.”</p>



<p>The last 12 months <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">saw the onset of an El Niño climate pattern</a>, which can bring higher global temperatures on top of the longer-term global warming trend (<em>SN: 6/15/23</em>). But the greatest temperature impact from El Niño generally takes a year or so to develop, as the heat gets disseminated around the globe, Pershing says.</p>



<p>The previous 12-month record was set from October 2015 to September 2016, as heat from a strong El Niño event spread around the globe. That record — where the global average was 1.29 degrees Celsius higher than the average preindustrial temperature — was tied earlier this year, for the period ending in September 2023.</p>



<p>That means that, as the El Niño pattern continues to develop into next year, 2024 will probably smash records once again.</p>

<p>A business school in Pakistan has fired a marketing professor after finding he had “damaged the repute” of the university and its scholarly journal, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a LinkedIn post, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230605074653/https://www.iba.edu.pk/faculty-profile.php?ftype=&amp;id=mmbutt">Muhammad Mohsin Butt</a>, the now-fired professor, shared a picture of the table of contents of a 2015 issue of <em>Business Review</em>, published by the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), in Karachi. The contents listed seven case studies authored by two other professors at the school:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two authors are still employed at IBA: <a href="https://oric.iba.edu.pk/profile.php?id=nafghan">Nasir Afghan</a> as an assistant professor of marketing, and <a href="https://www.iba.edu.pk/team-registrar.php">Mohammad Asad Ilyas</a> as registrar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal issue “once existed but was taken back immediately after its release internally,” the school’s inquiry found, although the articles’ authors and a former editor of the journal deny this action constituted retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://oric.iba.edu.pk/profile.php?id=habutt">Hilal Butt</a> (no relation to Mohsin Butt), chair of IBA’s finance department and the editor of <em>IBA Business Review </em>at the time of the LinkedIn post, replied with a link to the <a href="https://ir.iba.edu.pk/businessreview/vol10/iss2/">online table of contents</a> for the issue. The webpage showed different article titles and authors, and Hilal Butt wrote that “there is nothing published anything as reported.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Afghan, Ilyas, and Hilal Butt subsequently filed complaints against Mohsin Butt with IBA, according to a copy of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MB-inquiry-report.pdf">grievance committee report</a> obtained by Retraction Watch. Their complaints alleged that Mohsin Butt had posted “factually incorrect information” and publicly damaged “the reputation of the institute and its establishments,” as well as using “inappropriate language and an arrogant attitude.”</p>



<p>Mohsin Butt told the grievance committee he had posted about the issue because “he wanted to expose the corruption of both faculty members and expose the situation at the <em>Business Review</em>,” according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After investigating the matter, the committee concluded that the issue of <em>Business Review</em>&nbsp;&#8220;was once published but was taken back possibly due to multiple reasons, the major being the one that all seven case studies were authored by two faculty members namely Dr. Nasir Afghan and Dr. Asad Ilyas based on students work.&#8221;</p>



<p>The committee also found that Hilal Butt “constantly engaged in concealing the facts” and “took a faulty approach of outright denial of the existence of 10(2) issue of the <em>Business Review</em> that was replaced with the one now available on the journal website.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, IBA issued a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MB-warning-letter.pdf">warning letter</a> to Mohsin Butt in June that stated the grievance committee had determined Afghan and Ilyas’ complaints were “valid,” and he had violated the school’s code of conduct. The letter read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Committee has observed that your LinkedIn post has brought an eight-year-old internal matter related to IBA&#8217;s Business Review journal to public notice. You have deliberately highlighted only a partial view of the case besides using derogatory language which had simultaneously damaged the repute of IBA, the journal, Dr. Nasir Afghan, and Dr. Asad Ilyas.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The warning letter directed Mohsin Butt “to write an unconditional apology in a letter and on LinkedIn within 7 working days to Dr. Nasir Afghan and Dr. Asad Ilyas for damaging their reputation publicly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mohsin Butt did not issue such an apology. On November 2, IBA <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Employment-Termination-Letter-Dr.-Muhammad-Mohsin-Butt.pdf">terminated his employment</a>. The school has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In response to our request for comment, Afghan shared a letter from his lawyer to Mohsin Butt accusing him of defamation and threatening to sue if he didn’t apologize. “Matter is now court jurisdiction,” Afghan said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ilyas told us Mohsin Butt had complaints with IBA about subsidized housing, workload, salary, performance appraisal, and other matters.&nbsp; Because Ilyas’ office denied some of these grievances, &#8220;vindictive/vengeful smear/ bullying campaigns are being run to pressure the institute into giving preferential and against policy benefits.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mohsin Butt denied he had posted about the journal issue because of his grievances with the school. Ilyas’ “claims look like classical diversions from the core issue,” said Mohsin Butt, who has posted extensively about the case on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-mohsin-butt-61697b1/recent-activity/all/">LinkedIn account</a>. He initially posted the photo on LinkedIn because “I just thought its [sic] hilarious to share what they did.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ilyas and Hilal Butt disputed that anything inappropriate had happened with the journal issue, and said it had not been retracted because it had never appeared online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Anything that was never added to the literature and or body of knowledge cannot be retracted,” Ilyas told us. He explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Business Review Special Edition was cases on local businesses of Pakistan, which were submitted to the journal to be published as a separate “special edition”, not part of their regular research publications. The editor-in-chief disagreed with the idea of a special edition and asked to withdraw and cancel/destroy the copies printed. It was never added to any database, archived, uploaded on the website, etc. The editor-in-chief then asked to resubmit for the publication in regular edition to which both prospective authors didn’t agree as the concept was to build a local case repository rather than articles. Additionally, MBA students were recognized in the then-printed copies as well.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The committee investigating the complaints against Mohsin Butt “probably did not do a real in-depth background check on the reasons behind the cancellation of the special edition business review,” Ilyas wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He attached what appeared to be a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Email-from-Dr-Ishrat-Hussain.pdf">2016 email</a> from <a href="https://ishrathusain.iba.edu.pk/">Ishrat Husain</a>, then IBA’s dean and director, directing staff to “withdraw” the issue in which Ilyas and Afghan’s case studies had appeared. Husain has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All the copies of this edition should be returned and destroyed,” stated the email, which also called for the journal’s editor to be replaced and the editorial board “reconstituted.” The email continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Afghan and Mr. Asad [Ilyas] can submit these case studies to the new Editor who would arrange careful scrutiny by the peer reviewers. In case one, a few or all the cases are accepted for publication they should appear in the Case study section of the regular issue of Business Review. No special edition should be allowed in future as this dilutes the quality of the journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another email from Husain, sent earlier this year and seen by Retraction Watch, confirmed he “had instructed withdrawal of&nbsp; all copies of the issue within one hour of its coming out of the Press. Staff&nbsp; were asked to go from desk to desk of the recipients of the issue and get the copies&nbsp; back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hilal Butt, who was editor of <em>Business Review</em> from September 2020 until earlier this year, also told us the 2015 issue with the case studies “had never been issued by the IBA Business Review for the readers, it had never been deposited anywhere, therefore the question of retraction had never been raised.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal did publish a notice “after this episode,” he said. The notice, which appears on the journal’s general information <a href="https://ir.iba.edu.pk/businessreview/about.html">page</a>, states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please be informed that IBA Business Review has never released or archived any Case Studies/SPECIAL EDITION. All officially released volumes and issues of the journal since its inception in 2006 are accessible at https://ir.iba.edu.pk/businessreview, archived at Portico, and indexed in IDEAS, REPEC, JEL, EBSCO, DOAJ, and CrossRef.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hilal Butt further elaborated on his view of what constitutes a retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Now I need not to remind someone from the retraction watch that what retraction entails. But let me give my impression. In the world of academic publications/literature, the term Retraction refers to the process of correction of literature in the event a particular intellectual contribution (published material) is found to be plagued with some form of academic dishonesty, such as forgery, plagiarism and/or other forms of data manipulation etc. This Retraction can only be exercised if the intellectual contribution in question has already become part of the body of knowledge. This can only happen if a particular intellectual contribution is ever deposited to any online repository. If it is not deposited to any online repository, it cannot, therefore, be a part of the literature because it is not available in the public domain. Hence, it cannot be archived, it cannot be cited and would obviously not have any readership base. If something is not part of the literature, then how can a process of Retraction be initiated to correct it from the literature? Retraction, as per COPE, follows a prescribed procedure. First of all, the whole issue cannot be retracted (each case study or a paper has to be retracted on an individual basis). Secondly, Retraction necessitates an editor’s note. Thirdly, there have to be grounds to establish the case of retraction (as part of the formal retraction procedure) – such as forgery, plagiarism etc.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/head-lice-human-migration-evolution">Head lice hitched a ride on humans to the Americas at least twice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lice have been bugging humans for as long as our species has been around, and the insects’ genes record the story of their hosts’ global voyages, a study finds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lice DNA suggests that the scalp stowaways <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rode humans to the New World at least twice</a> — once from Asia many millennia ago, and again much more recently via European colonists, researchers report November 8 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>Head lice (<em>Pediculus humanus capitis</em>) can’t jump or fly. They can disperse only by crawling, leaving them closely tied to the movements of their human hosts, says Marina Ascunce, an evolutionary geneticist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service in Gainesville, Fla.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Ascunce and her colleagues analyzed DNA extracted from 274 head lice found on people from 25 locations around the world, comparing differences between 15 small sections of the louse genetic instruction book. The lice clustered genetically into two groups — one found in Europe and North America, and the other in Asia and Central America, the team found.</p>



<p>Central America’s link to Asian populations, the researchers suggest, is the result of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cave-mexico-stone-artifacts-humans-americas-early">humans crossing a land bridge into the Americas</a> many thousands of years ago (<em>SN: 7/22/20</em>).&nbsp;The other lice group prevalent in the Americas reflects the more recent colonization of the region by Europeans.</p>



<p>By acting as storytellers, lice may not be “all bad,” Ascunce says. “They can help us to see our history also.”</p>



<p>The strong genetic split between European and Asian lice was a surprise to Ascunce and her colleagues. Studying slower-evolving lice genes than what the team studied this time in future research might help researchers solve how that genetic rift formed and possibly yield insights into older events in human prehistory and the evolutionary changes spurred by them, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, studying lice evolution could provide a “fast-forward” perspective on the evolution of humans and other hosts because the bloodsucking parasites have faster generation times and mutation rates, says evolutionary biologist Andrew Sweet who was not involved in the new research. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“You might be able to see [evolutionary] patterns that emerge from the parasites before you would see them in the hosts,” says Sweet, of Arkansas State University in Jonesboro.</p>



<p>Using the team’s approach with other parasites, Ascunce and her colleagues say, could also tell researchers more about the evolutionary history of other host species that are currently poorly understood.</p>

<p><strong>Off to Mercury with a cold glance</strong> —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mercury-cold-glance"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;November 10, 1973</p>



<p>Mercury ho! Mariner 10 is on its way. Venus ho, too. Launched at 12:45 a.m. (EST) on Nov. 3, Mariner should pass within 3,330 miles of Venus on Feb. 5. It will then become the first spacecraft to use a technique … of letting the gravitational field of one planet bend its course around toward a second objective. That’s Mercury, of course, where it will arrive less than two months later.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Mariner 10 arrived on schedule, becoming the first probe to visit Mercury and map a portion of its cratered, moonlike terrain. The gravity assist that Mariner used to reach its destination is now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rendezvous-pluto">a trusted way</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-aiming-sun">get around the solar system</a> (<em>SN: 7/12/15; SN: 7/5/18</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/messenger-mercury">NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft</a> used gravity assists from Mercury, Venus and Earth to reach an orbit around Mercury in 2011, where the probe mapped the rest of the planet’s surface, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smallest-planet-yields-big-surprises">uncovered evidence of past volcanism</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-rock-sun-turns-out-have-ice">spotted signs of water ice and organic compounds</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/11</em>; <em>SN: 3/22/12; SN: 11/30/12</em>). </p>



<p>Today, the international <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">BepiColombo</a> mission is using gravitational assists from Mercury — following one from Earth and two from Venus — to steer itself into eventual orbit around the planet (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>). Beginning in 2025, BepiColombo will investigate Mercury’s innards and magnetic field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/room-temperature-superconductor-retracted-ranga-dias">A controversial room-temperature superconductor result has now been retracted </a></h4>

              
                <p>A stunning claim of a room-temperature superconductor that grabbed headlines  has fizzled. The paper was&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06774-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retracted November 7</a>&nbsp;from the journal&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>, making for a trio of high-profile retractions for physicist Ranga Dias of the University of Rochester.</p>



<p>The retraction is no surprise to the scientific community, many of whom had expressed hefty skepticism about Dias’ work, following the earlier retractions and many other researchers’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-research-controversy-electricity-temperature">failures to reproduce Dias’ results</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 9/5/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was about time,” says theoretical physicist Lilia Boeri of the Sapienza University of Rome.</p>





<p>In March, Dias and colleagues reported in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>&nbsp;that<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-room-temperature-scrutiny"> a compound of lutetium, hydrogen and nitrogen was a superconductor at room temperature</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/23</em>). The practical use of most superconductors is limited by the need to cool them to low temperatures, or squeeze them to extremely high pressures. Dias’ claimed material required neither of these conditions, a feat that could have revolutionary implications for electronics if correct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eight of the paper’s 11 coauthors requested the retraction, stating that “the published paper does not accurately reflect the provenance of the investigated materials, the experimental measurements undertaken and the data-processing protocols applied.”</p>



<p>Compared to the previous retractions, “this is much more worrying,” Boeri says. “This is not just somebody who is doing some honest mistakes.”</p>



<p>In addition to the coauthors’ concerns, outside researchers had raised questions<em>&nbsp;</em>about the reliability of the data, the retraction note states.</p>



<p>A statement provided by Dias reads, in part, “Ranga Dias refutes any allegations of research misconduct and remains steadfast in supporting all the scientific conclusions presented in the paper.”</p>



<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/room-temperature-superconductor-retraction-physics">earlier claim</a>&nbsp;of a room-temperature superconductor by Dias and colleagues was retracted from&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>&nbsp;in September 2022 (<em>SN: 10/3/22</em>). And one of Dias’&nbsp;&nbsp;papers on a different topic, published in&nbsp;<em>Physical Review Letters</em>, was&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.079902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retracted in August</a>.</p>



<p>Physicist Jorge Hirsch of the University of California, San Diego, who raised concerns about Dias’ work leading to the September 2022 retraction, cites a lack of data availability as an underlying issue in the field. “It’s a very serious problem,” Hirsch says. “In the case of Dias and the University of Rochester, when I contacted them and said there’s an obligation for researchers to release underlying data, they didn’t pay any attention to me.”</p>



<p>Despite the shadow cast on the Dias group’s result, at least one researcher believes the superconductor could still be real.&nbsp;Materials chemist Russell Hemley of the University of Illinois Chicago, who previously was part of a team that discovered a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hydrogen-rich-compound-may-be-record-breaking-superconductor">high-temperature superconductor of lanthanum and hydrogen</a>, was one of the few scientists to claim a confirmation of Dias’ result, using a sample created in collaboration with Dias’ group (<em>SN: 9/10/18</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our own measurements on the material, carried out independently in our lab, show the same signatures of very high-temperature superconductivity that we found for the lanthanum hydride,” Hemley says. While other researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02733-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have questioned </a>whether Hemley and colleagues’ reported results convincingly confirm superconductivity, Hemley has defended their findings and says he is confident that additional groups will eventually replicate the result too.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Dias’ work is under scrutiny by his university. In a statement released November 7, University of Rochester officials noted that the school “takes very seriously the recent concerns” and “has a comprehensive investigation underway into questions raised about the integrity of data across multiple papers led by Professor Dias.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/expanding-definition-loneliness-belonging">Why scientists are expanding the definition of loneliness</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">For centuries, the Turkana pastoralists of northern Kenya have followed the water. Families once moved about 15 times a year in search of watering holes for their cows, donkeys, camels, goats and sheep.</p>



<p>But the Turkana people’s seasonal way of life has become precarious in recent decades. With drought and ongoing fighting across the region, many women and children stay put while men roam the landscape — often at their own peril. Violence has forced many families to flee for their lives at a moment’s notice. Separated from their livestock, these families eke out a living along the edges of cities or bide their time in displacement camps ringed by tightly woven fencing.</p>





<p>Friendships built on the exchange of livestock also disintegrate. “When no one has any animals, how can we help one another?” a Turkana woman asked anthropologist Ivy Pike, who has worked in the region for 25 years, during an interview.</p>



<p>The suffering within these communities is profound, says Pike, of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Unable to safely comb the landscape for medicinal plants, such as herbs to stem postpartum bleeding or curb fevers in children, women find it hard to fulfill their role as nurturers. Men’s identities, meanwhile, are often so bound up in owning livestock that the Turkana language has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32799766/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a word to describe a man without animals</a> — <em>ekebotonit</em>.</p>



<p>“The loneliness of having no animals holds a particular place of distress that transcends the food and livelihood that livestock offer,” Pike and a colleague wrote in 2020 in <em>Transcultural Psychiatry</em>. “An <em>ekebotonit</em> … not only loses his sense of purpose and the companionship herds offer, but according to the Turkana, becomes erased — a man with no say in society.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="773" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030.jpg" alt="A young Turkana man in northern Kenya walks away from the camera while several cattle walk in front of him." class="wp-image-3132779" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030-510x383.jpg 510w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030-773x580.jpg 773w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline1_1030-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132779">A young Turkana man in northern Kenya takes his cattle to a dam for water. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132779">Francis Nkayo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>These experiences of loneliness among many Turkana people demonstrate how the feeling defies simple characterization — it’s more than social disconnection. That complexity is seen in cultures worldwide. In a study done in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, for instance, many respondents attributed their loneliness to several factors that left them feeling disconnected. One woman missed going to the grocery store, anthropologist Michelle Parsons of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff reported in 2022 in <em>SSM-Mental Health</em>. Another woman longed to browse the stacks at the library, a typically solitary activity.</p>



<p>Efforts to broaden the definition of loneliness to include a feeling of disconnect from animals, places, habits, rituals and even the weather have been gaining momentum across the social sciences. In October 2020, for instance, Parsons coauthored the introduction to a special issue on the anthropology of loneliness in <em>Transcultural Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>Getting a handle on the constituents of loneliness — and its flip side, belonging — is not just an academic pursuit; it’s a matter of public health, research suggests. In a May advisory, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/connection/index.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared loneliness a public health epidemic</a>, citing findings from numerous studies: Loneliness appears to increase a person’s risk of heart disease by 29 percent and risk of stroke by 32 percent. In older adults, chronic loneliness is associated with a 50 percent increase in the risk of developing dementia. Social isolation can increase the risk for premature death by 29 percent.</p>



<p>Broadening concepts of loneliness can help expand the toolkit of possible interventions, Parsons says.</p>



<p>Tethering people to the wider world could even help people recognize and address climate change, suggests geographer Sarah Wright of the University of Newcastle in Callaghan, Australia. This process begins, she says, by “building intentional relationships with more than human beings.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ancient forms of belonging</h4>





<p>To understand belonging and by extension loneliness, Wright has looked to Indigenous communities. Though these communities span the globe and are comprised of myriad practices and languages, broadly speaking, they share a belief that well-being stems from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/apology-indigenous-communities-mental-health-rethink">harmony between people and the planet</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/23, p. 14</em>).</p>



<p>Wright and colleagues recently studied the stories the Aboriginal Yolŋu people tell through <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/songspirals-bring-country-into-existence-singing-more-than-human-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ritualized songs known as songspirals</a>. This ancient practice explores the connections among place, culture, people and the stories they tell. Wright’s team, including members of the Yolŋu community and drawing on the work of the Gay’wu Group of Women, published an analysis of one matriarch’s songspiral in 2022 in <em>Qualitative Inquiry</em>. In keeping with the Yolŋu world view, Bawaka Country, the tribe’s homeland in northern Australia, is listed as the lead author.</p>



<p>While lying on her deathbed, the matriarch began singing about her place, her sense of belonging, within a wide web of human and nonhuman relationships. In accordance with her people’s tradition, the matriarch saw this last journey as taking her to the sea; she envisioned herself as a whale. “I can see the saltwater carrying me, moving together with the current; carrying me further into the depths of the ocean, where the foundation of my bloodline lies.”</p>



<p>The matriarch built from an ancient script, one that spirals outward from a voiceless land, explain the authors. That song always starts something like: “At the beginning of time someone had to talk for the land, it was quiet, nothingness. And then it began with the sound from deep within the water, ‘Hmmm hmmm.’ That was the starting point.…”</p>



<p>From there, the matriarch’s song moves forward and backward across generations to anchor people in the broader arc of time, Wright says. The matriarch sings of swimming alongside her deceased grandmother; she sings of her daughters, her granddaughters and her great-granddaughters.</p>



<p>The song also anchors the Yolŋu people to their homeland by giving voice to whale migratory patterns, key fishing grounds and physical connections across the land and sea. The songspiral “maps the land from the sea point of view,” Wright says.</p>



<p>The matriarch’s songspiral shows how for the Yolŋu people, nonhuman relationships are as real as relationships with humans, Wright says. With such relationships, people feel a sense of belonging in the world. Without them, people feel lost.</p>



<p>As the matriarch’s daughter Merrkiyawuy explains in the paper, if the laws of balance between people and land, or country, are broken, “the spiral can come tumbling down and burst. That’s what we say, it will burst open and just float and you will be like a leaf floating in the air, nothing controlling you … if that spiral is burst open, then the songs disappear.”</p>



<p>Losing place — through migration, development, climate change or some other cause — can <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:MEDI.0000034412.24293.bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manifest as loneliness</a> in Indigenous communities, other research suggests. For instance, in 1987, anthropologist Theresa O’Nell of the University of Oregon in Eugene began an 18-month study of depression among the Salish and Pend d’Oreille peoples living on the Flathead Reservation in Montana. But whenever O’Nell asked people if they had ever been depressed, they would invariably talk about loneliness.</p>

<p>“Time after time, I asked about ‘depression,’ and time after time, I was told about ‘loneliness,’ ” O’Nell recounted in the 2004 issue of <em>Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry</em>. As an example, O’Nell cited “the loneliness of an elder lamenting the loss of a song that is no longer sung.”</p>



<p>O’Nell attributed this loneliness to several causes, including a feeling of exclusion from society, an existential feeling of separation between the self and a higher power, and bereavement over losing rituals and language. The Salish and Pend d’Oreille peoples, she observed, did not see their loneliness as pathological, but instead saw it as a natural response to the erosion of their way of life.</p>



<p>“Traditionally oriented Indian people are less susceptible to sadness and more susceptible to loneliness,” says Joseph P. Gone, a psychologist at Harvard University and a member of the <em>Aaniiih</em>-Gros Ventre tribal nation located in Montana.</p>



<p>If land loss is connected to loneliness, especially in Indigenous communities, then the feeling would be expected to grow as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">climate change wreaks havoc</a> on people’s ancestral lands. (<em>SN: 3/28/20, p. 6</em>). For instance, the 2019–20 bushfires that scorched millions of hectares in Australia caused <a href="https://theconversation.com/strength-from-perpetual-grief-how-aboriginal-people-experience-the-bushfire-crisis-129448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tremendous suffering for Aboriginal communities</a>, researchers in Australia who worked with these communities wrote in 2020 for the Conversation, a nonprofit news organization: “For Aboriginal people … who live with the trauma of dispossession and neglect and now, the trauma of catastrophic fire, our grief is immeasurably different to that of non-Indigenous people.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Longing for daily rituals</h4>



<p>An emphasis on harmony between people and the planet appears less frequently in industrialized cultures, Wright says. “The fact that you can have a nourishing relationship with place has been invalidated.”</p>



<p>But as the pandemic illuminated, even in industrialized cultures, many people’s sense of belonging still hinges on connections to the more-than-human world. Rather than a connection between person and the landscape, though, these relationships frequently show up between people and aspects of the built environment.</p>



<p>This need for relationships with the built environment comes through in journal entries submitted to the <a href="https://pandemic-journaling-project.chip.uconn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pandemic Journaling Project</a>, Parsons says. This global initiative to gather people’s experiences of the historic health crisis amassed some 22,000 entries from 1,750 people from May 2020 to January 2022.</p>



<p>“The loneliness creeps up on me. It appears out of left field. The desire to just go and hang out with friends, go out to eat, even browse stacks at the library,” wrote Denise, described as a divorced Midwestern Black woman in her 60s.</p>



<p>The typical tools psychologists use to measure loneliness probably miss these feelings, Parsons reported in her 2022 article in <em>SSM-Mental Health</em>. She reached that conclusion after homing in on 35 U.S. journal writers, many with multiple entries, who used words containing the fragments “lone” or “isolat” in at least one entry. The journal writers also filled out a five-statement loneliness survey alongside their first entry and then every six weeks thereafter. Journal writers responded “yes,” “more or less” or “no” to statements such as: “I miss having people around me.” “There are plenty of people I can rely on when I have problems.” “There are enough people I feel close to.”</p>



<p>Even though many respondents reported feeling lonely in their entries, they <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560322000615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still scored low on the loneliness survey</a>, Parsons found. For instance, on the same date that Taylor, described as twenty­something, nonbinary single white person, wrote that they had “never been more lonely,” they scored a 0 on the loneliness survey.</p>



<p>Parsons attributes the discordance to limitations in the survey. The psychological survey used in the journaling project, called the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, and another widely used survey, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, both define loneliness as a form of social pain brought on by the felt absence of a social network or meaningful relationships.</p>



<p>By design, then, most loneliness surveys miss people’s connections to places, activities or even casual acquaintances. In the journaling project, people wrote about missing rituals and other practices, such as birthday celebrations, holidays, religious services and funerals, or missing places, such as the gym, grocery store, library and friends’ houses, Parsons notes. People also wrote about missing everyday encounters with others, the seemingly mundane interactions that can arise when people wander their communities.</p>



<p>Those feelings of loneliness show up in one of Taylor’s entries. They write: “Not only do I miss my friends, but I also miss strangers. I miss the random encounters I used to have with people on the street, in stores, at bars. I miss making a connection with someone and then going our own ways.”</p>



<p>The De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale is great at capturing a longing for the sort of deep, meaningful relationships that people typically associate with loneliness, but it misses other sorts of loneliness, Parsons says. “It’s not picking up place at all. It’s not picking up practices.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Expanding the loneliness toolkit</h4>



<p>Including the built environment in assessments of loneliness is not yet common. But architects, whose trade rests on understanding how people move about their communities, often intuitively think about how the design of the physical environment can worsen feelings of isolation or foster belonging.</p>



<p>“We usually think of loneliness as a singular situational, social or mental experience of being detached from place, domicile, or other human beings,” reads the opening line of the Finnish <a href="https://projects.tuni.fi/uploads/2021/06/7cca87af-lobe_pallasmaa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect Juhani Pallasmaa’s chapter</a> in the 2021 book of essays and lectures <em>Loneliness and the Built Environment</em>.</p>



<p>Many architects, including Pallasmaa, have found inspiration in the writings of German philosopher Martin Heidegger, who believed that dwellings provide a means of both shelter and self-expression. Architects thus design environments that imbue life with meaning, he argued.</p>



<p>Social scientists are starting to join architects in thinking about how the built environment can affect loneliness. In his recent public health advisory, Surgeon General Murthy outlined six pillars to advance social connection. In the first pillar, he recommended facilitating connection among people through better urban planning, such as providing people with easy access to green spaces and bolstering the reach of public transit.</p>



<p>Similarly, in January, a cross-disciplinary team of researchers in Australia and England, whose areas of expertise include urban planning, public health and sociology, identified several <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222002234?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urban design features that have the potential to reduce loneliness</a>. Those features include common spaces, walkability, public transit, housing design, sense of safety and access to natural spaces.</p>



<p>While the focus of such urban design projects often aim to get people together, there is growing awareness that connecting people with the natural world may also alleviate loneliness. “People can be socially isolated but still not feel lonely,” says Emily Rugel, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Sydney. “They may find that ability to tap a biophilic connection and go out and view wildlife and walk among the trees. [That may be] enough to make them feel connected to the broader world. They don’t necessarily need interaction with friends or family members to do that.”</p>



<p>Consider, for instance, a small project in New Zealand that aims to alleviate loneliness, in part, by helping people reconnect to their extended families and ancestral lands. Members of one Māori subtribe, the Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, developed a 30-home <em>papakāinga</em>, a type of communal Māori cohousing setup, on ancestral land. Completed in 2016, that project brought people together by connecting homes via shared lanes, community gardens and play spaces for children.</p>

<p>Developers wanted people to feel as if they were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666558122000094?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walking the same paths as their ancestors</a>, researchers wrote in the 2022 issue of <em>Wellbeing, Space and Society</em>. They hoped that feeling would help residents feel rooted in their culture and the long arc of time. Even when building on ancestral lands is not possible, bringing often far-flung community members back together has the potential to revive languages and cultural practices, the authors note. But more research is needed to know if a return to the <em>papakāinga</em> reduces loneliness.</p>



<p>The bottom line is that expanding how we think about loneliness has the potential to expand the toolkit of possible interventions, Parsons says. “We can regulate our loneliness by not necessarily calling up a friend but by going out, going for a walk, or going to the library, or going and sitting in a coffee shop.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Loneliness and climate change</h4>



<p>Many years ago, I moved to a small city in New England while several months pregnant. I knew no one except my husband and spent my lonely days wandering the woods behind my house. Once, after my baby was born, I strapped him into a carrier and scrambled down a steep embankment. There, at the edge of a lake, a log had lodged into the rocky shore. We would spend hours watching waves pummel the log’s rough bark. As I observed loons dive for fish in summer and heard waves shatter ice like glass in winter, my loneliness would briefly ebb.</p>



<p>I was reminded of this log after speaking with Sarah Wright about songspirals and why we should all cultivate intentional relationships with the natural world. I had never considered my relationship with the log particularly important, or even as a relationship at all. But Wright made me realize that in this new and unfamiliar place, the log had provided a haven. Her words also explained the sadness I felt over the years as the waves chipped away the log’s bark — a process accelerated no doubt by a lake that froze over less and less come winter.</p>



<p>There’s a word to describe what I was feeling. In the early 2000s, environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht of the University of Sydney coined the term “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18027145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solastalgia</a>” to describe the pain or sickness a person experiences when natural or human-made disasters destroy their home. Etymologically, the word originates from both solace and desolation. Desolation, Albrecht wrote in 2007, has “meanings connected to abandonment and loneliness.” Solastalgia is also a play on nostalgia.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="704" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline5_1030.jpg" alt="A photo of a young boy standing on a log that is hanging over a body of water. Trees line the body of water's shore." class="wp-image-3132783" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline5_1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline5_1030-560x383.jpg 560w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline5_1030-658x450.jpg 658w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline5_1030-272x186.jpg 272w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline5_1030-768x525.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/110423_loneliness_inline5_1030-849x580.jpg 849w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132783">Many cultures recognize that people disconnected from places, animals and ways of life can feel lonely. Writer Sujata Gupta experienced that sort of loneliness when a log she frequently visited (her son is shown with the log) floated away.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132783">S. Gupta</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Albrecht felt compelled to create such a term after observing and interviewing over 50 people living in the Hunter Valley region north of Sydney, where there has been intensive mining. Residents expressed concerns over how mining was affecting their health and well-being. “The fact that you can see those huge mine heaps et cetera makes you think that sometime in the future there may be dreadful consequences for the water table movement in the valley,” a man named Leo said. A woman named Eve said, “When the coal is gone, the people of Singleton will be left with nothing but ‘the final void.’ ”</p>



<p>The residents’ experience is ironic, Albrecht noted. These people are descended from the colonizers who dispossessed Indigenous communities of their land. Now, this “second wave of colonization,” Albrecht wrote, “is leading to complete dispossession for some and solastalgia for those left behind.” In other words: desolation, abandonment and loneliness.</p>



<p>In recent years, related terms have emerged: ecoanxiety <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-grief-climate-change-warming-mental-health-ecology">and climate grief</a> (<em>SN: 2/29/20, p. 22</em>). Unlike solastalgia, though, researchers rarely connect these ideas to loneliness. That’s changing. In 2022, an online survey of over 3,000 German adults, for instance, showed that those who scored high in loneliness on the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale also <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/22/14991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to score high in climate anxiety</a> on a different scale.</p>



<p>These terms make clear that building a relationship with the nonhuman elements of our world is bittersweet in this time of rapid climate change. We come to love what we may well lose. Yet, absent these deep relationships, how can we care for the world we live in?</p>



<p>Last winter in my New England town, it didn’t snow until mid-February and the water around the log never froze. Those months of battering waves were hard on the log. When I trekked down to that rocky shore one muddy spring day, my two school-aged children in tow, the log was smooth to the touch and white as bone.</p>



<p>On a solo walk a few weeks later, I discovered that the log was gone. It had, after so many years of holding on, floated away.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/death-zimbabwe-elephants-bacterium">The mysterious deaths of dozens of Zimbabwe’s elephants has been solved</a></h4>

              
                <p>Three years ago, dozens of African elephants mysteriously died in Zimbabwe. Now scientists have confirmed their killer: a rare and little-known bacterium that can cause organ inflammation leading to deadly hemorrhaging.</p>



<p>The bacterium, dubbed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41987-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pasteurellaceae Bisgaard taxon 45, turned up in</a> samples from six of 15 elephants analyzed, researchers report October 25 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The pathogen is closely related to <em>Pasteurella multocida,</em> which is known to cause hemorrhagic septicemia, or fatal blood poisoning, but Bisgaard taxon 45 had not been previously implicated in such infections. &nbsp;</p>





<p>It&#8217;s still unclear how Zimbabwe’s elephants became infected, say Laura Rosen and her colleagues. Rosen is an epidemiologist at the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area’s Animal Health Sub-Working Group in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. But the results do solve one part of a mystery that has haunted efforts to protect the region’s African elephants (<em>Loxodonta Africana</em>), which are <a href="https://www.iucn.org/news/species-survival-commission/202108/shrinking-spaces-worlds-largest-land-animal#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20African%20Savanna%20Elephants,time%20of%20about%2025%20years)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">endangered</a>, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.</p>



<p>From August to November 2020, 35 elephants were found dead in northwestern Zimbabwe. In neighboring Botswana, <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/african-journal-of-wildlife-research/volume-50/issue-1/056.050.0149/Mass-Die-Off-of-African-Elephants-in-Botswana--Pathogen/10.3957/056.050.0149.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as many as 350 elephants suddenly died</a> the same year. The Botswana elephants’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/african-elephant-mass-death-botswana">deaths have been attributed to cyanobacteria</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>But there is no evidence implicating cyanobacteria in the deaths of Zimbabwe’s elephants, the researchers say. Nor is their evidence anthrax, another suspected killer, is to blame: Other animals would have been affected, and the corpses lacked telltale symptoms.</p>



<p>Postmortem results and initial laboratory findings suggested the kind of inflammatory bleeding of internal organs and bodily tissues that <em>P. multocida </em>can cause<em>.</em> The elephants suffered from enlarged spleens and livers and extensive internal bleeding and tissue death.</p>



<p>While hemorrhagic septicemia has not been seen in African elephants before, it has been identified as a wildlife killer in other regions. For example, in Kazakhstan, <em>P. multocida </em>infections <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heres-why-so-many-saiga-antelope-mysteriously-died-2015">felled more than 200,000 saiga antelope</a> in 2015 (<em>SN: 1/29/18</em>). Researchers suspected that higher than normal temperatures and humidity caused the microbe — which normally lives harmlessly in the antelopes’ noses — to multiply and turn deadly.</p>



<p>But after more sophisticated lab testing of the samples from the Zimbabwe elephants, <em>P. multocida </em>was ruled out too.</p>



<p>“It became clear from the culture samples that we did not have&nbsp;<em>P. multocida</em>&nbsp;but something else similar,” Rosen says. Genetic analysis and isolation of the bacterium in the six samples confirmed growing suspicions that Bisgaard taxon 45 was the culprit.</p>



<p>Samples from the other nine elephants did not turn up Bisgaard taxon 45 because they were too rotten, or the team was not able to get the permits needed to send them to more sophisticated labs quickly enough. But the bacterium is to blame in all the deaths, the team suspects, as well as in another 14 elephants that died suddenly in 2019. “Past cases may have been missed,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Bisgaard taxon 45 has previously been isolated from tiger and lion bite wounds in humans, as well as from a chipmunk and healthy captive parrots, the researchers say. &nbsp;It’s not yet known if the bacterium is part of the elephants’ normal flora and whether heat, stress or other factors can cause it to multiply and become deadly. It’s also not clear how or if the highly social pachyderms might transmit the pathogen to each other.</p>



<p>But the findings add to the growing list of pathogens to look out for when mysterious deaths of elephants and other wildlife occur in Africa, says Shahan Azeem, veterinary microbiologist at the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan, who was not involved in the study.</p>





<p>It is also important for scientists to further look into which animals regularly carry the bacterium and identify their role and related environment in the spread of Bisgaard taxon 45 among African elephants, Azeem says.</p>

<p>A radiology professor in France who plagiarized others’ work in a review article has resigned from his role as deputy editor of a medical journal amid new concerns about his publications, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The professor, <a href="https://archive.fo/Dvmw6">Romaric Loffroy</a> of CHU Dijon Bourgogne, was first and corresponding author of the offending review, which included large amounts of text from two earlier papers without appropriate citation, as we reported last month.</p>

<p>The review, <a href="https://qims.amegroups.org/article/view/8064/html">“Current role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer</a>,” was published in 2015 in <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em>. The day after our story, the journal’s editor-in-chief, Yi-Xiang Wang, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/20/professor-who-blamed-plagiarism-on-ghostwriter-to-earn-first-retraction/">told us</a> it would pull the paper (<a href="https://qims.amegroups.org/article/view/118795/html">it did so</a> last week).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now Loffroy, who was deputy editor of <em>Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery</em>, has “voluntarily resigned” from the post, Wang said in an email from November 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loffroy did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The resignation comes as more concerns about the French professor’s work have surfaced on PubPeer. The 2015 review plagiarized from not just two, but four previous publications, according to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/67A280070F7352207DBE6FA95BBB37#4">comments left on the online forum</a> by data sleuth Elisabeth Bik following our reporting on the case.</p>



<p>Another PubPeer commenter <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5EBE4A4F1992D33F242BB1AC08EF00">flagged a potential problem</a> in “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/14/2313">Cyanoacrylate Glue for Treating Chronic Saphenous Vein Insufficiency: A Retrospective Observational Single-Center Study</a>,” which was published earlier this year in the journal <em>Diagnostics</em> and of which Loffroy is corresponding author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the anonymous commenter, the study should have been classified as prospective because it uses “a questionnaire in the follow-up of patients” and thus requires “approval from a Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP)” before recruitment of participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, however, does not mention CPP approval, stating only that “Institutional review board was not required for this study due to its retrospective nature, but our ethics committee approved this study.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wrote the PubPeer commenter: “Starting a prospective research in humans in France without a CPP is a serious breach to the Health French Law [sic].”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-expand-disease-surveillance-international-travelers">The CDC is expanding its disease surveillance of international travelers</a></h4>

              
                <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is <a href="https://investors.ginkgobioworks.com/news/news-details/2023/Ginkgo-Bioworks-and-XWELL-Implement-Expanded-CDC-Traveler-based-Genomic-Surveillance-Program-to-Test-for-More-than-30-Known-Pathogens/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding how it tracks diseases</a> among international travelers, just in time for the winter virus season.</p>



<p>Travelers returning to four major international airports now have the option to be tested for more than 30 pathogens, building upon a program that tracks coronavirus variants, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s1107-testing-respiratory-viruses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the CDC announced November 6.</a></p>



<p>This expanded testing, which has just started, will continue for three months as a pilot program designed to track winter respiratory diseases such as seasonal flu. The program will also screen wastewater from airplanes and airport terminals, adding population-level data to information from voluntary nasal swabs.</p>





<p>This program could catch potential health threats that might be “the next COVID,” says Sam Scarpino, an epidemiologist at Northeastern University in Boston. The new data may also inform public health guidance during outbreaks of seasonal viruses like the flu, he says.</p>



<p>Since fall 2021, the CDC’s <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#traveler-genomic-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance</a> program has tracked the global evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, through voluntary nasal swab PCR testing at international airports. In August, the program <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7243a3.htm?s_cid=mm7243a3_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up one of the first known cases anywhere of a new variant, BA.2.86</a>, in a traveler returning from Japan. More than 360,000 travelers have participated in the testing as of September 2023.</p>



<p>Airports participating in the expanded program include San Francisco International Airport — which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/san-francisco-plane-waste-covid-19-variant">became the first U.S. airport to screen its wastewater</a> for coronavirus variants this spring (<em>SN: 5/9/23</em>) — along with John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, Logan International Airport in Boston and Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C. The PCR and wastewater tests “complement each other,” Scarpino says, as the PCR testing provides anonymous information about individual travelers while the wastewater testing provides broader population-level patterns.</p>



<p>The expanded program is “a really smart way” to look for new pathogens reaching the United States through international travel, says Rachel Poretsky, a microbiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago who directs local wastewater monitoring programs. She’d like to see the CDC expand further to more airports as well as other travel hubs such as bus and train stations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-diving-kingfishers-avoid-concussions">Here’s how high-speed diving kingfishers may avoid concussions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Genetic tweaks in kingfishers might help cushion the blow when the diving birds plunge beak first into the water to catch fish.</p>



<p>Analysis of the genetic instruction book of some diving kingfishers identified <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05359-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes in genes related to brain function as well as retina and blood vessel development</a>, which might protect against damage during dives, researchers report October 24 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. The results suggest the different species of diving kingfishers may have adapted to survive their dives unscathed in some of the same ways, but it’s still unclear how the genetic changes protect the birds.</p>





<p>Hitting speeds of up to 40 kilometers per hour, kingfisher dives put huge amounts of potentially damaging pressure on the birds’ heads, beaks and brains. The birds dive repeatedly, smacking their heads into the water in ways that could cause concussions in humans, says Shannon Hackett, an evolutionary biologist and curator at the Field Museum in Chicago. “So there has to be something that protects them from the terrible consequences of repeatedly hitting their heads against a hard substrate.”</p>



<p>Hackett first became interested in how the birds protect their brains while she worked with her son’s hockey team and started worrying about the effect of repeated hits on the human brain. Around the same time, evolutionary biologist Chad Eliason joined the museum to study kingfishers and their plunge diving behavior.</p>



<p>In the new study, Hackett, Eliason and colleagues analyzed the complete genome of 30 kingfisher species, some that plunge dive and others that don’t, from specimens frozen and stored at the museum. The preserved birds came from all over the world; some of the diving species came from mainland areas and others from islands and had evolved to dive independently rather than from the same plunge-diving ancestor. The team wanted to know if the different diving species had evolved similar genetic changes to arrive at the same behaviors. Many kingfisher species have developed this behavior, but it was unclear whether this was through genetic convergence, similar to how many species of birds have lost their flight or how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-genes-dolphins-and-bats-evolved-same-way-allow-echolocation">bats and dolphins independently developed echolocation</a> <em>(SN: 9/6/2013)</em>.</p>



<p>Previous studies had found convergence on beak shape, making plunging kingfishers’ long and pointy, which could allow them to dive more effectively into the water. “Do they all [adapt to plunge-diving] in the same way with their beaks, their brain … and with their genes?” Hackett wondered.</p>



<p>The analysis revealed evidence of 93 changed genes that seemed to signal genetic convergence. Of those, one stood out: It was a tweak in a gene that holds the instructions for making the tau protein, which, when functioning normally, helps to stabilize cells’ structure and could be a change to help the birds adapt to diving, the team suggests.</p>



<p>In humans, tau has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and shows up in clumps in brain tissue of people who have suffered multiple concussions. “It’s a very interesting hypothesis that the same [tau] protein has been reused to mitigate these hard impacts” in kingfishers, says Tim Sackton, a geneticist at Harvard University who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>But, he says, the type of genetic analysis done in the study is tricky. Some of the convergent genes identified might be due to chance and not be related to the evolution of plunge diving behavior. More in-depth studies to identify which genetic changes are relevant to the diving behavior are warranted.</p>



<p>The next steps are to test what these genetic mutations and resulting proteins, particularly tau, do in kingfishers and how the genetic differences in diving species might protect them. If similar studies offer insight into how the birds protect their brains, the results could possibly be applied to developing protective strategies against concussions and brain injury for humans. But that’s in the distant future. </p>



<p>“We have a long way to go between understanding how the genotype and all of its modifications turn into what we see in the natural world,” Hackett says. “We&#8217;re just at the beginning of asking those questions.”</p>

<p>&#8220;These findings are unjustified.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how a biologist at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Chicago described the conclusions of a federal investigation that found she had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/03/us-va-scientist-banned-from-agency-research-for-faking-data/">faked images and inflated sample sizes in published papers and a grant application</a>. The biologist, Hee-Jeong Im Sampen, has been banned from conducting VA research. </p>



<p>Sampen, also a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, said that &#8220;any errors that occurred involved discrete erroneously-placed figures or images&#8221; that &#8220;in no way undermine our basic conclusions and findings.&#8221;</p>



<p>Calling the episode a &#8220;long and hard battle for me,&#8221; Sampen sent us these comments:</p>



<span id="more-128207"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These findings are unjustified.  They impose responsibility <em>vicariously</em> for claimed misinformation in scientific figures.  In other words, conclusory charges of “misconduct” are repeatedly made based on my supervisory role.  In the committee’s view, the person who actually caused the misinformation (unintentionally) to be placed is irrelevant.  Tagging me as accountable for a lab member’s error, and calling it research misconduct, is so much easier.  Fundamental principles of what constitute &#8220;misconduct&#8221; have been ignored.</p>



<p>In addition, the entire investigation has been a travesty.  Witnesses with whom I was forbidden from communicating offered evidence against me in secret interviews.  At the same time, the investigation committee was given unfettered ability to meet with witnesses and prompt unfavorable testimony.  The fact that such conduct occurred speaks to the utterly decrepit institutional procedures in place that allowed it to happen.  No witness was ever subject to questioning <em>on my behalf</em>.  Nor were questions asked seeking to elicit answers favorable to me.  Favorable responses that, by chance, happened to be made were disregarded.  Similarly, the written statements I offered from former lab members and colleagues who know me best and who attested to my integrity, have been given no consideration whatever.</p>



<p>No evidence was provided under oath!  Fact issues thus abound throughout the proceedings.  Yet no impartial decision maker has ever evaluated the evidence to determine the actual facts.  Rather, the investigation committee made routine inferences against me on a wholesale basis and largely ignored my written responses.  The committee’s conclusions then were rubber stamped by VA administrators who raised no questions and heard no witnesses.  In fact, I requested but was denied a hearing on the allegations.  Likewise, my request simply to meet with VA administrators was denied.</p>



<p>Finally, I would add that the misconduct findings are made with respect to a tiny fraction of the huge volume of data generated by our lab.  (I have authored or co-authored nearly 200 publications over 25 years.)  I do not say that to justify any errors that may have occurred in our publications.  I regret and am embarrassed by each and every error.  But any errors that occurred involved discrete erroneously-placed figures or images.  They in no way undermine our basic conclusions and findings.  No allegation asserts otherwise, and our findings may be readily replicated.    </p>



<p>In other words, the scientific validity of my lab’s research and findings have never been questioned.  Unfortunately, the Federal Register report, while generous in the negative aspersions it casts, makes no mention of the important contributions our work has offered the scientific community – contributions that far overshadow the technical errors that were the subject of the investigation.</p>



<p>In short, the VA&#8217;s reported findings appear to serve some VA administrative purpose and led to my termination, but they lack validity from a legal, ethical, and practical scientific perspective. </p>

                <p><strong>In this short interview series, we will be shining a light on inspiring women working in neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. We explore  job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to read new interviews every month from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_2af6a8f3236043268e71d6684a6b14d9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_457,h_577,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Lucy Taylor, Masters student in Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL." ></figure><p>This month we interviewed Lucy Taylor who is currently studying MSc Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL, evaluating the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in patients with brain injuries or disorders that affect their thinking, language or visual processing skills. Lucy previously studied BSc Nutrition and Medical Sciences at UCL for which she was awarded the nutrition prize for graduating top of her degree cohort.</p>
<h6><strong>Tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially.</strong>
<p>I have a BSc in Nutrition and Medical Sciences from UCL, and I am currently completing an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL. </p>

<p>I have always been interested in the biological aspects of human science, but in recent years the psychological and neuroscientific aspects have captured my interest. My interest in neuroscience was sparked by optional modules I took during my undergraduate degree. One lecture (on anosognosia and somatoparaphrenia poststroke) is particularly memorable, as it was delivered by an inspiring female Professor (Prof. Kat Fotopoulou). After the lecture I got in contact with her as I wanted to hear more about her career and the research she has done. As a result, we built rapport and I started interning in her psychology lab. I assisted in the running of a multisite clinical trial on metacognition and interoception in anorexia nervosa. During my time there I established that it was the intersection between neuroscience and psychology that intrigued me, and as such decided to pursue an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>

<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed my degree so far. It has given me a comprehensive introduction to cognitive neuroscience through modules spanning neuroanatomy, brain processes, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, statistics and translational research. Throughout my degree the translational aspects of cognitive neuroscience have captured my interest in particular; as such, I got a role as a research assistant for the Neurotherapeutics research group, which involved assisting in the running of clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of a word retrieval app for proper name anomia in dementia patients and assisting a psychologist in delivering therapy to carers of stroke patients with aphasia. I’ve also chosen to undertake my thesis on a clinical population; I am working with the Neuroscience and Mental Health research group on a clinical trial aiming to gain understanding of the neural circuitry implicated in the therapeutic effect of CBT.</p></h6>
<h6><strong>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</strong></h6><p><p>As mentioned, I am currently involved in research with the Neuroscience and Mental Health research group for my thesis. I am really enjoying this as it is a topic I am genuinely really interested in and passionate about. However, it is the people that make it particularly enjoyable – it’s a pleasure to work alongside such an inspiring, diverse group of people. From the moment I joined they have been welcoming and supportive, and I’ve no doubt that the positive culture they’ve instilled is reflected in the quality of research they produce.</p>

</p><h6><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></h6><p><p>I would say the most challenging aspect of my studies currently is the need to learn a lot of new skills very quickly; my thesis requires collection and analysis of fMRI data, which is very new territory for me, and some days I can find it overwhelming. However, I have always enjoyed learning and specifically chose this project to push my boundaries, and I know it’ll be very rewarding when I complete it! Another challenge I’ve found daunting throughout the duration of my Masters is feeling very inexperienced compared to those in my research teams. However, when I’ve felt this way, I’ve tried to reframe the situation positively, and instead use their expertise to my advantage by being inquisitive and learning as much as I can from them.</p></p>

<h6><strong>What are you currently trying to improve?</strong></h6><p><p>As my studies are now focused on my thesis, I am currently trying to develop new skills such as how to use specific software for fMRI data analysis, as well as continuing to improve my critical thinking, literature searching and scientific writing skills. This year I’ve also made a conscious effort to improve my communication skills through taking up opportunities to present at national conferences; this is certainly outside of my comfort zone but I have already gained a lot of confidence from doing so!</p></p>

<h6><strong>Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</strong></h6><p><p>In neuroscience, I find myself inspired by women at very different stages of their career. There are numerous world-leading Professors in the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, who have undoubtedly inspired me by showing what’s possible through hard work, dedication and passion. I am also inspired by a PhD student, Millie, that I am currently working alongside for my thesis. She is exceptionally knowledgeable and skilled, but very approachable and supportive – which are all attributes I find inspiring. Finally, I am inspired by my peers; I have a very strong and supportive group of 5 girls from my Masters – they are all exceptionally intelligent, ambitious, supportive and kind women, who I am inspired by and grateful for on a daily basis.</p></p>
<p><p>Outside of neuroscience, I am undoubtedly inspired by the women in my family. I am from a very female-dominant family, full of strong, caring and encouraging women – a reliable network that I am very fortunate to have!</p></p>

<h6><strong>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</strong></h6><p><p>My main goals are to have a career which I enjoy on a day-to-day basis, I find fulfilling and rewarding, has great progression opportunities and allows me to continually learn and expand my knowledge.  </p>

<p>I am currently looking to start my career in the pharmaceutical or healthcare industry in a business-to-business sales or consulting role. I am remaining open minded about doing a PhD or DClinPsy in the future - I am just ready for a break from academia at the moment!</p></p>

<h6><strong>What advice would you give to females at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</strong></h6><p><p>Neuroscience is highly complex. In the early stages, it certainly seems like the more you know, the more you realise you don’t know, which can be daunting. The key to embracing this is to not be afraid of asking questions, no matter how trivial you think they may be. You’re not expected to know everything; those with more experience just appreciate curiosity and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Also, grab as many opportunities as possible. Volunteer for neuro research studies and reach out to those whose work you are interested in to see if they can offer you any experience. You’ll be surprised at what you can find yourself simply from being proactive; I’ve found myself helping develop clinical trial protocols, running clinical trials, helping to write papers, receiving an offer to co-author a book and to present research at conferences, just from sending out some emails and having some conversations. Having this experience alongside my studies has been incredible – it has built my CV and helped me figure out where my interests lie within the discipline, which in turn has helped guide my next steps.</p></p>

<h6><strong>What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need improving/addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</strong></h6><p><p>Whilst I think the industry is making steps in the right direction, I think there are still aspects of the field which need to be addressed. The cost of tuition remains a significant barrier to entry and there is underrepresentation of groups including women, BAME groups and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is critically important to address as science requires innovation, and innovation requires diversity - different individuals bring different perspectives, which is what progresses scientific research.</p></p>

Such stigma makes it difficult for people to reach out about their experience, even when they may want support. Further, many people who do not have lived experience, but who are concerned about someone who does, want to offer support but are unsure about how to navigate this. The application of a person-centered approach when discussing self-injury can be used to foster more appropriate discussions, which will leave individuals with lived experience feeling more understood and validated. </p><p>Starting a supportive dialogue with a loved one who self-injures can make a big difference in their journey to recovery.
