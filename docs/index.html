Or AI, for that matter. The current black hole of capitalism, sucking in all the money, energy, and human ingenuity. Ever-growing whispers of the bubble bursting are dismissed by some, self-evident to others. The latter can see that <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/hidden-forces-ai-bubble%5d.">limits are being reached</a>. Not least that we’re running out of new, human-generated data — prose, poetry, music art — to train generative AI models on. An ever-growing proportion of new data are generated by AI themselves. And, as we now know, training AIs on their own outputs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07566-y">makes them dumber</a>.</p><p>Happily, brains are our concern here. We can leave politics and AI to one side. What did we learn of the brain this year, what startling new technological advances promise to unlock its secrets? Shortly we’ll be seeing the marvellous uses of light to understand — and fix — the brain, some noble failures, and a beautiful breakthrough in gene therapy. But let’s begin with — checks notes — foundation models. Dang it.</p><p><strong>Foundational thinking</strong></p><p>Are we (and by “we” I mean theorists in neural science of any kind) soon to be out of a job? I ask as this year saw foundation models move into the neuroscience mainstream. A foundation model is any neural network that we train on a diverse range of knowledge, then apply or fine-tune to a specific task. Any large-language model is one. Applied to science, the idea is that foundation models can discover theories on their own, showing what links a cause to some effect, some input to some output. Or, at least, that’s the idea.</p><p>In neuroscience, we had two landmark papers announce foundation models for two rather different use-cases: a cubic millimetre of the mouse’s cortex; and the whole of human cognition. Disparate applications, common limitations.</p><p>The MICRONS project went first. MICRONS is a cool idea. Its goal is to capture a complete “processing unit” of the mouse’s cortex: it wants to obtain both the activity of and the wiring between an entire column of neurons in the visual cortex. A digital twin of a cortical column, if you like. That digital twin could not only capture how those neurons respond to the visual world, but also how those neurons influence each other’s responses. Whether it is worth doing this in the mouse, an animal that predominantly lives in the dark, is a debate for another time.</p><p>What we learnt this year is that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08829-y">their digital twin works</a>. But, also, that it is not a digital twin. At least, not yet. It’s a multi-layer neural network that predicts the activity of recorded neurons during some visual stimulus. It uses no knowledge of the wiring, location or types of neurons, so in no sense is it a “twin” of the recorded cortical circuit. It can though predict with fair accuracy the activity of held-out neurons during videos of natural scenes. Scenes like driving through a desert. As mice do.</p><p>Predicting neural activity well is impressive, but quality prediction is what we’ve come to expect from a deep neural network trained on thousands of data points for thousands of iterations. The MICRONS crew treated that result as the hors d’oeuvre, and moved on to the main course. MICRONS treated the central layers of their ANN, what they called their “core”, as a foundation model. This foundation model was duly established by training those core layers using the neural activity from multiple mice, all of them watching the same videos. They then tested this foundation model’s ability to generalise by having it predict the neural activity from each mouse in five new visual tasks — five different types of artificial stimuli, from still pictures to randomly moving dots. The “fine-tuning” to do this was training, for each mouse, the input and output layers around the frozen core. This foundation model was contrasted with training a new, full model end-to-end from scratch — input, output and core — for each mouse, from the same videos. All were assessed by how well they predicted neural activity on these new tasks, on which no models were trained.</p><p>What did we learn? All the models could generalise: they could all predict neural activity in the tasks they had not been trained on. Given enough training data, the foundation model and the individual models were equally good at predicting neural activity in these unseen tasks. Another testament to the predictive power of deep neural networks. We also learned that, for small amounts of training data, the foundation model outperformed the individually trained models. Useful, but unsurprising given that the foundation model had, by design, orders of magnitude fewer parameters to train — its trained only its input and output layers whereas the individual models had to train their core layers too.</p><p>What we didn’t seem to learn much about was the brain. It is unclear in what sense the foundation model — those core layers — tells us anything about how the visual system of rodents works. Instead, one suspects that in creating a “foundation model” they’ve just rediscovered reservoir computing: taking a core set of units with frozen weights, which create a random projection of the input data; then training the outputs to turn this random projection into the desired target — here, neural activity. An obvious control would be to just randomly initialise the same core layers and use that as a “foundation” model.</p><p>Indeed, the rationale for using a foundation model here was not particularly clear. Its training recapitulated some amalgam of the evolution and development of the visual system; but I’d wager no one believes evo-devo is something akin to ADAM and auto-differentiation. Its performance was impressive, but I’d wager no one believes it is telling us much about the actual computation of the visual system, beyond that the visual system is some kind of neural network — which we’ve known for, what, a century or two?</p><p>If a foundation model for the mammalian visual system seems ambitious, then a foundation model for human cognition is hubristic. And so it proved.</p><p>This year was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09215-4">published the Centaur model</a>, a large-language model (specifically, Llama 3.1) fine-tuned on data from around 60,000 people doing 160 experiments using 32 different tasks from the gamut of cognitive psychology. Tasks like deciding between two options to get reward, or which item in a sequence was the odd-one-out. One might quibble that this stretches the definition of “fine tuning” somewhat, but 10 million data points is a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of data used to train Llama itself. This fine-tuning created a model that could perform a cognitive task given a simple description of it and some options to choose between.</p><p>In one sense, Centaur worked spectacularly. It was the best model for predicting the choices of participants it had not been trained on. Better than the base LLaMa model. Better, in all but one of the 160 tasks, than trained cognitive models specific to each task. Better, too, at adapting to tasks it had not been trained on — whether they were mild variants with different framing stories for the task, like pretending you are an astronaut tasked with deciding which direction to steer your spaceship, or stronger variants with changes in the task structure.</p><p>In another sense, Centaur did not work. We learnt little about how humans think. Unless the claim is that human cognition arises from some kind of neural network, which we’ve known for, what, a century or two?</p><p>There was much to admire here in the effort. The authors curated a truly valuable “Psych 101” dataset — those 32 tasks, 60,000 people, 10 million choices — to make possible the training of the model. We can still be amazed that it’s possible to give an LLM instructions on how to do a task in natural language and it just does it. But Centaur was pitched as a first step towards a “unified theory of cognition”. Why that unified model needed a black-box predictor of choices was unclear.</p><p>Lacking clarity of purpose is an inherent problem with using foundation models to do science. Foundations models are amazing at prediction. For technology or the clinic, such predictive power is only a good, for predicting which materials might be best for solar panels or which drug molecule would best activate a receptor on a cell’s surface.</p><p>In science, predictions are the consequence of hypotheses: they are how we test and distinguish between them. How we winnow our ideas. The hypothesis that better predicts the data is the one we believe the most (once we’ve accounted for overfitting etc). What hypothesis is a foundation model of the visual system or of human cognition offering? It turns out that in a science made of foundation models we still need theorists. Not to derive predictions from hypotheses any longer but derive hypotheses from the predictions that have already been made. Perhaps I just lack the necessary imagination, but I’m not sure that’s better than just doing science the old-fashioned way.</p><p><strong>Let there be light</strong></p><p>That old-fashioned science still has much to offer. There were two amazing advances this year in our use of light to understand the brain.</p><p>This year saw the 20th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1525">paper</a> that broke the news of optogenetics for a mass audience (well, a mass audience of neuroscientists). Even after 20 years optogenetics still sounds like science fiction, does it not? Into the brain we inject a virus carrying a DNA sequence, a sequence that, once it enters a neuron, instructs that neuron to express a light-sensitive ion channel in its membrane. Some DNA sequences result in excitable channels in the membrane. Shining a light on them creates a flow of current that forces a neuron to spike. Controlling neural activity at will using light.</p><p>I write “using light”, but it’s more using a high-powered laser to bombard the neurons with photons. That bombardment is necessary because the expressed ion channel is not particularly sensitive to light. This has several problems. For one, it needs a laser, which can be expensive. For another, photons at that intensity can heat the brain.</p><p>Enter Alex Naka’s team. This year <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.12.675947v1.full">they announced</a> they had found a new light-sensitive ion channel dubbed “WAChR”. On the one hand, it was yet another in a long line of light-sensitive ion channels capable of driving a neuron to spike when light was shone upon it. On the other hand, it didn’t need a laser. Ambient light was enough. Merely lifting a curtain was enough to activate this new WAChR channel.</p><p>(This experiment, dubbed the “curtain test”, was a beautiful piece of lo-fi improvisation. They simply took a slice of a brain full of neurons expressing their “WAChR” ion channel and placed it in darkness, hidden in a recess behind a curtain. Then they lifted the curtain, exposing the slice to office light. Recording individual neurons in that slice showed this was enough to significantly activate the WAChR ion channel, passing measurable current).</p><p>This discovery solves serious problems with optogenetics, promising control of neurons by low-powered light and without heating up the brain. But it is far more than just a technological refinement (with a natty curtain). One of the dreams for optogenetics has been to restore sight. If we could engineer light-sensitive neurons in the retina, then these could replace damaged receptors — the rods or cones — or damaged neurons. These engineered neurons could turn the incoming photons into the neural signals for “seeing”. This dream has always been held back by the supernatural levels of light needed to activate light-sensitive neurons. Shining a high-powered laser into someone’s retina is a sure-fire way to damage it further, as the label on your laser pointer will tell you, rather than fix it. Now this new WAChR channel could change all that, teasing us with a potential future of putting engineered neurons in the retina that will be as sensitive to light as the natural cells. Restoring sight with light.</p><p>The second breakthrough in using light to understand the brain came in our quest to map the wiring. The MICRONS project above is a terrific example of how hard it is to build a wiring diagram for a small brain or for a small piece of a larger brain. It is hard because neurons and the connections between them are so tiny. Tiny enough that the connection cannot be seen using a standard microscope. They are smaller than the smallest wavelength of visible light. To show that one neuron connects to another, we turn to electron microscopes that use beams of electrons, not photons, to see the gap between one neuron’s axon end and another’s receptors. That’s looking at one synapse. Each cortical neuron in a mouse has around 7,500 synapses on it, and we can only see, say, 5 of them in one image on the electron microscope. To trace where that axon came from, we may have to look through hundreds of slices of brain tissue. Mapping the wires this way is painstakingly slow work. Even with the massive speed ups of recent AI tools for tracing wires and checking connections, building a connectome between neurons is slow, expensive and in black-and-white. Oh yes: the other problem with the connections being smaller than the wavelength of visible light is that they cannot, by definition, be in colour.</p><p>This year <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08985-1">was announced LICONN</a>: a way to build a neuron-scale connectome with light. Actual light. How? By bringing the mountain to Mohammed. If the connections are too small for the visible light, then make ’em big enough to see. The LICONN team expanded the mouse brain by injecting a mix of hydrogels, the magic stuff in nappies (diapers, if you insist) that locks away the litres of wee produced by your average baby. The brain increased 16-fold in size, while keeping it intact. Now the wires could be traced and the connections found using just a standard light microscope.</p><p>Light-based connectomics promises to be faster, cheaper, and in full colour. Faster and cheaper democratises the ability to build wiring diagrams. It makes it easier to reconstruct the wiring of more than one brain. Being able to routinely compare wirings between brains means we can enter the era of doing proper comparative science of wiring at neuron scale. Colour is the game changer though.</p><p>Colour doesn’t just mean prettier pictures. What it means is that we can work out not just which neurons connect, but also any property of those neurons we have a marker for. Like a marker for whether those neurons express glutamate or GABA, or whether they have a particular type of ion channel. Our plethora of such markers all use colour. Red ones, blue ones, green ones. They all say: in this neuron I have detected this property — a transmitter, an ion channel. And now we can see them at the same time as the wiring. So not only can we do find the connections between neurons faster and cheaper than an electron microscope, but we can also add vital information about what those neurons are.</p><p>The arc of scientific progress is never smooth. Especially in a field as chaotic and rambunctious as neuroscience. We took two noble steps back this year.</p><p>One was the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aec1773">retraction of the DIANA paper</a>. This paper from 2022 reported the direct detection of neural activity using an MRI machine. If true, this was epoch-making stuff. We’ve had more than 30 years of using functional MRI’s tracking of blood oxygen as a proxy for neural activity. It is both amazing — activity deep in the living human brain! — and frustrating — it’s not neural activity, it’s slow, and each tiny blob of colour on an fMRI image is at least 100,000 neurons. DIANA’s promise to remove all these frustrations in one fell swoop looked too good to be true. Sadly, it was. The retraction came with <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/retraction/authors-retract-science-paper-on-controversial-fmri-method/">no obvious suggestion of nefarious actions by the authors</a>, just the work of other scientists unable to replicate that neural signal, and the authors re-analysing their own data to remove artifacts — that also removed the “neural activity” they reported. Science doing its thing.</p><p>The other was the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08888-1">head-to-head</a> of two of the major theories of consciousness: Global Workspace Theory versus Integrated Information Theory. The pitch was simple. A set of participants looked at pictures while having their brains scanned. The resulting patterns of brain activity were compared to the two theories’ predictions. Result? The activity matched neither theory’s predictions in any substantial way. If this were a football match, it’d be a 1–1 draw, both own goals, and two players sent off. Each. If boxing, a points draw after both combatants had missed a wild swing and the forward momentum face-planted them both on the canvas. Inconclusive, at best.</p><p>Its arc may not be smooth, but what science can unfailingly bring us is hope. Here’s a beautiful example.</p><p>Huntington’s disease was the first neurological disorder to have its genetics fully worked out. That was because it arises from the mutation of a single gene. And because it is probably the most common single-gene disorder of the brain.</p><p>The genetic culprit was identified in 1993. That means by 2025 we have a pretty good picture of the whole pathway from genetic mutation to symptoms. We know the critical mutation is too many repeats of the CAG triplet of bases in the “huntingtin” gene. More than 40 repeats mean the carrier is guaranteed to develop Huntington’s disease. Those extra repeats lead to an excess of the huntingtin protein in neurons. The excess causes the neurons to die, as it makes them overactive. That neuron death, particularly in the striatum, is what leads to the main symptoms.</p><p>One could be forgiven for wondering then why, with all this accumulated knowledge, we have no powerful treatment for Huntington’s. As of this year, we may have one.</p><p>In September, a gene therapy trial announced <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cevz13xkxpro">some spectacular results</a>. Just like optogenetics, the therapy injects a virus carrying a DNA fragment into the brain. In this case, into the striatum. That DNA fragment carries the instructions to stop neurons from making the huntingtin protein. (By creating a tiny bit of RNA that interferes with the process of turning the huntingtin gene into the protein). The trial reported the therapy worked: it significantly reduced the loss of neurons. Better, it slowed the progression of symptoms by an average of 75% over three years.</p><p>We await publication of the trial’s results to see the devil in the detail, but this is exciting stuff. For current sufferers of Huntington’s, this promises dramatic improvement in their quality of life. Slowing their symptoms, perhaps even reaching some equilibrium if the remaining neurons can be saved. After all, this is only three years of data, in the first trial.</p><p>But wait. Because it is caused by a specific, countable mutation in a single gene, we can reliably identify who will go on to develop Huntington’s. Imagine giving a refined version of this gene therapy to those carriers before they develop symptoms. If it stops the making of the protein, it will stop the neuron death. If it stops the neuron death, there is a chance they won’t develop any symptoms.

<p>We always enjoy our annual review of the year at Retraction Watch, and 2025 is no exception. But we’re more excited about what lies ahead than what we already accomplished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re on track for our second-highest year for pageviews — 6.6 million. This year we brought you more than 300 posts. Among our most-read stories this year include ones on metrics: The most-read of the year was on universities whose <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/10/bibliometrics-universities-publication-metrics-authorship/">publication metrics</a> show signs of “questionable authorship practices.” Also among the most-read stories was one on the 20 journals that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/18/clarivate-impact-factor-suppression-list-2025-self-citation-stacking/">lost their impact factors</a> this year for citation issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fakery was also a theme in 2025. A story on a Springer Nature <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/30/springer-nature-book-on-machine-learning-is-full-of-made-up-citations/">book full of fake references</a> and one on dozens of papers with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/14/dozens-of-elsevier-papers-retracted-over-fake-companies-and-suspicious-authorship-changes/">fake company affiliations</a> were among the most popular of the year.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133700"></span>



<p>But the most popular doesn’t always mean the most important. We exposed universities <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/17/exclusive-iraqi-university-forcing-students-to-cite-its-journals-to-graduate/">in Iraq </a>and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/24/exclusive-highly-problematic-policy-has-saudi-university-pressuring-faculty-to-cite-its-research/">in Saudi Arabia</a> that require their students to cite other university papers to graduate. We’ve kept an eye on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/12/18/ori-has-released-just-two-misconduct-findings-this-year/">Office of Research Integrity</a> and its <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/03/18/liping-zhang-baylor-college-medicine-ori-debarment-image-manipulation/">misconduct</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/11/office-research-integrity-hhs-ryan-evanoff-washington-state-university/">rulings</a> – or lack thereof. We’ve reported <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/07/biotech-company-athira-settlement-data-falsification-allegations/">misconduct cases</a> settled under the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/12/16/dana-farber-settlement-false-claims-act-image-manipulation/">False Claims Act</a>, and written about a researcher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/28/exclusive-sonia-melo-sues-md-anderson-cancer-center-misconduct-finding/">suing her former institution</a> to dispute misconduct findings.</p>



<p>We’ve also covered retractions that arose from <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/08/cosmic-magnet-study-retracted-after-cleaning-agent-wipes-away-results/">the discovery</a> of experiments <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/26/potato-pathogens-fungus-contaminated-experiments-retract-replace/">gone awry</a>, which serve as examples of the scientific process working as it should.</p>



<p>The stories weren’t all serious. An April Fool’s joke about a patient whose heart was in his abdomen <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/15/tin-man-syndrome-case-plagiarized-from-hoax-sleuths-say/">made its way into the literature</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/02/tin-man-syndrome-five-other-case-studies-retracted-following-retraction-watch-coverage/">was retracted</a> after our coverage. A paper about <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/13/humanities-social-sciences-communications-springer-nature-sex-robot-bibliometrics/">sex robot research was retracted</a> after a robotics expert named in the paper found it and confirmed he does not, in fact, study sex robots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We keep track of a lot of trends as well: Our list of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">retracted COVID-19 papers</a> is now up to 643, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">mass resignations at journals</a> is up to 47, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">the leaderboard</a>, which is always among our most-viewed pages, saw some changes this year. And <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/12/26/retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker-now-has-400-entries/">as we noted last week</a>, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ak985WGOgGbJRJbZFanoktAN_UFeExpE/edit?gid=5255084#gid=5255084">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, developed and maintained by Anna Abalkina, has more than 400 journals on the list.</p>



<p>We published articles elsewhere, including <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/retraction-reactions"><em>American Scientist</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/02/rfk-kennedy-vaccines-scientific-literature/681681/?gift=w6OQiPUCkftfG9R36HqAqxModq95QY6b_iy67r-2j34&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224"><em>The Conversation</em></a>, <a href="https://inquisitivemag.org/articles/theme-essay/the-discipline-of-last-resort/"><em>Inquisitive</em></a>, <a href="https://quillette.com/2025/04/21/when-do-scholarly-retractions-become-a-form-of-censorship/"><em>Quillette</em></a>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/data-manipulations-alleged-study-paved-way-microsoft-s-quantum-chip"><em>Science</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/data-sleuths-work-thankless-they-must-get-credit-retractions"><em>Times Higher Education</em></a>. And Retraction Watch stories are now <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/scientist-fired-for-defrauding-scholars-in-huge-publishing-scam-73498">featured in <em>The Scientist</em></a>, as part of a syndication arrangement.</p>



<p>Our work has continued to appear in mainstream media outlets, including <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-23/black-kitchen-utensils-health-risk-revisited-after/104850404">ABC (Australia)</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/08/06/fraudulent-scientific-papers-are-booming"><em>The Economist</em></a>, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/07/07/le-monde-des-revues-scientifiques-au-bord-de-l-asphyxie_6619660_1650684.html"><em>Le Monde</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00257-2"><em>Nature</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/well/maha-report-citations.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2025/02/05/bijna-twintig-jaar-na-publicatie-blijkt-de-studie-nooit-te-zijn-uitgevoerd-a4882062"><em>NRC Handelsblad</em></a>, <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/scientific-journal-editors-mass-resignations/"><em>Science Friday</em></a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/indias-retraction-crisis-casts-shadow-over-science-research/articleshow/120238864.cms"><em>The Times of India</em></a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/12/17/hydroxychloroquine-study-covid-19-retracted-trump/77051671007/"><em>USA Today</em></a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/scientific-journals-quality-publishers-6399fc95"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/10/harvard-higher-ed-trump-lawsuits/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were invited to give dozens of talks all around the globe, including at research integrity conferences in Sydney and at Oxford; to organizations including the National Academies and the Cochrane Collaboration; and at universities including Columbia and Georgia State.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Retraction Watch received the Council of Science Editors’ top honor, <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/2025/05/06/now-is-not-the-time-to-fade-retraction-watch-awarded-council-of-science-editors-highest-honor/">the 2025 Award for Meritorious Achievement</a>, which our cofounders Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky accepted at the organization’s annual meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year held important internal developments, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hired a full-time team for Retraction Watch, with managing editor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/kate-travis/">Kate Travis</a> and staff reporter <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/avery-orrall/">Avery Orrall</a> joining us in January and staff reporter <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/alicia-gallegos/">Alicia Gallegos</a> joining us in December.</p>



<p>The Retraction Watch Database now includes 63,000 retractions. We’re always thrilled to see how researchers use the database and the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/papers-that-cite-retraction-watch/">studies that cite it</a>. Our research director Alison Abritis celebrated 10 years with Retraction Watch this year. She and associate researcher Gordon Sullivan were joined by assistant database researcher Noah Knox to increase our capacity to keep the database robust and up to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this essential work is the core of Retraction Watch, we’ve always had a bigger vision for what our parent nonprofit, <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/">The Center for Scientific Integrity</a>, could do. And that vision came to fruition this year with the launch of several new projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://medicalevidenceproject.org/">Medical Evidence Project</a> is investigating problems in the medical literature that directly affect human health. Led by James Heathers, the project is leveraging the tools of forensic metascience to identify problems in scientific articles. Veteran editor Alice Dreger joined the team this fall to serve as the project&#8217;s editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/2025/05/27/meet-the-first-two-retraction-watch-sleuths-in-residence/">Sleuths in Residence Program</a> expanded our team to include David Robert Grimes and Mariana Ribeiro, who are bringing their research expertise to the dozens of tips we receive. The sleuths’ work appeared in articles on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/12/08/how-to-juice-your-google-scholar-h-index-preprint-by-preprint/">Google Scholar gaming</a>, an analysis of papers by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/12/09/one-of-kazakhstans-top-nuclear-physicists-also-leads-his-nation-in-retractions/">a top physicist</a> in Kazakhstan, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/12/19/world-bank-report-removed-nonexistent-references/">a report by the World Bank</a> with fake references.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/renowned-scientific-integrity-investigator-endows-fund-support-fellow-sleuths">Elisabeth Bik Science Integrity Fund</a>, launched with Bik’s generous donation of the proceeds of her Einstein Award, provides financial resources for sleuths and other science integrity advocates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re thrilled by this growth and progress, and look forward to focusing on further developing these projects in 2026, all of which center on keeping individuals, institutions and publishers accountable to upholding the integrity of the research enterprise.</p>

</div><span style="font-size: medium;">-- start of letter --</span><br /><br /><p></p></div><div style="text-align: right;">December 28, 2025&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />Dr. Miyakawa and the Editorial Staff of <i>Neuropsychopharmacology Reports</i>, <br /><br />&nbsp;I am writing about the legitimacy of an article published in the journal: <blockquote>Trivedi, M. K., Branton, A., Trivedi, D., Mondal, S., &amp; Jana, S. (2025). <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/npr2.70050" target="_blank">Amelioration of Adults' Mental Health Conditions and Symptoms Through Spiritual Energy Therapy: Randomized Controlled Trial</a>. <i>Neuropsychopharmacology Reports</i>, 45(3), e70050. </blockquote><br />This paper was <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2025/07/retracted-phony-study-on-biofield.html" target="_blank">retracted</a> from the <i>Journal of General and Family Medicine</i> after an investigation: <blockquote>“<i>The retraction has been agreed upon following an investigation into concerns raised by a third party, which revealed an inappropriate control group used as the placebo group of the trial, inconsistencies in the Psychological Questionnaire Scoring, highly implausible functional biomarker values that are out of the typical physiological range, and unsupported claims regarding the scientific evidence behind the biofield energy treatment.</i>” </blockquote><br />The authors objected to the retraction, edited the manuscript, and submitted it for publication in <i>NPPR</i>. The first author still makes extraordinary and unvalidated claims about his ability to change the mental and physical health of human volunteers via transmission of his thoughts (described as “blessing” throughout the manuscript). A peer-reviewed journal that accepts such declarations without incontrovertible scientific evidence, which was never provided, has compromised its scientific reputation. Furthermore, the study’s design is flawed and much of the data contained in the paper is implausible and inauthentic. <br /><br />I am an established scientist who runs a research lab, and as I will outline below, it is ethically mandatory for <i>Neuropsychopharmacology Reports</i> to reconsider this paper and for Wiley to retract it from the scientific literature for the following reasons.&nbsp;<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>In the abstract, the paper contends that the study was a “single-blind, active-controlled, randomized trial.” This is false.</li><blockquote>“<span style="font-family: arial;">Control subjects did not receive any treatment.</span>”  (p. 2)</blockquote><br /><li>The psychological questionnaire (PQ) used to assess mental health was “…based on a 7-point Likert scale of scoring” with two questions for each of 14 symptoms (see p. 3 and Appendix 1).</li><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial;">“The PQ was made by in-house renowned experienced psychologists based on literature with some modifications, and these PQs were routinely used in various clinical trial projects.” </span></blockquote><br />There are many standardized psychological instruments that could have been used (e.g., PHQ-9, Beck Depression Inventory, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), but the authors chose to use an unvalidated measure (file ‘<i>npr270050-sup-0001-annexures1.docx</i>’) with some unusual questions such as, “How is the quality of your skin?” for sleep disturbances and “Do you have desire to become independent and do something big for your family?” for Lack of inspiration, which would need to be reverse scored. Furthermore, the questions for Emotional Trauma do not measure emotional trauma. <br /><br />The authors added Appendix 2 (file ‘<i>npr270050-sup-0002-datas1.xlsx</i>’) to the republished paper, which contains the raw data. However, the Table 2 data contain some irregularities. In the <i>Table 2_PQ_Treatment</i> tab, the scores for ‘Stress from the Spiritual Energy Therapy Group (Day 180)’ are all ‘2’. It is statistically unlikely that 35 people would all endorse the lowest possible score for those two questions. For Sleep Disturbances, 32 out of 35 scored ‘2’ and for Depression, 30 out of 35 scored ‘2’.<br /><br /><li>Tables 3 and 4 list measurements for the functional biomarkers, which are the clearest evidence for unverifiable data (or error). In the retracted paper, some of these were highly implausible, because their values were out-of-range of typical physiological levels (to an extent beyond what is seen in pathological conditions). Oxytocin and plasma catecholamines (dopamine and norepinephrine) were the most egregious, and they were omitted from the revised paper, which...&nbsp;</li><blockquote>
  “<span style="font-family: arial;">…no longer includes data on a few biomarkers that raised concerns in the retracted article due to the high variability observed in these biomarker values.</span>”</blockquote><p></p>The problem wasn’t high variability, it was that the values were physiologically impossible. For the remaining biomarkers, clarifications were made (e.g., 17-β-estradiol was measured only in women and the units were ng/L, not ng/mL).&nbsp;</ol>  <br />In the example below, the units for Klotho (an anti-aging biomarker) were revised from pg/mL to ng/mL, but now the values are much <i>above </i>normal.</div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3" class="MsoNormalTable" style="mso-cellspacing: 1.5pt; mso-yfti-tbllook: 1184;">

<p><em>The BMJ</em> has retracted a paper on a clinical trial of different methods of vascular access during cardiac arrest after an expert raised concerns about the randomization in the trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/386/bmj-2024-079878.full.pdf">published in July 2024</a>, reports the results of a trial comparing intravenous and intraosseous vascular access for treating people who experienced cardiac arrest. It has been cited 29 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction marks the 13th <em>The BMJ </em>has issued since its first in 1989, <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?%3d1%26jou%3dBMJ%253a%2bBritish%2bMedical%2bJournal">according to the Retraction Watch Database</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133684"></span>



<p>The December 18 <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r2558">retraction notice</a> references an online comment that “raised concerns about the randomisation scheme and allocation ratio” in the study. Although it doesn’t directly identify the comment, a rapid response to the paper on Sept. 9, 2024, by <a href="https://www.au.dk/en/lwandersen@clin.au.dk">Lars Andersen</a>, a professor of clinical medicine at Aarhus University in Denmark, mentions the same concerns covered in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andersen told us retracting the article was the correct decision, and that “issues with the trial and the manuscript were quite severe” and “could lead to bias and incorrect conclusions.”</p>



<p>In<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2024-079878/rr-1"> his comment</a> on the article, Andersen, who is also a statistical reviewer for the <em>Journal for the American Medical Association</em>, noted the randomization of the interventions and the ratio of patients in each treatment group did not occur in the same ratio the authors had specified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emergency response teams were randomly assigned to use either intravenous or intraosseous access for cardiac patients for a two-week period. The trial stated this would be a 1:2 ratio, with twice as many people in the intravenous group as the other. In reality, the data showed periods with no randomization, where all teams were assigned the same mode of treatment, and periods with an equal ratio of treatments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Study coauthors <a href="https://scholars.lib.ntu.edu.tw/items/c91746fa-7f5f-449a-914d-642b718e4120">Ying-Chih Ko</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8620-7982">Wen-Chu Chiang</a>, both researchers at the National Taiwan University Hospital, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2024-079878/rr-3">responded</a> to Andersen’s comment, acknowledging the “potential explanations for this phenomenon mentioned in the manuscript are not strongly convincing.” They said they were attempting to achieve an “approximate” 1:2 ratio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andersen shared a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnZGmNVhKEkjuyJ5VvMp10Aa2JXReo7v/view?usp=sharing">more lengthy explanation</a> of his concerns with the journal on Oct. 17, 2024, which expanded on the discrepancies. “The correct description of the randomization should be provided in the manuscript,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another discrepancy Andersen pointed out in his comment was the number of patients that ended up in each treatment group, which was roughly the same for intraosseous and intravenous delivery — around 3,900 people — rather than the 1:2 allocation ratio the authors set out to include. In the paper, the authors speculate the unexpected similarity may have been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or “of prolonged pre-hospital time” in the intravenous group, “potentially leading to lower turnover and fewer overall emergency medical service dispatches.”</p>



<p>Chiang told us the journal’s editorial office “confirmed that this retraction in no way implies any ethical lapses or misconduct.” He also called the errors “unintentional procedural errors arising from manual randomisation interpretation, most of which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan.”</p>



<p>The authors “launched an exhaustive one-month re-examination” of the data, Chiang said, and confirmed some of the data “did not strictly adhere to the schedule due to unprecedented disruptions to our research operations during the pandemic.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors requested a retraction and replacement or a correction of the article, but “fully respect” the decision to retract, Chiang said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, <em>The BMJ </em><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/12/bmj-places-expression-of-concern-on-heavily-criticized-stem-cell-paper/">issued an expression of concern</a> for a stem cell paper criticized for a “complete mismatch” between the data and the study itself. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/20/relieved-bmj-retracts-and-replaces-article-on-unexpected-weight-loss-as-a-sign-of-cancer/">Last November</a>, the journal retracted and replaced an article on unexpected weight loss as a sign of cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Anna Abalkina: </strong>Thank you! When we started the list in May 2022, it had a bit more than 100 entries. Today, the number has surpassed 400, so there are 70-80 new hijacked journals annually. I’m very grateful to scholars and my colleagues who inform Retraction Watch and me about new hijacked journals. </p>



<p>I detected my first hijacked journal in 2020 because the journal <em>Talent Development and Excellence</em> — which I later found was a hijacked version — had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/07/the-case-of-the-stolen-journal/">published some plagiarized papers</a>, and unauthorized content was indexed in Scopus. Then I identified <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0">a big network </a>of hijacked journals. I also found that there were no active resources listing hijacked journals. Jeffrey Beall, who maintained a list of potential predatory and hijacked journals, had closed them. So I had the idea to create this regularly updated resource, which is freeware for scholars, in collaboration with Retraction Watch.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Are any cases particularly memorable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abalkina: </strong>I remember one of my first detected hijacked journals, <em>Novyi Mir</em> (<em>New World</em>). It is a legendary Soviet, and now Russian, literary journal, a national heritage. For example, in 1962, during the Soviet period, it published <em>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</em>, by Nobel Laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, about a Gulag prisoner, when the whole problem of the Gulag and political repressions had been silenced in the country. It was painful to see how the journal was hijacked and its title was used in a scam.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Are the outfits hijacking journals typically duplicating a single journal or several?</strong></p>



<p>There are several large networks of hijacked journals. They create dozens of clone websites of original journals. This is helpful for detection because they exhibit similar patterns. However, we still do not know much about these networks, and understanding how hijacked journals are organized is one of my future research goals.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Are you able to trace hijacked journals back to who’s behind them?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abalkina: </strong>I found one company that is behind journal transfers and journal hijacking. It is in my plans for 2026 to write more about it. But, unfortunately, many hijacked journals are registered anonymously and it is difficult to understand who is behind them.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Have any journals been hijacked more than once?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abalkina: </strong>There are increasing numbers of cases in which a journal has been hijacked several times by different networks of hijacked journals. This happens because fraudulent publishers target the same types of journals: those indexed in Scopus or Web of Science, local-language journals, and niche journals. The documented record is <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/24/how-many-times-can-a-journal-be-hijacked/">five clone websites</a> of the <em>Seybold Journal</em>.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong> <strong>Do journals get removed from the list?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abalkina: </strong>The Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker contains all websites, including expired ones. Evidence shows the strategy of some hijacked journals is cherry-picking. They create a clone website, it works for a certain period of time, and when the fraud is detected, the URL is abandoned and then expires.  Keeping it on the list maintains a record that something went wrong and that there was a problematic journal with this title. That can help explain bad citations, for example, later on.</p>



<p>There are rare cases in which the web domain was cleared (or the content was cleared because of a court decision or legal enforcement).</p>



<p><strong>RW: Is there any sort of enforcement after a journal is added to the list?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abalkina: </strong>There is enforcement when a journal belonging to a major publisher is hijacked. Publishers have large legal teams. I see, for example, that Springer is quite effective in closing the web domains of hijacked journals. Ironically the <em>Journal of Academic Ethics </em><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">was hijacked in 2024</a>, and the legal team turned it down rather fast.</p>



<p>Lately,  I see an increasing number of journals belonging to Elsevier being hijacked. <em>Journal of Informetrics</em>, one of the leading journals in scientometrics, was hijacked recently. I have informed the publisher, but the website is still operating. That can also mean the hijacked journal is anonymous, and such enforcement is difficult when registrars don’t act without a court decision.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Hijacking a journal seems like a convoluted way to make money. Is this a profitable scam?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abalkina: </strong>I believe it is a very profitable scam. Creating a hijacked journal doesn’t require much money. They attract clients by sending marketing emails or cooperating with paper mills, which have their own local database of clients.</p>



<p>I estimate some hijacked journals that have content indexed in Scopus could earn more than $1 million within several months.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Do hijacked journals pose a real threat to the scientific literature?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abalkina: </strong>Definitely, hijacked journals are a cybercrime and a scam. They are not as numerous as predatory journals, but we see the consequences of hijacked journals in science.</p>



<p>First of all, there is evidence that papers in hijacked journals are associated with misconduct. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2024.2387210">One study</a> showed that 66 percent of the analyzed sample of papers in hijacked journals contained plagiarism, and 28 percent&nbsp; displayed text similarities of 25 percent or more.</p>



<p>Papers published in hijacked journals are indexed in different databases, for example in Google Scholar. They were also successful in penetrating Scopus. <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24855">Another study</a> found that 67 hijacked journals compromised the data of authentic (original) journals in Scopus. Such indexjacking is harmful.</p>



<p>Papers from hijacked journals have also been added to the WHO database on COVID-19, and they <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04703">are actively cited in publications</a> that legitimize bad research.</p>



<p><strong>RW: </strong> <strong>What should people do if they see a journal they think might be hijacked?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abalkina: </strong>First of all, you can verify whether a journal is really hijacked. Look at WHOIS to see when the website was registered and whether the registrar is anonymous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check the DOIs. Sometimes hijacked journals use fake DOIs starting with 16 or 20. Real DOIs always start with 10. Check whether the titles of the papers correspond to the title of the journal, or whether you see anything suspicious. In many hijacked journals, the topic of the papers doesn’t correspond to the title of the journal. Then, check whether the journal and the exact URL are present in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ak985WGOgGbJRJbZFanoktAN_UFeExpE/edit?gid=5255084#gid=5255084">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>. If not, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOZ6qj8ZwpkGh8IH7Z43xnxgY8B9wPHUKXnK50ikVv3HC-Dg/viewform">use the form</a> to notify us about a possible hijacked journal. We will review the case, and if it is confirmed, we will update the Checker.</p>

<p>A federal court has terminated a former researcher’s lawsuit against the U.S. government agency that barred her from receiving federal funds following an agency investigation that lasted 10 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ivana Frech  — formerly Ivana De Domenico — <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/30/researcher-sues-u-s-government-following-debarment-misconduct-finding/">sued the U.S. Office of Research Integrity</a> (ORI) in 2023 after <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-de-domenico-ivana">the agency concluded</a> she engaged in research misconduct while at the University of Utah, by “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly falsifying and/or fabricating” images in work funded by the National Institutes of Health. In her <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Complaint_Frech.pdf">legal complaint</a> filed shortly after ORI’s debarment, Frech alleged the agency’s misconduct findings and debarment decision were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unsupported by substantial evidence, and contrary to law and regulation.” </p>



<p>On December 12, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia threw out Frech’s suit, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.259201/gov.uscourts.dcd.259201.52.0.pdf">ruling in favor of the government’s motion</a> for summary judgement. Summary motions are granted when a court finds no genuine dispute over material facts and a lack of conflicting evidence for a jury to weigh. The decision allows ORI’s three-year debarment – which runs through August 2026 – and misconduct conclusions against Frech to stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133670"></span>



<p>Frech told Retraction Watch she was disappointed with the outcome, but that she respected the court’s decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Although it was not the result I had hoped for, I am pleased that the Court specifically noted that its decision should not be understood as the Court’s agreement with HHS’ actions or that the ten-year delay in issuing its debarment decision was justified,” Frech told us in an email statement sent by her attorney, Stephen Tobin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“Moreover, I am appreciative that the Court expressly noted that it had no doubts about my ability to meaningfully contribute to the scientific community in the future.”</p>



<p>Frech declined to answer further questions about the case. ORI did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The case dates back to 2011 when ORI received allegations that Frech manipulated data underlying a series of research papers on which she was a coauthor. The agency referred the allegations to the University of Utah, where an investigation uncovered a “pattern of recklessness” in how Frech reported data across multiple publications, according to the court’s December 12 summary of the case. In 2012, <em>Cell Metabolism</em>&nbsp; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/05/23/authors-retract-two-cell-metabolism-papers-after-data-were-inappropriately-removed-from-the-laboratory/">retracted two papers</a>&nbsp; associated with the manipulated data at the request of the authors. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/06/06/two-new-corrections-for-utah-group-that-retracted-two-cell-metabolism-papers-for-missing-notebooks/">More corrections</a> soon followed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university concluded Frech had committed research misconduct, terminated her employment, and sent its findings to ORI.</p>



<p>In 2014, Frech informed the agency she “vigorously opposed the accusations made against her” and continued to maintain her accusers were incorrect and “motivated by bad faith,” according to the court’s summary.&nbsp; She asked to present additional arguments and evidence in her favor if the office conducted an oversight review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, ORI extended a settlement offer to Frech that if accepted, would allow her to receive supervision and education in lieu of debarment. She declined the settlement, according to court records.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2023, a decade after ORI’s investigation began, ORI ruled Frech had engaged in research misconduct and barred her from receiving federal funds for three years. Attorneys for Frech asked ORI to “reconsider its decision not to resolve the matter through a mutually agreeable settlement.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, on August 29, 2023, ORI informed Frech that because she failed to request an administrative hearing within 30 days of the charge letter, the debarment was final. Frech then sued, claiming the misconduct findings and final decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/administrative_procedure_act">federal law</a> governing how agencies make rules and resolve disputes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the litigation, Frech <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Frech_Restraining_Order_Request_2024.pdf">requested a temporary restraining order</a> to block ORI from enforcing the debarment. At the time, Frech’s new employer, a community hospital in Iowa City, had been purchased by the University of Iowa, which does not employ debarred employees, according to court records. Because of the debarment, Frech was terminated from her job on January 30, 2024, according to her motion for the restraining order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frech’s motion was denied, but the court cautioned that ORI “may have a bit more explaining to do,” according to a summary in the December 12 decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The court highlighted three potential shortcomings in ORI’s explanation for its debarment decision: “a lack of detail in the justification of its conclusion that Frech was personally responsible for an altered figure in one of the articles … a failure to grapple with Frech’s argument that the passage of time since the alleged misconduct mitigated any concern that she was not presently responsible, and … a failure to explain its determination that Frech solely planned, [initiated], and carried out the wrongdoing.”</p>



<p>In response, the government asked the court to remand the case to HHS so the department could reexamine the agency’s actions. In November 2024, ORI again concluded that Frech “engaged in research misconduct and recommended a three-year debarment period.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In the court’s latest 27-page decision, District Judge Christopher R. Cooper concluded found Frech’s debarment was not “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.”</p>



<p>“The department addressed the court’s concerns, articulated ‘a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,’ provided ‘substantial evidence’ supporting its decision, and made no ‘clear error in judgment,’” Cooper wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the court, ORI explained the long delay for its ruling was due to “the large and growing volume of ORI’s responsibilities relative to its staffing levels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The court also addressed Frech’s contention that in the years since she left the University of Utah, her “positive impact and unblemished record” at another laboratory demonstrates that she is presently responsible. Following her termination at the university, Frech stepped away from science and obtained her MBA, according to the court’s summary. In 2015, she accepted a position as a research scientist in Fenghuang Zhan’s laboratory at the University of Iowa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frech attested that during her four years at the lab, no one raised concerns about “the veracity or accuracy of her work,” nor were there any questions about her&nbsp; “professionalism and integrity.” However, in its amended charge letter, ORI identified several instances in which Frech was purportedly not “transparent about her involvement with federally funded research while working in the Zhan laboratory.”</p>



<p>Although Frech “vigorously” disputed the assertion, Cooper wrote she is ultimately asking the Court to reweigh a mitigating factor that ORI already considered. Agree or disagree, the determination was “the product of reasoned decisionmaking and therefore ‘must be upheld’ under the deferential APA standard of review,” the judge wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Cooper made clear that the court “is not stating that it would have reached the same conclusion as the Debarring Official,” nor is the court justifying the department’s “ten-year delay in issuing its debarment decision.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And the court does not doubt that Dr. Frech may make meaningful contributions to the scientific community in the future,” Cooper continued. “Instead, the court simply adheres to the ‘highly deferential’ standard of review under the APA.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580708002396">another paper</a> highlighted in ORI’s investigation is still intact, despite a recommendation that it be retracted. Editors of <em>Developmental Cell</em> did not return messages seeking the status of the recommended retraction. Jerry Kaplan, professor emeritus at the University of Utah and a coauthor of the paper, told Retraction Watch that to his knowledge, the University of Utah has been in communication with the journal regarding the issue. He said he was not aware of a resolution in the matter.&nbsp;</p>
