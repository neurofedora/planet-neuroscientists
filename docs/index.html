              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-asteroids-fomalhaut-star">The James Webb telescope revealed surprise asteroids in the Fomalhaut star system</a></h4>

              
                <p>The star Fomalhaut is ready for its close-up.</p>



<p>Rings of dust encircle the young star in stunning new images from the James Webb Space Telescope. The photos offer a clearer view of the star system — already famous for previous images of a purported, now widely disputed, planet. Features in the system include an oddly cockeyed asteroid belt, an expanding cloud of debris from a possible planet collision, and other unidentified bits <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01962-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that hint at a dynamic and crowded environment</a>, researchers report May 8 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“It’s the first time we’re actually looking at the inner system, and it looks really different than I think anybody expected it to,” says astrophysicist Meredith MacGregor of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study. “The expectation was that there would be something like our solar system,” a place that is relatively mature and stable. “It really starts changing how we think about the dynamics of the [Fomalhaut] system.”</p>



<p>Fomalhaut, a scant 25 light-years away, is a young star at the center of a rapidly evolving planetary system. It was once thought to host one of the first planets to be photographed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extrasolar-planetary-system-makes-pictorial-debut">outside of our solar system</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/08</em>). However, the existence of the planet — dubbed Dagon — has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-faux-malhaut-b">long been in question</a> (<em>SN: 1/26/12</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new JWST images add to the growing evidence that Dagon is actually a cloud of dust. A collision among planets probably explains the dusty feature, says András Gáspár, an astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It is fading, and it is expanding in size,” he says, as it follows a trajectory consistent with dust blowing in the stellar wind from Fomalhaut. Those are all characteristics more indicative of dust clouds than planets.</p>



<p>But just because Dagon hasn’t seemed to have panned out, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other planets lurking around Fomalhaut.</p>



<p>Indirect evidence for other worlds comes from an unexpected asteroid belt, seen for the first time in the new images. The belt is tilted at a jaunty 23 degrees from everything else seen in orbit around the star.</p>



<p>“This is a truly unique aspect of the system,” Gáspár says. The tilted belt, he says, could be the result of as-yet-undiscovered planets stirring up the debris around Fomalhaut.</p>



<p>MacGregor agrees. “If you see a disk that&#8217;s like this, that has an [elongated] outer ring and a bunch of dust that&#8217;s getting dragged in, there are probably planets there,” she says. “I think the easiest explanation [for the tilted belt] is there&#8217;s a planet in there, and the planet is on an orbit that is not aligned with the disk.” The misaligned planet, in turn, is dragging the asteroid belt off-kilter with respect to the plane of the solar system, she says.</p>





<p>The JWST images also turned up a newly identified feature in the outer belt around the star.&nbsp; It’s a blob that Gáspár and his colleagues call the Great Dust Cloud. It’s not yet clear whether it’s a real feature, or just some bright object shining through from beyond the Fomalhaut system.</p>



<p>“It could easily be a background galaxy,” Gáspár says, “which would be a really cruel trick by nature.” Follow-up observations with JWST will help them decide, he says. If the object stays put while the Fomalhaut system keeps spinning, then it’s a cosmic photobomber, lurking in the background.</p>



<p>The latest images answer some questions about Fomalhaut while raising a host of new ones, Gáspár says. “This single observation of Fomalhaut revealed way too many aspects of the system that we need to understand and unpack,” he says. “We set out to spatially resolve the asteroid belt component but ended up opening a much greater box of surprises.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-pipistrelle-bats-echolocation">Pregnancy may hamper bats’ ability to ‘see’ in the dark</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pregnancy can do weird things to the body. For some bats, it can hamper their ability to “see” the world around them.</p>



<p>Kuhl’s pipistrelle bats (<em>Pipistrellus kuhlii</em>) <a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01557-7#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20pregnant%20bats%20emitted%20longer,in%20hunting%20performance%20during%20pregnancy." target="_blank" rel="noopener">echolocate less frequently while pregnant</a>, researchers report March 28 in <em>BMC Biology</em>. The change may make it harder for the tiny bats to detect prey and potential obstacles in the environment.</p>



<p>The study is among the first to show that pregnancy can shape how nonhuman mammals sense their surroundings, says Yossi Yovel, a neuroecologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel.</p>





<p>Nocturnal bats like Kuhl’s pipistrelles famously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bat-brain-signals-illuminate-navigation-dark">use sound to navigate and hunt prey in the dark</a> (<em>SN: 9/20/17</em>). Their calls bounce off whatever is nearby and bats use the echoes to reconstruct what’s around them, a process aptly named echolocation. The faster a bat makes calls, the better it can make out its surroundings. But rapid-fire calling requires breathing deeply, which is something that pregnancy can get in the way of.</p>



<p>“Although I’ve never been pregnant, I know that when I eat a lot, it’s more difficult to breathe,” Yovel says. So pregnancy — which can add a full gram to a 7-gram Kuhl’s pipistrelle and may push up on the lungs — might hamper echolocation.</p>



<p>Yovel and colleagues tested their hypothesis by capturing 10 Kuhl’s pipistrelles, five of whom were pregnant, and training the bats to find and land on a platform. Recordings of the animals’ calls revealed that bats that weren’t pregnant made around 130 calls on average while searching for the platform. But bats that were pregnant made only around 110 calls, or 15 percent fewer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decline in calls among pregnant bats could impede hunting, the team says. A computer simulation showed that the study’s expectant moms would catch 15 percent fewer insects than nonpregnant bats. That finding could help explain why some bat species chase after larger and slower prey once they become pregnant, focusing their energy on easier-to-spot food. Figuring out whether diminished echolocating ability is responsible for these diet shifts will require more fieldwork, Yovel says.</p>



<p>However, the idea that carrying a fetus would interfere with echolocation makes a lot of sense, says behavior ecologist Erin Gillam of North Dakota State University in Fargo. “As a mammal who has been pregnant, I don’t think these results are surprising at all.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>First successful enzyme therapy in humans</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/first-successful-enzyme-therapy-humans"><em>Science News</em></a>, April 28, 1973</p>



<p>Fabry’s disease … [is caused by] a faulty fat-metabolizing enzyme called alpha-galactosidase. Because the abnormal enzyme does not break down lipids in the blood as it should, they accumulate in the body. [Researchers] tried to purify the enzyme in its normal form from human placental tissue. Four months ago they got enough of the enzyme to inject into two patients…. The results look promising.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Though the trial showed that enzyme replacement therapy could work, it took decades before such treatments were cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 1991, an injection to treat a different rare inherited disorder called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/enzyme-therapy-another-success">Gaucher disease</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/altered-enzyme-reverses-gauchers-symptoms">became the first to gain approval</a> (<em>SN: 11/23/74; </em>SN: 5/25/91). Approval for an enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry&#8217;s disease followed in 2003. Scientists are still developing enzyme therapies. Last year, researchers reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/child-treated-rare-genetic-disease-womb">treating a developing fetus for Pompe disease</a>, which causes severe heart and muscle defects (SN: 11/9/22).</p>

<p>A 2021 article that found journals from the open-access publisher MDPI had characteristics of predatory journals has been retracted and replaced with a version that softens its conclusions about the company. MDPI is still not satisfied, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/405/6348133">Journal citation reports and the definition of a predatory journal: The case of the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)</a>,” was published in <em>Research Evaluation</em>. It has been cited 20 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.us.es/trabaja-en-la-us/directorio/maria-de-los-angeles-oviedo-garcia">María de los Ángeles Oviedo García</a>, a professor of business administration and marketing at the University of Seville in Spain, and the paper’s sole author, analyzed 53 MDPI journals that were included in Clarivate’s 2018 Journal Citation Reports.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127066"></span>



<p>Oviedo García assessed each journal by eight criteria associated with predatory publications, including self-citation. She also compared the MDPI journals to the journals with the highest impact factor in their subject category. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211211124315/https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/405/6348133">original abstract</a> described her findings like this:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The formal criteria together with the analysis of the citation patterns of the 53 journals under analysis all singled them out as predatory journals.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Soon after the paper was published in July 2021, MDPI issued a “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/2979">comment</a>” about the article that responded to Oviedo García’s analysis point by point. The comment called out “the misrepresentation of MDPI, as well as concerns around the accuracy of the data and validity of the research methodology.”</p>



<p>In September 2021, <em>Research Evaluation</em> published an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/420/6360986?login=false">expression of concern</a> about the article that stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal and publisher have been alerted to concerns about this article, and an investigation is in progress. In the interim, we alert readers that these concerns have been raised.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The article was retracted and replaced with a revised version earlier this month. The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rev/advance-article/doi/10.1093/reseval/rvad014/7126683?login=false">notice</a>, which is labeled as a “correction,” stated that the replacement addressed:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>concerns about conclusions drawn in the article. The conclusions in the updated article are reached based on cited sources.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Oviedo García what led to the retraction and replacement, and she told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In a nutshell, after the publication of the article both the journal&#8217;s editors and the publisher received communications raising concerns about it. Then, that original version was revised and have been now published replacing the old version of the article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Oviedo García told us that she did not “have full details” about who raised concerns about the article. “The revision of the article was a joint work between the publisher and myself,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/thed-van-leeuwen#tab-1">Thed van Leeuwen</a>, a senior researcher at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies of Leiden University in the Netherlands, and an editor of <em>Research Evaluation, </em>has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Language throughout the article was changed to describe the findings less definitively. (See a comparison we created <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Comparison-version.docx">here</a>.) The sentence in the abstract we quoted above now states that the analysis of the 53 journals “suggest[s] they may be predatory journals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critical language remains in the new version, such as this discussion of the MDPI journals’ huge and <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/quality-questions-publishers-growth-challenges-big-players">increasing number of special issues</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact that the number of special issues in JCR-indexed MDPI-journals is so much higher than the number of ordinary issues per year coupled with their constant increase since 2018 inevitably awakens suspicions of a lucrative business aim.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The revision removes some references to MDPI’s temporary inclusion on librarian Jeffrey Beall’s list of “potentially predatory” publishers, along with links to an <a href="https://beallslist.net/">archived version</a> of the list, which was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/">taken down in 2017</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The revised version also includes additional caveats about the limitations of the work, such as which analyses Oviedo García did not conduct on the control group of top-ranked journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, rather than the original statement that the uniformly short review times at MDPI journals were “highly questionable,” the paper now states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As such the question arises whether or not this speed is achieved with a thorough peer review in line with editorial and publishing best practices or if the rigor and quality of the peer review process is compromised in order to achieve these speeds. It is beyond the scope of this research to answer that question based on the analysis conducted, further research is needed to address this key question.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A new paragraph in the section discussing the article’s limitations calls for further research to compare MDPI journals with other journals with similar impact factors, rather than the top-ranked journal in the subject area, as Oviedo García had done. MDPI’s comment on the article specifically called the comparison of its journals to those with the highest impact factors “flawed,” among many other critiques.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After <em>Research Evaluation</em> published the expression of concern about the paper, MDPI contacted Oxford University Press, the journal’s publisher, to follow up on the status of the article multiple times, said Giulia Stefenelli, chair of MDPI’s Board of Scientific Officers. But, Stefenelli told us, “We did not receive any response from OUP that showed progress on the handling of this paper, nor did we receive an update when this paper was retracted and replaced by a revised version.”</p>



<p>Stefenelli expressed dissatisfaction with the journal’s process, and the republished version of the paper:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We were expecting more transparency and communication, and to be informed at key stages of the progression of the investigation. As we have demonstrated, the original article contained serious flaws in its methodology, which have yet to be addressed or corrected. This was highlighted in our initial comment on the article (https://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/2979).</p>



<p>We would expect more details to be made publicly available for the readers so they can understand why this article was retracted and corrected. We found no track record of the original version retracted nor record about the corrections that have been made. In this case, we question OUP’s processing of this retraction/correction, as it would appear to be against COPE guidelines and standard practices.</p>



<p>The article sends a strong message affecting MDPI directly and ultimately begs the question, is this an article the public can trust? It is important to note that a retraction is issued when there is clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, as a result of major error. The fact that this article was retracted raises questions about the details of the significant changes made in order for it to be republished.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/AdobeStock_569558679-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h4>Maternal vaccination</h4>
<p>Pregnancy and early infancy are increased risk periods for severe adverse effects of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937812007223?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respiratory infections</a>. Influenza vaccines (IIV) and whooping cough (pertussis) vaccines are <a href="https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended</a> and free to every Australian pregnant woman to combat these infections during pregnancy, and the vaccines provide protection for young infants as well for approximately the first six months of life, through the transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta.</p>
<p>Because there is no central, national system in Australia that routinely monitors maternal vaccination uptake, it is unclear whether there is equitable distribution of these vaccines among our diverse populations. This is important because despite being recommended and free in Australia for decades, the overall uptake of IIV in pregnancy varies greatly between the different states and territories. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1753-6405.13130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uptake generally remains sub-optimal</a>, and we need to be confident that those with higher risk factors for infection in pregnancy and early infancy are being offered and provided vaccination. These risk factors include people with co-morbidities, living in remote regions, lower socio-economic status, inadequate housing, decreased rates of exclusive breastfeeding, and limited access to culturally safe and appropriate, affordable health care.</p>
<h4>Existing inequities</h4>
<p><a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajo.13548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our previous work</a> found that rates of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy were higher than they were for IIV, and that pertussis vaccination in pregnancy was a <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajo.13548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key driver</a> for having IIV in pregnancy. But we also found that pertussis vaccination was considerably lower (17%) among Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander pregnancies (respectfully referred to as First Nations) compared to other Australians (54% vs 71%). This was concerning because First Nations women and infants in Australia bear a disproportionately <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/baseline-incidence-of-adverse-birth-outcomes-and-infant-influenza-and-pertussis-hospitalisations-prior-to-the-introduction-of-influenza-and-pertussis-vaccination-in-pregnancy-a-data-linkage-study-of-78-382-motherinfant-pairs-northern-territory-australia-19942015/E5B9726C48B9177FD9E5CE7822E7A901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher burden</a> of respiratory diseases compared to non-Indigenous women and infants, which is a consistent finding in other countries’ Indigenous populations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vaccination against these infections has to be prioritized in these groups as a key public health strategy in preventing severe disease in pregnancy and early infancy and is the benchmark of equitable healthcare.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05574-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, we sought to understand these findings further, so we explored the equity of maternal IIV and pertussis vaccination for three Australian groups between 2012-2017: First Nations women; women from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds; and women living in remote areas or areas considered socio-economically disadvantaged. Our cohort of 445,590 individual pregnancies from the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia comprised of 29,181 First Nations women (6.5%), 93,561 women from CALD backgrounds (20.9%), and 322,848 other Australian women (72.4%).</p>
<p>Over the six years we found that although maternal vaccination rates were steadily increasing over time, overarching inequity persisted in participants who a) identified as First Nations, b) lived in remote areas, and c) lived in areas considered the highest in disadvantage. Compared with the other groups, First Nations women were <strong>less likely</strong> to have received <em>both</em> of the recommended maternal vaccines whereas women from CALD backgrounds were <strong>more likely</strong> to have. Women living in the highest areas of advantage were <strong>more</strong> <strong>likely</strong> to have received both vaccines during pregnancy too.</p>
<p>We know the increased risk factors for acquiring influenza or pertussis infections are living in remote regions, lower socio-economic status, inadequate housing, and limited access to culturally safe and appropriate, affordable health care. Vaccination against these infections has to be prioritized in these groups as a key public health strategy in preventing severe disease in pregnancy and early infancy and is the benchmark of equitable healthcare.</p>
<h4> What’s next?</h4>
<p>We plan to reassess these outcomes using contemporary data to determine whether our study findings still hold true five years later. Acquiring these multiply linked, whole of population data is a slow process though, and as experts in our field, we believe that a national, maternal vaccination surveillance system is warranted. One that can provide ongoing, reliable, accurate and timely data on vaccination uptake, and identify areas in vaccine inequity, so that appropriate resources can be mobilized to address the areas of inequity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/salty-water-ice-mars-equator">Salty water may have flowed near Mars’ equator as recently as 400,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Crusts, cracks and other geologic features on sand dunes near the Martian equator are leading researchers to believe there may have been water there much more recently than previously thought.</p>



<p>The features, likely caused by the movement of thawed, salty water, turned up in images taken by China’s Zhurong rover. A chemical analysis from the rover shows that they may have formed as recently as 400,000 years ago, researchers report April 28 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>The results could help guide future missions to find life on Mars. Atmospheric conditions on Mars 400,000 years ago were similar to what’s seen now, suggesting it’s possible that there’s still liquid, salty water at the planet’s low latitudes, says Xiaoguang Qin, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p>



<p>The Zhurong rover — China’s first Mars rover — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-first-mars-rover-landed-sending-photos">landed on the Red Planet</a> in May of 2021 in a region called Utopia Planitia, just north of the Martian equator (<em>SN: 5/19/21</em>). Over nine months, the rover gathered images and information on the chemical composition of the region’s dunes and took measurements of the cracks found along the sandy surfaces.</p>



<p>When Qin and his team first saw the rover images they were surprised. The crust’s features appeared to be related to water activity. Wind wouldn’t leave those geologic tracks; it would instead erode the crust. Nor would dioxide frost; it wouldn’t exist at lower latitudes. Melting pockets of frozen water best explained the features found on the dunes, the team concluded.</p>



<p>Mapping the number and size of meteorite impact craters in the area gave a rough estimate of the dunes’ age — they likely formed 1.4 million to 400,000 years ago. That suggests there was water in the region as recently as hundreds of thousands of years ago, not billions of years ago, as previously speculated.</p>



<p>It’s the combination of the features seen in the dunes with the age which makes the new research special, says Aditya Khuller, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “We’ve seen these features before,” says Khuller. “But they’re usually much older.”</p>



<p>Scientists also have previously found <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence for </a><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current-day </a><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water</a><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006539" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ice</a> in the mid-latitude gullies of Mars. And data from NASA landers hint that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-liquid-salty-brine-simulation-cold-life">liquid brines</a> can exist on the planet at middle to high northern latitudes, although it would be too cold for life (<em>SN: 5/11/20</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Qin says the findings from the Zhurong rover point to comparatively mild ground temperatures, which suggests the low-latitude sand dunes of Mars could be hospitable to life.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-who">WHO declares an end to the global COVID-19 public health emergency</a></h4>

              
                <p>COVID-19 is no longer a global public health emergency, the World Health Organization announced May 5.</p>



<p>The organization pointed to two factors: Dropping COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalizations, and high levels of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, from vaccination or prior infection. While the pandemic is not over, those trends signal that it’s <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-05-2023-statement-on-the-fifteenth-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time to transition</a> to more long-term prevention and control of the disease, WHO said in a statement.</p>



<p>“It’s reasonable, it makes sense,” says infectious disease specialist Peter Chin-Hong of the University of California, San Francisco, noting that “it follows on the heels of many countries” doing the same thing. The U.S. public health emergency is officially <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-ending-tests-vaccines-drugs-research">set to end May 11</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/23</em>).</p>





<p>But, Chin-Hong adds, “this doesn’t mean that it’s not still a global health threat.”</p>



<p>Worldwide, more than <a href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">750 million confirmed cases of COVID-19</a> have been reported to the WHO as of May 3. And nearly 7 million people have died from the disease, including more than 1.1 million people in the United States alone.</p>



<p>WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, on January 30, 2020. It’s the highest level of alarm under international law. Two months later, the organization also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-outbreak-who-pandemic">named the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a pandemic</a>, indicating it was not containable (<em>SN: 3/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>These declarations came at a scary and chaotic time: Countries initiated lockdown measures to prevent spread of the disease; there were way more questions than answers about the deadly disease, and no treatments or vaccines.</p>



<p>WHO’s designations prompted nations to work together, collaboratively collecting and sharing COVID-19 data including confirmed cases, hospital admissions, deaths and research. Since then,&nbsp;tests, vaccines and treatments have been developed. More than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide.</p>



<p>Even as the global public health emergency ends, the WHO noted remaining challenges to keeping the disease in check, including global inequities in accessing care and vaccines, an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-xbb15-kraken-omicron-variant-virus">evolving virus</a> and “pandemic fatigue” (<em>SN: 1/13/23</em>).</p>





<p>What <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WHE-SPP-2023.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term management of the disease</a> will look like remains to be seen; WHO plans to form a committee to examine that question. The agency will also continue monitoring the disease, but it will be integrated into a system that’s used to survey global influenza data.</p>



<p>But the end of the PHEIC may also mean that COVID-19 tracking data — already incomplete for a variety of reasons including the proliferation of at-home testing — will decline even more, Chin-Hong says. And researchers might have less available funding, which could slow the development of new vaccines and treatments. “There are repercussions both from a research perspective and a clinical care perspective,” he says.</p>



<p>In a May 5 news conference, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to keep their COVID-19 systems in place and remind people that SARS-CoV-2 is still dangerous.</p>



<p>“This virus is here to stay,” he said. “It’s still killing, and it’s still changing.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-black-hole-spiral-galaxy">A streak of light may not be a black hole fleeing its galaxy after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>A trail of starlight thought to possibly indicate a runaway supermassive black hole may be something much more mundane: a spiral galaxy seen edge on, a new study finds.</p>



<p>In February, astronomer Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University and colleagues reported spotting a line of stars near a compact galaxy in Hubble Space Telescope images. The researchers’ analysis suggested that three <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/runaway-black-hole-galaxy-hubble">galaxies had interacted and merged, kicking a supermassive black hole out of its host galaxy</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/23</em>). The black hole then traveled through a nearby gas cloud, the scenario goes, triggering the formation of stars in a line that points toward the home galaxy and revealing the black hole’s madcap escape.</p>





<p>But other researchers have been skeptical of this interpretation, with some suggesting that the scenario is too complex to explain the linear feature. In the new study, “we decided to explore what we thought was the most simple explanation,” says astronomer Ignacio Trujillo of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Tenerife, Spain.</p>



<p>He was inspired by a data plot in the original study, which compared the velocities of the stars in the linear feature with their positions, a comparison known as a velocity curve. To him, it looked like a spiral galaxy’s plot of its pinwheel rotation, where the stars in the galactic disk all <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vera-rubin-biography-ashley-yeager-dark-matter-cosmology">move at nearly the same speed</a>, no matter if they appeared to travel toward or away from Earth (<em>SN: 8/17/21</em>). That, combined with van Dokkum and colleagues’ estimate of the feature’s mass — roughly 100 million suns, which was surprisingly large for a simple line of stars — implied that the object is actually a spiral galaxy viewed on its edge, Trujillo says.</p>



<p>So he and his colleagues compared characteristics of the linear feature with those of a well-studied spiral galaxy called IC 5249, which astronomers know we see edge on from Earth. The team looked at the objects’ masses, surface brightnesses and general motions of stars. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">properties of the galaxy and linear feature matched closely</a>, the researchers report in the study, which is in press in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics </em>and was also submitted April 24 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>For now, “the evidence is not conclusive either way,” says astrophysicist Christopher Conselice of the University of Manchester in England who studies galaxy evolution and was not involved in either study.</p>



<p>“A black hole being ejected from a galaxy would be really cool,” Conselice says. “But I think the simple explanation is that it’s either an edge-on galaxy, or some kind of filament or tidal debris,” left over from some previous galaxy interaction.</p>



<p>Van Dokkum still favors the black hole scenario, in part because of one new image. In the original Hubble images, the linear feature merely points toward a compact galaxy at its left. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a new ultraviolet image,</a> from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, “you start to see that this feature is actually connected to the galaxy,” which strengthens the runaway black hole theory, he says.</p>



<p>Trujillo and his colleagues suggest that the edge-on spiral galaxy and compact galaxy are independent structures but members of the same galaxy group, coincidentally close to each other from our viewpoint.</p>





<p>The debate’s resolution may have to wait at least until this summer when better imagery from Hubble arrives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-pterosaurs-dinosaurs-fossils-pterodactyls">New discoveries are bringing the world of pterosaurs to life</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In an eat-or-be-eaten world, flight conveys a bevy of benefits. A creature that takes to the third dimension can more easily escape earthbound predators, dine off a much broader menu or drop down on unsuspecting victims from above. Flying also allows an animal to cover distance more quickly, forage more efficiently and find mates more easily.</p>



<p>So it’s perhaps surprising that only three groups of vertebrates have ever evolved sustained, muscle-powered flight. Pterosaurs, Greek for “wing lizards,” arrived on the scene in the Triassic Period, perhaps as early as around 237 million years ago. These original vertebrate fliers preceded birds by at least 70 million years and bats by more than twice that.</p>





<p>What caused pterosaurs’ demise is clear: The same <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicxulub-collision-earth-crust-hot-water-microbes-million-years">asteroid that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs</a> about 66 million years ago also took them out — along with more than 75 percent of all life on Earth (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 10</em>). But how pterosaurs took to the air in the first place remains a big mystery. “We don’t have any properly transitional fossils for pterosaurs, or at least ones that we recognize,” says Matthew Baron, a freelance vertebrate paleontologist.</p>



<p>Despite the gap in the early fossil record, recent research offers clues to who pterosaurs’ earliest cousins were and what they looked like, and how pterosaurs evolved from small, flitting creatures into an incredibly varied group. They eventually occupied ecosystems worldwide and consumed a wide variety of prey — getting bigger and spreading farther earlier than previously thought, recent studies reveal. Some grew bizarre crests atop their heads, while others sported mouths full of teeth that projected threateningly at various angles. </p>



<p>“Some pterosaurs looked like creatures from your nightmares,” says Brian Andres, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Sheffield in England.</p>



<p>During their lengthy reign of the skies, pterosaurs ranged in size from creatures that could sit in the palm of your hand to soaring behemoths with wingspans that rivaled those of an F-16 fighter jet. In fact, the largest animal that ever took flight — an iconic species discovered more than half a century ago but only recently described in great detail — was a pterosaur.</p>



<h4>Where did pterosaurs come from?</h4>



<p>Pterosaur fossils were first unearthed in the late 1700s — coincidentally, from the same limestone formation in Germany that later yielded the earliest known bird, <em>Archaeopteryx</em>. Scientists didn’t quite know what to make of the fossils. One scientist proposed they belonged to a weird sea creature, and another thought they represented a transitional form between birds and bats. But soon, experts settled on the fact that pterosaurs were flying reptiles, distinct from dinosaurs.</p>



<p>The first discovered species was named <em>Pterodactylus antiquus</em>, the genus name stemming from the Greek words for “wing finger.” (Although this species and many discovered soon after were commonly referred to as pterodactyls, that term officially applies only to this species and a small group of related species within the broader pterosaur lineage.) Unlike in bats, whose wing membranes are stretched between four elongated fingers of the hand, a pterosaur’s wing is supported by only one hyperelongated finger, a hallmark that helps distinguish pterosaurs from other creatures.</p>





<p>But something pterosaurs and bats do share is that when they first appear in the fossil record, they’re already able to fly. Direct evidence of how the reptiles took to the skies is lacking. “As yet, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825221002786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we do not know of any ‘missing link’ pterosaurs</a>,” Baron reported in 2021 in <em>Earth-Science Reviews</em>.</p>

<h4>Pterosaur timeline</h4>



<p>Pterosaurs originated during the Triassic Period — well before the other two groups of flying vertebrates, birds and bats — and then died out in the same mass extinction that killed off non-avian dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>237 million years ago</strong>: Suspected origin of pterosaurs</li>



<li><strong>230 million years ago</strong>: Oldest known dinosaur fossil</li>



<li><strong>219 million years ago</strong>: Oldest known pterosaur fossil</li>



<li><strong>150 million years ago</strong>: Oldest known bird skeleton</li>



<li><strong>66 million years ago</strong>: Asteroid hits and pterosaurs, along with non-avian dinosaurs, go extinct</li>



<li><strong>52 million years ago</strong>: Oldest known bat skeleton</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>The oldest known pterosaur fossils date to about 219 million years ago, though paleontologists suspect pterosaurs originated as early as 237 million years ago, Baron notes. That’s when the oldest and closest relatives of pterosaurs lived, and thus probably around the time that pterosaurs would have split off and formed their own lineage. The gap in the fossil record is in part due to the fact that rocks from this period are scarce worldwide. And many pterosaur bones were hollow, so they were vulnerable to being crushed soon after death or during fossilization. “Often, pterosaur remains are just a jumble of bones,” Baron says.</p>



<p>But there are indirect clues to what a proto-pterosaur might have looked like and whether pterosaur flight evolved from the ground up — in terrestrial creatures that flapped and leaped into the air — or from the trees down — in tree-living animals that glided.</p>



<p>Those clues come from studies of pterosaurs and their relatives. In 2020, researchers published a paper in <em>Nature</em> comparing the anatomy of 157&nbsp;species of early pterosaurs, primitive dinosaurs and a variety of reptiles that lived at the same time or earlier. A group known as lagerpetids — from the Greek for “rabbit reptiles,” so named because of the general proportions of the bones in the limbs — was most closely related to pterosaurs.</p>



<p>A separate analysis, reported last year in <em>Nature</em>, showed that a fast-running, roughly 20-centimeter-long reptile that lived about 230 million years ago was a close relative of both lagerpetids and pterosaurs. Given that close relationship, this creature, called <em>Scleromochlus taylori,</em> may serve as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-reptile-relative-fossils-tiny-fast-evolution">a good stand-in for the kind of animal that pterosaurs evolved from</a> (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 15</em>).</p>



<p><em>S. taylori</em> had slender limbs, small hands and straight claws, all of which point to a ground-dwelling creature, says Davide Foffa, a vertebrate paleontologist at National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh. Because a critter like<em> S. taylori </em>presumably didn’t spend a lot of time in trees, that argues against the idea that pterosaur flight evolved out of gliding. But a small pelvic girdle suggests that <em>S. taylori </em>wasn’t a leaper, Foffa says. That would seem to argue against the standard idea for how a ground dweller would take to the skies. However, he says, “it’s not necessary to be a leaper to evolve flight.”</p>

<h4>What did pterosaurs eat?</h4>



<p>What pterosaurs ate is often a matter of conjecture. Although some fossils preserve stomach contents — direct evidence of what was consumed — most of the time researchers must look at where a pterosaur lived and how its anatomy compares with modern creatures to reconstruct diet. Based on such comparisons, researchers have speculated that various species of pterosaurs ate everything from insects and worms to fish, crustaceans and meatier prey such as small land vertebrates.</p>



<p>But sometimes, researchers are left to comb through other types of evidence.</p>



<p>Take <em>Kunpengopterus sinensis</em>, a pterosaur that lived in what is now China between 165 million and 153 million years ago. Last year, researchers reported unearthing fossils of this species alongside <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-fossils-puke-pellet-regurgitation-food">gastric pellets chock-full of fish scales</a>, a strong hint that the creatures had eaten fish and then regurgitated the indigestible bits, as modern owls and gulls do (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 5</em>).</p>



<p>Other evidence comes à la fossilized poop — or, more delicately, coprolites. If a coprolite can be linked to the creature that made it, any contents can be reasonably identified as a part of the diet, says Martin Qvarnström, a vertebrate paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. A few years ago, he and colleagues analyzed three coprolites from more than 150-million-year-old rocks unearthed in south-central Poland. The fossilized dung was deposited on an ancient tidal flat that also preserved a multitude of pterosaur footprints, Qvarnström says. The well-trampled surface appears to have been rapidly buried, perhaps as soon as the next tide came in, so it’s very likely that both <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/7375/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the footprints and the coprolites were made by pterosaurs</a>, he and colleagues reported in 2019 in <em>PeerJ</em>.</p>



<p>Using high-energy radiation to perform CT–like scans of the fossilized poop, the team found that the largest coprolite, which was about 1.5 centimeters long and 6 millimeters in diameter, contained more than 100 calcium-rich shells of single-celled organisms called foraminifera. One of the smaller coprolites contained many bristles from what may have been bottom-dwelling marine worms. The large numbers alone suggest that ingestion of these forams and worms wasn’t accidental, Qvarnström says. Instead, the researchers propose, the pterosaur had been targeting this prey.</p>

<p>For these pterosaurs to consume such minuscule prey, they must have been filter feeders, much like flamingos or baleen whales. To capture the forams — which were mostly about 300 micrometers across, about the size of a large dust mite — these pterosaurs must have had jaws full of closely spaced teeth, the team suggests. Although filter-feeding pterosaurs are known from later ages, this is the first strong evidence for them living as early as about 150 million years ago, says Qvarnström.</p>



<p>Because skeletal fossils of these pterosaurs aren’t yet known, Qvarnström’s group doesn’t know what the mystery filter feeders looked like or how big they were. But maybe they resembled the newly discovered species <em>Balaenognathus maeuseri</em>. (<em>Balaenognathus</em>, roughly translated from Latin, means “whale jaw,” a reference to baleen whales.) Its fossils were unearthed from limestone rocks laid down as sediment sometime between 157 million and 152 million years ago in what is now Germany, says David Martill, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth in England.</p>

<p><em>B. maeuseri </em>had a wingspan of about 1.5 meters, similar to a large flamingo. The pterosaur had a 10-centimeter-long, spatula-shaped bill that sported at least 480 teeth. Many of those long, thin teeth — not strong enough to provide a clamping bite on struggling prey — had tiny hooks on their ends, Martill says. That’s unlike anything seen in any other pterosaur. The crochet hook–like features probably helped the pterosaur <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12542-022-00644-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filter and trap itty-bitty prey</a> more effectively than straight teeth would have, Martill and colleagues reported January 21 in <em>PalZ</em>. When foraging, this long-legged creature probably waded through shallow water, facing into the flow and opening its jaws just enough for plankton-­rich water to enter, Martill says. Then, water drained away through the teeth, leaving behind a food-rich slurry.</p>

<h4>Growing large and going global</h4>



<p>Thanks to a fossil discovered in 2017 on Scotland’s Isle of Skye, researchers now realize that pterosaurs grew to larger sizes much earlier than once thought. That, in turn, has helped debunk some theories about why pterosaurs evolved large body sizes.</p>



<p>Embedded in limestone laid down as sediments in a lagoon about 167 million years ago, the well-preserved fossil lacks only parts of the skull, wings, hind limbs and tail, says Natalia Jagielska, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. She and colleagues dubbed the creature <em>Dearc sgiathanach</em>, which in Scottish Gaelic means “winged reptile from Skye.”</p>



<p>Microscopic analyses of cross sections of some bones revealed features akin to the growth rings in trees, hinting that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00135-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pterosaur was at least 2 years old and still growing when it died</a>, Jagielska and colleagues reported in February 2022 in <em>Current Biology</em>. Based on the size of the pterosaur’s upper-arm bone, the team estimates the youngster had a wingspan of around 2 meters.</p>



<p>Comparisons with the growth patterns of closely related pterosaurs suggest that an adult would have had a wingspan of at least 2.5 meters and possibly 3 meters or more. That makes <em>D. sgiathanach</em> the largest pterosaur to have lived up until that time, with a wingspan that rivaled a trumpeter swan’s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-800x450.jpg" alt="An illustration of Dearc Sgiathanach next to a dinosaur." class="wp-image-3124173" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050623_pterosaur_inline-2-dearc.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124173">The recent discovery of <em>Dearc sgiathanach</em> (illustrated next to a dinosaur) suggests that pterosaurs evolved large body sizes by at least the middle of the Jurassic Period.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124173">N. Jagielska</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before the discovery of <em>D. sgiathanach</em>, studies had suggested that pterosaurs didn’t start to become larger until the late Jurassic Period, between about 160 million and 145 million years ago. At that point, the story goes, competition with newly evolved birds forced pterosaurs to expand beyond being just insect eaters and into new ecological roles. But <em>D. sgiathanach</em> evolved tens of millions of years before the first birds took wing, so other, not-yet-identified factors must have been at play, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Another recent study speaks to how widely and how quickly pterosaurs spread around the world, Andres says. Some extremely fragmentary specimens unearthed from sandstone in northwestern Argentina, including scattered portions of a snout, a jawbone and a wing bone, are distinct enough to be classified as belonging to pterosaurs. The features are so distinct that Andres and colleagues named two brand-new species:<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/spp2.1424" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Yelaphomte praderioi</em> and <em>Pachagnathus benitoi</em></a>. The team described the fossils in March 2022 in <em>Papers in Palaeontology</em>.</p>



<p>The sandstone probably dates to sometime between 206 million and 200 million years ago, the researchers estimate. Unequivocal pterosaur remains known from that time come from North America, Europe and Greenland — all then part of the northwestern portions of the supercontinent Pangaea. The new fossils were found in an area that was once southwestern Pangaea, Andres notes. That reveals a wider distribution tens of millions of years earlier in pterosaur history than was previously presumed, Andres’ team argues. And because the sandstone formed in upland areas far from the nearest coast, the find reveals that pterosaurs lived in a greater diversity of habitats in this era than previously recognized.</p>



<h4>The largest animal ever to fly</h4>



<p>Of all the pterosaurs ever found, none has captured imaginations as much as <em>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</em>, the largest creature to ever take flight. Besides cameos in <em>Jurassic Park: Dominion</em> and the comic strip <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>, the species has appeared on the postage stamps of more than two dozen nations and on two coins struck by the Royal Canadian Mint.</p>



<p>Scientists are enamored of the species too. The 1975 paper that initially described it has been cited more than 500 times, despite its brevity, Andres says. In late 2021, Andres and colleagues <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2021.1907587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built on that paper’s description</a> with a number of papers that, for the first time, delved deeply into the iconic species’ size, appearance, movements and the habitat where it lived.</p>



<p>Only a handful of <em>Q. northropi </em>fossils have been found, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2020.1780599" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most in the Big Bend area of southwestern Texas</a>, Andres says. Most of the identifiable remains come from a handful of creatures and together comprise a partial wing and a few leg bones. They, and several hundred other poorly preserved pterosaur bone fragments, were unearthed from rocks formed from sediments that accumulated in stream channels between 69 million and about 66 million years ago, says Tom Lehman, a vertebrate paleontologist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. That means some of these pterosaurs could have been alive when or just before an asteroid struck Earth and brought on a long-lasting and worldwide climate catastrophe.</p>



<p>Much of what scientists suspect about <em>Q. northropi</em> stems from the more common fossils of a related species, <em>Q. lawsoni</em>. Andres and his colleagues have unearthed fossils of more than 200 of these individuals, offering enough bones to reconstruct the majority of the pterosaur. The team estimates that this smaller relative had a wingspan of about 4.5 meters and lived in the same area around the same time as<em> Q. northropi</em>, Lehman says. He and colleagues estimate that <em>Q. northropi </em>had a wingspan of about 10 meters.</p>

<p>If these two species did live simultaneously, Lehman says, they evidently <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2019.1593184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divvied up the ecosystem and foraged separately</a>. When they died, their carcasses ended up in different types of sedimentary rocks, suggesting different parts of the environment.<em> Q. lawsoni</em> apparently spent a lot of time in oxbow lakes. <em>Q. northropi</em>, on the other hand, seems to have foraged along the edges of the river itself. Plenty of water snails and other creatures lived in these bodies of water and would have provided ample food for hungry pterosaurs and other predators, Lehman says.</p>



<p>Based on their measurements, the researchers made life-size models of <em>Q. northropi</em>’s bones to see how the creatures would have moved and to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2020.1780247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reconstruct the range of motion of their joints</a>. “First of all, their back is so short and their legs are so long that they couldn’t walk like other quadrupeds,” says Kevin Padian, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley. “And their forelimbs are so long, they couldn’t avoid touching the ground.” Yet pterosaur footprints suggest that those forelimbs weren’t helping propel the creature forward when it walked, he says. Instead, they appear to have been used for support only, like walking sticks.</p>



<p>It appears that <em>Quetzalcoatlus</em> could reach down to the ground with its long, toothless beak — and even lower, into bodies of water. Once it grabbed its prey, it could tilt its beak to the sky and swallow its victims whole. So Padian and colleagues suggest that this pterosaur patrolled through meadows or waded in shallow waters as modern-day storks or herons do, plucking up fish, mammals or even small dinosaurs using a beak that acted like chopsticks.</p>



<p>The sight of a giraffe-sized predator stalking through swamps would have undoubtedly been impressive. “The worst thing about pterosaurs,” Andres says, “is that they’re no longer around.”</p>

<p>A journal has issued an expression of concern for an Australian study that supported mask mandates after researchers raised several potential problems with the design and methodology of the study.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253510#sec003">The introduction of a mandatory mask policy was associated with significantly reduced COVID-19 cases in a major metropolitan city</a>,” was published in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em> in July 2021. It has been cited 12 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In comments to Retraction Watch, the authors of the paper stood by their work, but a key critic said he still thought the work should have been retracted.</p>



<span id="more-127062"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The research was led by scientists at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, and examined the impact of a mask mandate on COVID-19 cases in the Australian state of Victoria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with using case data from the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, the team estimated mask use from photographs taken for the newspaper <em>The Age</em> before and after the government imposed a mask mandate. They also looked at an online survey of self-reported mask use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers concluded that the “study strongly supports the use of masks for controlling epidemics in the broader community.”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2021, Australian doctor and medical researcher Kyle Sheldrick, who has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/11/ivermectin-papers-slapped-with-expressions-of-concern/">flagged issues</a> with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/01/19/how-an-ivermectin-study-that-didnt-mention-covid-19-fell-under-scrutiny/">other COVID-19 research</a>, raised concerns about the study on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/AE9E508C84B8C51D1485D87B9D181F?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer</a>, writing that “no weight should be given to the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>His comment went on to say, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All the photos taken before the intervention were taken in a [sic] the late afternoon between approx 2pm and 4pm. All the photos after the intervention were taken between 830am and 1230pm. This is an unresolvable problem. Where there is a bias in time (with one group having *some *more or fewer earlier or later photos) corrections can be made and relative contribution can be assessed,. However, where there is complete separation between cohorts on another potentially causal factor (as there is in this case) drawing any causal inference is simply invalid and indefensible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sheldrick raised several other concerns, including an apparent discrepancy in the data collection period, that editorial photos taken for a newspaper are not unbiased and therefore not an appropriate source of data, and how small the self-reported masking data sample was. Sheldrick also expressed doubt about the claim in the paper that masking in Victoria reached 100% while other states apparently had 0% masking. And he noted that similar case trends existed in other parts of Australia that did not have mask mandates.</p>



<p>Other researchers had raised concerns about the study when it was published. An article in <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/concerns-debate-over-burnet-study-showing-masks-turned-around-second-wave-20211021-p59231.html"><em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em></a> quoted William Bevens, an epidemiology researcher at the University of Melbourne, saying: “I don’t think the evidence they put forward demonstrates their conclusion.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0284939">expression of concern</a>, published on April 21, stated, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After publication of this article, readers raised a number of concerns, including about the methodology, the limitations of the study design, and whether the conclusions are fully supported. The PLOS ONE Editors consulted with two members of the editorial board and a statistical advisor who advised that the study design is associated with a number of weaknesses that are discussed in the article, and which are unavoidable because of ethical issues that would be associated with a randomized controlled trial in the context of a pandemic, but that there were also additional weaknesses. The authors have provided further discussion of these issues upon editorial follow up.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice addressed many of the concerns Sheldrick raised in his comment, particularly the small sample size of the online survey data and other potential factors that could have accounted for the observed reduction in COVID-19 cases, such as the closure of public gathering spaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors concluded that although aspects of the study present real limitations, they do not completely invalidate the study’s findings:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>According to the cumulative expert input received by the PLOS ONE Editors, the results of the published study contribute to the field of mask evaluation research, provided results are not overinterpreted and limitations are acknowledged. The PLOS ONE Editors felt that the conclusions, including those that imply causation, a direct correlation between COVID-19 cases and mask mandates, and the ability of masks for controlling epidemics, were not suitably tempered in light of the limitations of the study design. The PLOS ONE Editors issue this Expression of Concern to inform readers about the above considerations regarding study design and interpretation of the results.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expression of concern also corrected several errors in the study, including the issue with the image data collection dates that Sheldrick noted. Whereas the study originally said that images were collected between July 10 and August 2, which it claimed was 14 days before and 14 days after the mask mandate was imposed, the correction acknowledges that the correct numbers were 13 days before and 11 days after the mask mandate. It also noted that in some instances, an absence of data for people outside Victoria was originally represented as 0% mask-wearing, which was not accurate.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Both in the expression of concern and in response to an email from Retraction Watch, the authors of the study stood by its validity.&nbsp;In a statement to Retraction Watch, which co-lead author Allan Saul said was written and/or reviewed by six of the authors, the group wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When the article was published it attracted a vigorous, highly political and at times, nasty, social media response from a vocal minority who were anti-COVID public health measures. This commentary did not address the main findings of the study. Some of this commentary spilled over to comments posted on the PLOS web site resulting in PLOS re-reviewing the article. The review found no errors in the primary analyses about the effects a mask mandate had on reducing COVID-19 caseloads in Melbourne during the second wave. The main point of our paper is that the timing of the introduction of a mask mandate correlated with a statistically significant reduction in cases. There were some minor errors picked up that were subsequently corrected (e.g., the dates for collection of photographs of people wearing masks were incorrect reported (although the actual dates used were correct) and an error in a graph with results of a survey of mask data where no responses had been plotted as “zero” instead of no line at all. Presumably it was this external pressure, that resulted in PLOS posting the “Expression of Concern”. We are disappointed that PLOS has posted the Expression of Concern despite the editors agreeing within the documented expression of concern itself, that many of the technical criticisms were unjustified.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Raina MacIntyre, another author of the study, said she sees the backlash to the study as “an example of the information warfare that has abounded about masks since SARS in 2003.”&nbsp; She said she has received criticism for her work on masking since the 2000s, adding that the topic became political again in 2014, during the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa. She said she sees the response to the study as another example of that politicization and said that “the complaints themselves about the paper came from people without any relevant expertise in infectious diseases, epidemiology or masks.”</p>



<p>In reply to an email from Retraction Watch, PLOS said, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As described in the notice, the PLOS ONE Editors received input from three expert advisors; overall, the input indicated that the study design had weaknesses and that some potential limitations might not have been adequately discussed in the original article, but that the results nevertheless made a valid contribution to the field of mask evaluation research. The Expression of Concern provides transparency as to the issues raised post-publication, the authors’ responses, and the outcome of our editorial assessment, and informs readers about considerations regarding the study design and interpretation of the results. The notice also corrected some reporting errors and provided additional underlying data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Sheldrick said that he was “dissatisfied with PLOS’s response” and believes the paper should have been retracted, writing again of concerns over using editorial photographs, which he told Retraction Watch is “close to the most non-random sample imaginable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sheldrick also noted that though the researchers expected to find that cases in rural Victoria were not impacted by the mask mandate, which only applied to Melbourne, they actually found that the small number of cases they detected decreased, in some cases even more than in the city.&nbsp; He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Ultimately the authors identified a control group in the same state with no mask mandate. That group had a faster fall in cases. That means the intervention failed.</p>



<p>There is no within-group change that can overcome a failure to outperform control.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expression of concern did not specifically address this point. In the study, the researchers said that these cases in rural Victoria, which accounted for about 5% of total cases in Victoria in the study period, made no overall difference to the results.</p>



<p>In their message to Retraction Watch, the researchers wrote that as part of the study, they checked to see if there was a comparable decrease in cases “in rural populations that were not subject to the mask mandate. None was found.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/locust-swarm-chemical-cannibal">Swarming locusts can deploy a chemical to avoid being cannibalized</a></h4>

              
                <p>For many locusts, life in a swarm is a picnic. Crowded conditions create a locust-eat-locust world. But it turns out some migrating insects deploy a “don’t-eat-me” pheromone that can deter their cannibalistic companions.</p>



<p>When jammed together, juvenile migratory locusts (<em>Locusta migratoria) </em><a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade6155" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emit a volatile compound known as phenylacetonitrile</a>, or PAN, researchers report in the May 5<em> Science.</em> Locusts engineered to not give off the pheromone were eaten more often, the study found. And those unable to detect PAN were more likely to eat others producing it. The results suggest the compound has a role in suppressing cannibalism.</p>





<p>The level of cannibalism in a swarm “will be a constant balance,” says Bill Hansson, a neuroethologist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany. “How hungry are your friends behind you, and how badly do you smell?”</p>



<p>Cannibalism is pretty common in the animal kingdom. It’s typically a convenient way for animals to supplement their diet when food is scarce. For <em>L. migratoria</em>, the behavior kicks in when the insects switch lifestyles.</p>



<p>As solitary insects, the locusts spend time apart and don’t eat each other. When group density increases — around a dwindling food source, say — locusts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/locust-swarms-pheromones-pest-control">go “gregarious”</a> (<em>SN: 8/12/20</em>). They become more attracted to each other and increasingly active, migrating and engaging in cannibalism. That allows groups to survive longer while searching for more nutrients. Some research suggests cannibalism may actually underpin locust swarming behavior, as individuals <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(08)00521-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move en masse to avoid being attacked</a> from the rear.</p>



<p>It was known that <em>L. migratoria </em>produce hundreds of chemical compounds, some of which repel their own species. Hansson and colleagues wanted to see if any of these compounds specifically deterred cannibalistic attacks.</p>



<p>First the team screened for compounds given off only during the gregarious phase. One of these, PAN, piqued the researchers’ interest as it breaks down to form hydrogen cyanide and had previously been shown to repel bird attacks against <em>L. migratoria</em>.</p>



<p>Once the locusts start smelling of the compound, they become a dangerous meal, Hansson says. “The higher the PAN, the more toxic they are.”</p>



<p>Initial experiments showed that locusts produced PAN when things started getting crowded, and the amount increased as more locusts joined the group. Next, the team zeroed in on one gene — <em>LmOR70a </em>— in the locust olfactory system with the strongest response to the chemical compound. Using gene editing, the team created some locusts unable to smell PAN, and others unable to produce it.</p>





<p>The researchers put groups of locusts into crowded cages of 100 individuals. Rates of cannibalism were less than 5&nbsp;percent among wild-type locusts, but jumped to around 30&nbsp;percent among those unable to produce PAN. And when placed in cages with 50 starved yet otherwise normal locusts, non-PAN-producing individuals were attacked and eaten significantly more than locusts smelling of PAN. Locusts engineered to not detect PAN showed no preference for eating those producing the pheromone or those who did not.</p>



<p>Cannibalism is more of a threat to juvenile locusts as they don’t have wings yet, so this compound may be more useful to them. “They have to keep walking and being pushed, so cannibalism becomes a real threat,” Hansson says. “When they are adults, they can fly away.”</p>



<p>The work is “an exciting advancement for locust biology and chemical signaling,” says ecologist Arianne Cease, who heads the Global Locust Initiative at Arizona State University in Tempe. The use of this pheromone explains how highly crowded migratory locusts can gain the benefits of group living without incurring the cost of cannibalism, she says.</p>



<p><em>L. migratoria</em> is the most widespread species of locust, found across Africa, Eurasia and down to Australia and New Zealand. Plagues have been reported as far back as 200&nbsp;B.C. in China, and it is currently a major agricultural pest in Russia. Swarms can grow to densities of over 10,000 per square meter.</p>



<p>Blocking locusts’ ability to produce or detect PAN could help control swarms, says Greg Sword, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. As PAN deters birds too, “blocking the locusts’ ability to produce it should make them simultaneously more vulnerable to both their predators and cannibalistic neighbors,” he says.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to eradicate any species,” Hansson says. “But the cool thing would be if you could diminish the size of the swarms.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-ending-tests-vaccines-drugs-research">The U.S. COVID-19 public health emergency is ending. What does that mean?</a></h4>

              
                <p>In January 2020, the U.S. government declared COVID-19 a public health emergency. Now, with coronavirus cases and deaths on the decline, that declaration is quickly approaching a predetermined expiration date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Set to end on May 11, the public health emergency aimed to curb the coronavirus’&nbsp;spread. In the pandemic’s earliest days, the declaration <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-quarantine-measures-emergency-china">imposed temporary measures</a> such as quarantines for people exposed to the virus (<em>SN: 1/31/20</em>). Later, it allowed federal officials to make tests, drugs and vaccines authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration freely available to the public.&nbsp;</p>





<p>&#8220;Ending the public health emergency signals that we think we’ve turned a corner in what was a pretty dark time in America,” says health policy researcher Leighton Ku, who heads the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;(It’s not the first pandemic-related declaration to end. On April 10, President Joe Biden signed legislation ending <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/03/18/2020-05794/declaring-a-national-emergency-concerning-the-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the national emergency</a>, which had been issued in March 2020 to <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-19-emergency-declaration-waivers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waive some requirements for federal health insurance programs, such as to allow coverage of telehealth visits</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even as the public health emergency becomes yet another relic of a traumatic period, COVID-19 isn’t going away. More than 1,000 people in the United States <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died from COVID-19 from April 20 to April 26</a>, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the coronavirus continues to evolve. Although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-variants-fall-surge">not all new variants are worrisome, some can be</a> (<em>SN: 10/17/22</em>). So it remains to be seen whether now is the time to let our guard down, Ku says.</p>



<p>Tests, drugs and vaccines will remain important tools to control the virus’ spread, and researchers hope to improve our arsenal. Here’s what the end of the public health emergency means for these efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Millions of people may lose access to free testing</h4>



<p>COVID tests — at-home and lab versions — that were authorized by the FDA over the last three years will remain available. These tests were granted <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/faqs-what-happens-euas-when-public-health-emergency-ends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergency use authorizations</a>, or EUAs, which allow public access to tests that are not formally approved by the FDA. Instead of expiring with the public health emergency, the FDA can decide when it wants to end individual EUAs, and it can still issue EUAs for any new tests that might be developed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What may change is who pays for tests and diagnostics. It all comes down to insurance.</p>



<p>For those with private insurance, costs will depend on individual insurers. Starting in January 2022, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required insurers to pay for eight at-home tests</a> per covered individual per month. Ending the public health emergency means that at-home and lab tests, even if ordered by a physician, are no longer guaranteed to be fully covered.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The shift also affects those enrolled in federal health insurance programs — Medicare for those 65 and older and Medicaid for those below a certain income level.</p>



<p>Like those with private insurance, Medicare Part B users will also lose access to their eight free at-home tests per month. The program will, however, continue covering lab tests if ordered by a health professional, although test seekers may need to pay for the associated doctor’s visit. People with Medicaid will still receive free at-home and lab tests through September 2024. After that, costs may vary by state.</p>



<p>Currently, uninsured people in most states pay full price for at-home rapid tests, roughly $10 each, and lab tests, around $150 per standard PCR test. And that pool of people is about to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>States can now start disenrolling people from Medicaid and its equivalent for kids, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covered nearly 95 million individuals as of January 2023. Congress passed legislation in 2020 prohibiting states from removing people’s Medicaid or CHIP coverage during the pandemic, even if they were no longer eligible. That provision ended in March and could result in <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/how-many-people-might-lose-medicaid-when-states-unwind-continuous-enrollment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 million people losing insurance by May 2024</a>, according to an April 26 analysis by KFF, a health policy research organization based in San Francisco.</p>



<p>Uninsured individuals may still have access to testing at free clinics and the limited supply of at-home tests previously stockpiled by the government. Depending on resource availability, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/icatt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC Increasing Community Access to Testing program</a> will continue offering tests to those without insurance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, millions more will soon join this group of individuals who, for the most part, probably cannot afford testing. SARS-CoV-2 can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-testing-college-campus-coronavirus-deaths-communities">run rampant</a> in communities when people don’t test themselves for the virus and unknowingly spread it (<em>SN: 7/7/22</em>). “History in general shows us that disadvantaged, minority, poor populations get hurt the worst,”&nbsp; Ku says. “So that’s likely to be what happens.”</p>



<h4>Availability of COVID vaccines and treatments won’t change (for now)</h4>



<p>The end of the national emergency did not impact people’s ability to access vaccines and antiviral treatments. Nor will the end of the public health emergency.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/02/09/fact-sheet-covid-19-public-health-emergency-transition-roadmap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vaccines and treatments will “generally not be affected</a>,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, or HHS, says. The FDA can also continue issuing EUAs for any new vaccines or treatments that might be developed to fight future variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However another big shift looms later this year. Throughout the pandemic, the U.S. government stockpiled vaccines and treatments to fight COVID-19 and provided them to the public for free. Congress has decided not to continue funding these efforts. Stockpiles for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjVl2KjXjyM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to run out this summer or fall</a>, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Ashish Jha said in an interview with the University of California, San Francisco earlier this year.</p>



<p>On the vaccine front, the government previously bought shots at <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/how-much-could-covid-19-vaccines-cost-the-u-s-after-commercialization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a discounted cost of around $21 per shot</a> from pharmaceutical companies, according to data from KFF. When supplies run out, health care providers will have to buy them directly from companies. <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/781576035/files/doc_downloads/2022/10/IDWeek22/PFE-USQ_Transcript_2022-10-20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pfizer</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/moderna-considers-price-of-110-130-for-covid-19-vaccine-11673289609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moderna</a>, which manufacture the widely used mRNA shots, both estimate that the commercial cost will range between $110 to $130 per shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How will those costs impact patients? Again, it depends on what kind of insurance you have.</p>



<p>Medicaid will continue to cover shots through September 30, 2024. Vaccines will remain covered for patients enrolled in Medicare Part B. The CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vaccines for Kids program</a> will also continue to provide the COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Otherwise, costs will vary based on the state you live in and your insurance company. HHS claims that because COVID-19 vaccination is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7145a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended</a> by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, it counts as preventative health care, which would be covered without a co-pay by most private insurance companies. On April 18, HHS <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/18/fact-sheet-hhs-announces-hhs-bridge-access-program-covid-19-vaccines-treatments-maintain-access-covid-19-care-uninsured.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also announced</a> a new program to continue vaccine and treatment access for uninsured people through partnerships with pharmacies with funding through December 2024.</p>



<p>On the treatment front, antivirals purchased by the government will remain free as long as government stockpiles last. After that, pharmacies will have to purchase them directly from companies. Medicaid will continue to cover treatments until September 2024, but after that costs may vary by state. Medicare Part D, the prescription medication arm of the&nbsp;insurance program for seniors, covers only drugs with full FDA approval, which could impact treatments available through an EUA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paxlovid, a popular antiviral medication that curbs COVID-19 symptoms and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antiviral-drug-paxlovid-reduces-risk-long-covid">reduces the risk of long covid</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/23</em>), was originally purchased by the government at price of $530 per dose. Pfizer <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/paxlovid-covid-sticker-shock-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has not disclosed how much it plans to charge</a> on the commercial market, KFF Health News reports. The company has also applied to get a formal thumbs up from the FDA, and an advisory committee voted in March to <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/fda-advisory-committee-votes-support-favorable-benefit-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommend approval of Paxlovid</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<h4>Research into new COVID vaccines and treatments will continue</h4>



<p>The bulk of the funding for coronavirus research wasn’t tied directly to the public health emergency, so ongoing and future studies won’t come to a halt. What will change is how some data get reported to the CDC.</p>



<p>While most CDC data tracking isn’t directly affected by the public health emergency’s end, daily reports of COVID-related hospitalizations <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/past-reports/02242023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may come less frequently</a>, according to the agency. Labs will also no longer be required to report COVID-19 lab test results, making it harder to figure out what percentage of tests are positive — a metric that’s useful for monitoring new surges of infections. Reports of increasing cases and hospitalizations may be slightly delayed for places that don’t regularly release the information to the CDC, potentially making it more difficult for people to know exactly when cases start rising in their community and it’s time to start wearing masks again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As immune protection fades — particularly in older people or those who are immunocompromised — or the virus evolves in ways that can make vaccines less effective at protecting people from severe disease, researchers are on the hunt for variant-proof vaccines and treatments. The Biden administration is setting aside more than $5 billion for “Project Next Gen” to speed up the search.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program aims to develop <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-nasal-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-fluenz-tetra-flumist">mucosal vaccines</a> that might protect noses and throats from infection and reduce the chances a sick person will pass the virus on to others (<em>SN: 6/10/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another objective is to develop long-lasting, lab-engineered antibodies that could be used to treat infected people. Such monoclonal antibodies proved effective at preventing severe disease in newly infected people in clinical trials but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-xbb15-kraken-omicron-variant-virus">no longer work</a> because the virus has changed too much (<em>SN: 1/13/23</em>). Now, the plan is to develop new ones that attack parts of the virus that don’t often change as the virus evolves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also on the wish list is to craft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/christopher-barnes-coronavirus-vaccine-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">universal coronavirus vaccines</a> that protect people from not only newly emerging variants but also other types of coronaviruses <em>(SN: 9/29/22</em>). The virus that causes COVID-19 isn’t going anywhere, and there are plenty of other coronaviruses circulating among animals such as bats that might also pose a threat to people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having one vaccine to protect against a broad swath of related viruses could help prevent coronaviruses from sparking another round of health emergencies in the future. Time will tell whether that goal becomes reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The network of interactions between mitral and granule cells in the olfactory bulb is a
critical step in the processing of odor information underlying the neural basis of smell
perception. We are building the first computational model in 3 dimensions of this network
in order to analyze the rules for connectivity and function within it. , The initial
results indicate that this network can be modeled to simulate experimental results on the
activation of the olfactory bulb by natural odorants, providing a much more powerful
approach for 3D simulation of brain neurons and microcircuits.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/iStock-1316204932-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h3><strong>Complex AI-nursing-care projects as a challenge</strong></h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) already supports medical diagnostics, optimizes clinical processes or indicates complex risk constellations for individual patients and suggests healthcare interventions.  Nursing could also benefit from increased use of AI in the future. Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) projects, however, often encounter hurdles. Projects fail, AI solutions fall short of their potential, and nurses are reluctant to welcome the new technology into their daily work.</p>
<p>The participation of stakeholders is both a normative and a functional requirement for R&amp;D projects that want to set the course for success from the planning phase onward. However, nurses or nursing scientists are often not involved in projects at all or they only play a marginal role in fundamental project decisions. Knowledge of the needs for AI in nursing care and of the challenges R&amp;D projects have to overcome helps researchers and practitioners to plan and conduct successful projects that achieve real-world impact.</p>
<blockquote><p>How can we support nurses with assistive technologies in order to provide the right information at the right time in the right place?</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Our study</strong></h3>
<p>In preparation for a new, large-scale German public funding program for AI in nursing, we conducted a mixed-methods study to explore needs, use cases, requirements, facilitators, and barriers to R&amp;D. We invited nurses, nursing directors, digitization officers, informal caregivers, and researchers with backgrounds in nursing science or education, informatics and AI research, or ethics to discuss and prioritize needs and challenges for AI in nursing care.</p>
<p>We were particularly interested in requirements for and characteristics of successful R&amp;D projects. Specific needs for AI solutions in nursing care were also collected, as addressing specific problems and demands of the users is one important factor for a successful product in itself. We <a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/11/e26522">sifted through literature</a>, conducted workshops, interviews, an online survey, and a datathon. Topics of particular interest for research funding included AI-based care needs and risk assessment, evidence-based decision support systems, and care planning in complex care settings.</p>
<blockquote><p>These deep learning systems, you can use them as tools to try to understand complex issues for which you don&#8217;t yet have a model, for which you don&#8217;t yet have a theory</p></blockquote>
<p>We summarized requirements and characteristics of successful research projects and identified five overarching topics. <em>Regulatory requirements</em> addressed data analysis and models of data sharing in compliance with privacy regulations<em>. Process and translational requirements</em> included aspects of project planning, execution, and management.</p>
<p>Success criteria include <em>ethical</em> and <em>legal aspects</em>, <em>supportive communities and ecosystems</em>, and incorporation or reflection of existing frameworks and tools for the development and implementation of technologies and interventions in care and healthcare.</p>
<h3><strong>What does this mean for R&amp;D on AI in nursing care?</strong></h3>
<p>The use of AI methods shows diverse opportunities to support nursing care. A prerequisite for the use of AI is access to representative and high-quality data. When implementing AI in nursing processes, all stakeholders such as nursing professionals and nursing science must be closely involved. This should happen as soon as possible – preferably upon ideation – and partners should be equipped with reasonable resources for meaningful collaboration.</p>
<p>By implementing communities and eco-systems that go beyond the boundaries of individual projects, translation and dissemination of practical findings that may contribute to nursing education and the scientific community could be supported.</p>
<p>Participatory and demand-driven development remains a key element in the design of R&amp;D projects, which should ideally aim to bring AI solutions out of the lab and into nursing practice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/women-breast-cancer-treatment-pregnancy">Women who’ve had breast cancer can safely pause treatment for pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                <p>For women who’ve had breast cancer and would like to have a child, taking a break from a common treatment to try for a pregnancy appears safe in the short term.</p>



<p>A clinical trial studied the effect of temporarily halting hormone therapy, also called endocrine therapy, which reduces the risk that breast cancer will return. After about three years, the incidence of recurring or new breast cancer among women who paused the therapy <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2212856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was nearly the same as in a group that did not</a>, researchers report in the May 4 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. It’s the first study designed to assess the safety of a treatment break among women who wished to become pregnant.</p>





<p>The women in the study had hormone-positive breast cancer, which means that estrogen, progesterone or both hormones can promote the growth of the cancer. Roughly <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/breast-subtypes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80 percent of breast cancers</a> are hormone positive, according to the National Cancer Institute. Hormone therapy drugs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drug-prevents-some-breast-cancers">reduce the levels of these hormones</a> in the body or block the interaction between the hormones and cancer cells that spurs growth (<em>SN: 6/7/11</em>). The treatment is a staple for hormone-positive breast cancers and is recommended for five to 10 years.</p>



<p>But hormone therapy, which can cause birth defects, cannot be taken during pregnancy. For women of reproductive age who have had hormone-positive breast cancer and want to have a child, a five- to 10-year wait may be untenable.</p>



<p>More than 30,000 U.S. women ages 20 to 44 are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023. Studies have shown that younger breast cancer patients are concerned about the effect of treatments on fertility. For premenopausal women with hormone-positive breast cancer, the hormone therapy drug tamoxifen is recommended, but there is a reduced willingness to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5825683/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start or stick to the drug</a> in this age group.</p>



<p>“This is obviously a really challenging position for these women to be in,” says breast surgical oncologist Nicole Christian of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora who was not involved in the research. “They’re being treated, hopefully cured of their breast cancer and they are looking forward to their long, hopefully healthy lives, and for many of these women, having a family is a part of that life.”</p>



<p>In the new study, breast medical oncologist Ann Partridge of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and colleagues tested whether pausing hormone therapy to pursue pregnancy and then resuming would alter the reduction in risk associated with the therapy.</p>



<p>The women in the study were 42 or younger, and almost all had had early-stage disease, meaning smaller tumors and limited spread of the cancer. Participants had had surgery and been on hormone therapy for 18 to 30 months. Some of the women had also had chemotherapy. The hormone therapy break was intended to last for about two years to give time for attempting pregnancy, delivering a baby and breastfeeding if desired.</p>



<p>The comparison group consisted of women with hormone-positive breast cancer of the same ages who had been participants in other trials studying hormone therapy. But these women had not taken a break from the therapy.</p>





<p>The incidence of new or recurring breast cancer for the 516 women who paused therapy was just under 9 percent, compared with just over 9 percent for the 1,499 women in the comparison group. Of the nearly 500 women for whom there was pregnancy information, 317 had at least one live birth. A majority of women in the trial resumed the hormone therapy.</p>



<p>When treating breast cancer in women of reproductive age, one of the first things that comes up for many women is whether they will be able to have children, says Mary Gemignani, a breast cancer surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City who was not involved in the study. Though longer-term data will be needed, she says, “at least we know that, for this short term, it appears to be safe” to take the break.</p>



<p>The researchers plan to follow the women in the study for 10 years. For now, it’s helpful to have this initial data to support the decision to try for a pregnancy, Partridge says. “Cancer takes away so much control for people,” she says. “This allows them to add back some element of control in terms of their planning for their future and that of their family.”</p>

<p>The former director of the Southwest National Primate Research Center at Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio has been removed from the post after the U.S. Office of Research Integrity found he had faked data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last August, <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-kaushal-deepak">ORI found</a> that Deepak Kaushal, who remains a <a href="https://www.txbiomed.org/scientists/deepak-kaushal/">professor</a> at Texas Biomed, “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally, knowingly, and/or recklessly falsifying and fabricating the experimental methodology to demonstrate results obtained under different experimental conditions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Citing Kaushal’s admission, ORI said that he had engaged in research misconduct in work supported by 8 grants from the National Institutes of Health, and faked data in two grant applications and one published paper that has <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.v203retraction1">since been retracted</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127046"></span>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/leading-primate-researcher-admits-to-faking-data-in-nih-grant-applications-paper/">we reported at the time</a>, Texas Biomedical Research Institute vice president for communications Lisa Cruz confirmed that Kaushal remained in his role, saying that “the misconduct finding is not directly related to, and does not impact, his administrative leadership functions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Cruz tells us that Kaushal has not been the director of the SNPRC since September 2022. She said, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After the ORI report last year and as part of Dr. Kaushal’s corrective action plan, Texas Biomed and ORI imposed ramifications on Dr. Kaushal, including but not limited to research ethics training and a year of review of all study data produced prior to submission for grant funding/peer-review publication. The Institute named a new director for the SNPRC as Dr. Kaushal completes the corrective action plan, after which the Institute will evaluate SNPRC leadership next steps.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-approved-first-vaccine-rsv">The FDA has approved the first-ever vaccine for RSV</a></h4>

              
                <p>Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizes tens of thousands of people each year in the United States. Now there’s a powerful new tool against it: the first-ever RSV vaccine.</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced May 3 that it had granted <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval for an RSV vaccine</a> made by GlaxoSmithKline to be used in people 60 and older.</p>



<p>RSV is a respiratory virus that causes cold-like symptoms for many people, but can cause serious illness, hospitalization and death for infants and older people. In the United States, an estimated 60,000 to 160,000 older adults are hospitalized each year with lung infections caused by RSV, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/high-risk/older-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About 6,000 to 10,000 of them die from RSV</a> infections each year. Older adults with chronic heart or lung disease, and those with weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable.</p>





<p>The newly approved vaccine reduced the risk of developing lung infections by 82.6 percent compared with a placebo. In a trial of about 25,000 people age 60 and over, only seven people who got the vaccine developed RSV lung infections, compared with 40 people who got a placebo. The vaccine’s efficacy against severe lung infection was even better at 94.1 percent: Just one person in the vaccine group and 17 in the placebo group developed that complication.</p>



<p>The FDA is expected to approve an RSV vaccine for older people made by Pfizer later in May. And on <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-may-18-2023-meeting-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 18 the agency will discuss</a> Pfizer’s RSV vaccine given to pregnant women to protect newborns.</p>



<p>A number of other companies also have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccines-antibodies-rsv-virus">RSV vaccines in the works</a> (<em>SN: 4/27/23</em>).</p>



<p>The FDA is requiring GSK to monitor for safety concerns from the vaccine. In the clinical trial, two people developed a rare type of inflammation that affects the brain and spinal cord after getting the RSV vaccine and a flu shot. One died of the condition, called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.</p>



<p>And one person in the trial developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks nerves leading to muscle weakness or paralysis. The syndrome is a rare, but serious side effect of many vaccines. In addition, the company is voluntarily monitoring for a heart condition called atrial fibrillation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-human-dna-extracted-pendant">Ancient human DNA was extracted from a 20,000-year-old deer tooth pendant</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new, nondestructive way to recover ancient DNA has shown its potential for illuminating Stone Age people’s lives.</p>



<p>Genetic material extracted from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06035-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a pierced deer tooth, possibly worn as a pendant,</a> identifies its maker or wearer as a female <em>Homo sapiens </em>who lived roughly 20,000 years ago in Siberia, researchers report May 3 in <em>Nature</em>. Comparisons of DNA indicate that the female who handled the artifact was closely related to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/siberians-came-north-american-arctic-two-waves">people who lived farther east in Siberia</a> around the same time (<em>SN: 8/28/14</em>).</p>





<p>When applied to other finds, the technique could help clarify whether males and females alike made and used personal ornaments. And it could reveal whether <em>H. sapiens</em> or Neandertals made certain types of tools and ornaments in parts of Eurasia once occupied by both species at the same time.</p>



<p>“By extracting DNA from tools and ornaments directly, we can now begin to study the division of labor and the role of individuals [from different <em>Homo</em> species] in Pleistocene societies,” says molecular biologist Elena Essel of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.</p>



<p>Researchers usually extract ancient DNA from small amounts of powder drilled out of bones and teeth.&nbsp;Evolutionary geneticist Svante Pääbo, also at Max Planck, won the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-svante-paabo-human-evolution-neandertal-genetics">2022 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine</a> for developing that method (<em>SN: 10/3/22</em>). But there is understandable reticence to drill into and disfigure, or potentially destroy, rare and delicate finds such as pendants and other ornaments. <em>H. sapiens</em> and Neandertal DNA <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-dna-cave-mud-migration-eurasia">can also be isolated from artifact-bearing sediment</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/21</em>). But that DNA cannot identify the sex or species of who handled specific tools or ornaments.</p>



<p>In the new study, Essel, Pääbo and colleagues describe their method for ancient DNA extraction, which involves submerging bone and tooth artifacts in a sodium phosphate solution for three 30-minute periods at each of four temperatures. Objects are first placed in a room temperature solution, followed by three increasingly hotter solutions, ending at 90° Celsius.</p>



<p>Treatment at the highest temperature released human DNA that had penetrated deeply into the tooth artifact via extensive contact when it was made or used, the researchers say. Milder solution temperatures yielded ancient DNA closer to the pendant’s surface that originated from surrounding sediment, including that of an elk species.</p>



<p>Analyses of recovered human and elk mitochondrial DNA, usually inherited from mothers, generated an age estimate for the pendant of roughly 18,500 to 24,700 years old. That’s consistent with radiocarbon dates for burned wood that the researchers unearthed near the pendant. Radiocarbon dates are more precise than those generated from ancient DNA but cannot always be obtained from fragile or small artifacts, Essel says.</p>



<p>Two coauthors of the new study — archaeologists Maxim Kozlikin and Michael Shunkov of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk — directed a 2019 excavation that produced the newly analyzed pierced tooth at Siberia’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dates-narrow-down-when-denisovans-and-neandertals-crossed-paths">Denisova Cave</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/19</em>).</p>





<p>Neandertals and other Stone Age hominids called Denisovans periodically occupied this site from nearly 300,000 years ago until around 55,000 years ago. Bone tools and personal ornaments found in previous digs indicated that <em>H. sapiens</em> visited Denisova Cave as early as around 30,000 years ago. Excavators in 2019 wore gloves and face masks to minimize contamination of unearthed objects with their own DNA.</p>



<p>In future work, archaeologists will need to use those anticontamination measures and more, including refrigeration of freshly excavated artifacts, to boost the ability of the new technique to ferret out ancient DNA, Essel says.</p>



<p>In tests her group conducted with 11 nonhuman animal bones previously excavated at a 35,000- to 45,000-year-old French site, the nondestructive DNA technique largely identified genetic material from people who had handled the finds without gloves during or after the dig.</p>



<p>The new technique could help determine whether <em>H. sapiens</em> or Neandertals made bone pendants and stone tools dating to as early as around 45,000 years ago at several sites in southwestern Europe, says evolutionary geneticist Carles Lalueza-Fox of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona who did not participate in the new study. Scientists disagree whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/digging-debate-french-cave">distinctive stone tools found with those ornaments</a> were products of <em>H. sapiens</em> or Neandertals (<em>SN: 5/9/06</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-astrophysicists-star-eating-planet">For the first time, astrophysicists have caught a star eating a planet</a></h4>

              
                <p>A dusty belch is all that remains of a planet that was gobbled up by a star about 12,000 light-years away. It marks the first time anyone has seen a star in the act of eating a planet.</p>



<p>A brief burst of light captured by a couple of telescopes was probably caused by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05842-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a planet about 10 times the mass of Jupiter being swallowed by its sun</a>, researchers report May 3 in <em>Nature</em>. It’s a dramatic end that is the eventual destiny of many planets, including Earth.</p>





<p>“Planetary engulfment has been predicted for a very long time, but their frequency was not well known,” says MIT astrophysicist Kishalay De. “So it was certainly exciting to realize we had found one.”</p>



<p>The discovery came about as De was on the hunt for binary stars. He was using data from the Palomar Observatory in California to look for spots in the sky that showed rapid increases in brightness. Such fluctuations can be a sign of stars coming close enough together that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/old-stars-gleaned-neighbors-gas-hubble-data-show">one will suck matter from the other</a> (<em>SN: 2/6/14</em>).</p>



<p>One event from 2020 stood out. A spot of light rapidly got about 100 times as bright as it had been. It could have been the result of two stars merging. But a second look by NASA’s NEOWISE infrared space telescope suggested otherwise. Data from that observatory showed that the total amount of energy released in the flash was just one-thousandth what it would have been if two stars had merged, and that chilly dust surrounded the mash-up instead of hot plasma that would normally indicate a merger among stars.</p>



<p>The low energy suggested that one of the objects, assuming it was a merger of some kind, wasn’t a star at all. Instead, it was probably a giant planet. As the star noshed on the planet, a stream of cold dust sailed away like cosmic breadcrumbs from a stellar snack. “I was indeed surprised when we connected the dots together,” De says.</p>



<p>Planet-devouring stars are probably relatively common in the universe, says UCLA astrophysicist Smadar Naoz, who was not involved with the study. But the evidence, she says, has been circumstantial. Until now, astronomers have seen only signs of stars preparing for a planetary snack or debris left over from a presumed stellar meal.</p>



<p>“One of the things that I found in the paper that I really liked was the detective work” that pieced together evidence from multiple telescopes to confirm that the star expanded outward to eat a planet, Naoz says.</p>



<p>Naoz has pondered the ways that stars might gobble up planets. A star in the prime of life might consume a planet that wanders too close by in its orbit — think of that as a stellar lunch, Naoz says. A dying star, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-red-giant-stars-that-eat-planets-might-shine-less-brightly">will swallow a planet</a> as the star swells to become a red giant (<em>SN: 4/7/20</em>). That’s more like a cosmic dinner.</p>





<p>The planet-eating star in this study is turning into a red giant, but is still early in its transformation. &nbsp;“I would say it’s early supper,” Naoz says.</p>



<p>There’s a lot that’s still mysterious about stars munching on planets, De says. But upcoming observatories with large infrared cameras, he says, should let astronomers look for bright, long-lived infrared emissions that might reveal more planet-eating stars.</p>



<p>Our sun will evolve into a red giant and consume the Earth in about 5 billion years. “Because the Earth is much smaller than Jupiter,” De says, “the effects will certainly be more subdued … so finding Earth-like engulfments will be challenging, but we are actively working on ideas to identify them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/poop-time-capsule-andean-condor">A 2,200-year-old poop time capsule reveals secrets of the Andean condor</a></h4>

              
                <p>For over 2,000 years, Andean condors have been nesting — and pooping — in the same cliffside grotto high in the Andes. This gargantuan pile of guano is now providing an unprecedented peek deep into the birds’ past, revealing a surprising fidelity to raising chicks there even as the region changed dramatically.</p>



<p>Analyses of the deposit show that the condors overhauled their diet after European colonization of the Americas. The birds also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.0106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">practically abandoned the site</a> for a millennium, possibly thanks to centuries of erupting volcanoes, researchers report May 3 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“A material that could easily be ignored or discarded as waste can actually teach us quite a bit about how populations, communities and ecosystems respond to environmental change,” says Rachel Reid, a paleoecologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>With a wingspan of over 3 meters and the heft of a toddler, Andean condors (<em>Vultur gryphus</em>) are the largest birds of prey. Found in South America’s Andes and along the western coastline of the continent, the condors are also threatened with extinction. Only about 10,000 birds remain, and their numbers are declining.</p>



<p>Efforts to protect them hinge on understanding their behavior and ecology. But studying Andean condors can be challenging: The birds spend most of their time on the wing in remote mountain areas, which makes them difficult to capture and monitor, says paleoecologist Matthew Duda of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada.</p>



<p>But in 2014, Duda’s colleagues found a condor nest in Argentina’s Nahuel Huapi National Park, tucked in a cliffside nook that turned out to be a ripe source of information. Researchers hiked an hour from the nearest road and rappelled 10 meters down along the cliff just to reach the nest. Unlike most condor nest sites, this one was sheltered from rain and snow. Instead of washing away, the droppings of successive breeding pairs built up layer upon layer, creating a dense, pale mound.</p>



<p>Information in the preserved poo provided the “perfect opportunity for us to go back in time,” Duda says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers carved a 25-centimeter-deep slice out of the guano pile. DNA and ratios of specific chemicals in the poop hinted at what the condors ate over time. Other chemicals such as sulfur and potassium as well as preserved algae revealed changing environmental conditions.</p>



<p>Chemical dating of the samples divulged that the oldest layers in the deposit were at least 2,200 years old. That the condors were using this nest location for so long was “extremely surprising,” Duda says. Most species of birds return to the same area to raise young, but rarely the exact same nest, if ever. “If they have been using the same nest and keep coming back over and over and over again, it implies that where these birds are nesting is a super important part of their ecology and their behavior,” he says.</p>





<p>The rate at which feces accumulated slowed drastically from 1,650 to 650 years ago, dropping from 0.08 cm per year to 0.003 cm per year. That slowdown suggests condors largely left the site for a millennium, the researchers say. Around the same time, nearby volcanoes went through a volley of eruptions. Heavy ash that would have blanketed the region’s vegetation could have prompted herbivores to move away, reducing the availability of carcasses for the condors to feed on, Duda and colleagues suspect. The birds may have glided away to scavenge in greener pastures and returned to the area after the volcanic paroxysms ceased.</p>



<p>Similar connections between eruptions and declines in bird populations have previously been documented in guano records, says Dulcinea Groff, a paleoecologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie who was not involved in the new work. For instance, ancient excrement has linked dips in Gentoo penguin populations to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-nearly-snuffed-out-gentoo-penguin-colony">volcanic strife</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>4/12/17</em>).</p>

Each generation has contributed to the formation of a ring-shaped guano deposit that is now giving scientists an unprecedented look at the condors’ ecological history.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124195">Lorenzo Sympson</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The condor guano also reveals a major diet shift, Duda and colleagues say. Prior to European colonization of South America, the birds primarily scavenged the carcasses of beached whales and some native mammals like llamas and guanacos. But in recent centuries, livestock like sheep and cattle have made up the bulk of their diet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And unlike modern condors, those that lived many centuries ago didn’t have elevated lead and mercury levels in their bodies. The toxic metals can accumulate in scavengers that eat carcasses <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lead-poisoning-stymies-condor-recovery">shot with lead ammunition</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>6/26/12</em>). Scavengers excrete some of the metals in their droppings, which can then be detected by scientists. The finding helps confirm that heavy metal contamination is a recent phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research “gives us a much longer timeline to understand what the natural variability is in a population,” Duda says. Since this study is a snapshot of just one nest, he and colleagues plan on collaborating with other researchers to find similar condor nests to see whether the same patterns written in guano emerge.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the condors’ apparent loyalty to this very specific nest site — even potentially through centuries of volcanic mayhem — highlights just how crucial the preservation of such sites may be for their successful conservation, Duda says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-chemotherapy-drug-human-brain">Ultrasound allows a chemotherapy drug to enter the human brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cracking the code to brain cancer treatment might start with cracking the brain’s protective shield.</p>



<p>Nearly impenetrable walls of jam-packed cells line most of the brain’s blood vessels. Although this blood-brain barrier protects the organ from harmful invaders, it also prevents many medications from reaching the brain.  </p>



<p>Now, scientists can get a powerful <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(23)00112-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chemotherapy drug into the human brain by temporarily opening its protective shield</a> with ultrasound and tiny bubbles. The early-stage clinical trial, described May 2 in the<em> Lancet Oncology</em>, could lead to new treatments for those with brain cancer.</p>





<p>Better treatments are especially needed for glioblastoma, a common and aggressive type of brain tumor. Even after surgical removal, another mass tends to grow in its place.</p>



<p>“There’s really no established treatment for when the tumors come back,” says neurosurgeon Adam Sonabend of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Patients with recurrent glioblastomas “don’t have any meaningful therapeutic options, so we were exploring new ways of treating them.”</p>



<p>After the initial tumor has been removed, patients typically receive a relatively weak chemotherapy drug that can bypass the brain’s barricade. More potent drugs could help destroy any lingering disease — if the medicines could break through the barrier.</p>



<p>Sonabend and colleagues turned to an exploratory method using ultrasound that has already succeeded at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blood-brain-barrier-jiggled-loose-deliver-medicine">briefly opening the blood-brain barrier in humans</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/15</em>). A person first receives an intravenous injection of a fluid brimming with microscopic bubbles, which fill the body’s blood vessels. This technique is already routinely used to help visualize vessels in ultrasound imaging. In the targeted brain area, ultrasound waves shake the microbubbles, prying open the densely packed blood vessel walls.</p>



<p>To examine safety and dosing of this delivery method and drug, 17 people had their regrown tumor removed and an ultrasound device implanted in their skull, adjacent to the remaining cavity. Patients then received between two and six rounds of treatment spaced three weeks apart.</p>



<p>During each session, participants were injected with microbubbles for 30 seconds and simultaneously received pulses of ultrasound waves for nearly five minutes. The waves reached a specific area of the brain encompassing the tumor cavity, penetrating nearly 8 centimeters deep. That was followed by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of paclitaxel, a potent drug used to treat lung, breast and other cancers. It typically can’t access the brain.  </p>





<p>In the brain tissue zapped by ultrasound, researchers found nearly four times as much paclitaxel compared with tissue outside of range. MRI scans and a special dye revealed that the blood-brain barrier mostly closed back up within 60 minutes.</p>



<p>Overall, paclitaxel and the delivery method were well tolerated up to the maximum tested drug dose of 260 milligrams per square meter, the dose approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for breast cancer. Some patients, however, reported temporary side effects including headaches and confusion.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A fluorescent dye can enter the brain (shown) after researchers temporarily open the blood-brain barrier with ultrasound and microbubbles. That barrier is usually impenetrable for many medications, including powerful chemotherapy drugs.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“This definitely is a very interesting paradigm that can be applied not just to glioblastoma but other brain tumors,” says pediatric radiation oncologist Cheng-Chia Wu of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City who was not involved in the work. It “creates a whole host of opportunities.”</p>



<p>Although this early-stage clinical trial offers a glimmer of hope, Wu points out that it will take time to <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04528680?term=Sonabend&amp;cond=Glioblastoma&amp;cntry=US&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue testing</a> this potential treatment. But one day it could help extend glioblastoma patients’ life spans following diagnosis, which average a little over a year.</p>



<p>For now, Wu says, “this is definitely a very good first step in the right direction.”   </p>

<p>Hindawi will cease publishing four journals that it identified as “heavily compromised by paper mills.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The open access publisher announced today in a <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/post/evolving-our-portfolio-response-integrity-challenges/">blog post</a> that it will continue to retract articles from the closed titles, which are <em>Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine</em>, <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em>, the <em>Journal of Healthcare Engineering</em>, and the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The closures follow <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">reporting by Retraction Watch</a> in February that a professor used the identity and email account of a former student to edit special issues of two of the journals, <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em> and the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health.</em></p>



<span id="more-127039"></span>



<p>The four closed journals were also among ten Hindawi titles that sleuth Dorothy Bishop <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv">found</a> had signs of paper mill activity in their special issues. In March, the four titles were among <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">19 Hindawi journals</a> that Clarivate removed from its Web of Science index for failing to meet its quality criteria.</p>



<p>Wiley, Hindawi’s parent company, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">announced that month</a> that it had paused publication of special issues in Hindawi journals for three months, and subsequently had lost $9 million in revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, Wiley and Hindawi said they <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">planned to retract 1,200 articles</a> with compromised peer review, on top of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">500 they said they would retract</a> last September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slightly more than half of the completed or planned retractions come from these four journals, a Wiley spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch has tracked 81 retractions from <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dComputational%2band%2bMathematical%2bMethods%2bin%2bMedicine"><em>Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine</em></a><em>, </em>35 from <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dComputational%2bIntelligence%2band%2bNeuroscience"><em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em></a>, 133 from the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dJournal%2bof%2bHealthcare%2bEngineering"><em>Journal of Healthcare Engineering</em></a><em>,</em> and six from the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dJournal%2bof%2bEnvironmental%2band%2bPublic%2bHealth"><em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em></a>. Most of the retractions have come since September 2022.</p>



<p>The closed journals “have published Special Issues that have been impacted to such an extent that we feel it is in the best interest of the scholarly community to discontinue them,” Hindawi’s blog post stated. It continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marine-biologist-pate-endangered-rays">This marine biologist is on a mission to save endangered rays</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first time Jessica Pate swam beside a manta ray off Florida’s southern coast, the 8-foot-wide fish flipped belly-up and slowed to watch her. “I was kind of obsessed after that,” Pate says. The marine biologist was so hooked that she founded the conservation nonprofit <a href="https://marinemegafauna.org/americas/florida-manta-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Manta Project</a> and has dedicated the last seven years to studying mantas and their kin.</p>



<p>Her work is paying off. She and her colleagues have since discovered the first known manta nursery in Florida’s waters. Plus, the nonprofit launched an outreach campaign, based on surveys of local anglers, to encourage fishing practices that keep mantas safe.</p>





<p>Now Pate and her colleagues have learned that hundreds of sicklefin devil rays — an elusive cousin of mantas — also <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-marine-biological-association-of-the-united-kingdom/article/abs/multiple-datasets-confirm-range-extension-of-the-sicklefin-devil-ray-mobula-tarapacana-in-the-western-north-atlantic-ocean-off-the-eastern-usa/0D4984C41CE4C3855C694F747065525D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico home</a>, her team reports April 24 in the <em>Journal of the</em> <em>Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom</em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mantas and devil rays are both mobula rays, a genus that includes nine species, nearly all of which are listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. That’s partly because these rays have slow reproductive cycles and typically produce just one pup per pregnancy, Pate says, and partly because the animals are susceptible to injury from boat strikes or entanglement in fishing gear.<br><br>Before Pate began studying oceanic mantas (<em>Mobula birostirus</em>) off Florida, there was only one published study of sightings in the region. “There&#8217;s just so little awareness that manta rays are present,” she says. That makes instituting effective conservation measures difficult, because researchers know so little about the rays, such as population numbers or where they mate.</p>



<p>To fill knowledge gaps and raise the public profiles of manta rays in the western Atlantic, Pate conducts aerial drone surveys, gathers accounts of citizen sightings and spends countless hours tagging, tracking and measuring the creatures.</p>



<p>Those efforts led to <a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2020/43/n043p051.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the discovery a manta ray nursery</a> off the coast of southern Florida. Not only is it the first found in the area, it’s also the third nursery ever found globally, the team reported in 2020 in <em>Endangered Species Research</em>. But its located in a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-baby-florida-historic-nursery-endangered">heavily populated coastal area, where recreational fishing is popular</a> — and a threat to rays (<em>SN: 8/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>Pate has seen several mantas with missing fin tips from entangled fishing lines, as well as “mantas that look like Christmas trees” with wings covered in jigs and lures. A survey of nearly 200 recreational anglers in Palm Beach County, Fla., found that that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.3508" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just two out of three could identify a manta ray</a>, and even fewer knew how to prevent accidentally hooking one, Pate and colleagues reported in the June 2021 <em>Aquatic Conservation</em>.</p>



<p>However, 98 percent of surveyed anglers supported protecting the rays. The Florida Manta Project has since launched an outreach campaign that aims to build awareness of best practices, such as keeping an eye on the water while fishing and reeling in fishing lines until mantas have safely passed by.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, what appears to be a manta might be one of its relatives. In 2018, a diver sent Pate a photo of a manta that turned out to be a sicklefin devil ray (<em>M. tarapacana</em>) — the first confirmed sighting of this species in the western Atlantic Ocean. Sicklefin devils are similar in size and shape to mantas, but they tend to be a golden-brown instead of black.</p>





<p>The photo had Pate wondering how many past manta sightings had in fact been devil rays. An analysis of aerial surveys and fisheries observation data collected from 1996 to 2022 turned up 361 sicklefin devils in the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.</p>



<p>Because devil rays have been so understudied, “there are still huge knowledge gaps in their biology, ecology and life history,” says ecologist Joshua Stewart of Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. That makes it challenging to create management strategies that might help conserve the species. Research like Pate’s is essential for supporting “science-based conservation,” he says. It helps uncover “the movements and habitat use of these species in regions where they may be exposed to human impacts.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Pate hopes that her team’s continued efforts will help protect majestic mantas and their cousins, she says, by making the rays “as iconic and recognizable as manatees and sea turtles.”</p>

<p>A chemistry researcher in India <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dDhanaraj%2bGopi">has had seven of his papers retracted</a> after the publisher concluded that some images in the papers showed “<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ra/d3ra90024j">unexpected similarities</a>” or had been <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ra/d3ra90029k">duplicated</a>.</p>



<p>The retraction notices, issued in late March by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in the U.K., all state that:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors informed the Editor that the characterization of the original samples was outsourced, and they do not have the original raw data for the published results.</p>

<p>On a PubPeer thread about image problems in a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.6b01795">2016 paper</a> in <em>ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F23AEA94EBAB630FE2203AA33C3B5C#7">noted</a> that one figure “strongly resembles an apple crumble pie with a cloned crust.”</p>



<p>Gopi <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F23AEA94EBAB630FE2203AA33C3B5C#3">replied</a>, admitting that there had been “inadvertent misrepresentation of images in our paper due to errors in the assembly of figure panels, which were reshuffled during revision or resubmission.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since We have no expertise in biology, We got in touch with [the] biological institution. So, we are strongly apologizing for this unintentional error. Mostly, these type[s] of errors happen due to the outsourcing [of] images. In this regard, we assure you that this mistake will not happen anymore. Also, we are in the process of correcting this in the journal. And we hope that this error does not change the interpretation of the results or the conclusions of the work in this journal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(A <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.9b20300">subsequent correction</a> issued for the paper said the authors reperformed the experiments to rectify the problem.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F23AEA94EBAB630FE2203AA33C3B5C#11">expressed puzzlement</a> at Gopi’s comments:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Does this mean that certain figures in this paper were created by outsourcing experiments? And that the authors do not have any expertise [in] what these experiments are showing?</p>



<p>Could the authors please clarify which of the figures in this paper were outsourced and to which institute or company?</p>



<p>Could the authors also please clarify which part of their paper they do not have expertise in, and which parts of the paper they feel they are not responsible for?</p>



<p>These duplications within figures are really, really hard to explain by simple mistakes, so any clarification on what actually happened here would be welcome.</p>

<p>We reached out to Gopi, but have not heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six of the retracted papers were published in <em>RSC Advances</em>. The remaining was published in <em>Journal of Materials Chemistry B</em>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on May 1, 2023.</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash;The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is pleased to announce an agreement with the University of Padua to facilitate unlimited publishing across all 12 PLOS titles with no fees for researchers. This agreement encompasses PLOS&rsquo; three innovative publishing models, ensuring researchers from the University of Padua to benefit from frictionless, fee-free publishing with PLOS. This agreement represents another in the Europe, following agreements in Germany, Sweden, Ireland and the UK <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">(Jisc).</a></p>



<p>&ldquo;We are excited to expand our footprint in Italy with these new publishing models, which enable more researchers to participate in advancing Open Science,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;The University of Padua shares our commitment to make scholarly publishing and research open and equitable for the benefit of all.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;In recent years, our university has implemented various policies aimed at making scientific research open and accessible. In accordance with an historical tradition of cultural openness and freedom, represented by our motto: <em>&lsquo;Universa Universis Patavina Libertas&rsquo;</em>, shared by scientists like Galileo Galilei, the University of Padua has identified one of its main strategic objectives as the support of open science and open access. The agreement with PLOS fits into that same viewpoint and we are very pleased to be the first University in Italy to sign it,&rdquo; said prof. Monica Salvadori, Vice Rector of Historical and Cultural Heritage and President of the Open Science Commission, University of Padua. &ldquo;We are sure that our researchers will now have more opportunities to lead scientific advancements in a more open and reliable way.&rdquo;</p>



<p>All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond the article processing charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flat Fees </a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a><a href="#_ftn3"><u>[3]</u></a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I was thrilled to have&nbsp;collaborated on&nbsp;the very first agreement in&nbsp;Italy&nbsp;between the&nbsp;University of Padua&nbsp;and PLOS. This agreement allows&nbsp;the University of Padua&nbsp;to publish in all of PLOS&rsquo; journals&nbsp;till the end of the year,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Barbara Valcelli, Accucoms Regional Sales Manager, Italy. &ldquo;I was happy to have facilitated conversations between PLOS and&nbsp;University of Padua&nbsp;to reach this important agreement which will play a key role&nbsp;in&nbsp;making scientific research&nbsp;at the University of Padua&nbsp;open and accessible.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The University of Padua joins a growing list of institutions including the Big Ten Academic Alliance, the University of California system, CRL and NERL, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester), the Sachsen and TIB consortia&rsquo;s in Germany, &nbsp;and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a> have decided to support their researchers through publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> recently honored PLOS as the 2021 co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>

<p><strong>About the University of Padua</strong></p>



<p>Dating back to 1222, the University of Padua is a leading University in Italy and has a long tradition and consolidated reputation for scientific excellence. As a multi-disciplinary institute of higher education, the University aims to provide its students with professional training and a solid cultural background.</p>



<p>Intertwined within the story of the University of Padua are the many illustrious figures who lived, studied and taught in this city. Such famous names included those who have changed the cultural and scientific history of humanity, from Copernicus to Vesalius, Galileo, to William Harvey, to the more modern Tullio Levi-Civita, Concetto Marchesi, Giuseppe &lsquo;Bepi&rsquo; Colombo and many others.</p>



<p>The University of Padua has been a proud pioneer of several endeavours, including the first university botanical garden (1545, a UNESCO World Heritage Site), the first permanent anatomical theatre (1594) and in 1678, Elena Lucrezia Cornaro becomes the first woman in the world to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree. <a href="https://www.unipd.it/en/university-padua">https://www.unipd.it/en/university-padua</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscientists-decoded-thoughts-brain-scans">Neuroscientists decoded people’s thoughts using brain scans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like Dumbledore’s wand, a scan can pull long strings of stories straight out of a person’s brain — but only if that person cooperates.<br><br>This “mind-reading” feat, described May 1 in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, has a long way to go before it can be used outside of sophisticated laboratories. But the result could ultimately lead to seamless devices that help people who can’t talk or otherwise communicate easily. The research also raises privacy concerns about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics">unwelcome neural eavesdropping</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/21</em>).</p>



<p>“I thought it was fascinating,” says Gopala Anumanchipalli, a neural engineer at the University of California, Berkeley who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s like, ‘Wow, now we are here already,’” he says. “I was delighted to see this.”</p>





<p>As opposed to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-reads-peoples-thoughts">implanted devices</a> that have shown recent promise, the new system requires no surgery (<em>SN: 11/15/22</em>). And unlike other external approaches, it produces continuous streams of words instead of having a more constrained vocabulary.</p>



<p>For the new study, three people lay inside a bulky MRI machine for at least 16 hours each. They listened to stories, mostly from <em>The Moth</em> podcast, while functional MRI scans detected changes in blood flow in the brain. These changes are proxies for brain activity, albeit slow and imperfect measures.</p>



<p>With this neural data in hand, computational neuroscientists Alexander Huth and Jerry Tang of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues were able to match patterns of brain activity to certain words and ideas. The approach relied on a language model that was built with GPT, one of the forerunners that enabled <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chatgpt-ai-artificial-intelligence-education-cheating-accuracy">today’s AI chatbots</a> (<em>SN: 4/12/23</em>).</p>



<p>Once the researchers knew which brain activity patterns matched the words in the stories, the team could work backward, using brain patterns to predict new words and ideas. The process inched along in an iterative way. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-023-01304-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decoder ranked the likelihood of words appearing after the previous word</a>, then used the brain activity patterns to help pick a winner and ultimately land on the gist of an idea.</p>



<p>“It definitely doesn’t nail every word,” Huth says. The word-for-word error rate was actually pretty high, between 92 to 94 percent. “But that doesn’t account for how it paraphrases things,” he says. “It gets the ideas.” For instance, when a person heard, “I don’t have my driver’s license yet,” the decoder spat out, “She has not even started to learn to drive yet.”</p>

<p>Such responses made it clear that the decoders struggle with pronouns, though the researchers don’t know why. “It doesn’t know who is doing what to whom,” Huth said in an April 27 news briefing.</p>





<p>Decoders could also roughly reproduce stories from people’s brains in two different scenarios: as people silently told a rehearsed story to themselves, and as they watched silent movies. The fact that these situations could be decoded was exciting, Huth says, because “it meant that what we’re getting at with this decoder, it’s not low-level language stuff.” Instead, “we’re getting at the idea of the thing.”</p>

<p>“This study is very impressive, and it gives us a glimpse of what might be possible in the future,” says Sarah Wandelt, a computational neuroscientist at Caltech who wasn’t involved in the study.</p>



<p>Fast-moving advances in brain decoding can spur discussions of mental privacy, something the researchers addressed in the new study. “We know that this could come off as creepy,” Huth says. “It’s weird that we can put people in the scanner and read out what they’re kind of thinking.”</p>



<p>But the team found that the new method isn’t one-size-fits-all: Each decoder was quite personalized and worked only for the person whose brain data had helped built it. What’s more, a person had to voluntarily cooperate for the decoder to identify ideas. If a person wasn’t paying attention to an audio story, the decoder couldn’t pick that story up from brain signals. Participants could thwart the eavesdropping effort by simply ignoring the story and thinking about animals, doing math problems or focusing on a different story.</p>



<p>“I’m glad that these experiments are done with a view to understanding the privacy,” Anumanchipalli says. “I think we should be mindful, because after the fact, it’s hard to go back and put a pause on research.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-hair-gray-stem-cells">Mouse hair turns gray when certain stem cells get stuck</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hair might go gray when stem cells with wanderlust have their travels interrupted.</p>



<p>Stem cells involved in making the pigment that gives hair its color <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05960-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behave much differently</a> than other stem cells do, researchers report April 19 in <em>Nature</em>. Rather than staying put, these melanocyte stem cells travel up and down hair follicles all while oscillating between two different forms of maturity. But it’s not the unusual behavior that leads to graying. It’s when these stem cells stop their quirky ways that hair turns white.</p>





<p>That movement is really strange behavior for stem cells, says William Lowry, a hair follicle biologist at UCLA. Stem cells usually settle into a niche, or compartment, dividing when they need to, he says. “Their progeny go off and do interesting things … whereas the stem cells typically stay put.” Lowry was not involved in the study but coauthored <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00918-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a commentary about the work</a> that also appeared April 19 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Stem cells are immature cells that make more of themselves and give rise to cells that will mature to perform specific tasks. Melanocyte stem cells can become melanocytes, the cells that make pigments which give hair and skin their color. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Qi Sun and Mayumi Ito Suzuki, stem cell biologists at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, didn’t set out to study gray hair. They wanted to know how melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle behave. The researchers had previously implicated such cells in melanoma skin cancer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand the life cycle of melanocyte stem cells, Sun watched the same patch of hair follicles on a mouse again and again over the mouse’s lifetime. She saw that melanocyte stem cells move out of a compartment at the base of the follicle and up into the follicle bulge. Then the cells turn around and head back to the base.</p>



<p>That is not the cells’ only odd behavior. The stem cells mature, or differentiate, into an intermediate form that ultimately gives rise to melanocytes, the cells that make the pigment melanin, which colors hair. For other stem cells, once they start maturing there is no going back. But melanocyte stem cells can toggle between the less-mature and more-mature states.</p>



<p>Being able to slide between the two states is necessary for hair to keep its color, Sun and colleagues report. The intermediate state is needed for migration to the base of the growing hair shaft, where some of the cells develop into melanocytes to color the hair. And the stem cell state regenerates a pool of stem cells that can then mature to touch up the roots.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="401" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042523_ts_hair-graying_inline.jpg" alt="A series of images of a hair follicle over time.

Unusually for stem cells, the cells moved and up and down the growing follicle, the team discovered.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124022">Q. Sun <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The stem cells must move because proteins that help control cell maturity and proliferation are found in different compartments of the hair follicle. A protein called WNT made by cells in the compartment at the base of the follicle causes  stem cells to mature into melanocytes, the researchers found. But too much WNT activity prevented the stem cells from sliding back into their regenerative state.</p>



<p>As mice aged, or if the researchers plucked hairs to make them grow faster, more and more worn-out melanocyte stem cells got stuck in the hair follicle bulge. There they couldn’t mature into the intermediate stage to travel back to the base compartment where they could have formed melanocytes. That led to depletion of the color-producing cells, causing the hair to turn gray.</p>





<p>The graying could be reversed though. Getting the cells moving and starting the maturation cycle again gave hair back its color, the team found. Previous research has shown that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-stress-turns-hair-gray-triggers-body-fight-flight-response">periods of stress</a> deplete melanocytes and temporarily <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stressed-out-dna-turns-mousy-brown-hair-gray">cause hair to gray</a> (<em>SN: 1/23/20; SN: 6/11/09</em>).</p>



<p>In principle, this sort of behavior from melanocyte stem cells may cause humans’ hair to turn gray too, says Rui Yi, a stem cell biologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who was not involved in the research. Until researchers can observe human hair follicles over time, he says, it’s not possible to say for sure.</p>
