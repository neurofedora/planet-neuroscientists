              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/being-you-coming-to-terms-with-living-in-a-hallucination">Being You: Coming to terms with living in a hallucination</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Fran Hardyman reviews </strong><em><strong>Being You: A new science of consciousness</strong></em><strong>, a bestselling book of the renown author, Anil Seth. Seth discusses the subjectivity of human experience and attempts to explain consciousness.</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What does it mean to be conscious? For Anil Seth, Professor of Neuroscience and co-Director of the Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science, it means there exists “something it is like to be you”. It is fundamentally subjective and, as any scientist knows, subjectivity is a difficult starting point for experimentation and understanding. So, how can we ever attempt to explain the physical basis of the experience we call consciousness?</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This is at the root of the so-called ‘hard problem’, as defined by David Chalmers in 1995 (</span></span><u><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/CHAFUT" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a></span></span></u><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">): why and how are the physical processes of the brain accompanied by subjective experience? Seth tackles this seemingly insurmountable question by focusing on the separate, but related, ‘real problem’ of consciousness: trying to “explain, predict, and control the phenomenological properties of conscious experience” (p22, Being You). He broadly defines these properties as conscious level (on a scale from coma, sleep, and drowsiness to alertness, and even the hyper-awareness during psychedelic use), content (sensory experience), self-awareness and free will. With this structure, he keeps the focus of the book on what can be understood through theory and experimentation, and encourages us to trust that the resulting data will provide a framework for an improved understanding of more existential questions.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Seth compares the field, as it stands now, to the study of life a few centuries ago. He argues that both ‘life’ and ‘consciousness’ refer to emergent properties that arise from varying combinations of stacked biological processes which can be examined and understood individually. He draws the contrast between this type of phenomenon and the kind modelled by temperature, which derives ultimately from a single physical feature (molecular vibration) and can be quantified by a single measure. This temperature-like approach is characteristic of integrated information theory (IIT), one of the leading current theories of consciousness, and one that Seth discusses thoroughly. It holds that integrated information itself, to a high enough degree, produces conscious experience, and that the amount of consciousness can be measured with a single unit: phi. Seth ultimately does not fully subscribe to IIT, but he does not shy away from engaging with its ‘weirder’ aspects, including the implication of panpsychism, wherein the entire fabric of the universe thrums with a background low-level consciousness, with humans, animals, and other complex systems ‘hotspots’ with high phi. What is ‘weird’ is not necessarily false, as, he reminds us, has been proven repeatedly in the last century of physics. There is no reason to expect that the ultimate explanation of consciousness will make intuitive sense.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Seth’s preferred theory of consciousness, however, centres on predictive processing; a mechanistic theory often associated with IIT as a means of integrating information. It suggests that the brain is, at its core, a ‘prediction machine’, that generates models of the world around us and ‘expectations’ of the conditions inside the body, then compares sensory inputs against these. This shifts the common conception of sensory processing from bottom-up ‘reading’ of the world to top-down interpretation of it. Thus our lived experience is a “controlled hallucination” that we design and inhabit. In order to minimise prediction errors, between our internal models and the input they receive, we often engage in ‘active inference’: homeostatic control inside the body, or action in the world, to provide the sensory signals the brain’s predictive models ‘expect’. In this way, predictions can produce phenomenological experience and a conception of the self, he argues.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Overall, this book maintained an excellent balance of science and entertainment, not shying away from the weird and the ethically complex, including panpsychism, animal consciousness, and AI, while also maintaining a hard focus on the known and knowable. Seth made a clear and convincing case for his ‘real problem’ framework for conceptualising consciousness, supported by engaging writing that made his deep expertise and thoughtfulness apparent throughout. This book came at an exciting time for consciousness science, with an advent of adversarial collaboration studies and newfound respect for the field more broadly. I certainly got a lot out of it, and I think most readers could too!</span></span></p>

<p>In 2008, a group of researchers published a paper in <em>Current Biology</em> reporting on what they said was a lungless water-loving frog in Borneo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-bickford-2b254b92/?originalSubdomain=sg">David Bickford</a>, then of the National University of Singapore, and his colleagues, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bornean_flat-headed_frog">Bornean flat-headed frog</a> “breathed” the way most salamanders do:&nbsp; by absorbing oxygen through <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/01/lungless-salamanders-skin-expresses-protein-crucial-for-lung-function/">their skin</a> or, during earlier phases of life for some species, through gills. (We’re not salamander experts, so if this characterization is a bit crude, don’t come for us.) Because the frog lived in fast-moving streams, the researchers reasoned, it could obtain adequate oxygen to meet its needs.</p>



<p>For the last 15-odd years, that understanding held. But in May, another team of herpetologists, using more sophisticated tools, said they’ve found evidence of lungs – tiny but functional – in the creatures. As the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2431834-worlds-only-lungless-frog-species-actually-does-have-lungs-after-all/"><em>New Scientist</em></a> magazine reported earlier this year:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/blackburn-lab/personnel/principal-investigator/">David Blackburn</a> at the Florida Museum of Natural History and his colleagues have taken another look at two of Bickford’s specimens. They ran them through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LObeI9l5DMg">high-resolution micro-CT scanner</a> and saw a respiratory system with small, thin lungs hiding in plain sight.</p>



<p>“Right away, both of us were like, why is there a hole on the bottom of the mouth? That’s not supposed to be there,” says Blackburn. He had spotted the glottis, where the mouth connects with the lungs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, the paper has been retracted. Here’s the <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01064-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982224010649%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">retraction notice</a> for the article, “A lungless frog discovered on Borneo,” which has been cited 38 times, according to Clarivate’ Web of Science: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors previously claimed to have established lunglessness of the Bornean endemic aquatic frog, Barbourula kalimantanensis, by gross dissection and histological sections. However, these methods have been shown to not be sufficient to establish lunglessness (Blackburn et al., 2024, Curr. Biol. 34, R492–R493, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.03.017">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.03.017</a>). Although the methods the authors used were necessary to demonstrate simple features of gross anatomy, newer techniques used by Blackburn et al. (i.e., high-resolution CT scanning) are vastly superior and were able to detect the greatly reduced lungs that clearly exist in Barbourula. Though substantial loss of function might accompany such a reduction in the size of lungs, the frogs’ habitat in fast-flowing streams and rivers still appears to be a key driver of lung reduction in this species. The authors regret that they prematurely came to a false conclusion that Barbourula kalimantanensis has no lungs based on methods that have now been shown to be unreliable in detecting greatly reduced organs.</p>

<p>I led a large-scale collaborative project called oVert (<a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/">https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biad120">https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biad120</a>) in which we were creating high-resolution 3D anatomical datasets, mostly using CT-scanning. As an amphibian biologist, I was interested to generate datasets not only for exemplars across amphibian diversity but also of some taxa with interesting phenotypes. Thus, one species that we chose to CT-scan, as well as to create additional contrast-enhanced CT-scans to visualize soft tissues, was the “lungless frog”, Barbourula kalimantanensis. It was only after we began investigating these datasets that we realized something had been overlooked in the past. We often scroll through these x-ray cross-sections of these datasets beginning at the snout and scrolling backwards. We quite quickly noticed that there appeared to be a glottis and trachea, which, of course, wasn’t supposed to be there. That then led us to investigate this in more detail, including physically inspecting the two specimens on loan (two of the same specimens that had been investigated by Bickford et al. 2008).</p>



<p>To be clear, David Bickford has been a colleague for many years, and there was no animosity between us about this paper. Sometimes scientists take a second look and with different techniques and realize that not all is as it first seemed.</p>

<p>Researchers who said they discovered a new disease akin to rheumatoid arthritis, but caused by pollution, are standing by their claim despite the retraction of their paper last month.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01698-1">Middle east pain syndrome is a pollution-induced new disease mimicking rheumatoid arthritis</a>,” appeared in the Springer Nature journal <em>Scientific Reports</em> in November 2021.&nbsp; The paper has been cited once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and received limited <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/painful-new-arthritislike-disease-is-linked-to-pollution-suggest-doctors-61686">press coverage</a>.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-66447-6">retraction notice</a>, “post-publication peer review by an expert has confirmed the validity” of multiple concerns raised about the study. The paper did not present data to support its claims about the presumed cause for the syndrome, didn’t “conclusively” prove that MEPS is a new disease, and the bone erosions the study claimed were a hallmark of the disease weren’t backed by scans, the notice stated. Also, a figure of the paper featured a radiograph of a patient that wasn’t part of the study.</p>



<span id="more-129777"></span>



<p>“The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the conclusions of this study,” the notice states.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://communities.springernature.com/users/rafal-marszalek">Rafal Marszalek</a>, the editor-in-chief of the journal, told Retraction Watch the concerns were raised by a reader. After post-publication peer review by an expert “confirmed these concerns and that they substantially impact the conclusions of the article,” it was retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead author of the paper, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5034-8545">Adel A. Elbeialy</a>, a rheumatologist at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, disagreed with the retraction. He told us the journal did not respond to his objections.</p>



<p>In an email to <a href="https://communities.springernature.com/users/268019-anam-akhtar">Anam Akhtar</a>, a deputy editor of <em>Scientific Reports,</em> Elbeialy called the decision “hurried.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other communications with the journal seen by Retraction Watch, Elbeialy disputed the retraction, saying the findings would be supported in future research. “Some of these papers will reach your eminent journal soon,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elbeialy admitted that one of the figures was from a patient not included in the study, but said the authors decided to include it because of its “high resolution and suitability for printing.”</p>



<p>In his email to Akhtar, Elbeialy compared MEPS to COVID-19 “and its sequelae, we have to wait for other researches that explain the pathogenesis, criteria for diagnosis and proper treatment.” He also noted that rheumatoid arthritis, which the retracted paper claims is similar to Middle East Pain Syndrome, “was not understood fully from a single paper when described by Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais in the year 1800.”</p>

<p>As we reported <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/16/kavli-prize-winner-threatens-to-sue-critic-for-defamation/">last month</a>, a lawyer representing Mirkin sent a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cease-and-Desist-to-R.-Levy-5_15_20241348054-clean.pdf">cease and desist letter</a> to Raphaël Lévy, a professor of physics at the Université Paris Sorbonne Nord, accusing Lévy of making “patently false and defamatory” statements about Mirkin’s research in a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12746734">letter Lévy had submitted to <em>PNAS</em></a> about the now-corrected article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his letter, Lévy wrote that the article’s “presentation of SNAs as a ‘powerful class of nanotherapeutics’ is misleading.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129774"></span>



<p>The <em>PNAS</em> paper,“<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2306973121">Multimodal neuro-nanotechnology: Challenging the existing paradigm in glioblastoma therapy</a>,” had mentioned a clinical trial of an experimental cancer drug from <a href="https://invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/startups/exicure.html">Exicure</a>, a company Mirkin <a href="https://www.invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/invo-spotlights/featured-innovators/chad-mirkin.html">co-founded in 2011</a> to develop SNAs for diagnosing and treating disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The experimental drug showed a “33% overall response rate at the highest dosage,” according to the <em>PNAS</em> paper. In his critique, Lévy wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<p>No reference is provided but the figure appears to come from an interim report presented by the company (press release and presentation at a conference (<a href="https://jitc.bmj.com/content/8/Suppl_3/A257.2">10</a>)). The 33% are in fact 2 patients from a sub-group of 6 patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413733121">correction</a> to the article adds four references regarding the drug and its performance in clinical trials, one of which was reference 10 from Lévy’s letter. The other added references include the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03684785">clinical trial registration</a> and company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200916005263/en/">press release</a> about the results, both of which Lévy referred to in his letter, and a publication about a phase 1 study of the drug. The references were added “upon request,” according to the correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>PNAS</em> declined to publish Lévy’s letter, and declined to comment on its decision for our prior article. The journal said it had nothing to add to the correction. Mirkin has not responded to our requests for comment. </p>



<p>The added references confirm what Lévy wrote in his letter, he told Retraction Watch, but don’t go far enough to fix the article, in his view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Readers will “be unaware that this correction results from my comment, which Chad Mirkin tried to silence with a legal threat, and that PNAS decided not to publish,” Lévy said. “They will also not know that the results are from an interim report of a clinical trial that stopped several years ago.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thus this correction does nothing to correct the main problem” of the article, Lévy said, namely “that it cherry picks facts (here encouraging results from a very small number of patients) to mislead readers by presenting spherical nucleic acids as a ‘powerful class of nanotherapeutics.’”</p>



<p>Lévy also informed <em>PNAS</em> Mirkin had founded a new company, <a href="https://www.flashpoint.bio/">Flashpoint Therapeutics</a>, to develop SNA drugs but had not disclosed this relationship in the paper. “That conflict of interest is still undeclared,” he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/spotlight-on-eva-kreysing">Spotlight On: Eva Kreysing</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We are back with our &apos;spotlight on&apos; interview series, shedding light on inspiring women working in the field of neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. The questions posed to these individuals explore the themes of job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations in the neuroscience field, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to see new interviews every few weeks from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_0355dd46f68549c7a8b7de5056f93afc~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Dr Eva Kreysing, postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge."></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Being a woman in neuroscience can be challenging, but facing strong gender bias from an early age, by being a woman in physics, can be even more so. Dr Eva Kreysing is both. Equally fascinated by these research areas, based at the University of Cambridge as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Professor Kristian Franze, Dr Kreysing uses her advanced training in the physical sciences to shine light on some of the biggest questions in developmental neuroscience. What can physics tell us about the way that neurons mature as our brains are built? I sat down with Eva to learn about her journey into cross-disciplinary science, her current projects, and where her career is heading. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>How did you first decide to become a scientist?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I would probably say in eleventh grade which, in my school, was the first time we were properly introduced to the sciences in class. There were two key moments that come to mind. The first was in my first real school physics lecture where we were taught, in one go, how to differentiate, integrate and solve differential equations. I was amazed to see just how powerful maths is and how elegantly you can apply it. That made me see that I really love the approach that physics gives you in science.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">From the biology side, it was around the same time. I was looking through my biology textbook at the beginning of term and came across neurons – I was so intrigued, but perhaps a bit lazy and didn’t keep reading! Instead, I went to see my father, who used to be a biology teacher, and asked him to tell me everything he knew about neurons. We sat down for an entire afternoon, and I was hooked. I knew then that I wanted to study neurons, but I wanted to take a physics approach.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Your undergraduate and PhD studies were both in physics – what made you take that particular path?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I spoke to various people with backgrounds in neuroscience, medicine and physics, and from these conversations, I decided that the best way to combine a love of physics and neuroscience was to study physics as a primary subject and explore neuroscience independently. I felt learning physics by myself would be harder, but with biology I could focus on the areas I was specifically interested in and explore them in depth. I thought this approach would be the best way forward.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>What parts of your training in physics then helped you in neuroscience?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I would say less of the techniques, but more of the approach. Being a physics student teaches you to be independent in your learning. You know you will not understand everything in the beginning, but you just have to keep going. No matter what it is, you will manage. We used to call it ‘frustration tolerance’! I took that lesson with me into neuroscience – if I keep trying, then I can find the answers to the questions I am interested in.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>So training as a physicist helped you to train yourself as a biologist?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think so!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Can you tell me about the research you are doing now? What excites you most about your current work, combining physics with neuroscience?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">At the moment, I am taking on the question of how mechanics impacts the electrical development of neurons. For example, how quickly do neurons start to communicate with one another depending on their mechanical environment, such as the stiffness of the surrounding brain tissue? I absolutely love trying to figure out all of the different components that feed into the mechanics of the cell. Sometimes I put myself into the neuron’s shoes and try to imagine what it would actually </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">feel</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, what the world looks like from the perspective of this tiny neuron. If I am a neuron, and I grab hold of this and pull on it, how will this affect me?</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>So cool! What sort of lab techniques help you to understand this?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are so many different techniques. On the one hand, I use a lot of microscopy tools that are grounded in physics to probe how the mechanics of a cell work. Using traction force microscopy, I can measure the forces that a cell applies to its environment, for example as an axon extends and grows, by looking at how it deforms its environment. Optics tweezers let me pull a super thin tether of cell membrane to see how much tension there is. These physical principles tell us lots about how neurons behave and develop over time, and this feeds back into more traditional biological measures, such as gene expression. Figuring out how mechanical interactions can change biological pathways is, for me, the coolest thing, because it really combines these two worlds.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>How do you investigate the mechanisms that link mechanics to biochemistry? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have done a lot of RNA sequencing, and more Western blots than I can count, to compare gene expression from cells that are cultured in different mechanical environments, in particular on gels of different &apos;stiffness&apos;. This can pinpoint interesting candidates that may be important in the signalling cascade, even if you have never heard of them before! I then specifically target these candidates with molecular techniques, like CRISPR-Cas9, and see if the result is what I would expect, depending on my hypothesis. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_e3b90326c7d74f729c777340d44180eb~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Wild type rat hippocampal neurons stained for DAPI (blue), tubulin (white) and actin (blue)."></figure>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Is there such a thing as a typical ‘day-to-day’ in your job?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My days vary so much, which is definitely part of the appeal. I have some days where I am fully engaged in the lab, doing tissue dissections and neuronal culture. Now that I have so much experience, it almost feels like a handicraft, and I get into a sort-of ‘flow state’ when the muscle memory just kicks in. It gives lab work a totally zen feeling. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I then look at my cells under the microscope and, particularly if it is a new experiment, I might see things I have never seen before – I get so curious about what I am about to see! When you see something interesting, it is really eye opening, especially if it is not the observation you expected. I take the time to think about it and prepare to doubt all of my assumptions. I dive into the literature and search through papers for the missing pieces of the puzzle that explain what I just saw with my own two eyes. With more research, the picture becomes clearer, and I get such a sense of reward.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I also supervise students, which is immensely satisfying because I can share my knowledge to help people avoid making some of the frustrating mistakes I faced myself! Some of my students are actually taking on my own previous projects, so supporting their progress is truly fantastic because I still feel so invested in this research, despite not having the opportunity to progress with my own two hands in the lab. I’m still following the story, all while giving advice and mentoring the next generation of scientists.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Of course, there are also desk-based days. I write a lot of my own custom software to analyse the data that I have collected, such as the dynamic calcium signalling of cells. On other days, I’m writing papers and research proposals </span></span><u><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.25.605128v1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">(have a look at Eva&apos;s latest preprint here)</span></span></em></a></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_2e5208a4f6a947a1b8c67263e572add2~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Eva's Newfador, Sam."></figure>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Sounds really intense! When things get tough, what keeps you going?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As soon as I start to feel uneasy, I turn to the people around me. In the lab or the office, I am fortunate to be blessed with the most amazing team of colleagues who are such a source of support. After work, I focus on spending time with the people I love, and my adorable black Newfador, Sam. Sport is also a fantastic mental release; whenever I exercise, like taking Sam for a walk or jog, the world looks completely different when I get home. It gives me a new perspective and helps me forget about things.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Do you think there are particular challenges faced by women in progressing in their careers in both neuroscience and physics?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I would say it has become more ‘normal’ to be a woman in neuroscience than a woman in physics. This probably also depends what country you are in, as Germany (where I come from and did my PhD) has a very different scientific culture to the UK. I have always felt more accepted here, not by specific individuals, but in an overall sense. I do feel that I belong in science and that I am respected.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>On the topic of respect, who would you consider a scientific inspiration to admire?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have been thinking a lot about this question, as I thought it might come up! I have to say, if it is really a question of inspiration, I must admit that it is not people that inspire me, but problems. When I am faced with a problem, I am compelled to learn everything that I need to in order to tackle it. It is this that really inspires me in my work, rather than a desire to follow in the footsteps of someone else. Every scientist, just like every person, is completely different. No scientist I have met is someone I have felt able to compare myself to. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>There are so many problems out there to face! What problems do you want to face in your future research? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My dream is to combine my research from both my PhD and my postdoc and take them to the next level. Together, they could give much deeper insights into how mechanics impacts circuit formation in the brain. This is a huge question, and to face it we have to learn a lot more about how mechanosensing actually works at the subcellular level – how are neurons ‘feeling’ their environment? Then we have to take the story all the way through to the development of organs </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">in vivo</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. If I could start a lab that works to achieve this, it would be incredible. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Last but not least, if you could go through your career again, is there anything you would change?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Honestly, I would probably do exactly the same. During my undergraduate studies, people used to ask me what I was interested in, and when I told them I wanted to work at the interface of neuroscience and physics, they just looked at me in a funny way. Many tried to talk me out of studying physics at all. They gave me the impression that they thought what I wanted was wrong, or was not possible. Now, having gone through my journey, I know they were wrong. This has been the right path for me.</span></span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/rewiring-the-mind-the-extraordinary-power-of-neuroplasticity">Rewiring the mind: the extraordinary power of neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the brain’s remarkable ability to reorganise itself by forming and eliminating neural connections throughout life. This adaptive capability is essential for learning, memory and recovery from brain injuries.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Neuroplasticity manifests in two ways: functional, and structural plasticity. Functional plasticity is the brain’s ability to move the capability of performing functions from damaged areas to undamaged ones. For example, after a stroke, other parts of the brain may take over the functions that were previously controlled by other areas. Meanwhile, structural plasticity involves the brain’s ability to physically change in structure, such as when learning, during experiences, or injury. It includes growth of new neurons (neurogenesis) and formation of new synaptic connections.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #a5698a;">Mechanisms of neuroplasticity</span></h4>
<p>1.    <strong> Synaptic plasticity:</strong> changes in strength of the synapses (the connections between neurons) are crucial for learning and memory. Key processes involved are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), strengthening or weakening synapses over time in response to increases or decreases in their activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a process that results in a lasting enhancement of signal transmission between two neurons when they are stimulated together and the strengthening of synaptic connections. This phenomenon is typically triggered by high-frequency stimulation of the synapse. The induction of LTP relies on the influx of calcium ions through NMDA receptors, which activates signalling pathways that boost synaptic strength. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes are involved in LTP, with increased neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron and heightened receptor sensitivity or density on the postsynaptic neuron contributing to the overall enhancement of synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Long-term depression (LTD) is a process that results in a sustained reduction in synaptic strength, usually induced by low-frequency stimulation of the synapse. This decrease in synaptic efficiency is characterized by the removal of neurotransmitter receptors, such as AMPA receptors, from the postsynaptic neuron. Unlike long-term potentiation, which involves an influx of calcium ions through NMDA receptors to strengthen synapses, LTD involves a lower influx of calcium, activating phosphatases that lead to receptor removal. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes contribute to LTD, including diminished neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron and a decrease in receptor density or sensitivity on the postsynaptic neuron.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     <strong>Neurogenesis:</strong> generation of new neurons, particularly in the hippocampus, which is vital for learning and memory.</p>
<p>3.     <strong>Dendritic branching:</strong> the growth of dendrite branches at the end of axons enhances the formation of new connections.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><span style="color: #a5698a;">Factors that influence neuroplasticity</span></h4>
<p>1. <strong>    Age: </strong>neuroplasticity is more pronounced in childhood; however, adults retain significant plasticity, especially in response to stimuli like learning new skills or rehabilitation after injury.</p>
<p>2.     <strong>Environments with stimulating activities </strong>such as physical exercise, social interaction, cognitive challenges, and exposure to novel experiences enhance neuroplasticity. This is due to increased blood flow and providing complex varied stimuli.</p>
<p>3.     <strong>Experience and learning</strong> leads to formation and strengthening of synaptic connections.</p>
<p>4.     <strong>Physical activity</strong> promotes synaptic plasticity, benefiting cognitive functions.</p>
<p>5.    <strong> Dietary nutrients</strong>, such as omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, support brain health and plasticity.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #a5698a;">Neuroplasticity in health and disease</span></h4>
<p>Memory consolidation techniques, such as spaced repetition, enhance long-term retention of information. Similarly, post-injury rehabilitation strategies aim to harness neuroplasticity to restore lost functions. These include physical therapy, cognitive rehabilitation, or constrain induced movement therapy, a rehabilitation technique that involves restricting the use of an unaffected limb to encourage the use and improve the function of a weaker limb, commonly used in stroke recovery. Neuroplasticity also plays a role in mental health conditions, e.g. CBT aims to rewire maladaptive circuits in depression and anxiety.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #a5698a;">Outlook</span></h4>
<p>In the future, there are multiple ways in which we can continue to harness neuroplasticity. Devices such as brain computer interfaces can directly influence neuroplasticity by providing real-time feedback and targeted stimulation, which helps the brain to reorganize and form new neural connections, thereby enhancing motor and cognitive functions. Pharmacological drugs, such as memantine (used for Alzheimer&apos;s disease), donepezil (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), and ketamine (an anaesthetic with rapid antidepressant effects) can promote neuroplasticity by modulating neurotransmitter systems, enhancing synaptic connections, and supporting cognitive and emotional function, and hence can be used to treat neurological disorders. Genes and their expression can also influence neuroplasticity.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In conclusion, neuroplasticity, the brain’s dynamic ability to adapt, learn, and heal, not only supports our cognitive and motor functions, but also gives us hope for recovery from injuries and treatment of neurological disorders. As research progresses, harnessing neuroplasticity enables us to unlock new discoveries, ultimately enhancing human health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>A journal has republished an edited version of a paper it retracted after a distributor of a chiropractic product the paper criticized wrote in to complain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The distributor accused the publication of making “very serious, incorrect and libelous statements” and threatened legal action, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129772"></span>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/01/journal-retracts-paper-on-chiropractic-product-after-company-complains/">we reported</a> the <a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/"><em>Journal of Clinical Imaging Science</em></a> retracted the paper, “<a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/an-investigation-into-the-chiropractic-practice-and-communication-of-routine-repetitive-radiographic-imaging-for-the-location-of-postural-misalignments/">An investigation into the chiropractic practice and communication of routine repetitive radiographic imaging for the location of postural misalignments</a>,” because it contained “controversial statements regarding the commercial product Denneroll,” according to the <a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/retraction-an-investigation-into-the-chiropractic-practice-and-communication-of-routine-repetitive-radiographic-imaging-for-the-location-of-postural-misalignments/">retraction notice</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deed Harrison, a chiropractor who is a distributor of Denneroll, “claimed that the data presented against this product lacks scientific backing,” the notice stated. “The authors of the manuscript acknowledged the error. Therefore, on ethical grounds, the article is being retracted.”</p>



<p>We have now <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GDLRrLcVyzvbH5v1d56VFts0Qwi2L22I8c7qVrJbkGU/edit?usp=sharing">obtained an email</a>, dated June 15, in which Harrison accused the journal of making a “serious Libelous statement” against himself and the maker of Denneroll. “I do not wish to involve my legal team in this issue nor the legal team of Denneroll Industries, however, if nothing is done regarding the above we will be compelled to pursue legal counsel and appropriate action,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harrison called the statements in the published paper about him and the company “false,” and said the researchers “provide no reference for the support of their statements.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the email, Harrison stated his family does not own Denneroll Industries, as the original paper asserted. He also criticized the article’s use of the word “pillow” to describe the cervical chiropractic device. Rather, he called Denneroll a “prescription only based orthotic used by physicians (prescribed to their patients) to improve the cervical lordotic curvature.”</p>



<p>“The statement is not only false by Williams et al, but it is damaging to the scientific truth and the reputation of the Denneroll product, which in turn are damaging to Denneroll Industries,” Harrison wrote.</p>



<p>In the retracted version of the paper, still available online, the researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1839988/pdf/jcca-v50-2-103.pdf">cited</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1839992/pdf/jcca-v50-2-097.pdf">three</a> <a href="https://www.injuryjournal.com/article/S0020-1383(98)00184-3/abstract">papers</a> critical of the Denneroll and a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1840024/pdf/jcca-v49-4-270.pdf">2005 study</a> Harrison coauthored. Harrison noted that the quotations the retracted paper attributed to the critical articles it cited “can’t be found as a quotation by those sources.” </p>



<p>Another apparent quotation about the purported effects of the Denneroll is “not properly referenced and is made to appear as if it were nothing but conjecture from the &#8216;Harrisons&#8217;&#8211;being me Dr. Deed Harrison.” </p>



<p>“The libelous statements made by Williams et al in your journal are not referenced by them and it appears as though they made these up without proper citation,” he wrote.</p>



<p>One week after Harrison’s email to the journal, on June 22, the journal retracted the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On August 1, the day we published our report, the journal <a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/an-investigation-into-the-chiropractic-practice-and-communication-of-routine-repetitive-radiographic-imaging-for-the-location-of-postural-misalignments-2/">republished the article</a> without the offending statements, or any apparent reference to the original article or retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/112358951-vikram-s-dogra">Vikram Dogra</a>, the editor-in-chief of the journal, nor the corresponding author, <a href="https://muckrack.com/brogan-williams/articles">Brogan Williams</a>, a researcher at the Association of Musculoskeletal Sports Physiologists in Auckland, New Zealand, immediately responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The republished version of the article still cites four papers by Harrison in the introduction as examples of researchers “commonly drawn to communicate the patient’s overall spinal curvature and increased weight-bearing that may be occurring at specific structures.” Harrison’s papers were also used as examples of research that used “postural analysis of the lumbopelvic region” to “validate treatment approaches and communicate a patient’s spinal health.”</p>

His Google Scholar profile lists 795 publications with a collective citation count of 12,032 (as of July 31, 2024). This prolific output reached its peak in 2015, with 268 papers.</p>
<p>“How is this possible?” you may ask. Here's the reason. Only 17 of 795 articles are indexed in PubMed. All the others were published in journals that do not meet the quality standards of MEDLINE. {This is a fact.}<sup><b><span style="color: #800180;">1</span></b></sup> </p><p><br />The <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_journal_selection.html" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine</a> decides whether a journal is included in MEDLINE (the source database for PubMed) based on:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Scope and Coverage</li><li>Editorial Policies and Processes</li><li>Scientific Rigor/Methodological Rigor</li><li>Production and Administration</li><li>Impact</li></ul>
<br />

<p>So-called “<a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/predatory-online-journals-lure-scholars-who-are-eager-to-publish/" target="_blank">predatory</a>” journals – first documented by librarian <a href="https://beallslist.net/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Beall</a> – do not meet the quality standards for MEDLINE.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing" target="_blank">predatory publishing</a> “is an exploitative academic publishing business model, where the journal or publisher prioritizes self-interest at the expense of scholarship. It is characterized by misleading information, deviates from the standard peer review process, is highly non-transparent, and often utilizes aggressive solicitation practices.”</p>

<p>In such journals, the time between manuscript submission and acceptance for publication is alarmingly short, leading some to question whether adequate peer review had taken place.</p><br />

<p>Here are several examples for Trivedi et al. (2015). Note that time from submission to publication was 8-10 days.<b><sup><span style="color: #800180;">2</span></sup></b> <br /></p><br /><a href="https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ajhr.20150306.14" target="_blank">In vitro Evaluation of Biofield Treatment on Viral Load Against Human Immunodeficiency-1 and Cytomegalo Viruses</a><br /><i>American Journal of Health Research</i> (Volume 3, Issue 6)<br /><u>Received</u>: <b>9 October 2015</b> <u>Accepted</u>: <b>19 October 2015</b><br /><br /><a href="https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.aff.20150406.16" target="_blank">Evaluation of Plant Growth Regulator, Immunity and DNA Fingerprinting of Biofield Energy Treated Mustard Seeds</a> (<i>Brassica juncea</i>)<br /><i>Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries</i> (Volume 4, Issue 6)<br /><u>Received</u>: <b>11 October 2015</b>     <u>Accepted</u>: <b>19 October 2015</b><br /><br /><a href="https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ijgg.20150306.13" target="_blank">Agronomic Characteristics, Growth Analysis, and Yield Response of Biofield Treated Mustard, Cowpea, Horse Gram, and Groundnuts</a><br /><i>International Journal of Genetics and Genomics </i>(Volume 3, Issue 6)<br /><u>Received</u>: <b>12 October 2015</b>     <u>Accepted</u>: <b>21 October 2015 </b><br /><br /><a href="https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ajbio.20150306.16" target="_blank">Evaluation of Biochemical Marker - Glutathione and DNA Fingerprinting of Biofield Energy Treated</a> <i>Oryza sativa</i><br /><i>American Journal of BioScience </i>(Volume 3, Issue 6)<br /><u>Received</u>: <b>12 October 2015</b><u>     Accepted</u>: <b>21 October 2015</b><br /><br /><p>{<u>Qualification</u>: <a href="https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/" target="_blank">Science Publishing Group</a> claims that articles are

<p>Why is this important? When a company tries to sell products and services that are “backed by science,” we are free to evaluate the evidence for these claims.</p><br />

<p>My <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2024/07/the-miraculous-guru-with-h-index-of-62.html" target="_blank" title="The Miraculous Guru with an h-index of 62">previous post</a> introduced you to Mr. Trivedi and his Divine Connection:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>“<a href="https://divineconnection.org/about-guruji-trived" target="_blank">Guruji Mahendra Kumar Trivedi</a> is an Enlightened and miraculous being with Divine Embodiment, gifted to transform living organisms at the genetic level &amp; non-living materials at the atomic level. … Guruji’s Blessing has impacted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people globally, and has been validated globally with cutting-edge scientific research.”&nbsp;</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I read a 2023 paper, <span style="color: #2b00fe;"><i>The role of biofield energy treatment on psychological symptoms, mental health disorders, and stress‐related quality of life in adult subjects: A randomized controlled clinical trial</i> </span>(indexed in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37261039/" target="_blank">PubMed</a>), and found irregularities and questionable results. I’m confident that some of the reported data are physiologically impossible. Thus, I urged the journal to reconsider the paper and the publisher (Wiley) to retract it from the scientific literature {if warranted}.</p><br />

<p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottomline.asp" target="_blank">bottom line</a> (so to speak) for Trivedi Global, Inc. is net revenue from sales of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240803032749/https://divineconnection.org/memberships#memberships" target="_blank">Remote Blessing Memberships</a>:</p>

observed with 785 nm Raman spectroscopy, it must be understood that the changes
(a) were not reproducible, (b) occurred sometimes to the blessed samples and
sometimes to the control samples and (c) were most likely due to a problem we
were having with an unstable laser source on the Raman spectrometer, which was

were observed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></blockquote><br /><p>Mr. Trivedi sued Dr. Slawecki (see <a href="https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/144756np.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>) for these and other statements, but the case was dismissed.</p><p><br /></p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"></span><p></p></div><div>

<p>We know we say this every year, but the last 12 months have been big ones for Retraction Watch as we celebrate our 14th birthday on August 3. We’ve continued breaking big stories and maintaining <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org">The Retraction Watch Database</a> – while also taking big steps toward financial sustainability.</p>



<p>In September, we <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/news-crossref-and-retraction-watch/">announced</a> that the Database – which as of today contains more than 50,000 retractions – became completely open with its acquisition by <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref.</a> The move also allowed us to hire Gordon Sullivan, another staff member who works on the Database, and covers the costs of maintaining the Database 100% for at least five years.</p>



<p>We hope regular readers by now have noticed the site runs faster, with no downtime. That’s thanks to the volunteer efforts of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucent/">Michael Dayah</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karllehenbauer/">Karl Lehenbauer</a>, who over the past year or so have pitched in to help us with back-end platform and software issues. We can’t thank them enough for their ongoing support.</p>

<p>An article about the overuse of spinal imaging has been retracted after the distributor of a chiropractic product it criticized in passing complained to the journal. </p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/an-investigation-into-the-chiropractic-practice-and-communication-of-routine-repetitive-radiographic-imaging-for-the-location-of-postural-misalignments/">An investigation into the chiropractic practice and communication of routine repetitive radiographic imaging for the location of postural misalignments</a>,” was retracted in June from the <a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/"><em>Journal of Clinical Imaging Science</em></a> after the editor-in-chief learned it contained “controversial statements regarding the commercial product Denneroll,” according to the <a href="https://clinicalimagingscience.org/retraction-an-investigation-into-the-chiropractic-practice-and-communication-of-routine-repetitive-radiographic-imaging-for-the-location-of-postural-misalignments/">statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.denneroll.com/">Denneroll</a> is a line of support products that purports to help with “spinal remodeling” for people whose spines aren’t curved in the normal way, according to a company <a href="https://www.denneroll.com/denneroll-brochures-12-pack">brochure</a>. The company’s <a href="https://www.denneroll.com/">website</a> states that the Denneroll products are “second to none in spinal orthotics.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice said <a href="https://idealspine.com/about-deed-harrison/">Deed Harrison</a>, a chiropractor whose family distributes the Denneroll product line, “claimed that the data presented against this product lacks scientific backing.” Harrison’s father, <a href="https://idealspine.com/about-the-founder/">Donald Harrison</a>, originated a technique called <a href="https://idealspine.com/what-is-cbp/">Chiropractic BioPhysics</a> (CBP) which is the basis of the Denneroll product line, according to the CBP website. </p>



<span id="more-129756"></span>



<p>According to the notice, “the authors of the manuscript acknowledged the error. Therefore, on ethical grounds, the article is being retracted.” The corresponding author, <a href="https://muckrack.com/brogan-williams/articles">Brogan Williams</a>, a researcher at the Association of Musculoskeletal Sports Physiologists in Auckland, New Zealand, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/112358951-vikram-s-dogra">Vikram Dogra</a>, the editor-in-chief of the journal, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the authors of the retracted paper discussed evidence they said showed “no association between pain and reversed cervical curves,” they wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<p>It must be addressed that over the years, there have been some contradictory studies by one very active group, the Harrisons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Harrisons have been challenged multiple times by many leading chiropractors, claiming the method was ‘physiologically flawed’ and the studies extremely ‘vulnerable to false-positive diagnoses,’” Williams and his colleagues wrote, citing a <a href="https://www.injuryjournal.com/article/S0020-1383(98)00184-3/abstract">1998 study</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also mentioned two 2006 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1839988/pdf/jcca-v50-2-103.pdf">critical</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1839992/pdf/jcca-v50-2-097.pdf">reviews</a> of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1840024/pdf/jcca-v49-4-270.pdf">2005 paper</a> by both Harrisons supporting “structural rehabilitation of the spine” and the CBP method. The reviews “concluded that ‘we must reclassify their studies as seriously flawed controlled clinical trials’ and ‘inconclusive evidence that may be viewed as professionally irresponsible by the scientific and academic community,’” Williams and his colleagues wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We attempted to contact the authors from each paper referenced, but none responded to our request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harrison told Retraction Watch that he is “pleased with the decision by the Editor, the Board, and the Publisher based on the information I provided to them.” He refused to share the letter he sent the journal and would not respond to other questions.</p>



<p>Two “testimonies” on the <a href="https://www.denneroll.com/">Denneroll website</a> state “I personally use the Denneroll Orthotic device for my patients. Now, I have chosen to put the CBP name behind the Denneroll and recommend it to other Chiropractors.” They are attributed to Deed E. Harrison and Deed E. Harrison 2. A third, with the standard “Lorem ipsum dolor” text indicating filler, is attributed to Deed E. Harrison 3.</p>



<p>Update, 8/3/24, 1300 UTC: Headline, first paragraph, and fourth paragraph edited to clarify that the Harrisons are distributors of Denneroll, not the owners.</p>
