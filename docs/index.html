              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geothermal-energy-africa-kenya-renewable-electricity">How Kenya is helping its neighbors develop geothermal energy</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The dusty town of Naivasha sits within the Great Rift Valley, where the African continent is being divided into two. About 90 kilometers northwest of Kenya’s capital city of Nairobi, Naivasha welcomes gaggles of tourists each year trekking to Hell’s Gate National Park. The forces that are splitting apart the African tectonic plate have sculpted the area’s steep cliffs, plummeting valleys and undulating hills — a rugged landscape that inspired the backdrop of Disney’s <em>The Lion King</em>.</p>



<p>Those forces have also made Naivasha the frontier of Kenya’s geothermal power industry.</p>





<p>The country’s first geothermal well was drilled there in the 1950s. By 1981, Kenya had its first geothermal power plant, harnessing a renewable resource that taps into heat generated deep within the Earth. Today, Naivasha’s Olkaria geothermal power project plus a small facility at another site are capable of generating 963 megawatts of electricity when running at full power.</p>



<p>At the end of last year, Kenya ranked seventh on the list of top geothermal energy countries in the world. Geothermal accounts for 47 percent of the country’s total energy production — a percentage that’s growing. The only other geothermal energy producer in Africa, Ethiopia, started production in 1998 and has an installed capacity of just 7.5 megawatts.</p>



<p>But regional interest is growing, especially as Africa works toward universal energy access by 2030, in accordance with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Roughly 43 percent of the continent’s population, equaling about 600&nbsp;million people, lacks access to electricity. A 2021 analysis by the Dalberg consulting firm in partnership with the U.N. showed that there’s enough renewable energy potential to power Africa’s energy needs well into the future, though the up-front costs would be higher than if fossil fuels were used to meet those energy demands.</p>



<p>If African countries pursue renewable energy to meet their electricity goals, the up-front cost would be $1.5 trillion, about 50 percent more than the $1 trillion that fossils fuels would require, says James Mwangi, formerly of Dalberg and founder of the group Climate Action Platform for Africa. But thanks to lower operating and maintenance costs, renewables eventually pay off. In one scenario in the Dalberg analysis, a renewable-heavy future would take 13 years or so to break even with one where fossil fuels are still heavily used.</p>



<p>With the renewables route, Mwangi says, “Africa could reach universal energy access much faster and ultimately have the lowest energy costs in the world.” The localized nature of renewable sources, compared with often-imported fossil fuels, could also enhance energy security and independence.</p>



<p>In East Africa, geothermal energy is an attractive option. It’s abundant thanks to the East African Rift System, which brings heat toward the surface. Like other renewable energies such as wind and solar, geothermal doesn’t emit carbon dioxide. And it comes with extra benefits. “Geothermal power is reliable,” says Anna Mwangi, senior geophysicist at the Kenya Electricity Generating Company, or KenGen, the government entity that operates Olkaria (and no relation to James Mwangi). Geothermal sources are available night and day, and don’t depend on the sun, wind or rain. So geothermal energy may be more resilient to climate change than some other renewables.</p>



<p>But setting up geothermal power plants requires more money and specialized expertise than other renewable energies. And like any development project, it can come with social costs, such as displacing people from their land.</p>



<p>Given its long-standing experience, Kenya is now assisting its neighbors. “We are offering technical support to the countries in the region, as a way to help them develop their geothermal potential,” says Anna Mwangi. KenGen has already drilled multiple geothermal wells in Ethiopia and Djibouti.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why East Africa is a geothermal energy hot spot</h4>



<p>Globally, geothermal resources are often found along the boundaries of tectonic plates, such as around the Pacific Ocean’s Ring of Fire. In Africa, a bounty of geothermal resources exist where a new boundary is forming: the East African Rift System. The exact start of the system is not clearly defined; it originates on the Arabian Peninsula before running south along the Red Sea and into Djibouti. As it runs southward in Africa, the rift zone branches into two arms: The eastern arm ends at the border between Kenya and Tanzania while the western arm goes farther south, running 6,400&nbsp;kilometers through more than 10 countries before ending in Mozambique.</p>





<p>For millions of years, the African Plate has been pulled in opposite directions, at a rate of a few centimeters per year. Eventually, this stretching will split Africa into two separate continents and create two tectonic plates, the Nubian Plate to the west and the Somalian Plate to the east.</p>



<p>The stretching also causes magma to dome up in various points along the rift system. One such place is Olkaria in Naivasha. Beneath the surface, the molten rock heats groundwater. Wells bring that hot water and steam to the surface. When harnessed at high pressure and used to turn turbines, the steam generates electricity. The hot water is then injected back into the ground to recharge the subterranean water supply.</p>



<p>There’s no comprehensive estimate for how much total energy East Africa could harvest from geothermal sources. But experts estimate that Kenya and Ethiopia could each generate 10,000 megawatts. That’s roughly triple Kenya’s total installed electricity capacity and double Ethiopia’s.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where’s the heat?</h3>



<p>The total worldwide installed capacity for generating electricity from geothermal energy is 16,000 megawatts. In 2022, Kenya ranked seventh on the list of top geothermal countries.<br>Source: ThinkGeoEnergy Research 2023</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Top 10 geothermal countries (megawatts of installed capacity)</h5>



<p>United States: 3,794<br>Indonesia: 2,356<br>Philippines: 1,935<br>Turkey: 1,682<br>New Zealand: 1,037<br>Mexico: 963<br>Kenya: 944*<br>Italy: 944<br>Iceland: 754<br>Japan: 621</p>



<p>*ThinkGeoEnergy’s tally of Kenya’s installed capacity, as of January 2023, differs slightly from KenGen’s.</p>
</div>



<p>For now, it’s mostly Kenya — one of the world’s fastest-growing geothermal power players — that has plumbed this deep heat. In addition to Olkaria, there’s a small site at the nearby Eburru geothermal field that can generate 2.4 megawatts of electricity. Farther to the north, a 35-megawatt power plant is expected to open this year at the Menengai geothermal field, with another one in development.</p>



<p>A push toward geothermal energy in recent years has come as droughts have dwindled some of Kenya’s hydropower sources. With rainfall and temperatures projected to become more erratic and extreme with climate change, geothermal energy may be the more dependable option, Anna Mwangi says.</p>



<p>Geothermal power plants can run at maximum power output up to 90 percent of the time, when taking downtime due to maintenance into account, says François Le Scornet, president and senior market intelligence consultant at Carbonexit Consulting in France. That’s comparable to a nuclear power plant and about twice as reliable as a fossil fuel plant or wind farm (and four times as good as solar). Indeed, with the rise of geothermal energy, <a href="https://www.irena.org/Publications/2023/Feb/Global-geothermal-market-and-technology-assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenya’s power outages have declined</a>, according to a report released in February by the International Renewable Energy Agency and the International Geothermal Association.</p>



<p>The scalding-hot water and steam that flow up a geothermal well can do more than generate electricity; they can also be a direct source of heating. The <a href="https://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/WGC/2020/01055.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oserian flower farm near Naivasha</a>, for instance, pipes the water in to warm a greenhouse at night. The warmth dries out the air to prevent fungus from spoiling the roses, carnations and other flowers destined for bouquets around the world. At Olkaria, tourists in need of relaxation after a long day of exploring Hell’s Gate can soak in the geothermal spa near the power plant.</p>

Kamadi</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to find geothermal resources</h4>



<p>It takes a team of specialists to determine a site’s suitability for geothermal resource exploration. At minimum, what’s needed are the presence of groundwater, high temperatures — often around or above 150° Celsius — and permeable rock that will enable heated water and steam to flow into production wells, says Mohamed Abdel Zaher, a geophysicist at the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics in Cairo.</p>



<p>Certain visual characteristics on the surface may give an initial hint. Hot springs, hot mud puddles, geysers and even steam rising from the ground are signs of geothermal activity. Another clue is the presence of certain rocks, such as travertine, or mineral veins like quartz that indicate rock has been altered during interactions with hot water.</p>



<p>At Olkaria, a tip-off was the fact that the surrounding area is ring-shaped like a caldera, a collapsed volcano. A series of younger volcanic domes appear to have intruded into the caldera.</p>



<p>If the surface characteristics look promising, geochemists will step in to analyze fluid and gas samples to estimate how deep and hot the heat source might be and where the fluids flow. Seismometers might be deployed to infer the brittleness of the subsurface rock. It’s important that rock be permeable, but it needs to be strong enough to withstand the interaction of cool water being heated from the magma below.</p>



<p>If all those data look promising, exploration drilling will commence and if all goes well, a production well and eventually a full-blown power plant will follow.</p>



<p>Zaher and his colleagues recently completed a project that might help experts across the continent zero in on potential geothermal targets before starting costly on-the-ground exploration. “It is quite difficult to predict the precise power or electricity that can be produced for all of Africa,” he says. But his group incorporated a range of geologic, seismic and other geophysical data into a geographic information system to predict the most promising spots for geothermal exploration. The resulting map identifies <a href="https://geothermal-energy-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40517-022-00219-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14 areas that have high geothermal potential</a>, the team reported last year in<em> Geothermal Energy</em>.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, many of these locations are within the East African Rift System, though high potential also exists in northern Africa in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, as well as in Liberia, Namibia, Zambia and South Africa. In many of those countries, the tectonics are such that using geothermal energy for direct heating — as is done at the Oserian flower farm and could be applied in a variety of settings, including industrial processing — may be more feasible than for electricity generation, Zaher says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Work beyond Kenya</h4>



<p>KenGen has led on-the-ground geothermal exploration in a number of nearby countries. In addition to the drilling done in Ethiopia and Djibouti, surface studies to identify potential geothermal resources have been done in Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and the Comoros islands off the coast of Mozambique, Anna Mwangi says.</p>



<p>In addition, KenGen — in collaboration with the Icelandic-based GRÓ Geothermal Training Programme and Kenya’s Geothermal Development Company — has been training university students, energy professionals and government officials within East Africa on geothermal resource exploration and development, as well as power plant financing and management. With help from the World Bank, Kenya is also setting up the Geothermal Centre of Excellence, which will train professionals in the region once it opens in a couple years, Mwangi says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Deep-seated power</h3>



<p>Comprehensive estimates of geothermal energy potential are not available for all East African countries. But the estimates that do exist suggest there’s room for growth. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Geothermal energy potential versus installed capacity in select East African countries</h5>

</div>



<p>Even with the right technical knowledge, though, it can take several years to go from exploration to geothermal energy production. In fact, even once a well has been drilled, it could still take up to a decade or more before a power plant is up and running. Funding constraints can be one barrier.</p>



<p>This is what Kenyan engineers were faced with in 2012, Mwangi says. Wells had already been drilled, yet funding for putting up power plants to generate electricity at full capacity was still unavailable.</p>



<p>This opened an avenue for experimentation. Typically, a power plant is supplied with water and steam from multiple wells at varying distances away. But a new wellhead approach, which hadn’t been implemented anywhere in the world, allowed for the generation of power directly and quickly from a single well, at low cost, in the meantime.</p>



<p>Once a permanent power plant is ready to be built, the wellhead installation can be disassembled and taken to another well for the same purpose. About 85 megawatts of power have been produced this way in Kenya. “Such well-based power plants give us the early generation benefit, and generate revenue in the meantime,” Mwangi says. “Otherwise, these production wells would have remained capped awaiting construction and commissioning of a new power plant.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The costs of geothermal energy</h4>



<p>Even as interest and expertise in geothermal energy grow in East Africa, financial constraints remain an impediment. In Kenya, a single geothermal well can cost about $6 million to drill, and it can be another $300 million to build a roughly 165-megawatt plant.</p>



<p>“Up-front capital cost is high in geothermal, but running costs are limited,” says Le Scornet, the energy consultant.</p>



<p>The worldwide levelized cost of electricity, or LCOE, for a new geothermal installation in 2021 averaged $0.068 per kilowatt-hour, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The LCOE is the lowest price at which electricity can be sold for an energy project to break even. The figure takes into account lifetime costs, from building a plant to operating and maintaining it.</p>



<p>Geothermal’s LCOE is about 40 percent higher than a new hydropower project or solar photovoltaic array, which have an LCOE of $0.048 per kilowatt-hour. An onshore wind farm is about half as expensive, at $0.033 per kilowatt-hour, but geothermal energy is slightly less costly than an offshore wind farm’s $0.075 per kilowatt-hour. (For context, Kenya’s per capita energy consumption in 2019 was about 168 kilowatt-hours, according to the U.N.)</p>

<p>Le Scornet says that stable financing mechanisms are needed to provide stability and reduce actual and perceived project risks. To tackle this challenge, the <a href="https://grmf-eastafrica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility</a>, funded by the European Union and the African Union, was set up in 2012 to cofinance surface studies and drilling programs.</p>



<p>“Support from project partners like the EU, for instance, and the African Development Bank can be instrumental, especially in countries with high debt levels and where competition with alternative projects presents obvious challenges for the development of new geothermal projects,” Le Scornet says.</p>



<p>But not all costs are purely financial. Kenya’s Olkaria project demonstrates one of the social costs. In developing and expanding the project over time, some members of the local Maasai community, a seminomadic pastoralist group, have been removed from their land, says Ben Ole Koissaba, lead consultant for Rarin Consulting Services, which champions for the land rights of Indigenous communities. Relocated people “have been cut off from the rest of the community,” says Koissaba, who is a member of the Maasai. And some of the housing built for them has not been culturally appropriate, he says.</p>



<p>While some of the Maasai consider the displacement an outstanding issue, Kenya’s geothermal exploration isn’t slowing down. By 2025, the country aims to more than double its current production capacity to 2,500 megawatts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronal-rain-sun-space">Coronal rain has been seen splashing on the sun</a></h4>

              
                <p>Plasma rain in the sun’s atmosphere makes a splash when it lands. New observations from the European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter have revealed <a href="https://nam2023.org/press-releases/279-solar-astronomers-discover-shooting-stars-on-the-sun-s-corona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously unseen details</a> of how this coronal rain falls, including bright fireball effects and sudden upward surges in plasma.</p>



<p>“These are the highest resolution images we have ever obtained from the solar corona,” says solar physicist Patrick Antolin of Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He presented the results at the National Astronomy Meeting in Cardiff, Wales, the week of July 3 and in a paper <a href="https://www.aanda.org/component/article?access=doi&amp;doi=10.1051/0004-6361/202346016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be published in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em></a>.</p>





<p>The corona is the sun’s wispy upper atmosphere, the sizzling tangle of plasma and magnetism that is visible during a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2019-total-solar-eclipse-south-america">total eclipse</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/19</em>). When clumps of scorching-hot plasma in the corona suddenly cool, they condense and fall toward the solar surface, just like water droplets in Earth’s atmosphere. This <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plasma-rain-sun-atmosphere-falls-surprising-places">coronal rain</a> has been observed before, but details of its formation and falling were fuzzy (<em>SN: 5/24/18</em>).</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/esas-solar-orbiter-will-be-the-first-spacecraft-to-study-the-suns-polar-zones">2020 launch of Solar Orbiter</a> promised to change that (<em>SN: 2/9/20</em>). The probe is making passes over the sun’s unexplored polar regions, carrying high resolution cameras and other instruments to investigate solar mysteries. In late March 2022, Solar Orbiter made its closest approach to the sun to date, swooping within 49 million kilometers of our star — about a third of the distance between the sun and Earth.</p>



<p>In images from the spacecraft taken during that close encounter, Antolin and colleagues discovered a new feature in the coronal rain. As the plasma raindrops fell, the region immediately below them brightened. The researchers think the brightening came from other plasma below the falling rain getting compressed and heated, similar to the way meteors in Earth’s atmosphere can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-explodes-over-russia">create fireballs</a> just ahead of the falling rocks (<em>SN: 2/15/13</em>).</p>



<p>“This is the first time we’ve seen that kind of compression from the rain falling this clearly,” says Emily Mason, a solar physicist at Predictive Science, a research company based in San Diego, who was not involved in the study. “The resolution just wasn’t there before.”</p>



<p>Antolin and colleagues also saw a rebound and upward flow of material after coronal raindrops smacked onto the chromosphere, the thin layer of plasma that lies between the sun’s visible surface and the corona.</p>



<p>“This rain is as dense as the chromosphere,” Antolin says. “It can fall to the chromosphere and then make a splash.” This sort of splash was predicted in computer simulations but had never been observed on the actual sun before.</p>



<p>On their own, the observations won’t directly solve the biggest solar mysteries, like why the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona">diffuse corona sizzles at millions of degrees</a> Celsius higher than the surface of the sun (<em>SN: 8/20/17</em>). But more observations of the same phenomena can help figure out details of the coronal environment, like how easily its gas compresses, or what its chemical composition is.</p>



<p>“We are not able to send a probe to the inner part of the corona because it’s so hot,” Antolin says. “So we can use these observations as indirect probes of the local environment.”</p>



<p>The observations are “an important litmus test for Solar Orbiter itself,” Mason says. “It’s good to see what Solar Orbiter is capable of.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-air-quality-pollution">Wildfires aren’t going away. Here’s how smoke can affect your health</a></h4>

              
                <p>North America’s summer of smoke may well be a harbinger of what’s to come. As record-breaking wildfires in Canada continue to sweep across the land, smoke has been suffusing the skies for more and more people. Frequent fires like these can mean more smoke inhaled, and over longer periods of time.</p>



<p>What are the health consequences of breathing in this fumy miasma? I asked three experts.</p>



<p>Air pollution exposure scientist Jeffrey Brook’s office at the University of Toronto is roughly 500 kilometers from some of the raging blazes that have engulfed more than 8 million hectares in Canada this year. Even at that distance, the air has been bad, he says, shrouding the city in noxious gasses and tiny particles of burned biomass. “It’s the worst particulate matter air quality I’ve seen in 30 years or more,” Brook says.</p>





<p>When I reach him, he’s on a boat on the eastern end of Lake Ontario. All around, the air is hazy from wildfire smoke; he can just make out the shoreline. Driving there from Toronto, Brook felt like he was moving through a curtain, he says.</p>



<p>Some 800 kilometers south, where atmospheric scientist Katelyn O’Dell works at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., the scene has been less apocalyptic, but it can change abruptly. Some days, you can see and smell smoke in the air, and “the sky doesn’t even look blue,” she says.</p>



<p>From across the continent, at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, environmental epidemiologist Sarah Henderson says those smoky scenes look all too familiar. “We’re no strangers to wildfire smoke,” she says. In previous years, the region has seen extreme episodes driven by fires in the Pacific Northwest.</p>



<p>These three scientists have been studying the health effects of wildfire smoke for years. They talked with me about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">how smoke impacts our health, what questions remain</a> and what researchers might be able to learn from the current fires <em>(SN: 9/18/20)</em>. Our conversations have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why are scientists focusing on wildfire smoke?&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>The wildfire season has been expanding, so it&#8217;s impacting us more throughout the year. [And] wildfire smoke is different than the typical urban smog that has been studied historically.</p>



<p>[That smog], emissions from traffic and industry, has been decreasing due to successful emissions control policies — and those are projected to continue to decrease. Because those are going down and wildfire smoke is going up, it’s really important for us to study wildfire smoke and its impacts on health.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How can wildfire smoke affect people’s health?</h4>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>Wildfire smoke is a really complex form of air pollution. And we have decades of research that tells us exposure to air pollution isn&#8217;t good for us. <strong></strong></p>





<p>What we know at this point is that when smoke is occurring, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-health-risks-air-smoke-west-east-united-states">there are measurable effects</a> in the population almost immediately <em>(SN: 6/17/22)</em>. Respiratory effects, especially for people with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], are the first things to happen. We generally see that these people need more of their rescue medications, meaning that their airways are closing up.</p>



<p>The magnitude of that impact in those populations seems to be larger for wildfire smoke than for other types of air pollution. We [also] see small detriments to cognitive performance.</p>



<p>And then [there’s] quite a bit of evidence around impacts to the developing fetus. There’s risk of preterm birth and reductions in birth weight for infants who are exposed in utero.</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>People will say, “Oh, it&#8217;s natural. It&#8217;s campfire smoke, it&#8217;s OK.” No, it&#8217;s not. [Wildfire smoke] contains some of the same toxicants that we think about all the time as bad ones in air pollution.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s in wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> There are multiple pollutants in wildfire smoke that can impact health, but the one that we&#8217;re typically most concerned with is the fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5. PM 2.5 is a particle in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson:</strong> Those [are] particles that can travel deep into the lungs.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> Wildfire smoke has a lot of gases in it too. Things like formaldehyde, benzene and sometimes ozone.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-air-pollution-ozone-shutdown">Ozone negatively impacts respiratory health</a> <em>(SN: 1/4/21)</em>. It&#8217;s unclear right now if benzene and formaldehyde are often at [dangerous] levels in smoke plumes, but we do know these pollutants at certain levels can negatively impact health from both short-term and long-term exposure.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gauging air quality&nbsp; <strong></strong></h3>



<p>The Air Quality Index, or AQI, ranges from 0 to 500, based on the amount of pollution in the air at a given time. Ground-level ozone, particulate matter (both PM<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;and PM<sub>2.5</sub>), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are the primary parameters considered in the index. Code orange (above a score of 100) is unhealthy for people in sensitive groups. Code red and above (151–500) is unhealthy for everyone.</p>

</div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What questions do researchers still have about the health effects of wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> If you have a wave of wildfire smoke multiple times every summer, how does that affect your health in the long term? It’s a very important question [and] an open area of research right now.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>It&#8217;s a slightly more challenging question to address because you might have a population that&#8217;s exposed for a couple of weeks, at a really high magnitude for one summer, and then for the next three summers, there&#8217;s no smoke and everything&#8217;s fine.</p>



<p>That intermittent episodic nature of exposure might mean that [the longer-term effects of wildfire smoke] are quite different from the more steady types of air pollution that affect our air quality, day in and day out.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re still learning about what that means. We might be seeing kids, if they are exposed very early in life, [with] a lifelong detriment to their lung function.</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>What if you happen to be pregnant and the fetus is at a particularly important part of development? If it’s getting really high [smoke] exposure coupled with stress because the mom’s worried about the high exposure, [could] that alter how certain organs – lungs, brain, heart – develop? We don’t know.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> [Another] open question is how the health impacts of fresh smoke differ from old smoke [<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.0c04497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than three days old</a>]. There are a few reasons [the impacts] might be different, one being chemical changes in the smoke itself — smoke changes as it travels through the atmosphere. Another major factor is the public’s awareness of smoke. If you live close to where the fire is burning, you’re very aware that there is likely smoke. But [people] farther away, might be less aware and maybe take less action to protect their own health.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can we learn from the current wildfires?</h4>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>These fires are impacting a different population than have historically been predominantly studied. A lot of the wildfire and health studies have occurred in the western United States. This event that we&#8217;re experiencing right now [will] hopefully allow us to have a greater understanding of how wildfire smoke might impact people in the eastern states.</p>



<p>There are many factors that may lead to a different health response for those out east compared with those out west, including different baseline disease rates or levels of pre-existing conditions, different responses to smoke, level of outdoor activity, et cetera.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>What we need [are] populations that are resilient to these exposures, populations that know how to take protective measures, and policies that look at how we keep smoke out of the indoor environment to ensure that people are protected when they&#8217;re indoors. All of those types of things are going to allow us to be resilient to the smoke exposures in the decades ahead.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can people do to protect themselves from wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p><strong>Henderson: </strong>[In our current lifestyle], the vast majority of us spend the vast majority of our time inside. If we are effectively reducing smoke in the indoor environment, we are effectively protecting our health for about 90 percent of the time. </p>



<p>We highly recommend that you have some sort of air cleaning device running in at least one room of the home so that you have kind of a smoke-free haven — especially the bedroom because you&#8217;re probably going to be there for at least eight hours of the day.</p>



<p>Then we can look to what happens when you’re outdoors. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">A well-fitted respirator type mask like an N95 or KN95</a> will effectively filter the particles of wildfire smoke out and probably some of the gases as well <em>(SN: 2/12/21)</em>.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell:</strong> &nbsp;It&#8217;s always a good idea to check the local air quality before you undergo any outdoor activity, and then adjust your behavior accordingly. If you really need to be outside, maybe go for a walk instead of a run, and wear a mask if it&#8217;s really bad. And if you&#8217;re in an extra-sensitive group — children, the elderly, people with preexisting conditions — you might choose to stay indoors on days that are especially smoky.</p>



<p>At the local government level, it’s good to have plans in place for when there is smoke. Do schools cancel recess? Do we open clean-air shelters for people who aren&#8217;t able to have clean air in their homes — or maybe don’t have a home — to protect that vulnerable set of the population?</p>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>A key principle we always follow in environmental protection is to set our policies to protect the most vulnerable. It’s always good to be cautious. If you’re healthy, smoke is a little piece of many things in your life that impact your health. But if you’re compromised, maybe you’ve got a respiratory infection or just had a heart attack or some other condition, smoke could really hinder [your] recovery.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How worried should we be about wildfire smoke?&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>Brook: </strong>We should be more worried about climate change. When you look at Canada, we’ve had fire impacts from coast to coast this year. I’ve never seen that. It’s just unprecedented. It&#8217;s a wake-up call. Like, hey folks, you&#8217;ve been hearing that these things are going to happen. And look, they’re happening sooner, they’re happening faster. Look at your air. This is not just bad luck.</p>



<p><strong>O’Dell: </strong>In the western United States and even in parts of Canada, [wildfires] have been increasing over the past several decades due to several factors. In the United States, one [factor is] historical fire suppression tactics, but another [is] anthropogenic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">climate change</a> <em>(SN: 6/9/23). </em>And those increases in fires, and the smoke that they emit, is expected to continue to increase across the coming century.</p>



<p><strong>Henderson:</strong> &nbsp;There are people who live their daily lives in cities that are about as polluted as some of the cities we&#8217;ve seen in eastern North America over the past month. On one hand, humans are quite resilient to air pollution exposure, and on the other hand, air pollution exposure is not good for people. We need to find a balance somewhere in the middle that doesn&#8217;t make people feel panicked, [and] makes them feel empowered to make the best possible decisions for themselves in their health.</p>

<p>The German anesthesiologist <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dBoldt">Joachim Boldt</a> has lost 20 more papers since January 2023, earning him the top spot in our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a>, with 184 retractions. </p>



<p>Boldt, readers may recall, was once one of the leading international figures in perioperative medicine. His work, particularly studies involving the use of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/187846?path=/bmj/346/7900/Feature.full.pdf">fluid management</a> during surgery, helped inform clinical guidelines that, thanks to his misdeeds, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.362.6413.394-a">some experts believe</a> may have put patients at risk for serious harm and even death.</p>



<p>Boldt has vaulted over another anesthesiologist, Yoshitaka Fujii, to take the crown (more on that in a moment) – although one might fairly ask: Why did it take so long?</p>



<span id="more-127491"></span>



<p>The bulk of the recently retracted papers appeared in <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/134"><em>Intensive Care Medicine</em></a>, a European title published by Springer Nature. Since March, the journal has pulled 15 articles by Boldt, whose misdeeds – including but not limited to fabrication of data and lack of ethics approval in his clinical trials – first <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/10/28/top-german-anesthesiologists-cardiac-surgery-paper-retracted-over-very-serious-misrepresentations/">came to light</a> in 2010. Five more came in the journal <em>Chest</em>.</p>



<p>Here’s one<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07133-5"> notice</a>, for “Right ventricular function and cardiac surgery,” which <em>Intensive Care Medicine</em> published in June 1988. (Note that the statement from Justus Liebig University <a href="https://www.bjanaesthesia.org/article/S0007-0912(20)30163-X/pdf">dates to 2020</a>.)</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. A statement by Justus Liebig University (JLU) [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07142-4#ref-CR1">1</a>] on the scientific credibility of articles by Joachim Boldt has recommended that journal editors consider retracting all articles “where Boldt is the responsible author even if there is no obvious indication of falsification”. Given the concerns about the studies performed by Joachim Boldt the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the work reported in this article. J. Boldt has not responded to correspodence [sic] from the Publisher about this retraction. The Publisher was not able to obtain a current email address for T Wollbrück, S. Sonneborn, A. Welters and G Hempelmann.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited seven times, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. The new retracted article with the most citations (27) is “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-023-07142-4">Thrombomodulin in intensive care patients</a>.” Of those, eight came in the years since the Boldt scandal broke, and once came after 2020, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the editor of the journal about the delay. He passed us along to someone else at Springer Nature, who didn’t reply. We eventually got this statement from a spokesperson for the publisher:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors of Intensive Care Medicine and its publisher Springer Nature have been aware of concerns regarding the integrity of the work of Joachim Boldt for some time. When we were first made aware of the concerns we carefully investigated – in line with COPE best practice &#8211; and acted to retract nine articles by Boldt in 2011. A further three articles were retracted in 2020; these were review articles which were deemed to be unreliable as their content relied on articles reporting studies that had been retracted. However, a number of papers by Boldt remained unretracted as our investigations were unconclusive and the allegations could not be confirmed.</p>



<p>Subsequently, the Editors were made aware of a statement by Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen (JLU) recommending the retraction of any article for which Boldt is a responsible author. Upon further assessment, the journals Editors and the Springer Nature Research Integrity Team decided to proceed with the retraction of the remaining articles where Boldt is the responsible author. These retractions are in the process of being completed.</p>



<p>We are committed to maintaining the integrity of the scientific record, and although evidence of fraud cannot be ascertained in all cases, the Editors and Springer Nature considered it prudent to proceed with these retractions and warn readers about the unreliability of this research, in line with the recommendations of Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen (JLU).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We wondered about the journal’s investigation into “unconfirmed allegations” against Boldt and why the letter from JLU would have affected those investigations, but did not receive a reply to that follow-up question.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meanwhile, at this point, we need to make something of an apology. For the last several years, we have listed the number of retractions attributed to Yoshitaka Fujii as 183. (We also included this figure in a <a href="https://nautil.us/how-the-biggest-fabricator-in-science-got-caught-235421/">2015 article for Nautilus</a>.)</p>



<p>That figure came from the list of Fujii’s paper investigators – from the Japanese Society of Anesthesiology in particular – had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/01/15/retraction-record-broken-again-university-report-should-up-fujii-total-to-183/">marked for retraction</a>. But as we know all too well, journals don’t always act, even when asked. More than a decade after that report, and now that the dust has (mostly) settled, we have records of only 172 retractions.</p>



<p>Although Boldt now beats the incorrect 183, and while Fujii was indeed the most-retracted researcher until Boldt’s recent bolus, details are important. We’ve updated our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> accordingly.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/canada-crawford-lake-beginning-anthropocene">Canada’s Crawford Lake could mark the beginning of the Anthropocene</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists are one step closer to defining a new chapter in geology, one in which humans have become the dominant driver of Earth’s climate and environment.</p>



<p>Out of 12 locations around the world, Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada, has been selected as the site that would mark the official beginning of the Anthropocene, a proposed geologic epoch starting in the 1950s, researchers announced at a July 11 news conference during the&nbsp;<a href="https://climate-conference.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Planck Society Conference for a Sustainable Anthropocene</a> in Berlin.</p>





<p>The lake bottom’s sediments hold one of the most precise records of humans’ alteration of Earth, including upticks in plutonium from nuclear weapons testing, ash from burning fossil fuels as well as heavy metals and microplastics.</p>



<p>But the Anthropocene isn’t an official geologic epoch yet. Now, several more committees must approve of the proposed epoch before it can be added to the geologic time scale. Doing so would end the nearly 12,000-year-old Holocene Epoch, which encompasses the rise of humankind since the last ice age.</p>



<p>Scientists first started using the term <em>Anthropocene</em> in the early 2000s to refer to the ongoing time of humans altering the planet on a global scale. Although framed in terms of geology, the Anthropocene lacked a formal geologic definition.</p>



<p>Still, the idea spread. “It exploded so quickly into other disciplines without it being defined,” says earth scientist Simon Turner of University College London. So “that’s what we’ve been trying to do ever since.”</p>



<p>In 2009, the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the scientific group responsible for defining geologic time, convened a committee to characterize the Anthropocene and see whether it deserved a spot on the geologic time scale. Over a decade later, that committee has now chosen Crawford Lake out of the 12 candidate sites as the Anthropocene’s “Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point,” a reference site that shows a change in its rock, ice or other layers to mark the beginning of a new geologic time.</p>



<p>From coral to ice to peat, each of the candidate sites holds a remarkable record of human activity in its layers. Selecting Crawford Lake was “like choosing a favorite child,” says Turner, secretary and a voting member of the committee.</p>



<p>Among the locations, Crawford Lake’s muddy layers have trapped one of the most precise histories of human activity. Each summer, the water’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20530196221149281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pH and warm temperatures cause mineral crystals to form near the top of the water</a>. The crystals fall to the lake’s bottom like snow, where they lay undisturbed. “You get these lovely stripes,” Turner says. “And you can resolve what year [they’re from] pretty much by counting backwards from the surface layer, like a tree ring.”</p>



<p>The layers capture a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-blasts-other-human-activity-signal-new-epoch-anthropocene">radioactivity and other evidence of human activity starting in the early 1950s</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/16</em>).</p>



<p>But not all scientists agree that the Anthropocene began merely 70 years ago, or that it should be defined as a geologic term at all. “Any time you draw a hard line in the geologic record or in any other system, you’re creating a binary —&nbsp;there’s a before and there’s an after,” says paleoecologist Jacquelyn Gill of the University of Maine in Orono. “We know human impacts began well before 1950.”</p>



<p>Retaining an informal&nbsp;and flexible concept, like what’s used now in disciplines beyond geology, might be more beneficial, she adds. “It’s more powerful as a tool in that way,” Gill says, “than it is to try to confine it or constrain it to a narrow definition that then creates confusion about everything that came before.”</p>





<p>Still, attempting to define the Anthropocene in geologic terms underscores humanity’s rapid and intense impact on the planet, Turner says. “We’ve become a geological force.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thermal-cloak-material-temperature">This ‘thermal cloak’ keeps spaces from getting either too hot or cold</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever burned your hands on a car steering wheel, you know how hot the inside of a car can get on a summer day. But a new fabric could one day help cars and other objects stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter.</p>



<p>Researchers created a prototype of the fabric, which <a href="https://cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(23)00008-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acts as a “thermal cloak”</a> that keeps the space underneath it from getting too hot or too cold. The cloak, described in the July 11 <em>Device</em>, doesn’t require an external power source, which could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reflective-paint-could-keep-sunbaked-buildings-cool">reduce energy consumption</a> associated with heating and cooling (<em>SN: 9/28/18)</em>.</p>





<p>Globally, heating and cooling make up <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472101427X#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20HVAC%20consumption%20represents,as%20the%20UE%20or%20Russia." target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 percent of energy use in buildings and 12 percent of total energy consumption</a>. Materials like this thermal cloak could help keep us comfortable during heat waves while reducing carbon dioxide emissions associated with electricity used in temperature control, says Aaswath Raman, an applied physicist at UCLA who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>In the new study, Kehang Cui, an engineer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and colleagues built the cloak using two layers. The outer layer is made of white silica fibers that reflect visible light, coated with hexagonal boron nitride, a ceramic material that reflects ultraviolet light and helps dissipate heat. Together, the silica fibers and boron nitride reflect 96 percent of the sunlight that hits the fabric. At the same time, the outer layer absorbs heat from the surrounding area and emits that energy as infrared light, which also lowers the temperature under the cloak through a process called radiative cooling.</p>



<p>Though the outer layer keeps the space under the cloak cooler for longer than an uncovered area, the cloaked space slowly warms up throughout the day. The inner layer, made of aluminum foil, keeps the space warm at night by trapping some of that heat inside, similar to an insulating survival blanket.</p>



<p>The researchers tested the cloak material’s durability under several extreme conditions. They baked the fabric at 800° Celsius, just about hot enough to melt table salt. They also exposed it to extreme cold by dunking it in liquid nitrogen, subjected it to the same amount of vibration as a rocket launch, doused it in acid and blasted it with fire from a butane torch — all with virtually no changes to the material’s structure or performance. This extreme durability might lend itself to use in spacecraft or extraterrestrial environments, the team says.</p>



<p>To see the fabric in action, Cui and colleagues built a full-size prototype cloak and tested it on an electric car. On a summer day in Shanghai, the cloak kept the car at about 23° C — up to 8 degrees C lower than the outside temperature and 28 degrees C lower than the inside of an uncloaked car. The cloak also kept the car about 5 degrees C warmer than the outside air on a winter night.</p>



<p>The cloak “definitely shows the capability of saving energy, but the next step is that we want to demonstrate it in even larger-scale field tests [such as rooftops] to see the impact on our daily lives,” Cui says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-lauren-schroeder-scientists-to-watch">Lauren Schroeder looks beyond natural selection to rethink human evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lauren Schroeder has loved dinosaurs since age 3 and bones since she was 10. In her second year of university, she started studying the early evolution of the <em>Homo </em>genus and it turned into her Ph.D. Many fossils have taken her breath away, she says, but a 2-million-year-old <em>Homo habilis </em>skull holds such a special place in her heart that it’s tattooed on her forearm.</p>



<p>“I think I can safely say that I&#8217;m doing what I wanted to do,” she says.</p>

<p>As a paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto, Schroeder works to untangle the various processes by which humans have evolved. One such process, natural selection,&nbsp;is adaptive: Changes in an organism’s features make it more suited to its environment. But some changes are not selected for, or even totally random. Despite the existence of “nonadaptive” processes, paleoanthropology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248422001567?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has often attributed</a> evolutionary changes in hominids to adaptation alone.</p>



<p>While a Ph.D. student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, Schroeder questioned the emphasis on natural selection to explain changes seen in the fossil record. “It was very clear that something was missing,” she says. Not much research had considered the role played by nonadaptive processes, such as genetic drift and gene flow.&nbsp;“That was really the big moment for me … these are important questions that haven&#8217;t really been asked. I should try to answer them.”</p>





<p>Since then, her research has suggested that nonadaptive processes play a much bigger role in evolution than previously realized.</p>



<p>“All aspects of Lauren’s research have been consequential for the discipline,” says Benjamin Auerbach, a biological anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. “We’re witnessing maybe a change in the way we talk about human evolution.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of chance</h4>



<p>Schroeder’s research centers around questions of how and why body features in humans (or other animals) — called “morphology” — came to be.</p>



<p>They are hard questions to answer, in part because fossils often don’t contain usable DNA. Paleoanthropologists rely on patterns in the morphology, established theory and statistical analyses to try to understand the evolutionary processes at play. It’s math “all the way through,” Schroeder says —&nbsp;which is good, because she adores math.</p>



<p>Before the math, Schroeder measures the features of the fossils. During her Ph.D. research, she traveled across Africa to scan and analyze fossil <em>Homo </em>skulls dating from 2.8 million years ago until just tens of thousands of years ago. Some features of the skulls showed a strong adaptive signal, including the jaw; that means that early <em>Homo</em> jaw shape probably evolved via natural selection, driven by a changing diet. </p>



<p>But surprisingly, when Schroeder looked at the results for the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724841630152X?casa_token=sK6RMWS3q8UAAAAA:8FlfRoRlTg_7tEoFdQ63zifQXHv_JpzFHDW90IYcBrjVB8_ptd8pA2iEHNTZovoFgwTWbMoJ4Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape of braincases</a> across the <em>Homo </em>genus, genetic drift appeared to be at play, she reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Human Evolution.</em> A nonadaptive process, genetic drift is the loss of genetic variation in a population due to the chance disappearance of certain genes. In other words, the braincase shape evolved just because.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="496" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of a Homo habilis skull on a black background." class="wp-image-3129182" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline-525x383.jpg 525w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline-617x450.jpg 617w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lauren-Schroeder_inline-255x186.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129182">During her Ph.D. work, Lauren Schroeder analyzed this <em>Homo habilis</em> skull and other fossils to better understand how the human skull evolved.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129182">Chip Clark, Smithsonian Institution</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Schroeder also turns to today’s animals to better understand the evolution of our ancestors. Another nonadaptive process — gene flow — occurs when genes spread from one population to another through breeding, including when two species hybridize. Hybrids in the fossil record could thus offer clues to evolutionary processes. But there’s currently no good way to determine whether a fossil represents a hybrid.</p>



<p>Schroeder aims to change that by developing a framework based on morphological patterns in living hybrids. So far she’s focused on the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.21417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skulls of coyote-wolf hybrids</a> (chosen in part because Schroeder loves dogs), and she’s identified traits consistent with other hybrids, she and colleagues reported in 2021 in <em>Journal of Morphology</em>, including a higher incidence of dental and other anomalies.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rewriting narratives</h4>



<p>Schroeder, who grew up in South Africa, remembers noticing as early as her undergraduate years that most of the paleoanthropological research in her country was conducted by foreign researchers. In fact, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248422001567?via%3Dihub#fig5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 5 percent of papers</a> published in the <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em> from 2016 to 2021 were authored by African researchers, Schroeder reported in the journal this past January.</p>



<p>Additionally, “even though most of it is based in Africa, paleoanthropology is so white,” she says. As a Black African woman, “it was such a lonely place, actually, for a long time.” Schroeder has struggled to publish papers, received sexist reviews on papers and experienced instances of blatant racism.</p>



<p>Some things have improved. At American Association of Biological Anthropologists conferences, she used to be able to count the number of Black people on two hands, she says. When she attended this past May, she was one of many. But there is still a long way to go. She credits her mentors for helping her get through the tough early years and the <a href="https://www.blackinbioanth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black in BioAnth Collective</a> for working to transform the field.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not an easy journey getting to where she is, but she&#8217;s there,” says Rebecca Ackermann, Schroeder’s Ph.D. adviser at the University of Cape Town. “And so now the world is her oyster.”</p>



<p>Schroeder recently secured tenure at the University of Toronto. As the first in her family to attend university, it means a lot to her and her parents. “They don’t necessarily get everything I do,” she laughs. But “we’re in disbelief that I’ve gotten here.”</p>

<p>The journal <em>Scientific Reports</em> removed a scientist linked to paper mill activity from its editorial board last year, but didn’t take his name off the web page until last month, after a Retraction Watch-Undark story pointed out his association.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former editorial board member, <a href="https://research.iaun.ac.ir/pd/afrand/">Masoud Afrand</a>, is an assistant professor of engineering at the Islamic Azad University in Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">our story</a>, Alexander Magazinov, a scientific sleuth and software engineer based in Kazakhstan, cited Afrand as an example of researchers seemingly associated with paper mills who manage to get editorial positions at reputable journals. Afrand, he said:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127465"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>was likely part of a paper mill operation for a special issue in Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences, where Afrand was cited over 130 times.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the time our story was published, on June 21, Afrand was listed as an editorial board member for mechanical engineering at <em>Scientific Reports</em>, a Springer Nature title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About a week later, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/#comment-2171802">commenter</a> noted that Afrand was no longer on the website, although he had been in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230620034100/https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors">snapshot</a> of the webpage from June 20 in the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/#comment-2171896">replied</a> that he had emailed the journal about Afrand on May 31, 2022. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Why it should take a dedicated journalist to get things done, is beyond my understanding.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rafal Marszalek, chief editor of <em>Scientific Reports</em>, told us that while Afrand had been listed as an editorial board member on the website, the journal had “parted ways” with him in March 2022. An internal audit earlier that year had uncovered “irregularities” in how Afrand handled papers, and the journal made its decision “after an in-depth investigation following due process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as the recent update to the website, he said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unfortunately, due to an oversight, Masoud was still listed as an Editorial Board Member on the Scientific Reports website for more than a year after his departure. The recent Retraction Watch article brought this error to our attention and we have since removed his name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Afrand has not responded to our request for comment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/quantifying-openness/">Why quantifying Openness matters</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; mission is to transform research communication for the good of science and society. We believe that Open Science is the key. Open Science supports rigor, reproducibility, inclusivity, and efficiency&mdash;and in doing so, results in accelerated progress, stronger research, and increased trust in results. Increasing the prevalence of Open Science is a prerequisite to reaping the full benefits. At PLOS, we work to foster openness through policy, and by creating opportunities for researchers to engage in Open Science practices as part of their everyday experience publishing in our journals.</p>



<p>But we can only succeed in driving Open Science adoption if we understand:</p>



<ol><li>The research communities we serve</li><li>Current norms in those communities</li><li>How Open Science behaviors change over time&mdash;and especially in response to new policies and offerings</li></ol>



<p>Combined with <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">other research activities</a>, <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">Open Science Indicators (OSIs)</a> are an important source of data that help us to develop solutions that better serve PLOS authors, and the research community in general. Read on to learn more about why and how we&rsquo;re measuring Open Science practices more comprehensively and consistently at PLOS.</p>



<h2>What are Open Science Indicators?</h2>



<p>Open Science Indicators are a new source of information on Open Science practices across the published literature. Produced in partnership with DataSeer, they use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp; to identify and measure Open Science practices in all PLOS articles, and in a comparator set of similar Open Access research articles. The dataset begins in January 2019, and is updated quarterly.</p>



<h2>Measuring Openness with Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>PLOS began developing Open Science Indicators in 2021 to meet our own need for better information. We needed a fuller understanding to inform a data-driven strategy that meets our aims to:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>increase adoption of Open Science practices and</li><li>increase evidence of the benefits and effects of these practices.</li></ol>



<p>But until recently, there was no easy way to measure Open Science practices, save from having an expert read every article. And we are not the only ones who need better information on Open Science practices. Research funders, institutions, and policy makers all share the same challenge.</p>



<p>Before initiating OSI we first defined <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889">six guiding principles</a>. While the collective requirements we developed for Open Science Indicators are, so far, unique, much of our approach builds on&nbsp; the work of others: meta-researchers, tool developers, and community-endorsed frameworks. Our inspirations include the FAIR principles, the <a href="https://quest-dashboard.charite.de/">Charite Metrics Dashboard</a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001107">a major piece of meta-research</a> that analyzed different aspects of open science practice in PubMed Central. Even more recently, national efforts such as the French Open Science Monitor and UK Reproducibility Network have, respectively, <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04121339v2">created solutions</a> or <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/2023/06/30/ukrn-2nd-working-paper-open-research-indicators-sector-priorities/">explored requirements</a> for monitoring open research practices to suit their needs.</p>



<p>In shaping our own guiding principles, we felt it was important that Open Science Indicators rely on the publicly available text and metadata included in any research publication, so that the measurements might be applied not just at PLOS, but across any publicly available research article. We wanted to enable comparison across fields, regions, and publication venues in the short term, and to lay the groundwork for a system that might be easily expanded to give a broader view of the whole scientific communications landscape in the future. And of course, we wanted to make the data publicly available to all, for use at PLOS and other organizations.</p>



<h2>Selecting the first Indicators</h2>



<p>PLOS journals support and facilitate a wide range of Open Science practices, so we needed to prioritize which Open Science Indicators to measure first. We selected, to begin with, three practices that are highly relevant to a large percentage of the researchers we serve, and so have high potential for broad adoption: data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each has its own vital role to play in the system of Open Science.</p>



<h3>Data sharing</h3>



<p>Data is the raw output of primary research. Readers rely on raw scientific data to enhance their understanding of published research. Data are key for verification, replication and reanalysis, to inform future investigations, and to inform systematic reviews or meta-analyses.</p>



<p>At PLOS, our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/how-to-prepare-and-share/">pioneering data availability policy</a> requires authors to make the raw data underlying their conclusions accessible (within ethical boundaries) at the time of publication. PLOS data availability policy gives authors several options for sharing their data, depending on what works best for them and their manuscript. At the same time, we appreciate that data repositories are the most efficient and impactful way to share. Indicators help us&nbsp; track progress towards <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/how-to-prepare-and-share/">best practices</a>.</p>



<h3>Code sharing</h3>



<p>Data only mean so much without the context to understand how it was generated and analyzed, and the tools to validate and reproduce the work. Augmenting a research article with Open Code enhances understanding, facilitates reproducibility and reanalysis, promotes trust, and saves other researchers time and effort, leading to a more efficient scientific system overall.</p>



<p>Code sharing is strongly encouraged at all PLOS journals, and is <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/open-code-at-plos-computational-biology/">required at <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Preprints</h3>



<p>Preprints empower researchers to take control of their research communications for more efficient and inclusive sharing. Researchers use preprints to establish priority, broadcast results, seek community feedback, increase readership, and bolster grant, job or tenure applications.</p>



<p>PLOS journals have always welcomed preprints, and since 2018, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/">we&rsquo;ve offered facilitated preprint posting</a> at submission to help make the process even easier for our authors.</p>



<h2>Looking ahead</h2>



<p>Measuring data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting is one step toward understanding the state of Open Science practices today, and charting the course ahead based on researchers&rsquo; real-world behavior. PLOS uses OSIs to guide our decision-making. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Prioritizing which repositories to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data">extend our Accessible Data icon</a> to</li><li>Monitoring the effectiveness of new solutions, such as our integration with EarthArXiv, and <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s code-sharing policy</li><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/#preprints">Understanding the Open Science practices</a> of researchers in different disciplines and regions, helping us to align our systems and policies with their needs, and sharing what we learn more widely&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the future, we&rsquo;ll add additional data points and new Indicators to the OSI dataset, and expand it to include more comparator content. We&rsquo;re also combining the quantitative insights from OSIs with other sources of information, such as published qualitative research, as well as our own <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">novel investigations</a> into different communities and practices. Combining qualitative insights with diverse, responsibly-applied quantitative insights provides a more complete picture of research quality and impact, and aligns with <a href="https://coara.eu/">efforts to reform research assessment</a>.</p>



<p>And we&rsquo;ll continue to make the dataset publicly available for others to read and consult, share, remix, and reuse, for the betterment of science, which ultimately is what Open Science is trying to achieve.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seagrass-chesapeake-bay-ecosystem">This seagrass is taking over the Chesapeake Bay. That’s good and bad news</a></h4>

              
                <p>On the U.S. mid-Atlantic seaboard, efforts to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay over the last 10 years have faced a mysterious challenge — massive booms and busts of the seagrass meadows that provide crucial habitats for juvenile blue crabs, black sea bass and scores of other creatures. Now researchers have uncovered the surprising reasons for these dramatic swings.</p>

<p>A weedy plant that used to lurk only at low levels in the Bay is becoming dominant, dethroning the Bay’s historically predominant eelgrass, says ecologist Chris Patrick of the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences in Gloucester Point. Widgeongrass’s ability to grow like, well, a weed has caused <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220678120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bay’s seagrass meadow to nearly triple in extent</a>, Patrick and colleagues report May 30 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. That was a “big shock to everyone,” he says. But widgeongrass is also more vulnerable than eelgrass to sunlight-blocking water pollution, making it prone to huge crashes.</p>



<p>These findings offer “a weird message of hope,” says VIMS ecologist Marc Hensel. Understanding the ecology of shifting seagrasses offers solutions to better protecting and restoring sea meadows, not just in the Chesapeake Bay but also for many other estuaries and coastal ecosystems.</p>





<p>The study combines aerial surveys of 26,000 hectares of habitat with 40 years of data on nutrient and sediment pollution, seagrass coverage, temperatures, plankton blooms and river flows. These data provide “an almost unprecedented record of submerged aquatic vegetation,” says ecologist and seagrass expert Emmett Duffy of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Md., who was not involved in the study. Particularly important is the researchers’ ability to distinguish between seagrass species, he says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where’s the seagrass?</h3>



<p>In 2019, eelgrass (blue) was the dominant seagrass in the southern parts of Chesapeake Bay (shown in this map), but it once thrived throughout the region. Many of those regions, predominately in the north, are now dominated by widgeongrass (green), which has been expanding rapidly as warming water temperatures shift the seagrass ecosystem.</p>

<p>The extent of the Bay’s eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina)</em> has plunged by more than half since 1991, the team found, despite successful <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seagrass-restoration-project-virginia-ecosystem-rapid-recovery">efforts to restore it</a> in some spots (<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>). Higher water temperatures caused by climate change starve the plant by jacking up its respiration rate to burn more food than can be supplied by photosynthesis.</p>



<p>Conventional ecological wisdom holds that a more heat-tolerant species migrating from warmer southern waters would replace eelgrass. Instead, the big winner for now is wimpy-looking widgeongrass (<em>Ruppia maritima</em>). With hardy seeds, rapid growth rates and an ability to thrive in water about 7 degrees Celsius warmer than the optimal highest temperature for eelgrass (about 20° C), “widgeongrass almost literally has been waiting in the shallows for its opportunity,” Hensel says.</p>



<p>Fueled largely by widgeongrass,&nbsp;the total area of<strong>&nbsp;</strong>seagrass meadows in the Bay&nbsp;leapt from&nbsp;just over&nbsp;15,000 hectares in 1984&nbsp;to a record peak of nearly&nbsp;44,000&nbsp;hectares in 2018. The very thin and branchy leaves of widgeongrass may offer a better habitat than the eelgrass for tiny crustaceans like amphipods and isopods, Patrick suggests. But with its wispy structure and shallower roots, widgeongrass doesn’t provide as much biomass, and thus carbon storage, or as good a habitat for crabs and fish as taller, more luxuriant eelgrass does, says Duffy, who has dubbed eelgrass the “Serengeti of the sea.”</p>



<p>To some extent though, widgeongrass “is making up for the loss of the eelgrass,” Duffy says. To the researchers struggling to restore the Bay’s vegetation, the expansion of widgeongrass qualifies as a win. “When environmental conditions change, species that were always there may step up, change their roles, and do something really positive for the Bay,” Patrick says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Seagrass swings</h3>



<p>Over the past four decades, warming temperatures have shifted the balance of seagrass species in Chesapeake Bay. Eelgrass (blue) has subsided while widgeongrass (green) has exploded. That surge drove total seagrass meadows (black) to nearly triple in area between 1984 and 2018. But in 2019, the meadows suffered the largest known crash when nutrient pollution wiped out about half of the widgeongrass.</p>

<p>These positives come with a big caution, though. Widgeongrass habitats are far less stable than their eelgrass predecessors. The largest recorded dieback of seagrass meadows in Chesapeake Bay history occurred in 2019, when half of the widgeongrass — about 9,000 hectares — vanished. Heavy springtime rains flushed massive amounts of nutrients and sediment into the Bay, causing algal blooms that blocked sunlight from reaching the plants’ short springtime leaves, the team found. The taller leaves of eelgrass, in contrast, reach closer to the surface, making that species less vulnerable to poor water quality conditions.</p>



<p>Similar shifts to more unstable and potentially less productive aquatic ecosystems are occurring all around the world, from Tampa Bay in Florida to the English Channel, as human influences and climate change enable weedy, more ephemeral plants to increase at the expense of the old growth, Duffy says. But the new study suggests that careful monitoring that identifies the individual species of plants, not just the total area of vegetation, then reducing the nutrient and sediment runoff reaching the most susceptible areas, may help mitigate the harm.</p>



<p>In the Chesapeake, that means targeting agricultural pollution flowing into the Bay from the Choptank River and in the Tangier Sound. While the new weedier species may not be as good as the original plants, “if we can get the right combination of environmental conditions, we can restore mature, functioning seagrass meadows in one or two decades,” Patrick says. “You can’t do that with any other ecosystem.”</p>

<p><strong>Good (for hyperkinesis) to the last drop </strong>–<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavioral-sciences-127"><em>Science News, </em>July 14, 1973</a> </p>



<p>[Hyperactive] children are sometimes given amphetamines to calm them down.… [A researcher] took 11 such children off medication and gave them one cup of coffee at breakfast and lunch…. Teachers and parents rated the children as less hyperactive during the three-week period they were getting coffee instead of amphetamines.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder affects about 6 million U.S. children. Most medical professionals recommend managing symptoms with talk therapy and stimulant medications. For people with ADHD, stimulants boost levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain to improve <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-brain-differences-seen-between-girls-boys-adhd">impulse control, focus and working memory</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/17</em>). C­affeine also boosts dopa­mine, but evidence that coffee or other caffeinated foods relieve ADHD symptoms is sparse and inconsistent. </p>



<p>A few <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700297/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies in children with ADHD</a> hint that caffeine <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70037-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improves attention</a> and impulse control compared with no treatment, while other studies suggest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70037-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the opposite</a>. Pediatricians generally advise against giving kids caffeine due to its effect on sleep.</p>

<p>A journal for conference proceedings which published a duplicate article has updated the later version, after originally telling the researcher who noticed the duplication that the articles were different enough to warrant publishing both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, titled “Production and storage of polarized H2, D2, and HD molecules,” was published twice in the journal <em>Proceedings of Science</em>, in <a href="https://pos.sissa.it/324/033">2018</a> and in <a href="https://pos.sissa.it/346/099">2019</a>. The first version represented proceedings from a talk given at the 2017 XVII International Workshop on Polarized Sources, Targets &amp; Polarimetry in Kaist, South Korea; the second was from the 23rd International Spin Physics Symposium in Ferrara, Italy, held in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The later version has minor differences from the first, including more technical details about the study’s methods.</p>



<p><em>PoS</em>, which is run by the International School for Advanced Studies based in Trieste, Italy, functions as a repository for various conference proceedings. It is run by a small staff, and each submission is reviewed by an individual conference’s editorial board.</p>



<p>A researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, contacted <em>PoS</em> after coming across the two nearly identical versions of “Production and storage of polarized H2, D2, and HD molecules.” A journal representative first told the researcher that the journal would investigate the situation, then that “the contributions differ sufficiently in order to warrant both their publication,” according to an email seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-127412"></span>



<p>“Shocked and flabbergasted” by this response, the researcher contacted Retraction Watch about the duplication and the journal’s decision to keep both articles published. The researcher told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Proceedings of Science denied the fact that a gross plagiarism was published in their journal and actually found it to be “sufficiently different”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to an email from Retraction Watch, Ralf Engels, the first author of the article, wrote that there was a simple explanation for the duplication. He said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Both publications are proceedings of conference contributions. When I gave the corresponding talk on the first conference, I was asked to give the same talk at another conference too. For both conferences should write a proceeding and, thus, both proceedings are very similar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gabriella Furlan, a spokesperson for <em>PoS</em>, told us that the original complaint prompted the journal to review the journal’s policies, and eventually to begin working with the authors to update the second version of the article. This decision, Furlan said, was made shortly before we contacted them. She said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When the researcher raised concerns about the duplication of content, we conducted a thorough investigation into the matter and contacted the conference editors asking to carefully compare the two articles and analyze their content and structure. As a result, we acknowledge the lack of citation and therefore we are in the process of asking the author to revise the second contribution to include a precise reference to the first. In addition to it, since transparency is another PoS core value, we are asking them to add a description of the modifications introduced in the second contribution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Committee on Publication Ethics does not have formal guidelines for published conference proceedings, including regarding duplications. In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for COPE said there is currently a working group addressing this issue. A comment from a September 2022 COPE forum about<a href="https://publicationethics.org/resources/forum-discussions/ethical-aspects-conference-proceedings"> ethical aspects of conference proceedings</a>, which does not represent official COPE guidance, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sometimes the same or very similar papers can be published in proceedings from multiple conferences which is counter to usual expectations of publication ethics (duplicate-redundant publication) in journals more broadly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the absence of formal guidelines, <em>PoS</em> “has adopted an inclusive approach,” Furlan said.</p>



<p>Engels said he wasn’t aware the proceedings would be published in the same journal. At one point, he told us he had decided to request the retraction of the first version, but then said he would instead edit the second version of the article to cite the first and offer an explanation for the changes, as Furlan suggested.</p>



<p><em>PoS</em> said that in response to the researcher’s complaint, they had also decided to review their policies on duplicate publications from conference proceedings. <em>PoS</em> said they did not respond to the researcher in more detail or mention their intentions to review their policies because they decided to conduct this review shortly after sending their brief reply to the researcher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pdf of the 2019 version of the article now cites the earlier version and includes a note which reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The corresponding talk was also given at the PSTP2017 conference in Kaist, South Korea. Nevertheless, this proceeding includes recent developments and more technical details in subsection 2.1.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>PoS</em> did not indicate that the first version of the article would refer to the second version in any way. Instead, they said, “it is essential that the second publication refer to the first one, as this ensures that the reader is informed about the main differences.” The first version of the article remains unchanged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither chairperson of the two conferences’ editorial boards have responded to an email from Retraction Watch.The lack of formal guidance around conference proceedings has contributed to the proliferation of not only duplicated papers, but low-quality and nonsensical publications. Retraction Watch<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/15/plague-of-anomalies-in-conference-proceedings-hint-at-systemic-issues/"> previously reported</a> on hundreds of proceedings from conferences put on by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers which show signs of plagiarism, citation fraud, and other misconduct.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-apex-predator-prey">This ancient, Lovecraftian apex predator chased and pierced soft prey</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the earliest apex predators, and perhaps the freakiest to ever haunt the sea, may have also been a delicate eater.</p>



<p>For decades, paleontologists have assumed that the long-extinct <em>Anomalocaris canadensis</em> — roughly translated as “the abnormal shrimp from Canada” — used two spiny appendages on its face to grab hard trilobites off the seafloor and crush and eat them. But a new analysis suggests the bizarre hunter may not have been up to the task. Instead, <em>A. canadensis</em> may have <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0638" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swiftly hunted soft prey</a> in the water, researchers report in the July 12 <em>Proceedings of the</em> <em>Royal Society B.</em></p>





<p>“These were the orcas … the great whites of the time,” says paleontologist Jakob Vinther of the University of Bristol in England, who was not involved in the study. <em>A. canadensis</em> was clearly adapted to be a top predator, he says, though it seems trilobites might have been too tough.</p>



<p><em>A. canadensis </em>reigned roughly 500 million years ago. With a body as long as a housecat, it was among the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-animals-have-bulked-ancient-eras">largest creatures</a> of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites">Cambrian period</a> (<em>SN: 2/19/15; SN: 4/24/19</em>). Some researchers had suggested that it could have preyed upon another iconic Cambrian critter — the trilobite. Over the years, scads of fossilized injured trilobites have been unearthed, suggesting something had attacked them.</p>



<p>But paleobiologist Russell Bicknell of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City had reservations. Trilobite exoskeletons were hard and thick, and no one had yet presented evidence that <em>A. canadensis</em> could break them.</p>



<p>So Bicknell and colleagues compared the flexible appendages to those of some modern arthropods and tested the primitive appendages’ toughness, range of motion and optimal swimming position via computer simulations.</p>

<p>The ancient spiky limbs would have been effective at grabbing prey, much like those of today’s whip spiders, the researchers conclude. But the extremities were probably too delicate to attack well-armored prey. Additionally, <em>A. canadensis</em> would have moved most efficiently when its appendages were outstretched in front, like Superman’s arms in flight, the team found.</p>



<p>Taken together, the results suggest that<em> A. canadensis</em> was best suited for chasing soft creatures swimming through the water and snagging them in its spiky clutches, Bicknell says. “That&#8217;s going to absolutely pincushion something soft and squishy.” </p>



<p>The findings also imply that even the earliest predators may have been specialized hunters, says evolutionary biologist Joanna Wolfe of Harvard University, who was not involved in the study. “These were complicated ecosystems, even though they&#8217;re really ancient.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tear-resistant-rubber-tough-tires">Tear-resistant rubbery materials could pave the way for tougher tires</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new material design could reduce pollution where the rubber meets the road.</p>



<p>Strategically <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding weak points along microscopic chains called polymers</a> actually makes them harder to tear, researchers report in the June 23 <em>Science</em>. Because polymers are used in car tires, the findings could help reduce plastic pollution as tires wear down over time.</p>



<p>When tires scrape against the road, they drop <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/car-tires-and-brake-pads-produce-harmful-microplastics">tiny particles</a> of rubber and plastic polymers, which pollute waterways and contaminate the air (<em>SN: 11/12/18</em>). Every year, tires release an estimated <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/14/10/1265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 million metric tons</a> of these microplastics into the environment. Stronger polymers that break apart less easily could limit the amount of particles shed annually.</p>





<p>To make such tough materials, Stephen Craig, a chemist at Duke University, and colleagues added molecules called cross-linkers to the polymers. These cross-linkers connected jumbled-up polymer chains to their many neighbors, and they were specifically designed to break apart easily. At the microscopic scale, the polymers act like a tangle of spaghetti strands with the cross-linkers holding them all together and helping them retain their shape, says Craig’s collaborator Shu Wang, a chemist at MIT.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="A rubbery plastic with weak spots tears slower than with tough ones | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmsznnE92w8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A rubbery plastic polymer with weak cross-linkers, shown on the left, requires more stretching force to tear than a similar polymer with stronger cross-linkers, shown on the right. Adding the weak cross-linkers to rubber could lead to tougher car tires.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the team stretched the polymer spaghetti, the individual cross-linkers broke easily, as expected. But the bulk material required more force to rip than they expected.</p>



<p>The secret to the increased toughness lies in the path the tear has to take, Craig says. The tear propagates through the easy-to-break cross-linkers rather than through the tougher polymer strands. Each broken connection follows the path of least resistance but dodging the long polymer strands means breaking many cross-linkers, which requires more stretching force overall.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time researchers have used weak connectors to make polymers stronger. But unlike in similar materials, the increased toughness doesn’t come at the expense of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1967.0160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other beneficial properties like stiffness</a>.</p>



<p>Craig says he hopes the findings will help extend the lifetimes of car tires and plastics, potentially limiting annual microplastic pollution.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780525657170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fires in the Dark</a><br><em>Kay Redfield Jamison<br>Knopf, $30</em></p>



<p>Mentally and spiritually devastated after surviving World War I’s combat horrors, British poet Siegfried Sassoon was treated for emotional wounds at a military hospital. He wrote a poem for his psychotherapist that included these lines: <br><br><em>Fires in the dark you build; tall quivering flames<br>In the huge midnight forest of the unknown</em></p>



<p>Kay Redfield Jamison takes the title of her new book, <em>Fires in the Dark</em>, from Sassoon’s vivid image of how medical psychologist, physician and anthropologist W.H.R. Rivers tended to his psychological war wounds. Jamison uses writings by both men to explore Sassoon’s therapeutic relationship with Rivers. Their story forms part of a deeper probe into how psychological pain can be healed and what it takes to be a great healer. Jamison writes movingly about topics ranging from the workings of ancient Greek healing temples to the tribulations of World War I nurses facing the limits of healing soldiers’ ravaged bodies and minds.</p>





<p>Jamison, a psychiatrist herself, has previously written about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pushing-mood-swings">her personal experience with bipolar disorder</a>, which informs this literary journey into healing (<em>SN: 4/8/00, p. 232</em>).</p>



<p>Since the dawn of humankind, certain individuals — who combine compelling personalities, a stout character and superior people skills — have stood out as healers of what Jamison has previously described as “unquiet minds.”</p>



<p>Effective healers accompany sufferers on a journey toward wellness, she writes. Healing tools include the deft use of suggestion, confession, memory, ritual and medicines. Healers find ways to provide consolation and hope, enabling their wounded charges to engage with meaningful work and find purpose in life.</p>



<p>That theme reverberates in Jamison’s account of how Rivers treated Sassoon, whose war reactions might today be diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder. As an anthropologist, Rivers had learned about and witnessed healing rituals and supernatural beliefs of different cultures. He had written that “psycho-therapeutics would seem to be the oldest branch of medicine.”</p>



<p>Rivers struck colleagues and those he treated as forceful but caring, demanding but sympathetic. Sassoon wrote that he liked and trusted Rivers within minutes of meeting him. After listening to Sassoon relate his traumatic war experiences, Rivers focused on the soldier’s memory and imagination as key healing elements.</p>



<p>Rivers encouraged Sassoon to use poetry to memorialize friends and soldiers he had commanded but who had not survived. As verses of remembrance and grief accumulated, Sassoon achieved a measure of control over the war’s terror and futility. Feeling a sense of guilt and responsibility for soldiers still fighting, Sassoon returned to the war.</p>



<p>Psychotherapy as practiced by Rivers had roots in the powers of suggestion wielded millennia earlier by priests and sorcerers, Jamison writes. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks, for example, called on priest-physicians who performed early types of surgery, chanted against disease-causing spirits and used magic spells to amplify patients’ responses to medicinal potions.</p>



<p>Jamison includes a fascinating description of ancient Greek healing temples run by followers of Asclepius, the god of medicine. In settings designed to be peaceful refuges, individuals with mental maladies received a special herbal ointment made from imported ingredients. Sufferers were encouraged to enter meditative or hypnotic states and to tell their dreams to temple healers. Dream content guided treatment recommendations.</p>



<p>Therapists today practice a range of purely secular techniques, though they still hark back to the days of Asclepius, Jamison says. Scientifically supported approaches rest on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/questions-couch">a time-tested need for therapists to gain clients’ trust</a> and nurture self-understanding and hope for improvement (<em>SN: 11/5/05, p. 299</em>). That’s truer than ever in an era characterized by the well-funded promotion of medications and brain technologies over mere “talk” as keys to vanquishing mental problems.</p>



<p>As recently as the 20th century, Jamison writes, mental health clinicians emphasized general features of psychotherapy that promote healing. Psychiatrist and psychologist Jerome Frank, for instance, influentially argued in a 1961 book that any successful form of psychotherapy counteracts the demoralization of those who experience the world as chaotic.</p>





<p>Jamison also delves into examples of the healing powers of music, art, drama and public rituals of remembrance. She includes the poignant story of how, thanks to an Anglican army chaplain, remains of the Unknown Warrior came to be buried at Westminster Abbey in 1920 in a ceremony that lessened the postwar grief of people across Britain. Healers often find it difficult to untangle why their efforts sometimes light fires in the dark and other times fizzle out. Jamison’s stories of healing outline a process that’s still emerging from Sassoon’s huge midnight forest of the unknown.</p>

<p>Last month, a millipede expert in Denmark received an email notifying him that one of his publications had been mentioned in <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202306.1339/v1">a new </a>manuscript on <em>Preprints.org</em>. But when the researcher, <a href="https://snm.ku.dk/english/staffsnm/staff/?pure=en/persons/52118">Henrik Enghoff</a>, downloaded the paper, he learned that it cited his work for something off-topic.</p>



<p>Stranger still, the authors of the now-withdrawn preprint, a group of researchers in China and Africa, also referenced two papers by Enghoff that he knew he hadn&#8217;t written. It turned out they didn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had anything like this happen before,&#8221; Enghoff, a professor at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, in Copenhagen, told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-127450"></span>



<p>Flabbergasted, Enghoff reached out to <a href="https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/201051">David Richard Nash</a> at the University of Copenhagen. A few months prior, Nash had been experimenting with <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT</a>, an artificial-intelligence chatbot, to see if it could be used to find scientific literature. He asked the bot to provide him with recent references on the butterfly species he works with. &#8220;It came back with 10 plausible-looking papers,” only one of which existed, Nash told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>After learning of Enghoff&#8217;s case, Nash emailed <em>Preprints.org</em>, a free preprint server owned by the scientific publisher <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/">MDPI</a>. He explained that he had looked up five random references in the preprint and found that all of them were fictitious. He also hinted that generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT could have been at work, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I suggest that you contact the authors directly and ask for an explanation (and hopefully a retraction and apology to the affected “authors” of these fake references), and also review your policies regarding accepting AI-generated textxs [sic] and references.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In correspondence shared with Retraction Watch, Lloyd Shu, preprints editor at MDPI, apologized for &#8220;the problems caused by this preprint&#8221; and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We will withdraw it immediately and add the authors of this preprint to our blacklist.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Shu nor the preprint authors responded to our requests for comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ioana Craciun, scientific officer at MDPI, confirmed that <em>Preprints.org</em> had “taken down a preprint that appears to have been generated using AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.preprints.org/about"><em>Preprints.org</em></a>’s website:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All preprints undergo a short screening before being uploaded online. This process takes less than 24 hours in most cases. Screening includes checks for basic scientific content, author background, and compliance with ethical standards. It is carried out by the Preprints.org staff, with the support of active researchers and the Preprints.org advisory board.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Craciun explained that, because preprints do not undergo peer review, “it may be more likely for AI-generated content to be posted on preprint servers without detection.”</p>



<p>She added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This case serves as a signal for us. It is not only a challenge for Preprints.org, but for all preprint servers, publishers, universities, and the scientific community as a whole. We will review our screening process to identify areas for improvement. While we can pay attention to the extremely low similarity rate of AI-generated content, we cannot rely solely on that. We hope that more powerful tools will be developed to assist in the detection of AI-generated content, and closer inspection of references may be necessary, as demonstrated in this case.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the title of the withdrawn preprint, &#8220;From Beneficial Arthropods to Soil-Dwelling Organisms: A Review on Millipedes,&#8221; is somewhat strange, its abstract appears cogent. (<em>Preprints.org</em> has removed the manuscript, but we have made it available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mawcha-et-al-2023.pdf">here</a>.) The main text is suspicious in places, however, including broken sentences such as these:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Another study by Enghoff [32] carried out on the distribution of millipedes in Southeast Asia, is known to have high levels of species richness and endemism. The distribution and ecology of millipedes and other arthropods, and notes that millipedes are found on all continents except Antarctica [48]. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;If it had gone into a journal, I would definitely be very worried,&#8221; Nash said. &#8220;Going onto a preprint server, I have to admit that slightly confirms some of my prejudice against preprint servers.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Note: The interview with Enghoff was conducted in Danish and translated by the writer, a native speaker.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rats-wind-antennae-whiskers-eyes">Rats sense the wind with antennae-like whiskers above their eyes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many rodents use whiskers to feel their way around their world. But rats appear to take this one step further, using special, antennae-like whiskers above their eyes to sense subtle air movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These long, thin hairs <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may help the rats detect the movements of predators or prey</a> in dark, cramped environments, researchers report July 6 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many studies of rodents have focused on the snout whiskers, says Ann Clemens, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh. But “there are a plethora of whiskers beyond the snout, on other parts of the face and the body.”</p>





<p>While working together on a research course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., Clemens and her colleagues noticed that some of the whiskers above rats’ eyes were particularly long and fine. The researchers wondered if these prominent, exposed hairs, known as supraorbital whiskers, could be used to detect wind.</p>



<p>“Wind is an important carrier of information about the environment in the form of odors, humidity and airflow, but has been barely studied by neuroscience,” says Matias Mugnaini, a neuroscientist at the Leloir Institute in Buenos Aires.</p>



<p>Mugnaini, Clemens and their colleagues compared how all the whiskers on rats’ heads behaved under different wind conditions. Supraorbital whiskers waggle more wildly under light breezes than other whisker types, they found. These light breezes are thought to more closely mimic typical air movement levels in the natural environment than strong winds.</p>



<p>High-powered X-rays showed that where a supraorbital whisker follicle meets a nerve, nerve cell projections are concentrated in a more circular structure than in other whiskers. So these whiskers may be highly sensitive to movement from many different directions, as you might see from the pushing action from wind, the researchers say.</p>

Mugnaini <em>et al</em>/<em>PLOS Biology</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1600716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous research</a> showed that trimming rats’ facial whiskers reduces the rodents’ ability to sense wind. But the new study suggests the whiskers above the eyes in particular are specialized, wind-sensing structures.&nbsp;In total darkness, the rats regularly turned toward where wind was blowing from, but when the team numbed the supraorbital whiskers with lidocaine, the rats turned less frequently.</p>



<p>“Our findings show that not all whiskers on an animal operate in the same way,” Clemens says.</p>



<p>Seals also have supraorbital whiskers that sense underwater flow patterns, Mugnaini says. Rats may use their wind-sensing whiskers to pick up the movements of predators or prey in the dark, the team suggests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It could be that an incoming animal is sensed through a subtle change in airflow,” Clemens says. “The rat would detect this and escape in time or attack their meal.”</p>



<p>It’s possible the whiskers could have multiple functions, says Mehdi Adibi, a neuroscientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the research. The hairs might detect vibrations from sound waves, for example, and could still play an important role helping rats navigate their surroundings using touch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-round-new-measurement-matter-physics">Electrons are extremely round, a new measurement confirms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrons are really, really round.</p>



<p>A new measurement <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg4084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirms the subatomic particle’s spherical shape</a> to a record level of exactness, physicists report in the July 7 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That near-perfect roundness deepens the mystery behind how the universe came to be filled with matter as opposed to its counterpart, antimatter. Any asymmetry in the electron’s shape, namely the distribution of the particle’s electric charge, would point to a related asymmetry in the laws of nature, one that could explain this feature of the cosmos.</p>





<p>The measurement — of a property known in physicist-speak as the electric dipole moment of the electron — is twice as precise as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-shape-round-standard-model-physics">previous best measurement</a> of the electron’s shape (<em>SN: 10/17/18</em>).</p>



<p>“I don’t think Guinness tracks this, but if they did, we’d have a new world record,” says physicist Tanya Roussy of the University of Colorado Boulder. The new measurement is so precise that, if an electron were the size of Earth, any asymmetry in its shape would have to be on a scale smaller than an atom.</p>



<p>To gauge the particle’s shape, Roussy and colleagues looked at whether electrons pivoted in an electric field. If electrons weren’t round but slightly egg-shaped, an electric field would exert a torque on them, much as gravity topples an egg standing on its end.</p>



<p>To see that torque, the team looked for changes in the energy levels of electrically charged molecules of hafnium fluoride. Any torque on the electrons would give the molecules different energy levels depending on which direction the “egg” was oriented relative to an electric field. The researchers found no difference in the molecules’ energy levels, confirming the electron’s roundness.</p>



<p>At their most basic level, electrons are pointlike particles, without a definite size and shape. But in quantum field theory, electrons can be thought of as surrounded by temporary “virtual” particles that pop in and out of existence, giving each electron a spherical halo of electric charge. If that halo were found to be just slightly egg-shaped, that could point to how the universe became lopsided toward matter.</p>



<p>The Big Bang should have created matter and antimatter in equal parts — the two are mirror images of one another, with opposite electric charges. But matter in our universe is common while antimatter is scarce. Theoretical physicists have suggested that the existence of certain subatomic particles could have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">tipped the balance toward matter</a> (<em>SN: 9/22/22</em>). If those particles exist, they would also transiently appear and disappear around the electron, in such a way as to make it oblong.</p>



<p>Such particles would be so massive, and would therefore require so much energy to produce, that they would not be discoverable even at the world’s biggest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva. That makes sensitive studies of the electron’s roundness an important test for particle physicists. And such experiments are poised to improve further, testing for particles of even larger masses, says physicist David DeMille of the University of Chicago, one of the scientists behind the previous best measurement of the electron’s roundness.</p>



<p>For now, the new result shows no trace of any hidden particles, leaving unsolved the mystery of how matter gained the upper hand. And that, DeMille says, “leaves us with the question of what is out there.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-affirmative-action-ban-future">California’s long-standing affirmative action ban hints at what’s to come</a></h4>

              
                <p>Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a half-century of precedent and made it illegal for public and private universities and colleges to consider race in student admissions. The decision comes at a time when the nation is rapidly diversifying, with less than half of children under age 15 identifying as white.</p>



<p>No one can know for sure how the ending of affirmative action will ultimately alter these schools’ racial compositions. But insights from California, which banned race-based admissions at its public universities in the late 1990s, are suggestive.</p>





<p>Immediately following the ban, the percentage of Black, Hispanic and Native American students attending selective colleges in the state plummeted, research shows. With the introduction of race-neutral policies aimed at capturing a similar population of underrepresented students a few years later, those numbers rebounded somewhat, but remain far lower than previous levels.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke with labor economist Zachary Bleemer of Princeton University, who has spent years studying what happened in California. “I think [California’s affirmative action ban] is the closest thing we’ve got to a reasonable sort of microcosm for what is about to happen nationally,” he says.</p>



<p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How has affirmative action influenced the college-admissions process over time?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: Affirmative action has gone through two primary iterations in the United States. From when it started in the late 1960s through the early 2000s, affirmative action was generally a point-based admissions policy that provided an immediate and directed admissions advantage to Black, Hispanic and Native American students.</p>



<p>Imagine that a university has some point-based admissions policy: Take SAT scores plus GPA times a thousand, plus 500 points for extracurriculars, 300 points for leadership activities and 300 points for Black, Hispanic and Native American students. It was just extra points for students from minority backgrounds. It has tended to target Black, Hispanic and Native American students though it has also targeted, at various points, Filipino and other Southeast Asian students.</p>



<p>Then point-based affirmative action policies became unconstitutional in 2003. Since then, race is something that admissions readers pay attention to as they are going through undergraduate applications, providing admissions advantages.</p>



<p>It’s worth emphasizing that in both periods, affirmative action [effects] could be really big. There might have been students with a very similar application. If they were white, they would have almost no chance of getting into a university, whereas if they were Black, they would have been basically guaranteed admission. Some people think of affirmative action as a light-touch policy, but it’s not. It provides very substantial admissions advantages in many cases on the basis of race.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Affirmative action has long generated controversy. Why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: I think there are two primary public criticisms of affirmative action. The first is a question of fairness. People think that it’s unfair to provide admissions advantages based on a born characteristic of young people.</p>





<p>I think it’s primarily for that reason that even in California, a liberal state, when affirmative action was on the ballot in 1996, it lost by 10 points. And when it was back on the ballot in 2020, it lost by 14 points. And it seems to have lost among Hispanic voters, a group that benefits from affirmative action. So this is a deeply publicly unpopular policy.</p>



<p>The second criticism is the concern that affirmative action may not actually benefit the people it’s supposed to benefit. This “mismatch hypothesis” is the idea that, even if you give Black and Hispanic students access to more selective universities, they are going to struggle. They’re not going to be able to compete with their peers in challenging courses. They may have a difficult time getting into selective college majors. They may be more likely to drop out.</p>



<p>As an economist, I was very interested in knowing if this was true on average, whether affirmative action did benefit or even generate costs on average for the Black and Hispanic students it targeted.</p>



<p>The quick and dirty is that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/137/1/115/6360982?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mismatch hypothesis is not true on average</a>. Black and Hispanic students really do derive very substantial advantages from more selective university enrollments. That includes increases in degree attainment, [including] STEM degree attainment, and higher wages through people’s 20s and 30s.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What happened in California after affirmative action ended at its public universities?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: California was this really interesting natural experiment. There were a bunch of kids who wouldn’t typically have been admitted to selective universities who were admitted because of affirmative action. And then there were the kids who abruptly lost access to those universities when the state of California banned affirmative action in 1998. What happened to the kids who turned 18 one year too late to take advantage of the state’s former policies?</p>



<p>In my research, I found three main things. The first is that affirmative action bans lead to this cascade of Black and Hispanic students into less-selective universities, with the largest enrollment declines in the most selective schools. This then leads to long-term negative outcomes for Black and Hispanic students in terms of lower graduation rates and lost wages. The third finding is that this decline in Black and Hispanic students’ outcomes isn’t met by equal gains for the white and Asian students who replace them.</p>



<p>Every time a selective university goes out of its way to admit lower-testing but disadvantaged students [through affirmative action], that low-testing student seems to derive substantially above average gains from access to the school.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Are there race-neutral alternatives to recruiting diverse college students that work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: The most popular of these policies, known as top percent policies, guarantee admission to some number of students coming from the top of every high school in a given state. Top percent policies have been implemented in four states: California, Texas, Florida and Georgia. The original policy in California was the top 4 percent of students. That policy got those students into all the campuses in the University of California system other than UC Berkeley or UCLA.</p>



<p>At really good high schools, the top 4 percent of students could have already gotten into, say, UC Davis or UC Irvine. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272300021X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy doesn’t do very much at those schools</a>. At the lowest-preparation high schools in California — where even the valedictorian would have had a hard time getting into Irvine [or elsewhere] absent this policy — they matter a lot.</p>



<p>These policies tended to increase Black and Hispanic enrollment at UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara, by about 7 or 8 percent. But, for context, affirmative action increased Black and Hispanic enrollment across the University of California system by 20 percent. Affirmative action directly targets students on the basis of race. With top percent policies, many of the top 4 percent students aren’t Black or Hispanic. So a lot of the kids who are pulled into the universities are not on average diversifying those campuses.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Would replacing race-based affirmative action policies with class-based policies help retain student diversity?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: Targeting students on the basis of income has a very small effect on the racial composition of universities. In the same way, race-based affirmative action hardly increases lower income enrollment.</p>



<p>Think about who are the lower income students on the margin of admission to a selective university — the kids who, if you were to give them a bump, would just clear the bar. The low income students with high enough test scores to make it into these selective universities are mostly not Black or Hispanic.</p>



<p>It really depends on what your goal is. If your goal is racial diversity, class-based affirmative action won’t give that to you. But if your goal is class diversity, class-based affirmative action will deliver that.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Another race-based alternative to affirmative action is holistic review. What’s that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: Rather than having a point-based scheme that admits all the students with the highest point at some threshold and rejects all the students with the fewest points, holistic review allows a lot more discretion to admissions counselors.</p>



<p>Counselors can contextualize the information, such as giving preference to a student with low test scores from a low-income background. In holistic review, students might be admitted because of their promise, not because of their explicit high level of preparation.</p>



<p>I found that campuses [in California] that implemented holistic review saw Black and Hispanic enrollment increases by 7 percent. Remember, affirmative action increased enrollment by 20 percent, so this is smaller but still meaningful.</p>



<p>Still, if the goal is to increase Black, Native American and Hispanic enrollment, race-based affirmative action is much more impactful than the race-neutral alternatives that universities have implemented as replacements. If your goal is racial diversity, nothing does that as well as explicit race-based targeting.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">Extending Accessible Data to more articles, repositories, and outputs</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>In March 2022, with support from the Wellcome Trust, we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">launched</a> an experimental &ldquo;Accessible Data&rdquo; feature designed to increase research data sharing and reuse. Having observed some interesting preliminary results, we&rsquo;re extending &ndash; and extending the scope of &ndash; our &ldquo;Accessible Data&rdquo; experiment.</p>



<h2>What are we trying to achieve in the next phase of the Accessible Data experiment?</h2>



<p>We began the Accessible Data experiment with two goals, to:</p>



<ul><li>Increase reuse of datasets linked to PLOS articles and</li><li>Increase use of data repositories by offering a visual cue/ reward on articles.</li></ul>



<p>In the next phase of the experiment we have an additional goal: to understand if there are meaningful differences in how readers engage with different types of data, and different types of research output.</p>



<p>To achieve these goals we are increasing the number of articles that will qualify for the icon, by diversifying the repository and output types that are included. In this next phase, articles will display the icon if they:</p>



<ul><li>Were published from 2016 onwards</li><li>Include a link to a research output in a repository in their Data Availability Statement, and</li><li>The link directs to a unique record in <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework (OSF)</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">Gene Expression Omnibus</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">Sequence Read Archive</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/">BioProject</a>, or <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/">Demographic and Health Surveys</a></li></ul>



<p>Extending the icon to articles that link to six additional repositories &ndash; Github, Zenodo, Gene Expression Omnibus, Sequence Read Archive, BioProject, or Demographic and Health Surveys &ndash; achieves two things. First, it increases the number of articles that qualify for the feature three-fold, to more than 15,000 articles, rewarding more researchers and increasing our potential to promote discovery of research data, and code. Second, we&rsquo;re adding different <em>types</em> of repositories, which increases our potential for learning. Dryad, Figshare and OSF, from the first phase, are similar, in so far as they are all generalist data repositories. Gene Expression Omnibus, Sequence Read Archive, BioProject are domain-specific resources commonly used in the Life Sciences, and Demographic and Health Surveys is a key resource in social science and medicine. Domain-focused data repositories tend to have more specific requirements for structure of data and/or metadata, and we want to understand if readers engage differently with domain-specific resources compared to content in generalist repositories.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="284" height="462" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20187" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12.png 284w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12-184x300.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px"></figure></div>



<p>Github is best known for sharing and versioning code and software<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/#asterisk">*</a>, but is often also used for other content, including research data. With <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">rates of code sharing increasing</a>, and code being used or produced in around half of studies reported in PLOS articles, we want to better understand the value of code linked to PLOS articles &ndash; and support a popular resource for sharing research outputs. Indeed, all the newly-added repositories are popular among PLOS authors &ndash; the nine supported repositories collectively are hosting about three quarters of the outputs that PLOS authors share in repositories. They are also compatible with the creation of simple tooling that enables us to create links automatically and in some cases &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;, from accession numbers rather than URLs. See an example <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011387">here</a>.</p>



<p>The results of the next phase of the experiment will inform future strategies to support discovery and reuse of research outputs produced by PLOS authors.</p>



<h2>What have we learned so far?</h2>



<h5><em>Readers are engaging with the Accessible Data icon</em></h5>



<p>In the first 12 months of the experiment (to March 2023) we have recorded more than 20,000 reader clicks on the icon, which displayed on 3,335 articles at initial launch in March 2022, and was automatically added to more than 1,200 more articles published in the 12 months after launch. Through analysis of 543 Figshare datasets linked to PLOS articles, we observed that the average number of views received per month was 2.5 in the 12 months prior to the launch of the feature and 3.0 in the 12 months following the launch (a statistically significant relative increase of 20%).</p>



<h5><em>The icon could influence future data sharing practice</em></h5>



<p>Rates of repository use <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">are rising among published PLOS authors, 2019-present</a>. But it&rsquo;s not yet possible to measure if the Accessible Data icon has influenced the rate of data sharing in repositories by PLOS authors because the experiment has not been running long enough to measure effects in <em>published</em> papers. However, our <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Dryad_Integration_and_Accessible_Data_surveys/22762469">research</a> suggests that the availability of the icon may help normalize data sharing, and influence which repository researchers select.</p>



<h5><em>Getting the &ldquo;right&rdquo; data links in articles remains a challenge for publishers and authors</em></h5>



<p>The Accessible Data icon rewards sharing data (and code) in a repository via a weblink. Best practice is sharing via a link-able persistent identifier, such as a DOI, but many PLOS articles link to data in other ways, such as via URLs or private links that are intended to be used for peer review only (a common problem for publishers). There is clearly work to do to improve consistency and practice of how data links are shared, but we decided to be inclusive in how we deploy the Accessible Data icon. It displays as long readers can access the data. We decided it was more important to help researchers as authors&nbsp; &ndash; who may be unaware of the nuances of DOIs and private links &ndash; and also help them as readers, by including imperfect but functional links to data in our articles.</p>



<p>We are preparing a fuller report of the qualitative and quantitative insights we&rsquo;ve gained in the experiment in the future. Meanwhile, a summary is available as <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Poster_Testing_new_solutions_to_incentivize_best_practice_in_data_sharing_and_promote_data_reuse/22786454">a poster in Figshare</a>, which was presented at the MetaScience conference &ndash; along with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22762469">supporting data from our surveys</a>.</p>

<p>The co-editors in chief and most editorial board members of the journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ccph20"><em>Critical Public Health</em></a> have resigned their roles to start a new, independent journal, citing differences with their publisher, Taylor &amp; Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While there are inevitable tensions for a critically oriented scholarly journal that is also a commodity marketed by a commercial publisher, over the last year or so it has become increasingly difficult to hold together these two different versions of the journal,” co-editors <a href="https://sociology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/jmgreen/">Judith Green</a> of the University of Exeter in the UK and <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/node/3126">Lindsay McLaren</a> of the University of Calgary in Canada said in a <a href="https://cphn.net/breaking-news/">press release</a> announcing the mass resignation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is simply a relationship that hasn’t worked out and we need to find other ways to continue the spirit of the community,” McLaren told us.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127458"></span>



<p>Earlier this year, the entire editorial boards of the open-access Elsevier journals <em>NeuroImage</em> and <em>NeuroImage: Reports</em> <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/imaging-journal-editors-resign-over-extreme-open-access-fees/">resigned</a> to start a new, non-profit journal after the publisher rebuffed their request to reduce the journals’ fees for authors to publish their work. Editors of another Elsevier journal, <em>Design Studies</em>, have also <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/second-elsevier-journal-board-threatens-mass-resignations">threatened to resign</a> following the publisher replacing the editor-in-chief and pushing the editorial team to publish more papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The press release and <a href="https://cphn.net/2023/07/05/resignation-letter/">resignation letter</a> from the <em>Critical Public Health</em> editors posted online cited a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/09581596.2021.1958512?needAccess=true&amp;role=button">2021 editorial</a> by Green, McLaren, and two other board members discussing the history of the journal and consolidation in the academic publishing industry that led to Taylor &amp; Francis owning the journal. They also cited&nbsp; the publisher “pushing” the editors to move the journal from a hybrid subscription/open-access model to a fully open-access model funded by charging fees to authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors opposed that change. Charging authors to publish their work “risks compounding existing inequalities,” they wrote, and “goes against the entire spirit of the journal,” which was founded to create “a space to challenge public health orthodoxies, shifting the centre and breaking new ground.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the editors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis have made it clear that the choice is ultimately theirs to make, and the Editorial Board’s agreement is not a necessary precondition to changes in how CPH is funded. This move suggests that Taylor &amp; Francis see the journal as a commodity separable from the intellectual community that produces it.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The resignation letter stated that current fees for authors to publish their work as open-access were £2700 per research article (nearly $3,500), which the editors described as:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>an unsustainable cost for research funders and university libraries in high income countries, and an impossible cost for many in less advantaged countries; occasional subsidies do not constitute a viable solution to the much deeper issues of inequity embedded within the profit orientation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter also outlined issues with a new editorial contract and amendment, which “make clear the limited role the publisher sees for the editorial team and board.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In reiterating the rights of the publisher to determine the funding model and volume of articles that will be published, we believe Taylor &amp; Francis have significantly eroded our ability to set strategic direction. The editorial team’s ability to manage a collegial and bespoke response to authors and reviewers has also been systematically undermined by changes (typically without any consultation) to the submission platform, information about the journal, and requirements for manuscripts, and outsourcing key functions such as pre-production.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A Taylor &amp; Francis spokesperson told us the publisher was “disappointed” by the resignations:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>However, we very much look forward to recruiting a new editorial team who share our ambitions for <em>Critical Public Health</em> to extend its relevance and influence for the community it serves. We thank the outgoing board for their dedication to the journal and additionally thank the editors, Judith Green and Lindsay McLaren, for agreeing to stay on in an acting capacity until the current volume has been completed. This will ensure researchers can continue to submit papers as usual and for <em>Critical Public Health</em> to continue its valuable role in areas of public health, health promotion, political economy of health, and related fields.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Critical Public Health</em>’s impact factor in 2022, as well as over the past five years, was 2.8, placing it in the top half for its category.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors who resigned from <em>Critical Public Health</em> have started a new publication, the <a href="https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jcph/"><em>Journal of Critical Public Health</em></a>, hosted by the University of Calgary and owned by the <a href="https://cphn.net/">Critical Public Health Network</a>, a UK-based scholarly organization. An <a href="https://cphn.net/2023/07/05/critical-public-health-editorial-board-resignation-faqs/">FAQ page</a> about the resignations and new journal states that the editors hope to begin publishing content in about a year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-sea-ice-record-low-2023">Antarctic sea ice has been hitting record lows for most of this year</a></h4>

              
                <p>Something strange is happening to the Antarctic’s sea ice. The areal expanse of floating ice fringing the continent is not only at a record low for this time of year — surpassing a record just set in 2022 — but ice extent has been hitting record lows throughout the year.</p>



<p>“What’s happened here is unlike the Arctic sea ice expanse,” says Mark Serreze, a climate scientist and the director of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, or NSIDC, in Boulder, Colo. We’ve come to expect <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">a dramatic decline in sea ice at Earth’s other pole</a>, he says (<em>SN: 9/25/19</em>). “Not much has happened to Antarctica’s sea ice until the last few years. But it’s just plummeted.”</p>





<p>NSIDC uses satellite-gleaned data, collected daily, to <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep an eye on the spread of sea ice</a> at both poles. Throughout most of 2023, the ring of sea ice around Antarctica has repeatedly set new record lows, staying well below the average extent from 1981 to 2010. On February 21 — the height of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer — the sea ice expanse hit an all-time low since record-keeping began in 1978, of 1.79 million square kilometers. That’s 130,000 square kilometers — about the size of the state of New York — smaller than the previous recorded minimum, reached on February 25, 2022.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Subpar sea ice</h3>



<p>The amount of ocean around Antarctica covered in sea ice in 2023 (red) has stayed well below the average from 1981 to 2010 (black). Sea ice expanse hit a record low in late February — surpassing a record set just in 2022 (blue). The sea ice expanse for every year from 1981 to 2021 is shown in gray.</p>

<p>Even as the Southern Hemisphere shifted into winter, Antarctic sea ice remained at record low levels. On June 27, the ice was dotted across about 11.7 million square kilometers of ocean. That’s about 2.6 million square kilometers below the 1981–2010 average, and about 1.2 million square kilometers below the previous lowest extent on record for June 27, set in 2022.</p>



<p>Unlike Arctic ice, whose dwindling is known to be closely tied to global warming, it’s been harder to parse the reasons for changes in Antarctic sea ice extent. That difficulty has made it unclear whether changes are the result of natural variability or whether “something big has changed,” Serreze says.</p>

<p>The last few years<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/battering-storms-caused-antarctic-sea-ice-shrink-record-pace"> have given scientists pause</a> (<em>SN: 6/27/17</em>). “We’re kind of dropping off an edge,” Serreze says. It’s not yet clear whether this year’s extent is part of a larger trend, he notes. But “the longer that persists, the more likely it is that something big is happening.”</p>



<p>The Arctic and the Antarctic regions are polar opposites, so to speak, in their geographic setting. Ice in the Arctic Ocean is confined to a relatively small body of water ringed by land. The Antarctic, by contrast, is a landmass surrounded by ocean, which means the sea ice around the continent is much more mobile than up north, with a larger seasonal range as it expands in the Southern Hemisphere’s winter and shrinks in summer. Climate simulations have, accordingly, consistently predicted that the Arctic would show bigger sea ice losses as the planet warms, at least at first, while Antarctica would be slower to respond.</p>



<p>As to why the Antarctic ice has tracked so low this year there are a few possible culprits. Regional climate patterns — particularly an air pressure pattern known as the Southern Annular Mode that shifts the direction of winds blowing around the continent — can pack or diffuse the sea ice cover around Antarctica. And other regional patterns, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, can affect both ocean and air circulation in the southern high latitudes.</p>





<p>Right now, scientists are concerned most with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">what lies beneath the ice</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). “There’s growing evidence that there has been some kind of change in ocean circulation that is bringing more heat” to the region, which affects the ice cover, Serreze says. “There are a bunch of people looking into this; we’re really blitzing to get the data. We need to understand what the heck is going on in the ocean.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reimagining-animal-behavior-feminist-lens-kamath-packer">These researchers are reimagining animal behavior through a feminist lens</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Ambika Kamath was a graduate student in evolutionary biology at Harvard University, she knew one thing for sure: She wasn’t going to research anoles, the lizards that her adviser, Jonathan Losos, specialized in.</p>



<p>“I started out as one of those rebellious renegades,” Kamath says, determined to pursue her own research subject. So she went to India for a couple of years to study the poorly understood fan-throated lizards. But when she tried to map out their territories, she found chaos. “All of the lizards were moving everywhere,” she says.</p>





<p>Losos encouraged her to work with anoles after all, because it was well established that males hold individual territories that they protect from other males, and females only mate with the male whose territory they reside in. That would make it more straightforward for Kamath to study how anole territoriality differed across habitat types, like forests and parks.</p>



<p>So Kamath went to Florida, where she identified individual anoles and tracked their movements day in, day out. Kamath studied the anoles “in a larger area, in a longer period of time than anyone else had ever done,” says Losos, who is now at Washington University in St. Louis. But instead of revealing territorial differences, this massive dataset showed that the anoles weren’t actually territorial in the first place.</p>



<p>Kamath looked into the historical record to see where the idea of anole territoriality originated. It started with a 1933 paper that described frequent sexual behavior between male lizards in the lab. The authors had concluded that this lab behavior must be “prevented by something” in the wild, Kamath says, which they inferred was the males protecting territories. “The very first conclusion,” she says, “was based on a homophobic response to observing male-male copulation.” That shaky conclusion caught on, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-017-2319-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later researchers assumed it to be true</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing a feminist perspective</h4>



<p>With this work, Kamath had entered the world of scholarship aimed at critically examining science, including interrogations of who is doing research and what biases and viewpoints they bring to their work. In particular, Kamath has adopted <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a feminist approach to science</a>, which critically examines not only how women and gender minorities have been excluded from science, but also how sexist and gendered ideas have influenced the questions scientists ask and how they frame the results of their work — whether they know it or not.</p>



<p>Kamath began to explore how the fact that most of science has been done by white men has shaped our understanding of the world. It’s something biologist Zuleyma Tang-Martínez, widely recognized for her research challenging accepted scientific paradigms, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/027046769201200402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted three decades ago</a>. In 1992, she wrote that incorporating diverse viewpoints and dismantling old ways of thinking can “give rise to a new science that is more humane, and that recognizes the perspectives of women and people of color as valuable.” Still, a lack of diverse viewpoints in science remains an issue today.</p>



<p>Kamath’s research led to a collaboration with another evolutionary biologist, Max Lambert. In 2019 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>, Kamath, Lambert and colleagues critiqued the dominant view of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1019-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how same-sex sexual behavior evolved</a>. Given how common same-sex behavior is in animals, the prevailing hypothesis that exclusive heterosexual behavior is the baseline from which same-sex behavior evolved doesn’t make sense, they proposed.</p>



<p>Instead, sexual behavior likely first evolved to be indiscriminate to all sexes. The focus on explaining how homosexual behavior evolved, Kamath says, is “driven by these heteronormative, if not homophobic, assumptions that are baked into the science.” If we remove those assumptions, she adds, “we&#8217;re going to actually reveal a lot more about biology.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Science is shaped by human bias</h4>



<p>Kamath continues to challenge biological ideas that are rooted in human bias, now at her own lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. Her group focuses on understanding how animals interact with each other and their environments and what drives those interactions, while also examining how human identities and biases shape our perceptions of animal behavior. This concept is reflected in her lab’s name: the <a href="https://kamathlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feminist Lenses for Animal Interaction Research</a>, or FLAIR, Lab.</p>





<p>“Feminist critiques of science have been going on for decades,” says social scientist Melina Packer, who works in the FLAIR lab. The question is why, given that history, so few scientists are ever exposed to social studies that look at science as a human endeavor, complete with human biases. Packer and Kamath are working to change this lack of exposure.</p>



<p>Kamath and Packer first met at the University of California, Berkeley, where Kamath was a postdoc and Packer was a graduate student, in a working group focused on exploring biology through queer and feminist frameworks. While there, Packer teamed up with Lambert, also a member of the working group, to critique the gendered terminology — <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/720131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and thinking</a> — that dominated environmental toxicology, such as the terms “feminize” and “demasculinize” to describe sex-switching in frogs.</p>



<p>Research since the 1990s had focused on chemicals that scientists feared caused frogs to unnaturally switch sex, but Packer and Lambert found that <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA588374803&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=01908286&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E9a899775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this worry was overblown</a>. In fact, frogs switch sex all the time, for all sorts of reasons, and sex changes don’t result in population declines.</p>



<p>As with Kamath’s experience with the anole territories, Packer says, “if you go into an experiment assuming that chemicals are causing sex changes, then you’re going to find it.” What seems unnatural to humans is perfectly normal in frogs. And the emphasis on sex-switching as an outcome of pollutant exposure takes away from studying other impacts that may be more important, Lambert says, like the growth of liver tumors.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Developing a new curriculum</h4>



<p>In the FLAIR Lab, Kamath and Packer are working to perfect a new course in animal behavior that is critical and cross-disciplinary. The course presents radically new ways of thinking about animal behavior, sometimes by first teaching — and then unteaching — dominant paradigms.</p>



<p>For example, Kamath will teach students about Bateman’s principle, which is the idea first presented in 1948 that male animals should be expected to pursue as many mates as possible while female animals should not, because males produce millions of sperm while females produce comparatively few eggs. Tang-Martínez calls this <a href="https://theconversation.com/data-should-smash-the-biological-myth-of-promiscuous-males-and-sexually-coy-females-59665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the biological myth of promiscuous males and sexually coy females</a>. Kamath will then present critiques of the idea, such as modern researchers’ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406825/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inability to replicate Bateman’s findings</a>, as well as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01921.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“theoretical weirdnesses”</a> with how the idea has been used in the decades since it was introduced.</p>



<p>When Kamath teaches the class, some of the students are “baffled” by the feminist critiques of science they encounter in the course curriculum, Kamath says, but she realized that “if we want this more expansive view of doing biology to take root, we’re going to have to face that friction.” She and Packer are also writing a book that builds feminist frameworks for understanding animal behavior, meant for a general audience.</p>



<p>Lambert, now a biologist at the Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife, credits Packer and Kamath with showing him how taking a broader perspective on biology, including interrogating the influence of forces like capitalism and sexism, can lead to more interesting research questions.</p>



<p>Losos says he and Kamath have many differing views, but that’s never gotten in the way of their work. “She has certainly opened my eyes to things that I really never used to think about,” he says.” Kamath created an entirely new statistical framework to quantify how much a lizard’s movements overlapped in time and space with other lizards, which ultimately helped reveal that the anoles she studied aren’t territorial after all. “It was brilliant,” Losos says.</p>



<p>Kamath and Packer are both early-career scientists; redesigning a curriculum and writing popular science books aren’t typical activities among their peers. &nbsp;“I think that’s particularly brave at this career stage,” Lambert says, “to be planting your flag on what you care most about.” And Kamath is still figuring out how to frame her lab’s research on lizard ecology and behavior into a critical, feminist perspective. “I’m not sure that we as a field are there yet,” she says. “The hope was that in the writing of this book, clarity would emerge as to what the next empirical steps would be.”</p>



<p>Both Kamath and Packer recognize the challenges in the work they’re doing, but they also recognize the stakes. Given the recent flurry of homophobic and anti-trans legislation, says Packer, “it doesn&#8217;t help if scientists are reinforcing those same kinds of assumptions,” even unintentionally. Papers that challenge dominate scientific paradigms often struggle to be published, Kamath says. “How much biological discovery are we missing out on?” she asks. “If you have the ability to start changing the conversation, even within scientific communities, it’s an important part of the process.”</p>

<p>A gastroenterology researcher has sued a scientific journal to stop it from publishing an expression of concern for one of her papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/research/office-of-research-and-graduate-education/research-faculty/clinical-and-translational-science/singh-soudamani/">Soudamani Singh</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Clinical and Translational Sciences at Marshall University’s Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine in Huntington, W. Va., is the middle author of “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203552">Cyclooxygenase pathway mediates the inhibition of Na-glutamine co-transporter B0AT1 in rabbit villus cells during chronic intestinal inflammation</a>,” published in <em>PLOS ONE </em>in September 2018. The article has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/07/med-school-vice-dean-says-hes-correcting-paper-amid-negative-misconduct-inquiry/">previously reported</a> that the corresponding author of the paper, <a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/research/office-of-research-and-graduate-education/research-faculty/clinical-and-translational-science/sundaram/">Uma Sundaram</a>, vice dean of research and graduate education at the Edwards School and chair of its department of clinical and translational science, told us he had contacted PLOS to request a correction to the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127420"></span>



<p>A <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/08/medical-school-dean-up-to-five-retractions/#comment-2111182">comment</a> on <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/08/medical-school-dean-up-to-five-retractions">another</a> of our posts had identified a duplicated image in the paper, but Sundaram said he and his coauthors had noticed the “accidental error” independently and notified the journal. The committee that conducted a subsequent research misconduct inquiry into the matter decided not to pursue an investigation because Sundaram had already contacted the journal to make the correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS spokesperson David Knutson told us at the time that the journal had not decided what type of notice to issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Singh’s <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Singh-complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> against PLOS, filed in federal court in April and <a href="https://wvrecord.com/stories/644749864-scientist-seeks-injunction-to-stop-scientific-journal-from-publishing-notice-of-concern">first reported</a> by the <em>West Virginia Record</em>, the journal had decided to publish an expression of concern instead of a correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh is seeking a temporary restraining order and eventually a permanent injunction preventing PLOS from publishing the expression of concern, “compensation for damages incurred as a result of the unlawful and harmful conduct carried out by Defendant,” and recovery of her legal fees. Neither her lawyer nor the local counsel for PLOS has responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/25/judge-denies-motion-by-researcher-to-quash-diabetes-expressions-of-concern/">previous case</a> in which a researcher sued to block publication of expressions of concern on his work, a judge denied the request for a restraining order and injunction because, as one legal <a href="https://www.popehat.com/2015/02/26/dr-mario-j-a-saad-tries-and-fails-to-censor-american-diabetes-association/">commentator explained</a>, the law does not allow courts to censor speech ahead of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the lawsuit tells it, the duplicated image was “simply a scrivener’s error” in compiling the manuscript, which the researchers discovered “in or around June 2022,” the month the comment pointing out the duplication appeared on Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the authors notified the publisher of the duplication (which Knutson previously told us happened on June 17), the suit alleges PLOS:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>made numerous inquiries about the Article which were duplicative of the vetting process that Plaintiff had already reviewed with Defendant nearly four (4) years prior – when Defendant’s research editors had accepted the research, data, scientific processes and conclusions related to the Article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nine months later, PLOS notified the scientists of the decision to publish an expression of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Publishing such a notice instead of a correction is inappropriate, the lawsuit argues, because:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the research publication world, a Notice of Concern has quite the negative connotation and implies a certain level of intentional misconduct (i.e. plagiarism, falsifying data, etc.) or that something otherwise nefarious has occurred with an article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yet, “there have been zero allegations lodged by Defendants regarding research or publication misconduct,” the suit states. It also cites the findings of the research misconduct inquiry, and quotes a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Marshall-VPR-Sundaram-Letter.pdf">memo</a> from Marshall University’s vice president for research John M. Maher, in which he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Sundaram and his colleagues did not commit research misconduct, but instead offered exemplary vigilance and diligence in detecting and correcting a mistake in published work.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PLOS’s <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/corrections-expressions-of-concern-and-retractions">guidelines</a> for publishing expressions of concern do not mention misconduct, but state they are “notices published at editors’ discretion to alert readers of serious concerns about published work or an article’s compliance with PLOS policies (e.g. Data Availability).”</p>



<p>Singh’s suit claims that if PLOS publishes the expression of concern, it will damage her reputation and she will lose career opportunities and wages, and it could also “jeopardize a current federal research grant that Plaintiff and her team are applying to renew.”</p>



<p>Besides seeking the temporary restraining order, Singh’s suit alleges breach of contract, negligence, defamation, and unfair and deceptive trade practices, namely that PLOS</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>has engaged in an unlawful and deceptive practice of soliciting articles from authors for publication in furtherance of their own economic benefit, accepting money and later rejecting said articles or, alternatively, engaging in a pattern of falsely publishing unlawful “Notices of Concern.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lawsuit requests a trial by jury.</p>

<p>A better understanding of the neural and functional mechanisms underlying drug-induced
changes in pathological nystagmus is likely to improve medical treatment. A treatment
option for downbeat nystagmus (DBN), a common form of acquired fixation nystagmus that
often occurs with cerebellar degeneration, is low doses of the potassium channel blocker
4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The upward ocular drift in DBN has a spontaneous and a vertical
gaze-evoked component. Detailed analysis of the effect of 4-AP in patients showed that the
drug consistently improved the gaze-evoked component, but had less effect in reducing the
spontaneous drift. We show by a combination of computational modelling at the systems
level and at the neuronal level how this differential effect can be investigated. We have
previously postulated that DBN is caused by damage to the floccular lobe (FL). 4-AP, which
has been shown to increase the excitability of Purkinje cells (PCs) in slice experiments,
may thus suppress DBN by partly restoring floccular function. We simulated the effect of
low concentrations of 4-AP on the cellular level using a multicompartment model of a PC,
in which we changed ion channel properties to simulate damage. The transition from the
cellular level to the systems level was achieved by constructing a population response.
Systems level modelling predicted that the effect of 4-AP on the PCs should reduce DBN,
but the predicted effect on the gaze-dependent component was less than is observed in
patients. Our results suggest that the beneficial effect of 4-AP on DBN cannot be solely
explained by its effect at the neuronal level of PCs, and suggests added effects at the
level of the population of neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-plant-leaves-fibonacci-spirals">A 407-million-year-old plant’s leaves skipped the usual Fibonacci spirals</a></h4>

              
                <p>An unusual arrangement of leaves in a 407-million-year-old fossilized plant is complicating scientists’ understanding of plant evolution.</p>



<p>Most land plants living today have spiral patterns involving the famous Fibonacci sequence of numbers. Because the spirals are so common, scientists have thought that the patterns must have evolved in some of the earliest land plants. But the leaves of the ancient plant, a member of one of the first plant groups known to have developed leaves, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg4014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were arranged in spirals that can’t be described by Fibonacci numbers</a>, researchers report in the June 16 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The study “helps us to understand how [the] diversity of plants has been generated,” says botanist Barbara Ambrose, the director of laboratory research at the New York Botanical Garden in New York City, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two previous ones: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on. Examples of spirals in plants that involve Fibonacci numbers can be seen in the arrangement of the leaves of some succulents, the bracts of a pinecone and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/golden-blossoms-pi-flowers">seeds of a sunflower,</a> among many other plants (<em>SN: 8/27/02</em>).</p>



<p>In plants with spiraling patterns of leaves, all the leaves can be described by a set of curved lines that spiral clockwise out from the center as well as by a set of curved lines that spiral counterclockwise. If the numbers of clockwise and counterclockwise curves are both numbers found in the Fibonacci sequence, it’s known as Fibonacci spiraling.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t sure why most modern plants adopt Fibonacci spiraling, but it might help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematical-lives-plants-0">maximize the amount of space</a> between leaves or other plant parts (<em>SN: 7/21/07</em>). The patterns could also arise from the distribution of auxins, a type of plant growth hormone.</p>

Hetherington</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the new study, Sandy Hetherington, a paleobotanist at the University of Edinburgh, and colleagues studied fossils of the extinct <em>Asteroxylon mackiei</em>, a member of a group of plants called lycopods that also includes modern club mosses. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The fossils were obtained from the Rhynie chert, a roughly 400-million-year-old deposit of sedimentary rock in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, that contains exceptionally well-preserved fossils of some of the first land plants. In 1969, researchers collected hundreds of cross-sectional images of <em>A. mackiei </em>fossils and the surrounding rock. Hetherington’s team digitally reconstructed the cross sections into 3-D representations of the original plants.</p>



<p>Two of the four reconstructed plants exhibited non-Fibonacci spiraling in their leaf arrangements. Both plants had eight counterclockwise spirals (a Fibonacci number). But one had seven clockwise spirals and the other had nine, neither of which is a Fibonacci number.</p>



<p>The leaves on the other two plants didn’t grow in spirals at all — instead, they grew in a series of rings stacked along the stem.</p>



<p>“Given the prevalence of Fibonacci spirals today and in the later fossil records of plants, we definitely expected Fibonacci spirals,” says study coauthor Holly-Anne Turner, a paleontologist now at University College Cork in Ireland. The <em>A. mackiei</em> fossils predate the next-earliest lycopod fossils that show non-Fibonacci spiraling by almost 50 million years.</p>





<p>Lycopod leaves evolved separately from leaves in other types of plants, but some modern lycopods do exhibit Fibonacci spiraling. That suggests the spiraling patterns may have evolved separately in different lineages of plants, says Peter Crane, a botanist and president of the Oak Spring Garden Foundation in Upperville, Va., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p><em>A. mackiei</em> is just one species, Ambrose notes. Though the fossil record is patchy, reconstructing other early plants could offer more clues to how these spirals evolve in nature.</p>



<p>New computing technology also means that it’s worth revisiting fossils that had been analyzed by hand decades ago, Turner says. With the amount of information and detail that can be collected from computer simulations, “you could find something really great.”</p>

<p>A pharmacy researcher who left the University of Pennsylvania sometime last year has been found guilty of research misconduct in multiple federal grant applications and five published papers, four of which have already been retracted.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/25/penn-maintains-wall-of-silence-over-now-retired-prof-as-retractions-mount/">we have reported</a>, William Armstead, who is retired from Penn, was working among other things on the effects of brain injury on piglets – experiments in which the animals were slaughtered. He has had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dArmstead%252c%2bWilliam%2bM">seven papers retracted</a>, and <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/penn-scientist-william-armstead-investigation-retracted-piglets-20220906.html">reported in September</a> that he had left the university. Penn <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/25/penn-maintains-wall-of-silence-over-now-retired-prof-as-retractions-mount/">did not respond to several requests</a> for comment when we attempted to reach officials there about Armstead’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-armstead-william-m">U.S. Office of Research Integrity</a>, much of that work appears to have been suspect:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127442"></span>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-mosquito-possum-flesh-eating-disease">In Australia, mosquitoes and possums may spread a flesh-eating disease</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>HOUSTON </strong>— Some mosquitoes buzzing around parts of Australia could be ferrying dangerous cargo from possums to people: flesh-eating bacteria.</p>



<p><em>Mycobacterium ulcerans </em>is the microbe behind Buruli ulcer, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/africas-latest-scourge">disfiguring skin disease</a> that largely occurs across areas of Australia and Africa (<em>SN: 7/17/99</em>). Antibiotics can help ulcers heal completely, but untreated cases can cause scarring, permanent disfigurement and disability.</p>



<p>Humans aren’t the only creatures that can get the disease. In Australia, the country’s native possums — including the common ringtail (<em>Pseudocheirus peregrinus</em>) — do too, developing ulcers and shedding the bacteria in poop. The possums are thought to transmit the bacteria to people, and researchers have suspected mosquitoes interacting somehow with infected possums could play a role.</p>





<p>Figuring out exactly what animals may harbor the bacteria and how they come into contact with people could help with efforts to control the disease. But a link between the possums, mosquitoes and people hadn’t been found.</p>



<p>Now, surveys of mosquitoes in southeastern Australia have provided that link. Analyses of captured mosquitoes show that a small number of the insects <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10789/presentation/3516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had recently fed on both possums and people</a>, molecular microbiologist Timothy Stinear reported June 18 at the ASM Microbe 2023 meeting.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses also revealed that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.07.539718v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>M. ulcerans</em> bacteria from mosquitoes, possums and people are identical</a>, Stinear and colleagues reported May 7 at bioRxiv.org in a preliminary study that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. The finding that the microbes have indistinguishable DNA in all three “really [ties] up that transmission chain between all of these species,” said Stinear, of the University of Melbourne in Australia.</p>



<p>The research provides “pretty compelling” evidence that mosquitoes could be transmitting the disease in Australia, says Jennifer Guthrie, a microbiologist and epidemiologist at Western University in London, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>



<p><em>M. ulcerans</em> is a slow-growing microbe. It can take from two to nine months before people develop symptoms of the flesh-eating disease. “Pinpointing transmission of something that happened months and months ago is really challenging,” Guthrie says.</p>



<p>In their research, Stinear and colleagues captured more than 72,000 mosquitoes from the Mornington Peninsula, a part of southeastern Melbourne where the disease is found. When the team tested about 18,000 individuals for <em>M. ulcerans</em>, nearly all that tested positive belonged to one species of day-biting mosquito: <em>Aedes notoscriptus</em>.</p>



<p>Of 13 mosquitoes from that species that had recently fed on an animal, two had sucked blood from both a ringtail possum and a person. That’s a small number, but such mosquitoes are probably rare, given that only about 200 to 300 cases of Buruli ulcer are reported in Australia each year, though cases are on the rise. In 2022, around 2,100 Buruli ulcer cases from 11 countries were reported to the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>The team also found overlap among the areas where infected mosquitoes hang out, where researchers find possum poop contaminated with the bacteria and where there are diagnosed Buruli ulcer cases in people. But it’s still unclear how exactly the mosquitoes may carry <em>M. ulcerans</em> from animal to person.</p>



<p>It’s possible that <em>A. notoscriptus </em>feeding on possum ulcers could physically bring microbes along for the ride to their next victim. But other mosquito species analyzed by the researchers also feed on possums yet don’t seem to pick the bacteria up. Another idea is that possums’ poop sometimes ends up in the small artificial containers where <em>A. notoscriptus</em> likes to lay its eggs, contaminating the water and infecting the growing insects.</p>



<p>The transmission of the disease in Australia appears to be distinct from what occurs in Africa. In western Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/still-waters-skin-disease-microbe-tracked-ponds-swamps">water bug</a> bites can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212553114000089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inject the bacteria into skin</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/08</em>). Whether the bugs transmit the microbes to people from another animal is unknown.</p>





<p><em>M. ulcerans</em> from each continent are so genetically similar that it’d be surprising if the transmission cycle were incredibly different, Stinear said. But, so far, surveys in western Africa of other animals including mosquitoes and small mammals have yet to turn up signs of <em>M. ulcerans</em>. It’s possible, he said, “we’re missing something in our studies in Africa.”</p>
