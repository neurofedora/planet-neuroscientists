<span>Open access to research papers in STM journals has always been a controversial topic.

In large part, I think, because although OA began as a bottom-up revolution it was never widely embraced by researchers. However, OA advocates managed to persuade governments, funders and institutions that their colleagues should be compelled to embrace open access. This has seen a series of ever more stringent OA mandates being imposed on researchers, increasing the bureaucratic burden on them (amongst other things). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Monographs are a particularly contested area because of their length, their narrative form, and the licensing issues that this raises. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It has not helped that OA advocates promised open access would reduce the costs of scholarly communication. In reality, costs have risen. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This last point is particularly troublesome in the UK context as OA policies have been introduced without providing the necessary funding to support them. As a result, researchers can discover that they have been mandated to make their work open access but cannot afford to pay the article-processing charge (</span><a href="https://libraryguides.helsinki.fi/apc"><span>APC</span></a><span>) needed if they want to satisfy the government’s </span><a href="http://blogs.rcuk.ac.uk/2012/10/24/rcuk-open-access-policy-our-preference-for-gold/"><span>preference for gold OA</span></a><span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This has been a challenge even for researchers at wealthy and prestigious institutions. Last year, for instance, Oxford University library had to </span><a href="http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/2018/01/10/oxfords-rcuk-open-access-block-grant-update-no-funds-remaining/"><span>inform faculty</span></a><span> that its OA fund had been exhausted and so they should delay submitting to journals until it had been replenished.<span>  </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>At the same time, the bureaucracy surrounding OA compliance has become so complex that universities have had to recruit legions of support staff to interpret and manage the escalating number of policies (some of which have proved contradictory). Indeed, such is the complexity now that even specialist support staff can struggle to decode the rules.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In short, the UK OA policy environment is far too complex, and it is seriously underfunded. For researchers, this is frustrating and depressing.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>No one knows this better than </span><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/edith-hall"><span>Edith Hall</span></a><span>, a professor of Classics at King’s College London. (Full disclosure: Edith and I are co-parents). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Free for all</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Given the topic of her new book – co-authored with colleague </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-stead-75059045/?originalSubdomain=uk"><span>Henry Stead</span></a><span> – Hall felt it really important that it be freely available for anyone to read. The book’s theme is the historic exclusion of the poor from education in the Greek and Roman Classics. To not make her work open access, Hall felt, would be an act of hypocrisy.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Moreover, since the organisation that funded the research in the book – The Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (</span><a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/"><span>AHRC</span></a><span>) – has had an </span><a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/about/policies/openaccess/"><span>open access policy in place since 2005</span></a><span>it seemed the correct thing to do.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>AHRC was until recently one of the funding bodies of the umbrella organisation Research Councils UK (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Councils_UK"><span>RCUK</span></a><span>), which itself has had an open access policy in place </span><a href="http://blogs.rcuk.ac.uk/2012/10/24/rcuk-open-access-policy-our-preference-for-gold/"><span>since 2012</span></a><span>. RCUK’s role has now moved to UK Research and Innovation (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Research_and_Innovation"><span>UKRI</span></a><span>), which has inherited both the RCUK policy and the </span><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/01/hefce-open-access-ref-gamechanger/"><span>2014 OA policy</span></a><span> of the Higher Education Council for England (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Funding_Council_for_England"><span>HEFCE</span></a><span>). HEFCE manages the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Excellence_Framework"><span>Research Excellence Framework</span></a><span>and the future funding of Hall’s department depends on her and her colleagues submitting their work for REF assessment.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In other words, Hall’s work is subject to several different OA policies, all of which were introduced with the aim of making publicly funded research open access. <span> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>True, only research papers have to be made open access on a mandatory basis today, but all the UK policies recommend and actively encourage researchers to make their monographs open access as well. As the Guidance on Submissions for REF 2021 </span><a href="https://www.ref.ac.uk/media/1092/ref-2019_01-guidance-on-submissions.pdf"><span>puts it</span></a><span>, “The funding bodies [also] encourage institutions to take a proportionate view of the costs and benefits of making other types of outputs (including monographs) available as open access.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Complexity aside, the problem these policies face is that they were introduced on the assumption that open access would be less costly than traditional methods, or at least cost neutral. As noted, this has not proved the case. In fact, it was only after it had introduced its OA policy that RCUK realised it had imposed a significant new cost burden on UK universities. In 2013, therefore, it had to provide </span><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/11/01/uk-government-stands-up-for-open-access-with-a-10-million-funding-boost/"><span>additional funding</span></a><span> to research-intensive universities like King’s in order for them to comply, in the form of </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/funding/information-for-award-holders/open-access/open-access-policy/open-access-block-grants/"><span>annual block grants</span></a><span> to pay for APCs. At the time, it was assumed that this would only need to be a temporary measure, but the money has had to be paid ever since. (King’s 2019/2020 block grant is </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/files/research/2019-2020-block-grant-awards-pdf/"><span>£686,560</span></a><span>).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Keen to make her work open access, conscious that OA is now a UK priority, and aware that funding is available to help pay for open access, Hall contacted </span><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/library/researchsupport/index"><span>Research Support</span></a><span> at King’s (which manages the RCUK block grant) to ask if they could contribute to the Book Processing Charge (</span><a href="https://libraryguides.helsinki.fi/apc"><span>BPC</span></a><span>) she would need to pay to make her book OA. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To her joy, Research Support replied that they would be happy to fund the full cost of making the book OA (£10,000). Explaining why they were providing the money, Research Support cited the </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/documents/rcukopenaccesspolicy-pdf/"><span>RCUK Policy on Open Access</span></a><span>. Although RCUK’s open access policy does not require mandatory OA for monographs or books, they said, it does encourage “authors of such material to consider making them Open Access where possible.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In addition, they said, the RCUK policy states that research organisations “may use the block grant in the manner they consider will best deliver the RCUK Policy on Open Access, as long as the primary purpose to support the payment of APCs is fulfilled.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Confident that the funding was now in place to make their book OA, Hall and Stead signed an open access agreement with Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis (RTF) and began writing up their research. When the book</span><span>’</span><span>s text was finally accepted by RFT Hall emailed Research Support to ask where the publisher should send its invoice.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Research Support replied, however, that as too many calls are now being made on the block grant, they could no longer honour their commitment to pay. When Hall questioned this change of heart, she was informed that – contrary to what Research Support had told her at the time she applied for the subvention – it was not actually permitted to use money from RCUK block grants to pay BPCs. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Alarmed that if it did not go into production immediately their book would not be published in time to be eligible for the all-important 2021 REF, Hall and Stead concluded they had no choice but to ask RTF to rewrite the contract along traditional lines and accept that their book would not be open access after all. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Wider significance?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Hall’s experience has been demoralising and frustrating. But does it have any wider significance? I think so. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Let’s recall that when the open access movement was founded – at the meeting of the 2002 Budapest Open Access Initiative (</span><a href="https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read"><span>BOAI</span></a><span>) – the resulting declaration stated (inter alia) that:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>“Removing access barriers to [the scholarly] literature will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”</i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This democratic, upbeat vision is a far cry from the expensive, oppressive and bureaucratic environment that surrounds open access in the UK today. And one can reasonably assume that many other UK researchers have been experiencing similar frustrations to Hall. This can only alienate them from the practice and principles of open access, and so delay the transformation to OA the UK government wants to see. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>There is, however, a larger and more pressing question we have to ask: Is the open access strategy currently being pursued in the UK affordable, particularly as the government focuses its attention on monographs?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Clearly driven by settled policy rather than financial considerations the UK is now determined to press ahead and mandate OA for monographs. Last year </span><a href="https://re.ukri.org/about-us/our-people/steven-hill/"><span>Steven Hill</span></a><span>, Director of Research at UKRI </span><a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/insight/oa-requirement-monographs-will-benefit-society-says-hill-747196"><span>told</span></a><span> <i>The Bookseller</i>that for REF2027 the current policies on open access as applied to journal articles would be extended to encompass monographs and other “long form outputs”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>But how much will this cost? How will it be funded? This question has led to some anguished deliberation, by both publishers and researchers. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In 2017, for instance, the Pro-Vice Dean Research (Impact and Innovation) at King’s College, Simon Tanner, published a </span><a href="http://simon-tanner.blogspot.com/2017/06/gold-is-dead-model-for-open-access-books.html"><span>blog post</span></a><span> entitled <i>Gold is a dead model for Open Access Books. </i>In the post, he said that Book Processing Charges in a Gold OA environment, “would be utterly unsustainable in a future OA mandated REF environment.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In reaching this conclusion Tanner calculated that there were 11,861 named submitters to Panel D (Arts and Humanities) for REF2014, with 8,513 books. He explained: “So we have 8,513 books submitted to the REF2014 and probably a similar number to the next one as well. The top 3 most book submitting universities were University of Oxford (511), University of Cambridge (344) and King’s College London (245).”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Tanner added that BPCs range from between £3,500 to £11,000 per book. As a result, he said, “The maths don’t look good if these figures continued into a new OA mandated REF environment.

But there are problems with this model and – as is evident from recent criticism of </span><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/"><span>Knowledge Unlatched</span></a><span> (e.g. </span><a href="http://blogs.openbookpublishers.com/open-book-publishers-statement-on-knowledge-unlatched-and-the-open-research-library/"><span>here</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/10/03/knowledge-unlatched-failed-transparency-and-the-commercialisation-of-open-access-book-publishing/"><span>here</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html"><span>here</span></a><span>) – there are also unintended consequences. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/7/3/55"><span>This article</span></a><span> draws attention to some of the problems of the crowdfunding model. It also points out that the ongoing efforts to agree transformative agreements with journal publishers, the current focus of UKRI on Plan S, and the large amounts of money already being sucked from the system by journals, pose a big threat to implementing such a model. As the authors put it, “Currently, the focus of libraries and research funders is on journals rather than books. Therefore, Plan S could be a threat as well as other changes in science policy orientation.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It seems to me that there are two underlying and connected problems here. There is an abiding assumption that open access can reduce the costs of scholarly publishing and a continuing desire to press ahead with policy changes without thinking through the cost implications.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It’s as if OA advocates and funders believed that costs can be magically wished away. The truth is that costs do not disappear with open access. Moreover, publishers are not going to willingly lower their prices, and market forces are not sufficient to force them to do so, if only because STM researchers are always going to want to publish in prestigious journals and humanities researchers are always going to want to publish with prestigious imprints. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>True, high-minded statements like The Declaration on Research Assessment (</span><a href="https://sfdora.org/"><span>DORA</span></a><span>) effectively seek to force researchers to abandon this practice (as does Plan S) but this </span><a href="https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20181107234431569"><span>raises issues of academic freedom</span></a><span>and leaves researchers more vulnerable to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing"><span>predatory publishing</span></a><span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In short, while King’s College clearly failed Hall in her attempts to publish her new book open access, the larger failing here is a failure of the UK government and UK funders. They have yet to develop a coherent or sustainable strategy for moving to an open-access environment, even as they insist on pressing ahead with new OA policies. This suggests that individuals like Hall can expect the situation to get worse before it gets better.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>But there is a little good news to end with: RTF agreed to insert a clause in the new contract with Hall and Stead to allow their book to made open access after a three-year embargo, for a reduced BPC (£3,000).

Where a scientist will write a paper and then send it to a journal publisher for consideration, with humanities monographs the author generally does things the other way round: s/he will propose an idea to a publisher before writing the book. The publisher will likely then send that proposal (the book’s topic and how the topic will be dealt with) out for review. Only once the reviews have been provided, and any recommended changes made to the book proposal (assuming the publisher is still willing to proceed), will the author(s) sit down and write the text (of, say, 200,000 words). Sometimes the completed text will also be sent out for further review before the book is finally cleared for publication.</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>This process takes a lot longer than sending a, say, 5,000-word scientific paper to a journal and waiting for it to be reviewed and published (which can sometimes happen within 3 months), especially when the book author(s) is/ are highly research active and working on several other books and projects simultaneously. </span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>In the case of the book we are discussing the text was not finally and fully accepted for publication until June this year, which is when Hall contacted Research Support to ask for the promised BPC to be released (on 22nd June). In its initial response, which was not sent until 12th July, Research Support replied that three years is a long time in open access and that the demand on RCUK funds was now significantly higher. (It later added that it was not in any case permitted to use RCUK funds to pay BPCs). Consequently, it suggested that the Faculty of Arts and Humanities be asked for money to pay the BPC. More than a month after Hall made contact (26th July), the Vice Dean Research said that he could not provide the funds either.</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>At this point, Hall had no option but to go back to the publisher and ask to revert to a traditional contract. She then negotiated with the publisher an option that would allow the book to be made OA after three years for a greatly reduced BPC. When she asked Research Support if they would pay this reduced fee they agreed. As such, it is not so much that Research Support eventually secured funds to cover the cost of the BPC, but that it secured a considerably lower sum in order for the book to be released after a three-year embargo. The book will not be freely available until 2023.</span></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span>With regard to Research Support having offered a “soft” commitment: when Hall was informed that the money would be made available to her she was told, “As you are funded by AHRC we are prepared to fund the whole cost of publication for your monograph from the RCUK block grant.” There was no indication here that the commitment would expire at some point in the future, or that it was “soft” (whatever that might mean). It would have been reasonable for Hall to assume that at that point the commitment was recorded in some file or document somewhere indicating that the BPC had been promised to her. It would now seem, however, that this is not the case and that King’s operates a first come first served system.

Stop by our booth and say hello! Dr. Karen Root, an Academic Editor for </em>PLOS ONE,<em> will also be in attendance. You can meet her at our booth on Monday, August 12 between 3 and 4pm. Here’s a brief interview with her. </em></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your area of study and what are you currently working on?</strong><br />
A: I originally began as behavioral ecologist but realized there were real issues in the population that I was studying related to human activities. Conservation biology drew me since it provided a way to utilize my ecological training to directly address some of those issues. My current research focuses on native species and the factors that imperil them, but also on the effects of restoration and management.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What first drew you into the field?</strong><br />
A: I have always been interested in the natural world around me, especially growing up in an urban center. During college I spent a summer at the Itasca Biological Station and fell in love with field work. In graduate school, I grew to appreciate techniques such as spatial analysis and population modeling that complemented the field studies. Conservation biology is a way to integrate all of these approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you share your thoughts on why this type of research is important? How does it affect other areas of research? Other communities?</strong><br />
A: I think of myself as a practical ecologist–basic ecological research is important but there are issues that need to be addressed. When I can demonstrate the societal value of my research, I receive more support, collaboration is more likely, and scientists and non-scientists alike are more receptive.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long have you been an editor on <em>PLOS ONE</em>? What have you enjoyed most about it?</strong><br />
A: I have only been an editor for a year, but it has been a very interesting experience and I have learned so much more about science communication.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why is <em>PLOS ONE</em> important to you and the ecology community?</strong><br />
A: I appreciate the inclusivity of <em>PLOS ONE</em>. It is very tempting to focus on one aspect of ecology or a particular subdiscipline but you would miss out on all of the other interesting research out there that can strengthen your own science.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What advice would you give to authors in your field who are getting ready to submit their work?</strong><br />
A: Read broadly. If I can understand a paper that is not in my area of expertise, then I can learn something important about how to write more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are you most looking forward to while attending ESA?</strong><br />

An investigation into participation in No Lights, No Lycra and its association with health and wellbeing</a></strong></p>
<p>Dancing is a performing art form whereby participants move their body in time to a rhythm (usually music). It is a physical activity that has been associated with improving fitness and physical wellbeing. An activity often enjoyed in childhood, it often falls away as we get older and relatively few people participate once they reach adulthood.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11177 alignleft" height="212" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/cheers-204742_1920-300x212.jpg" width="300" />
<p><a href="https://www.nolightsnolycra.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No lights, no lycra (NLNL)</a> is a global dance community that allows participants to indulge in free form dancing in the dark, providing a non-judgmental, inclusive and drug and alcohol free environment. It’s an activity that has gained popularity.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Foley <em>et al</em> have recently looked into the sort of people who participate in this activity. They collected information on their demographic characteristics, physical activity levels, motivations for doing the activity and what impact NLNL has had on their health and well-being.</p>
<p>This investigation was performed via a self-report online survey where each participant was asked to describe their experiences and motivations. This revealed that NLNL mostly attracts adult women who, by and large, are not particularly fit and have not historically engaged in much organised physical activity before.</p>
<p>This illustrates how an organised physical activity can be modified to appeal to a population that would not have otherwise been interested and highlights the need to understand how such modifications can motivate and maintain the engagement of people who would typically be inactive.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Health Services Research</em></strong><strong> – </strong><strong><a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-4353-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supporting access to healthcare for refugees and migrants in European countries under particular migratory pressure</a></strong></p>
<p>In 2015, countries in the European Union (EU) experienced an influx of over a million refugees and migrants; the so-called refugee crisis.</p>
<p>This resulted in an increase in migratory pressures; providing care for the most vulnerable groups created some significant challenges. In essence, refugees and migrants frequently found themselves with no effective healthcare. As a response to this, a study was performed by Chiarenza and colleagues to inform the development of a “resource package”, aiming to improve such access. This involved conducting interviews and focus groups in order to collect up-to-date information on the challenges different healthcare provides faced in relation to the refugee crisis, as well as a literature review on barriers to healthcare access and possible solutions.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11178 alignright" height="218" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/humanitarian-aid-939723_1280-300x218.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Researchers found that the barriers faced by refugees and migrants were due to challenges related to whether they had just arrived to a EU country, were in transit or whether they have reached their final destination. These challenges created, for example, legislative, financial and administrative barriers to healthcare, lack of reliable information on the health status of individuals, lack of knowledge of entitlements and what help was available, and lack of organization and co-ordination between different services. These issues were particularly acute when trying to access mental health, sexual health, child services or victim of violence care services.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that working with solutions developed to deal with emergencies often create a system that is both chaotic and fragmented, distracting from the need to develop changes in the EU health system to prevent vulnerable people from accessing healthcare.</p>

<p>Information technology (IT) has changed many aspects of how we communicate. This, in turn, has had a considerable impact on education, providing the means, for example, to access a wide range of multimedia learning resources. There are questions however surrounding whether there is enough evidence supporting the benefits of using IT tools for medical education and, in particular, whether the advance of learning in medical education is driven more by social behavior and cheap technology than improvement in outcomes.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11179 alignleft" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/whatsapp-3012138_1920-300x225.png" width="300" />
<p>Coleman and O’Conner recently performed a scoping review of a popular messaging and voice over IP service, WhatsApp, the aim of which being to see how it is used and evaluated as a tool in medical education. They performed two searches of the published literature, using the term “WhatsApp” as the search term. They discovered that WhatsApp was being used in implementing one of three different strategies – namely educational use with a pre-defined curriculum, educational use without a curriculum, or a primarily non-educational use.</p>
<p>There were some reports of an improvement in the learners knowledge after using WhatsApp as a learning tool, but there was little evidence for any learning theory being used. Coleman and O’Conner have taken the three strategies for WhatsApp use and developed their own model that draws on the Dabbagh and Bannan-Ritland’s exploration-enactment-evaluation learning design framework for online education, from which they propose their own instant messenger design model for medical education.</p>

<p>Brain development, in particular the expansion of brain tissue and development of advanced cognitive skills are characteristic of human evolution. It has been linked to nutrients that promote such development, including iodine. Rich sources of this critical nutrient can be found primarily in coastal areas. This thus raises the question of how early hominins in continental areas could have met their iodine requirements.</p>
<p>One way to try and answer this question is to study how hominoid primates today are able to source these nutrients.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-11104 alignright" height="207" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/06/bonobos-fishingCGB-300x200.png" width="311" />
<p>Bonobos are only found in the central region of the Congo basin, an area considered to be somewhat iodine deficient.</p>
<p>Hohmann and colleagues measured the mineral content of the fruit, terrestrial and aquatic herbs in the area, which showed that it was the aquatic herbs that contained most iodine and, importantly, two species in particular had iodine concentrations almost equivalent to that found in marine algae. This challenges the assumption that the Congo basin is iodine deficient and shows that it offers natural sources of the nutrient in concentrations high enough to prevent iodine deficiency in hominoids and humans.</p>

</div>
</center><p>Now that we are about a year into the project, we have <a class="reference external" href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig">quite a bit of software
ready for users to use</a>. Here
is a dump of the complete list (find your tool!):</p>
<p>auryn, bionetgen, biosig4c++, calcium-calculator, COPASI, ctk, dcm2niix, dcmtk, DiffusionKurtosisFit, dlib, drawtk, gdcm, getdp, gifticlib, InsightToolkit, isis, libb64, liblsl, libminc, libneurosim, libsbml, nest, neuron, neurord, nipy-data, octave-metch, openigtlink, openmeeg, openvibe, petpvc, python-airspeed, python-amico, python-baker, python-bids-validator, python-biopython, python-brian2, python-chaospy, python-citeproc-py, python-dipy, python-duecredit, python-elephant, python-fastavro, python-fsleyes, python-fsleyes-props, python-fsleyes-widgets, python-fslpy, python-grabbit, python-gradunwarp, python-h5io, python-hdfs, python-hdmf, python-indexed_gzip, python-interfile, python-klusta, python-lazyarray, python-libNeuroML, python-matplotlib-scalebar, python-missingno, python-mne, python-mne-bids, python-moss, python-neo, python-neurosynth, python-nibabel, python-nilearn, python-nineml, python-nipy, python-nistats, python-nitime, python-nixio, python-num2words, python-patsy, python-petlink, python-pyactivetwo, python-pybids, python-pydicom, python-pydotplus, python-pyelectro, python-pyemd, python-pyfim, python-pygiftiio, python-pylatex, python-PyLEMS, python-PyLink, python-pymatreader, python-pynwb, python-pyoptical, python-pyphi, python-pyriemann, python-pysb, python-pyscaffold, python-pytest-lazy-fixture, python-pytest-sugar, python-pyxid, python-quantities, python-rangehttpserver, python-resumable-urlretrieve, python-simplewrap, python-tabulate, python-transforms3d, python-tvb-data, python-tvb-gdist, python-visionegg-quest, python-wxnatpy, python-xnat, rubygem-nifti, rudeconfig, smoldyn, teem, vrpn, vxl.</p>
<p>All of these tools can now be used in three simple steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install a Fedora system. You can get the installable image from
<a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">https://getfedora.org</a>.</li>
<li>Install your software! For example: <code>sudo dnf install python-fsleyes</code>.</li>
<li>Get to work!</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though it is only three steps, it could still be made simpler. What if we
could have a Fedora Remix that you could simply download and use?</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-fedora-spin-lab">
<h2>What is a Fedora Spin/Lab?</h2>
<p>The Fedora community produces three "editions" that are featured on
<a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">https://getfedora.org</a>. However, these are not all! The community is full of
volunteers with different interests, and so we also produce lots of secondary
products---Fedora <a class="reference external" href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org">Spins</a> and Fedora <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org">Labs</a>. They are both downloadable images
like the Fedora editions, with the difference being that they are contain
different software sets.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org">Spins</a> for example, include different default
desktop environments: KDE, LXDE, LXQT, and so on. The <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org">Labs</a> consist of
different "functional bundles", for different target audiences: Astronomy,
Design, Games, Security, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="neurofedora-lab">
<h2>NeuroFedora Lab?</h2>
<p>So, the plan now is to have a similar downloadable image for <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>. If
not a single image, maybe two: one each for the two main functional classes:
one for computational modelling, and one for neuroimaging. So, effectively that
will mean the process would become even simpler for users:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download the image (and optionally install it).</li>
<li>Get to work!</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's why installing is optional. All Fedora images are "Live". This means
that you don't really need to install them to use them. You can boot into them
off a USB drive and use them straight away---without installing them on a
computer.  This could be very very useful for tutorials and hackathons where
the organisers could have a bunch of these images ready for users to work on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-are-looking-for-a-spin-lab-master">
<h2>We are looking for a Spin/Lab master</h2>
<p>So, we are looking for someone to manage the image. We have a small team
already, but we would like to keep the team focussed on including more
software---<a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?status=Open&amp;tags=T%3A+Software">there are still 160 tools in queue</a>.</p>
<p>The Spin/Lab master shall:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>help decide what tools should be included in the image,</li>
<li>lead the effort by using existing Fedora community infrastructure to create
the images,</li>
<li>ensure the images are always functional and ready to use,</li>
<li>poke the rest of the team when needed to fix issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time commitment would be: 2-3 hours a week.</p>
<p>What skills do you need for this? None---like all other tasks, you can learn on
the go. In general, you will use/learn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Git (since most things in Fedora now use Git),</li>
<li>how to create a "kickstart" recipe---the configuration file that defines what
the image contains. This is very well documented and mostly, you only have to
copy paste the recipe off another image and tweak it.</li>
<li>how to use the Fedora community infrastructure to build these images---this
is also quite easy since there are helper tools for all of it. All you have
to do is run the commands in the right order.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is quite an easy role, and there are lots of people in the Fedora community
who would be happy to help when needed. There is a whole <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Spins_SIG">Spins Special
Interest Group (SIG)</a>, as a matter
of fact. The toughest bit would be learning the process that is to be followed.</p>
<p>Does that sound interesting? Do you want to learn new skills and help us make
<a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> better and easier for neuroscience enthusiasts? Have any
questions? <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/">Get in touch with us</a>!</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help">here</a>.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/thrivership-cover-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Why is this study important?</strong></h3>
<p>Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is a serious public health issue, threatening the health of individuals the world over. While men can also experience DVA, women are disproportionately affected. Around <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30% of women worldwide</a> who have been in a romantic relationship report having experienced violence at the hands of their partner, and in the UK <a href="https://1q7dqy2unor827bqjls0c4rn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Femicide-Census-of-2017.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a woman is killed</a> by her current or former male partner every four days.</p>
<h3><strong>What is thrivership?</strong></h3>
<p>The purpose of our study was to explore the concept of ‘thrivership’ with women who have experienced DVA. Thrivership is an emerging field and refers to the progression of the victim from surviving DVA to truly overcoming the trauma of abuse. Following <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-98440-000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gondolf and Fisher’s ‘survivor theory’</a> in the late 1980s, ‘survivor’ replaced ‘victim’ as the preferred term to refer to individuals who have experienced DVA.  Although originally viewed as a positive shift, this terminology was not optimal for a number of reasons. ‘Survivor’ <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07399339509516194" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">centralizes abuse</a> in the lives of affected individuals, serving as a reminder of past negative experiences and thus hindering full recovery. It also fails to explore the more long-term recovery from abuse, focusing instead on more-immediate freedom.</p>
<p>‘Thrivership’ offers a resolution to these issues: it denotes prosperity and growth on an upward trajectory. Ultimately, our goal should be to eliminate DVA. In the meantime, however, public health professionals should strive to empower and support women to thrive after long-term after abuse, not simply – and in some cases barely – survive the experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s very easy to move from being a victim to survivor to thinking that you’re there and thriving and then it’s… so easy for that to be knocked right back to the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several studies over the past 15 years provide some insight into thriving post-DVA, predominantly as a transformative process rather than an outcome. Beyond this, though, available literature on thriving offers little information about how women can be supported through this process. We are left wondering what thriving means to women beyond a spiritual or theory-based experience. What are the practical implications of thrivership? What do women need to thrive? How can healthcare professionals provide support and services to facilitate thrivership?</p>
<h3><strong>What did we do?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2018, we conducted a qualitative study consisting of six focus groups and four in-depth interviews with thirty-seven women. Participants were recruited from a domestic abuse charity in Birmingham, England, which provides empowerment and recovery programs for women who have experienced DVA. Participants were from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, faiths, and age groups. All had experienced abuse by a male intimate partner.</p>
<p>Discussions during data collection explored women’s thoughts about the progression from ‘victim’ to ‘survivor’, then ‘survivor’ to ‘thriver’; how they viewed the recovery process; what thriving post-abuse featured or meant to them; and what could be done to encourage thrivership post-abuse. Data were analysed thematically.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we find?</strong></h3>
<p>Our findings show that there are clear differences between the victim, survivor, and thriver ‘stages’ for women, ranging from highly negative connotations through to very positive. During the victim stage, women said they had “no self-esteem” and felt “powerless” and “isolated.” During the survivor stage they had “escaped” and felt “freedom” but experienced “guilt” and “hardships.” By the thriver stage women reported that they experienced “acceptance,” felt “free,” had developed “self-confidence,” and were “in control” of their lives.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all women reported that the thrivership process was fluid; it was easy for something or someone to “knock you off your thriver line,” although this became less frequent over time. As one participant put it: “I’ve been through everything in a year… and it’s very easy to move from being a victim to survivor to thinking that you’re there and thriving and then it’s… so easy for that to be knocked right back to the beginning.” Long-term, flexible support for survivors and a wider change in societal awareness were therefore highlighted as important by participants.</p>

<h3><strong>The Thrivership Model</strong></h3>
<p>Thriving was ultimately characterized by a positive and forward-looking outlook, improved health and well-being, a reclamation of the self, and new social networks. Three key components were crucial to ensuring women reached thrivership, which we propose as the Thrivership Model (Figure 1): (1) Provision of Safety, (2) Sharing the Story, (3) Social Response. These components are underpinned by vital education and building of awareness at different levels. The Thrivership Model illustrates what is required from DVA-services and public health practitioners to facilitate thrivership.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the <a href="https://birminghamfreedomproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Birmingham Freedom Project (BFP)</a> for working with us on this project. The BFP delivers a unique combination of awareness and empowerment programs for women affected by DVA. Programs are delivered by two female facilitators who have also experienced abuse themselves. The service offers long-term support to women who attend their programs, and free, unlimited access to services. The project’s ongoing support was cited as integral to women’s continuing progress, as was the benefit of being able to meet and talk with others who have experienced abuse.</p>

Lulea University of Technology is a dark and violent place, according to these victim accounts. Bullying, blackmail, sexual nepotism, robbery and even threats of physical violence and even of murder are not unheard of. LTU leadership seems to be part of the problem, and money plays a role.

<p>The 2015 World Alzheimer <a href="https://www.alz.co.uk/research/WorldAlzheimerReport2015.pdf">Report</a> on the global impact of dementia states there are over 9.9 million new cases of dementia each year worldwide, which implies one new case every 3.2 seconds.</p>
<p>In 2015, the estimated number of people living with dementia was 22.9 million in Asia, 10.5 million in Europe, 4 million in Africa, and 9.4 million in the Americas. As baby boomers reach older age, numbers are set to double every twenty years.</p>
<p>The statistics made for disturbing reading and the 2015 report on dementia sums up how many of us feel:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dementia is highly stigmatised and universally feared. It is often perceived as a normal part of ageing, and that no actions can be taken to prevent or treat it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Although stats vary by country, <em>your</em> absolute risk is probably not as high as you fear.</h2>
<p>In the UK, about two in 100 (two per cent) of people aged between sixty-five to sixty-nine have dementia; this figure rises to one in five (twenty per cent) for those aged between eighty-five to eighty-nine.</p>
<p>The majority of centenarian studies report rates of dementia in the extremely old as sitting somewhere between forty-five and sixty-five per cent, with the Sydney Centenarian Study finding rates are consistent with this finding.</p>
<p>On the upside, eighty per cent of people in their eighties, and nearly half of centenarians remain dementia-free.</p>
<p>So contrary to popular belief, dementia is <em>not</em> a natural or inevitable consequence of ageing.</p>
<h2>Dementia is a disease, and while there is no cure, there are steps you can take to tip the brain health scales in your favour.</h2>
<p>In late 2015, an international team <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26294005">pooled data</a> from 323 studies including over 5000 people and ninety-three identified factors thought to influence risk for Alzheimer’s disease, many of which also increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. The most significant harm was heavy smoking, whereas healthy diet was protective.</p>
<p>A total of nine modifiable harms were identified that caused sixty-six per cent of AD cases globally.</p>
<h2>For men and women the 9 modifiable risk factors for AD were:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Being obese</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Carotid atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)</li>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>Low education (not completing secondary school)</li>
<li>High total homocysteine level</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Frailty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly for women, oestrogen therapy, which included the oral contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy, <em>protected</em> against AD.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26294005">paper</a> concluded with a startling statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two in three dementia cases worldwide are preventable.</p></blockquote>
<h2>More women than men develop Alzheimer’s or other dementias.</h2>
<p>In September 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released a<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3303.0"> report</a> stating dementia is the leading cause of death among Australian women. For men, dementia took out number two spot, right behind heart disease. The ABS warn that as treatments for heart disease improve, and men live longer, healthier lives, dementia will likely surpass heart disease as the leading cause of death for men too.</p>
<p>There are a number of potential biological and social reasons for this fact.</p>
<p>One prevailing view that, on average, women live longer than men, and getting older is the greatest risk factor for AD. Or to put it simply – there are more older women alive than old men, so there are more cases of AD.</p>
<p>A related reason is men’s ‘survival bias’. Men have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and stroke than women, so those men who live to old age tend to be much healthier than women of the same age and therefore have lesser risks of developing AD.</p>
<p>Another well-known genetic risk factor for AD is the gene APOE-e4. A 2017 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846757">meta-analysis</a> of nearly 58,000 people found women with particular versions of the APOE-e4 may be more likely to develop AD than men, but only between the ages of ages 65 and 75 years.</p>
<p>One final reason often given to account for the sex difference in risk is low education in women. The more years schooling you received, the lower your risk of developing AD, and the fact women born before the 1950s completed fewer years schooling than men may have rendered their brains more vulnerable to the disease.</p>
<p>We are privileged to live in a world where life expectancy is increasing; and the ageing population, which worries so many people, is actually one of humanity’s greatest achievements.</p>
<h2>Dementia has become humanity’s brain health problem.</h2>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9975">"Clock-like" Neurons Discovered At Last?</a></h4>

The brain is buzzing with gamma oscillations - cycles of neuronal activity with a frequency (around 40-60 Hz) higher than that of other major brain waves.



A longstanding hypothesis is that gamma serves as a kind of 'clock signal' that enables the coordination and integration of signals. Gamma has even been proposed as the mechanism by which the brain 'binds' information from different brain areas into a unitary consciousness.



However, while the gamma-clock hypothesis is intriguing, direct

<img alt="Sheep in Norway" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Sheep-Norway-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h4>Tell us about paratuberculosis, what is it, how does it spread and how does it affect animals and humans?</h4>
<p>Paratuberculosis, or Johne’s disease, is caused by bacteria (<em>Mycobacterium avium, </em>subspecies <em>paratuberculosis</em>) similar to the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) in animals and humans. Paratuberculosis mainly affects the intestine whereas TB usually affects the lungs. This important difference means that paratuberculosis is mainly spread through feces whereas TB is mainly spread by coughing.</p>
<p>Paratuberculosis commonly affects ruminants, including cattle, sheep, goats, and deer, but a wide range of domestic and wild animals are also susceptible to the disease. We believe that most livestock become infected up to the age of about two years, with the main risk period being the first weeks of life.</p>
<p>The infection begins with the bacteria penetrating the lining of the gut and then spreading to other organs through the blood and lymphatic systems. The bacteria can be shed in the feces and in milk. Here, young animals can easily become infected by accidentally consuming bacteria from colostrum or milk or by ingesting feces, for example off of a dirty teat or from pasture. The bacteria then multiply inside special immune cells called macrophages, disabling them by causing them to clump together. This can cause the bowel to thicken, leading to chronic problems with bowel function and weight loss, and eventually the death of 10-20% of infected animals.</p>

<p>Paratuberculosis bacteria can also infect humans. Some researchers believe that the bacteria could be involved in the development of Crohn’s disease (a chronic inflammatory bowel disease). Paratuberculosis bacteria <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.20967" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been isolated from the intestines of children with Crohn’s disease</a>, and the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067360417058X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blood of Crohn’s disease patients</a> but it’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S095026881500076X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not certain whether these bacteria cause Crohn’s disease</a>.</p>
<h4>Your study collated a considerable amount of data from 48 countries worldwide, how did you build such an extensive network of researchers to produce this work?</h4>
<p>The research team was built by something called “snowball sampling”, a method typically used by social science surveys. However, it seemed to be a good way to find “rare” experts from around the world, to expand my network of contacts. I guessed that other people would know different experts, and those experts would know others. This process was closely supervised, by setting out criteria for formal inclusion in the study team and sending regular updates to keep everything on track.</p>
<p>To collect the data for our study, paratuberculosis experts were asked to complete a survey which collected data from their own countries. The survey was successful with around 80% of experts invited agreeing to take part, with a very low dropout rate. I think everyone believed it was an important topic and had the same questions in their minds as I did. The time from the original concept for the study to publication of the paper was about 18 months.</p>
<h4>The survey was completed by experts in the paratuberculosis field, what were their experiences of taking part?</h4>
<blockquote><p>In the absence of national control programs, prevalence and severity continue to increase in the huge ruminant population. This study establishes Johne’s disease as a ‘global emergency’ facing domestic livestock.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was very clear to me that our colleagues in other developing countries were delighted to have been invited to participate and to have their contributions valued, here are some of their thoughts on the project:</p>
<p>“This was very easy to agree to be part of because the topic is “one of my babies” and it was likely that the orchestration of the project would see it completed” –<strong>Søren Nielsen</strong></p>
<p>“For those of us working with control programs, we share lots of information informally.  It’s nice to have a published manuscript that we can cite when we refer to the work that we do.” –<strong>David Kelton</strong></p>
<p>“It was a great experience to be part of such a broad and inclusive team writing this paper. Even though our backgrounds are pretty variable, we are globally facing the same challenges and uncertainties in controlling paratuberculosis. Thus, colleagues from around the globe do recognize that cooperation rather than competition is the way forward. The team was very much prepared to share available knowledge, information, and experiences.” –<strong>Maarten Weber</strong></p>
<p>“It was a great experience to be part of this first international initiative to get a picture of 48 countries. In the absence of national control programs, prevalence and severity continue to increase in the huge ruminant population. This study establishes Johne’s disease as a ‘global emergency’ facing domestic livestock.” –<strong>Shoor Vir Singh</strong></p>
<p>“When informing stakeholders about paratuberculosis control it is good to be able to tell them what has been done already and what was learned by the different approaches. This might help to streamline a new control program and to avoid mistakes which have been already made by others”. –<strong>Suzanne Eisenberg</strong></p>
<h4>Your study found that in around half of the countries surveyed, 20% of herds and flocks were infected with paratuberculosis. How does the treatment of this disease compare with other livestock diseases?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Paratuberculosis is of great concern because there is no treatment, it builds up over time and can reach high levels of prevalence within a herd or flock. It spreads between herds and flocks and it does not die out by itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a complex question. Infectious diseases can be divided into those that are exotic (do not regularly occur in a country or region but pop up once in a while) or endemic (occur in a lot of herds most of the time). There are common diseases that affect almost every herd or flock from time to time, but there are often treatments or vaccines to prevent these and so they are considered to be routine matters for farmers (examples include internal parasitic diseases, clostridial diseases, and mastitis).</p>
<p>In comparison, paratuberculosis is of great concern because there is no treatment, it builds up over time and can reach high levels of prevalence within a herd or flock. It spreads between herds and flocks and it does not die out by itself. Over time the impacts of production loss and mortality worsen. It takes years for this to occur and so it can go unnoticed until infection rates are quite high. Therefore, livestock trade during this long incubation period can enhance the spread of disease.</p>
<h4>What do you think are the main barriers and facilitators to the control of paratuberculosis?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Paratuberculosis control could be greatly enhanced if vaccines were adopted more widely.</p></blockquote>
<p>While a lack of accurate diagnostic tests is often cited as a barrier, a larger one is a lack of leadership at national and international levels. Many developing countries look to the <a href="http://www.oie.int/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)</a> for guidance on disease priorities and approaches to control. For paratuberculosis, there is no international code, creating the impression that the disease is ‘not important’.</p>
<p>For developed countries, with high rates of paratuberculosis, it is convenient not to have any specific international guidelines because they can continue to sell live animals to any country prepared to accept their livestock. Import testing requirements are set at the importing-country level and sometimes they are meaningless. For example, young animals with subclinical infections are likely to test negative and so can be imported.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11159" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Farmer checking on cattle" class="wp-image-11159 size-large" height="274" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/15636971561_b9776a3e6d_k-1024x438.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Source: CGIAR Climate</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Paratuberculosis control could be greatly enhanced if vaccines were adopted more widely. The existing commercial vaccines are quite effective <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02882.x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">but can cause interference with TB skin testing</a>. This is something that requires international guidance as well as research and development of better tests for TB.</p>
<h4>In your study, you found that of the countries surveyed, 22 had formal control programs. How can these countries support others without formal control programs in place?</h4>
<blockquote><p>There is an urgent need for a set of generic guidelines developed by experts that can be refined according to each country’s unique needs and practices.</p></blockquote>
<p>The design of control programs and the experiences amongst countries were often quite different, varying according to the burden of disease, animal husbandry practices, and the diverse ways that animal disease control is organized locally. But there is great expertise that could be leveraged if some method of formal coordination was in place.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for a set of generic guidelines developed by experts that can be refined according to each country’s unique needs and practices. There is already an initiative from the dairy industry called the “<a href="https://store.fil-idf.org/product/bulletin-idf-n-493-2018-proceedings-6th-paratuberculosis-forum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ParaTB Forum</a>” which has provided a nice opportunity for sharing experiences between countries, but this needs to be expanded to cover all types of livestock.</p>
<p>There may also be an opportunity to link paratuberculosis control activity with TB control in the future. This would be an efficient use of human resources because both require a great deal of on-farm work, individual animal testing, and interaction with farmers.</p>
<h4>You mention that different countries have different objectives for controlling the disease, with some Scandinavian countries aiming to eradicate it. Do you think this will be achievable in the long term?</h4>
<p>Yes, but this depends on several factors, for example, the amount of trade between herds in the population. Eradication has been confirmed in practice and is predicted by modeling. Sweden appears to have achieved eradication and maintained freedom from paratuberculosis infection. It is in a uniquely favorable position by using this form of surveillance strategy, and it is true that Norway is in a similar position. Other countries like Japan have implemented strong measures designed to get the bacterium out of the food chain, since every cow on farms in Japan must be tested.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11166" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Sheep" class="wp-image-11166 size-medium" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/sheep-2625347_960_720-300x201.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image Soure: Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Vaccination of sheep has been very effective in reducing the disease to negligible levels (but not zero), confirmed through <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.08.064" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rigorous long-term studies</a>. Initially, it is important to implement control measures to reduce the burden of the disease before thinking about eradication. Eradication may be possible in some countries, but realistically this should only be a long-term goal. The rate of exchange of animals between herds is so high that eradication will not be feasible unless the industry is prepared to reform and strongly reduce the trade of individual animals between herds.</p>
<h4>What steps can farmers living in countries without formal control programs take to protect their livestock?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Farmers should be formally educated about the precautions they should take when purchasing replacement livestock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paratuberculosis is a problem but it ranks quite low in terms of farmer interest and focus. Farmers should be formally educated about the precautions they should take when purchasing replacement livestock. Advice could include that it is best to purchase animals from farms that are demonstrated to have a high probability of freedom of paratuberculosis through objective certification of the entire herd /flock, rather than to buy individual “test negative” animals from farms of unknown status. Nevertheless, these certification programs exist in only some countries.</p>

<h4>An Actual Scientific Case for Brain Simulations</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*_rCPryBOhhHc2gzYIXBAAA.jpeg" />Jaffa cakes. Important for simulating the brain.</figure><p>Brains are messily complex bags of cells. Cobbled together by evolution over half a billion years or more, the bauplan of the mammalian brain is a bolted together mish-mash of bits that work in tandem to keep you alive long enough to procreate.</p><p>Say you wanted to understand how one of those bits of the brain work, understand what it is they do. Then you have to chose where you want to sit in the pecking order of neuroscience. You can do experiments on the bit of the brain. You can write down theories in maths for what that bit of brain will do, whose predictions you can then compare to experiment (if you can be bothered to dirty your beautiful theory with data). Or you can simulate that bit of the brain in code. The triumvirate: experiment, theory, and simulation. And as the good book says, the least of these is simulation. At least, according to the lack of simulation studies in the glam-mag journals, the lack of support from funders, and the lack of invited talks at neuroscience conferences.</p><p>So it was heartening to see a piece in <em>Neuron</em> recently with the grand title “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627319302909?via%3Dihub">The Scientific Case for Brain Simulations</a>”. A rare opportunity in a high profile venue to make a cast iron case for why one should build models of bits of the brain.</p><p>And it failed. Conspicuously absent from this “Scientific Case” was Science. Indeed the piece spent much of its generous 10 pages on discussing technical issues with simulators — the code used to build a model — and not discussing why one should want to build such a model. This is like titling a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-38985820">controversial editorial</a> “Why a Jaffa Cake Is a Biscuit”, then spending most of your word limit writing about the wrapper.</p><p>Which is a shame, as the authors were spot on in their intentions. Building simulations of brain circuits needs a robust defence. Over the past decade the most high-profile work on brain simulations has come from the Blue Brain Project and its red-rag-to-a-bull named successor, the Human Brain Project. Both have been heavily, deeply criticised (most recently, in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/ten-years-human-brain-project-simulation-markram-ted-talk/594493/">The Atlantic</a>). Including <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/how-to-spend-a-billion-euros-on-the-brain-a79122891879">by me</a>, and I build these kinds of model. They have absorbed fantastic amounts of cash, to feed the towering ambition of building a one-to-one scale model of 30,000 neurons in the hindpaw region of a teenage rat. Such follies give the impression that building a brain simulation is tantamount to yelling “WE DON’T HAVE A THEORY” in the face of passing scientists.</p><p>We can do better than this. So I’ll try. Here’s a slightly-better scientific case for brain simulations. With biscuits.</p><p>Let’s start with The Biological Imitation Game (copyright <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415012623">Koch &amp; Buice</a>). The <em>Neuron</em> piece got this part spot on. Building detailed models of a brain region will give you detailed facsimiles of neural activity — spikes from neurons, local field potentials, perhaps more. The better you can capture and recapitulate neural activity from experiments, the more closely your model imitates reality. Fooling an expert, so they cannot tell which is neural activity from your model and which is from the real thing, wins you the Biological Imitation Game.</p><p>(Slight flaw here is we can always cheat. For one thing, we could train an arbitrary deep neural network to generate as output spike trains that look like cortical neurons. Indistinguishable, but sod all to do with the brain. Indeed, the powerful data analysis methods <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0109-9">LFADS </a>(latent factor analysis via dynamical systems) is essentially this idea — training a recurrent neural network to reproduce single neuron activity — used instead as tool for understanding, by uncovering what network dynamics could underpin the observed data).</p><p>Doing well at the Biological Imitation Game opens the door to doing science. A good brain simulation is a virtual preparation. One in which we can do virtual experiments. Experiments at impossibly high rates, or that are just impossible in animals. We can remove any neuron we like. We can alter any property of a neuron we like. We can test <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llin%C3%A1s%27s_law">Llinas Law</a>, swapping cortical neurons for thalamic neurons, and seeing if it makes a difference. We can simulate how different optogenetic protocols will change the dynamics of neural activity. We can simulate drugs that block or stimulate receptors, and their effects on neural activity. All these virtual experiments make real predictions.</p><p>But these are all biophysics. They are the mechanics of what happens to property X of neurons when we change property Y. The scope of brain simulations are much richer. Fourteen times richer.</p><p>In “<a href="http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/12.html">Why Model?</a>”, Joshua Epstein gives fourteen reasons for building computer models beyond “predict”. For he, as I, discount “predict” as a primary driver. Let’s dive into a few.</p><p>(Well, he actually gave sixteen, but Epstein is writing as an agent-based modeller of society. So his reasons include “Discipline the policy dialogue”. I know we all love brains, but frankly studying the salt sensitive neurons in <em>C Elegans</em>, or whether neurons in the prefrontal cortex of a rat uses a population code, isn’t much use for the policy issues that beset society. While in principle brain simulations could one day inform how we intervene, drug, or treat neurological disorders, we’re a long way off. And the other irrelevant reason? “Offer crisis options in near real-time”. Again, not relevant. At least, not until Elon Musk accidentally creates Skynet out of his Neuralinked clientele, in a cruel irony.)</p><p>One reason for building models is to understand, not predict. We can derive predictions from our models after we’ve used them for more enlightened science. I’d wager Hodgkin and Huxley did not build their model of action potential generation in the squid giant axon to make predictions. They built it to understand how the essential building blocks they and others had discovered experimentally — the dependence on sodium and potassium, the shape of the voltage change, and so on — fit together to make a spike. With that understanding in place, we’ve derived endless predictions from that model since then, and new insights into how neurons work.</p><p>Related to understand is explain, especially unintuitive phenomena or complex mechanisms. Brain simulations are ideally suited to this task. For example,<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08085.x"> we showed </a>that deep brain simulation for Parkinson’s disease could work because of the stochastic nature of wiring between neurons in the basal ganglia. By paying attention to the details of the basal ganglia‘s circuit, we could show that deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus causes a complex mix of responses in downstream nuclei thanks to the randomness of wiring alone. And some of those responses “reset” neurons to their pre-Parkinson’s state. Equally compelling theories of how deep brain stimulation works have also been worked out in <a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/89/11/1181">detailed circuit simulations.</a> (See also Jonathan Rubin’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438816302690?via%3Dihub">exposition for why biology matters</a> when using models to understand the basal ganglia).</p><p>Closely related to explain is test. Test ideas and theories. Say I wanted to claim that neurons in region X of cortex repeated precise patterns of spikes. That a neuron produced a particular pattern of spikes far more often than chance, according to experimental data. And this pattern is somehow its code. Well, then we can turn to a circuit model and ask: under what conditions would this model predict that such a set of repeated patterns appear? And the answer will be: hardly ever. For it would require that a large, recurrently wired collection of neurons repeats exactly the same state of its dynamics multiple times. This is vanishingly unlikely. So a circuit model here says that to claim cortex encodes by precisely repeated patterns of spikes is unlikely to be a correct hypothesis.</p><p>More generally, we might ask: can the dynamics necessary to encode information by medium X — spike timing, counts, latencies etc — be supported in a simulated circuit that respects the details of cortex? With NMDA receptors; or proper anatomy — layers, and connection probabilities, and more. With adaptation in the spiking of pyramidal neurons; or those pesky interneurons that sadly are not just a pyramidal neuron with a minus sign in front?</p><p>I can find few examples of this kind of test-theory-against-the-details applied to the cortex (notable exceptions include the work emanating from Wolfgang Maass’ group e.g. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003311">this</a>; and a recent paper from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006781">Duarte and Morrison</a> on the computational capacity of circuit models of layers 2 and 3 of cortex). Outside of cortex, this kind of work has been done to death. The hypothesis that the basal ganglia implement some kind of “selection” device has been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3486-06.2006">mercilessly tested </a>against the reality of the basal ganglia’s biophysics, and <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16571765">replicated</a> by <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/3/6/ENEURO.0156-16.2016">multiple</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10827-013-0476-2">groups</a>. And I’ve lost count of the number of models purporting to explain how the wiring and dynamics of the hippocampus and friends can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315006285?via%3Dihub">create grid cells in entorhinal cortex.</a> But that’s great — we have this wealth of models, falling into different classes of mechanisms, that each can make different predictions. Science, great science, with brain simulations.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*xzrfoZPj_6hF1BDCr3cHWQ.jpeg" />Well done, you’ve made it half way through this essay. Have a biscuit.</figure><p>Neuroscience has deep reasons for building brain simulations that go beyond Epstein’s list.</p><p>One is to synthesise. On his quiet days, when he wasn’t spouting about simulating a human brain in ten years time or using one-to-one scale models of the rodent cortex to tackle autism, this is what Henry Markram claimed as the main rationale for the Blue Brain Project. And rightly so. Each experimental study of a bit of brain, as tough as it is to do, is one data-point. In one aspect of what that bit of brain is or does. Brain simulations are how we bring all those data-points together. This synthesis lets us do many things.</p><p>We can find out the known unknowns — what we need to know, but don’t. Better, we can test the compatibility of all the data-points on one aspect — like the measurements of individual ion channels in a Purkinje cell or Martinotti cell. When we strap them together into a single model, it becomes immediately apparent if something goes awry.</p><p>A sparkling case study of model synthesis is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2735">Eve Marder’s work</a> with Astrid Prinz and others on solving the conundrum of lobster stomach dynamics. They work on a small circuit of neurons that controls movement of the lobster (and crab) stomach, a circuit that has<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.physiol.69.031905.161516"> yielded many fundamental insights</a> into how neurons work together. The conundrum is that this circuit has a characteristic oscillation in all animals; yet between animals the neurons vary wildly in their expression of ion channels and in the strengths of the connections between them. To address this problem, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1352">Prinz built millions of detailed circuit models</a>, each one a different lobster: each model sampled from the enormous space of known variations in ion channels and connections. And the solution to the conundrum turned out to be simple. Most of their zoo of model lobsters had the characteristic oscillation. The simulated models were showing us that the biological circuit controlling the lobster stomach is degenerate, can achieve the same end-goal — the oscillation — by many different solutions. A beautiful use of brain simulations to show the beautiful robustness of biology. And to show the laziness of evolution, which evidently can’t be bothered to evolve a tight genetic specification for the lobster stomach circuit, knowing it can just throw together any old thing and it will probably turn out okay in the end.</p><p>Even better, we can test the compatibility of different data speaking to the same theory. One small example is<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002034"> our test of the canonical theory</a> for how reinforcement learning operates in the brain: dopamine released in response to unexpected reward controls changes to the strength of connections from cortex to the striatum, which thereby alters the probability of choosing the reward-eliciting action in the future (because the striatum is the gatekeeper for the basal ganglia, which we’ve already learnt are something to do with the selection of actions). The truth of that theory rests on data drawn from many different areas of research being compatible: the <em>in vivo</em> data supporting the reward prediction error theory of dopamine; the<em> in vitro</em> data on the complex rules of spike-time dependent changes at the cortico-striatal synapse; the confusing mass of data on how dopamine gates plasticity at a single synapse; and the evidence that striatum controls action selection. So we made a model to incorporate all that data and ask if they do fit together. Which they did. Which was nice.</p><p>The scientific case for brain simulations revolves around a series of simple ideas. Brain simulations can act as virtual bits of brain, to do amazing, impossible virtual experiments. But are so much more: the basis of understanding; explanations of how and why; tests of ideas and hypotheses and theories; synthesisers of data; and the way to test the coherence of entire research fields.</p><p>Some may find the above arguments compelling. Some may not. Even when made well, and I don’t flatter myself that this particular case was made well, the scientific case for brain simulations is often misunderstood or dismissed. Perhaps you’re rolling your eyes right now. And that’s a fair reaction. The eternal problem with making the case for brain simulations is that the people who get the most scientific insight from them are those who build them.</p><p>I have learnt incalculable amounts about the brain and its workings from the process of building circuit models of its different bits. Far more than I have learnt from reading papers.</p><p>For the process reveals hidden things — innocuous-looking assumptions with major ramifications, the unexpected power of a small biological detail, mechanisms unconsidered. Because building a brain stimulation forces you to face up to the brain in its terrifying complexity and think hard. Which all means much of the scientific case for brain simulations comes in the making, not the running; the creating, not the numerics. And these insights are so tough to convey in a scientific paper. For they do not fit into the neat Methods/Results/Discussion triad of the classic paper. Little wonder that many brain simulation papers will contain somewhere “the conceptual contribution of this work is…”. That’s a computational scientists plea, saying: “the main scientific insight from our model is not in the Results. It is the model itself, it is what we found on the way; the model is the idea — the simulations are demonstrations of that idea. Please, read with that in mind.”</p><p>And that’s perhaps exactly why we still, endlessly, repeatedly, have to make the scientific case for brain simulations. Because we modellers often fail to do so in the papers we write. We perhaps need to work harder to explain what we have done, and what we have learnt, and what we are contributing. But it’s tough. If you think reading modelling papers is tough, try writing one. So the next time you take a deep breath and plunge bravely into a paper about a model that simulates a bit of brain, give a little thought to the poor souls who wrote it, and dig a little deeper. The science is there, somewhere — it just might not be where you were expecting.</p><p><em>Want more?

Arrange your fingers like the image below, and then look at them closely.



From Bertamini (2019) i-Perception



Do you notice anything odd?



Psychologist Marco Bertamini of the University of Liverpool describes this test in a fun new paper. According to Bertamini, seven of the ten people he surveyed reported that their little fingers clearly appeared to be 'too far away', to the extent that they did not appear to be part of their hands.



Bertamini suggests that the illusion is caused by

Women are not being sponsored by male leaders for a variety of reasons, including perceived inappropriateness. </span></li><li><strong>Male leaders sincerely seek change.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At each of the events, the men who attended expressed interest in increasing the proportion of women in leadership roles but felt a lack of clarity in the best way for them to effect change. As shown in the </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/pages/solutions/buyers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 EY survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, men may not realize which steps have the highest impact on women’s career progression — and more structured communication is important for change.</span></li><li><strong>Compared to large pharma, smaller biotechs have a greater percentage of women in leadership roles.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A possible </span><a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-report/top-10-women-biotech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reason for this trend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that biotechs are more purely results-driven, creating an environment where a leader’s achievements and potential are valued, consciously or unconsciously, more highly than their network connections.</span></li></ul><h3> </h3><h3><b>The path forward</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to define the characteristics of a great R&amp;D leader, especially in a large company, and difficult to pinpoint the sort of background required for such a position. The CEO of GSK came from commercial, not a scientific, background, and the CEO-to-be of Vertex is currently their Chief Medical Officer. Perhaps, because of this lack of definition, diversity programs at large companies have had relatively little success at increasing the number of women in the most senior roles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts like those of Science Exchange to document authentically how men got these roles and what the roles actually require in terms of skills and daily demands can contribute to developing clear criteria for selecting the best candidates. When such criteria are combined with networking opportunities, sponsorship, and growing resources for identifying qualified women (such as the </span><a href="http://www.rightmixmatters.org/bioboardlist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIO Boardlist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), the drug discovery and development industry can start bridging its leadership gender gap.</span></p><p><b>Participate in future events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you an R&amp;D leader interested in joining Science Exchange at future networking events? </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/contact?selected=enterprise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to let us know you’re interested.</span></p></div>

<p>BS 159 is an interview with Dr. Kevin Mitchell, author of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XqrGVi" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="amazon link">Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are</a></em>. We discuss the fact that our brain-based behavior is actually more innate than is commonly realized. Even identical twins are innately different despite having nearly identical genomes. This is because of events that occur during brain development. Listen now to learn more about what science is revealing about this fascinating topic. (PS: we also talk about the role of brain plasticity.)</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XqrGVi" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="amazon link">Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are</a></em> by Kevin J.

<p>The first step to dealing with a negative emotion is to identify it. If you’re feeling irritated, restless or guilty, the most effective way to start feeling better will be different in each case. The trouble is, if your sense of your own emotions is not that fine-grained – if you feel just “bad” or “upset” – you may struggle to identify the cause of your distress, making it tricky to self-regulate your emotions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Plenty of studies have linked a poor ability to differentiate between negative emotions (known as “low Negative Emotion Differentiation” or “low NED” for short) to depression. But this work has mostly been conducted at a single point in time (i.e. having a “cross-sectional” design), making it impossible to tell whether difficulties with emotional differentiation cause depression or vice versa. The research has also overwhelmingly involved adults, and yet it is adolescence that is most marked by low NED (even more than in early childhood) and depression. This mismatch in the literature motivated Lisa Starr at the University of Rochester and her colleagues to conduct a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-35689-001">longitudinal study on adolescents</a>, published recently in <i>Emotion</i>. They looked not only at teenagers’ NED and depressive symptoms over time, but also their experience of minor daily hassles and more serious stressful life events. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37593"></span></p>
<p>The team studied 233 healthy American boys and girls aged between 14 and 17. They first interviewed the adolescents for depression and exposure to discrete stressful events (such as serious problems at school or parental separation) over the past 12 months. Then four times a day for the next seven days, the teens used a smartphone questionnaire to describe their current mood using a choice of 12 negative emotion words and 5 positive emotion words (these responses allowed the researchers to score the teens’ ability to distinguish their negative emotions). The phone surveys also allowed the teens to note any daily hassles (such as an argument with a parent or a parking ticket) they’d experienced during the preceding five hours, including rating their severity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Eighteen months later, the same teen participants were again assessed for levels of depression and also exposure to stressful life events during this period.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that the adolescents who during the week-long survey period were relatively poor at differentiating between negative (but not positive) emotions were also more likely to suffer a transiently depressed mood after a minor hassle. Eighteen months on, they also had higher levels of depressive symptoms – but only if their exposure to stressful life events during that period had been high.</p>
<p>The finding that low NED on its own, without stress, did not predict depression over time is a “critical finding”, the researchers write. They add that it is “to our knowledge, unique to the literature”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Why might an inability to distinguish between negative emotions function as a risk factor for depression only in the context of high levels of stress? “People with difficulties discriminating between and labelling [negative emotions] may fail to orient to the causes and consequences of their emotional responses to stressors, leaving them less prepared to effectively down-regulate [negative emotions],” the researchers write. Such deficits in emotion regulation may in turn “make the emotional aftermath of stressors more difficult to manage and lead to the development of depressive symptoms,” they added. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Adolescents experience all kinds of changes, both in their neurobiology and in their social relationships, which put pressure on their emotional functioning. At the start of this study, 15 per cent of the sample had clinically significant symptoms of depression and 4 per cent met the formal psychiatric criteria for a diagnosis of depression. At the second time point, when any depressive symptoms over the past 1.5 years were considered, these rates had jumped to 37 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively. If, as the new findings suggest, low NED in combination with stress is a risk factor for depression, this suggests a particularly effective way to address depression in adolescence might be via a process known as “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/09/twitter-study-confirms-the-power-of-affect-labelling-emotions-are-calmed-by-putting-them-into-words/">affect labelling</a>”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This process involves teaching people to understand and recognise a broader range of emotions (usually negative ones). It has been shown to lessen the intensity of negative emotions and encourage appropriate responses – and the researchers suggest, given their new data, that it may also protect against the development of depression. “Moreover, our finding that NED interacts with environmental stress to predict depression suggests it is especially important to target interventions at high-risk, stress-exposed youth,” they conclude.</p>

<strong>Can psychology help make running more enjoyable?</strong> Our presenter <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com">Christian Jarrett</a> speaks to several experts about various strategies including “cognitive reappraisal” and the benefits of taking part in organised runs. He also hears how some of us are genetically disposed to find running less enjoyable than others, and why that isn’t an excuse for giving up.</p>
