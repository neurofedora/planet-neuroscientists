To view this big question from a broad perspective at the end of each year, I&#8217;m reporting some of the thoughts about the brain that marked me most during the past twelve month – with the hope to advance and structure the progress in the part of my understanding of the brain that is not immediately reflected in journal publications.

<p>During the last years&#8217; write-ups, I have been thinking about experiments to study self-organized plasticity in living brains. This year, I have been busy with preparations for the implementation of this line of research and hope to be working on it next year. Experimentally, I have been mostly occupied with &#8211; and more and more intrigued by &#8211; the study of <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504030v1">hippocampal astrocytes and how they integrate calcium signals</a>. In experiments connected to this project, we are now studying the role of neuromodulation and the locus coeruleus in more detail. And I&#8217;m glad that I can learn more about this interesting brain area by doing experiments myself. But I will discuss this in another blog post in more detail.</p>



<p>For this write-up, I want to discuss a small subfield of neuroscience that I only became aware of this autumn and that is closely related to ideas of self-organized neuronal networks: the experimental study of learning in cell cultures. How can the neuronal system of a cell culture be used to interact with a (virtual) world in a closed loop? In this blog post, I will discuss a few important papers to understand what can be studied with this model system of learning.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I think that this field is interesting in principle, as it provides a method to study plasticity (although this is not necessarily the primary aim of this kind of research). The method suffers from the problem, as most <em>in vitro </em>slice approaches as well, that experimental protocols for plasticity induction might be artificial and not related to processes <em>in vivo</em>.</p>



<p>I became aware if the field in October, when a high-profile paper on this topic came out and was prominently covered on social media &#8211; partly for making misleading claims and not citing prior research. I want to make it better and start chronologically with a seminal paper from 2001.</p>



<p><strong>A network of cultured cortical neurons is trained to stop a stimulus</strong></p>



<p>Shahaf and Marom showed in 2001 what can be described as &#8220;learning-in-a-dish&#8221; [1,2]. In these experiments, they grew a culture of cortical neurons on a 2D multi-electrode array (MEA) such that they could both stimulate these neurons and record from them. They used this system to provide some neurons with a specific stimulus. When the neuronal network exhibited a certain firing pattern briefly after stimulation, the stimulation was stopped. With this approach, the cultured network was embedded in a closed-cloop interaction.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the cultured network indeed started to increasingly show these spiking patterns that stopped the external stimulation. The observation is very easily summarized by figure 2 in their experimental paper [1]. After learning, the network is much more activate in a pre-defined time window (shaded area), thereby shutting down the stimulation:</p>

<p>This is a fascinating and also surprising observation. It seems as if the network is realizing that there is a stimulus, decides that the stimulus is annoying and therefore puts forward measures to stop and prevent the stimulus. Such a description is however highly anthropomorphic and does not really help to understand what is going on.</p>



<p>According to Shahaf and Marom, their observation shows in the first place that a neuronal network does not depend on a distinct implementation of reward or other forms of reinforcement. Instead, the network, following Shahaf and Marom, explores configurations until a desired state is reached (in this case: the state of stimulus removal) [1]. The authors discuss the implications a bit more in detail in [2] (check out section 7) but remain rather vague on the possible mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that might underlie such behavior.</p>



<p><strong>A network of cultured cortical neurons interacts with a virtual world</strong></p>



<p>Going slightly beyond the very simple closed loop by Shahaf and Marom, researchers from the lab of Steve Potter, which according to <a href="https://potterlab.gatech.edu/">the lab&#8217;s website</a> has &#8220;created the field of embodied cultured networks&#8221;, used the activity of the cultured neurons to drive the behavior of an &#8220;animal&#8221; in a virtual world [3]. The sensory feedback received by this animal in the virtual world is fed back to the cultured neurons. In this study, the focus is primarily on showing that it is possible to have a cultured network and a very simple virtual environment in a closed loop. This sounds particularly fascinating as the paper was published during a time when the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">Matrix</a> had just come out.</p>



<p>Afterwards, in order to be able to evaluate learning and plasticity systematically, the lab moved to specific tasks based on this experimental design [4]. This study by Bakkum, Chao and Potter is conceptually close to the studies by Shahaf and Marom discussed above. The experimental design is depicted in this nice schematic (part of figure 1 in [4]) and shows a clearly identified mapping of the population activity onto a &#8220;motor output&#8221;.</p>

<p>Here, SBS (unpatterned <strong>s</strong>huffled <strong>b</strong>ackground <strong>s</strong>timulation) serves as a kind of reward or neutral stimulus while PTS (<strong>p</strong>atterned <strong>t</strong>raining <strong>s</strong>timulation) serves as an aversive stimulus that makes the network provide different output activity patterns. The (unchanging) context-control probing sequence (CPS) is used as a probe, and the network response upon the CPS pattern is regarded as the system&#8217;s motor output. Therefore, PTS or SBS act as plasticity- or feedback-stimuli, whereas CPS defines a probing time window to elicit the &#8220;motor output&#8221;.</p>



<p>The authors show that the networks could learn to provide mostly correct motor output when trained with such a paradigm. In addition, they quantify plasticity processes over time. Plasticity was higher during the learning procedure compared to baseline and remained higher for &gt;1h after training. To summarize, the authors do not dig into mechanisms of cell-to-cell plasticity but rather provide a broader, systemic description of what is going on.</p>



<p>A difficult-to-grasp feature of this experimental study is the design of the patterned training stimulations (PTSs). The authors repeatedly applied different stimulation patterns (e.g., PTS1 stimulates electrodes 1, 4, 7 and 15, PTS2 stimulates electrodes 6, 8, 19, 20, 21 with specific stimulation intensities). Their algorithm was designed to choose from a pool of PTSs and select the PTS that resulted in plasticity towards a network state that generated the desired &#8220;motor&#8221; output. In 2022, most people (or at least myself) are so much used to deep learning and gradient descent that it is almost strange to read about such a random exploration approach.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the authors also investigated a comparable paradigm in a separate and purely theoretical study [5]. In this study, they replaced the cultured network with a simulated network and found very similar learning compared to the <em>in vitro</em> study. They found that this behavior depended on spike-time dependent plasticity, a cell-to-cell synaptic plasticity rule, and on STD, a short-term plasticity rule that helps to prevent large system-wide bursts.</p>



<p>From my perspective, it is interesting to see that the cell culture results could be replicated with a network that was based on STDP. A large part of the paper however instead focuses on the question how to choose and adapt stimuli that make the network learn the desired output. I would have been interested to get to know more about how STDP is shaped by the stimulation patterns and driven towards the desired output. </p>



<p><strong>Learning by stimulation avoidance and autopoiesis</strong></p>



<p>The group of Takashi Ikegami tried to better understand what is actually going on when neuronal cultures as in the experiments by Shahaf and Marom [1] learn to shut down an external stimulus. They study this effect using simulated neuronal networks and, as in work from the Potter lab [5], they identify spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) as an essential factor to mediate this learning process. As in work from the Potter lab, they also use an &#8220;embodied&#8221; application with a moving simulated robot that learns to avoid walls [6].</p>



<p>The main take-away of their simulation experiments is that the experiments by Shahaf and Marom can be replicated <em>in silico</em> and that the observed phenomena can be interpreted as &#8220;Learning by Stimulation Avoidance (LSA)&#8221;. The authors write in the discussion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>LSA is not just an another theoretical neural learning rule, but provides a new interpretation to the learning behavior of neural cells in vitro. (&#8230;) LSA relies on the mechanism of STDP, and we demonstrated that the conditions to obtain LSA are: (1) Causal coupling between neural network’s behaviour and environmental stimulation; (2) Burst suppression. We obtain burst suppression by increasing the input noise in the model or by using STP.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have the impression that this is an overstatement of what &#8220;LSA&#8221; is. First, both STDP and burst suppression by spontaneous activity as ingredients to enable learning-in-a-dish had been described already previously [5]. Second, I don&#8217;t think this is &#8220;a new interpretation&#8221; of <em>in vitro</em> learning but simply the demonstration of a model that is consistent with the observed experiments from [1].</p>



<p>The authors expand a bit and provide more context:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As we have shown, LSA does not support the theory of the Stimulus Regulation Principle. It could be closer to the Principle of Free Energy Minimisation introduced by Friston. The Free Energy Principle states that networks strive to avoid surprising inputs by learning to predict external stimulation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The &#8220;stimulus regulation principle&#8221; suggests a network that samples possible network configurations and stops the exploration once a favorable state is reached. A favorable configuration would be one which manages to suppress the stimulation. The STDP-model put forward by [6] instead is based on a synaptic learning rule that specifically strengthens and weakens synapses in order to reach a favorable network configuration.</p>



<p>The mentioned &#8220;free energy principle&#8221;, on the other hand, is infamous for being so general that almost any imaginable theory is consistent with it. The most popular theory about an implementation of the free energy principle is probably predictive processing [7]. In classical predictive processing, an internal model in the brain provides top-down signals to cancel out expected sensory inputs. The internal model adapts in order to improve the predictive power of the top-down signals. It is interesting how this typically hierarchical top-down/bottom-up view breaks down when being applied it to the model system of a dissociated cell culture. It would be hard to assume that there is an hierarchy in this dish. And still, the stimulus-avoidance paradigm does have some clear resemblance with surprise-minimization and predictive processing.</p>



<p>For more work from the Ikegami lab in collaboration with others, check out [8], where they interpret the findings that neurons in cultured networks that receive incontrollable stimulation will be disconnected from the network. They do so in the context of the rather old concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis">autopoiesis</a>, thereby going beyond the simple principle of &#8220;learning by stimulus avoidance&#8221; (LSA).</p>



<p><strong>A network of cultured cortical neurons learns to play a simplified version of pong</strong></p>



<p>In October 2022, a related paper by Kagan et al. with Karl Friston as senior author &#8211; who is famous for inventing the free energy princple &#8211; was published [9]. It received a lot of attention, but also quite some criticism by several neuroscientists on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/Timothy0Leary/status/1580328593824964608">ref 1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stenichele/status/1580910769373265920">ref 2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sina_lana/status/1580362015511437313">ref 3</a>, and other discussions that were deleted afterwards). It was critizised that the paper failed to cite previous research and interpreted the results in a misleading manner. For example, the title speaks of cultured neurons that &#8220;exhibit sentience&#8221;. This statement does not use a commonly used definition of &#8220;sentience&#8221; and therefore seems quite misleading for the reader. Unfortunately, this is not the only part of the manuscript which sounds like a buzzword combination made up by ChatGPT. Check out this excerpt of the introduction:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Instantiating SBIs [synthetic biological intelligences] could herald a paradigm shift of research into biological intelligence, including pseudo-cognitive responses as part of drug screening, bridging the divide between single-cell and population-coding approaches to understanding neurobiology, exploring how BNNs compute to inform machine-learning approaches, and potentially giving rise to silico-biological computational platforms that surpass the performance of existing purely silicon hardware.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But let&#8217;s put all the the buzz aside and discuss the science. Similar to the previously discussed studies, Kagan et al. used cultured neurons that were integrated into a closed loop using multi-electrode arrays. The virtual environment of this closed loop was a simplified version of the game &#8220;pong&#8221;. The multi-electrode array (MEA) was used to provide the cell culture with &#8220;sensory&#8221; feedback about the position of the ball and the success of the game, and to provide &#8220;motor&#8221; output from the MEA activity pattern back to the game in order to control the paddle.</p>

<p>Pong as implemented in the paper was less demanding (using a paddle half as large as the side of the arena). Despite this simplification, the performance of the cell culture controlling the game was not very impressive. The cultured network, after some learning, managed to hit the ball on average a bit more often than once (1x) before losing the game. This performance is not much higher (but significantly above) chance level.</p>



<p>The experimental design is well illustrated by this panel from their figure 5 (taken from the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.02.471005v2">preprint</a>, which had been published under the CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0 license):</p>

<p>The electrode array is subdivided into a &#8220;sensory&#8221; region indicated by the crosses and a &#8220;motor&#8221; region indicated by up and down arrows; the firing patterns in the motor region move the paddle up or down. The sensory region is provided with sensory feedback about the position of the ball, but also with a predictable stimulus when the ball hits the paddle and a random stimulus when the paddle misses the ball. Over time, the neurons learn to avoid the random stimulation by hitting the ball more often.</p>



<p>The interesting aspect is that the network seems to learn based on an intrinsic preference for predictable as opposed to unpredictable stimuli. The authors interpret this result as supportive evidence for the free energy principle, because the systems seems to learn the game in order to escape punishment by the random and unpredictable stimulus.</p>



<p>I have however some doubts about the interpretation of the results and also about the conceptualization. First, it is strange that predictable and unpredictable stimuli are used to reward or punish the system. This is not how, according to my understanding, the free energy principle works. One would rather expect the the system (the ball/paddle interaction) to be modeled by the neuronal network and therefore become predictable. There would not be any use of additional reinforcement by predictable stimuli as reward. &#8211; Interestingly, in Bakkum et al. [4], in contrast, the negatively reinforcing stimulus was patterned while the stabilizing, positively reinforcing stimulus was random. This fact shows that different stimuli are used for different purposes, and interpretations of their effect on the network depends on the conceptual framework of the paper.</p>



<p>Second, it is strange that the predictable stimulus (75 mV at 100 Hz over 100 ms; unfortunately, the duty cycle is not stated) and the unpredictable stimuli (150 mV at 5 Hz over 4000 ms) differ quite a bit in terms of stimulation strength, duration and frequency of stimulation. One needs to make oneself aware of the fact that in reality the &#8220;predictive stimulus&#8221; is a high-frequency tetanus stimulation. Such tetanic stimuli are known to be able to drive long-term potentiation (LTP). It is not hard to imagine that the slower unpredictable stimulation results in long-term depression (LTD), not by means of being unpredictable but by means of its frequency and duration.</p>



<p>Therefore, an alternative and, in my opinion, much more parsimonious explanation of the results is that the system does not try to minimize surprising/unpredictable results, but that it potentiates neuronal patterns that precede successful performance by tetanic stimulation. I am therefore not convinced that Kagan et al. demonstrated a phenomenon that can be linked to predictive processing or the free energy principle in the way they describe it.</p>



<p>However, I would also like to highlight the positive sides of the paper: the figures are well-designed; a preprint is available; the experiments were done with several conditions which allow for comparisons across conditions (e.g., different cell lines); and the experimental system was characterized with several complementary methods (including IHC, EM, qPCR).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The fact that cultured neuronal networks can interact with a closed-loop and learn to optimize these interactions is quite fascinating. The interpretation of such behavior as &#8220;learned stimulation avoidance&#8221; [6], &#8220;autopoiesis&#8221; [8] or a reflection of the &#8220;free energy principle&#8221; [6,9] is certainly intriguing. However, it might rather serve as a metaphor or a high-level description and does not really provide a deeper analysis or understanding of the underlying mechanisms. One possible starting point to investigate the mechanisms of such learning could be the STDP rules that were found to be consistent with the learning behavior in simulation studies [5,6]. It would be possible to make predictions about how spike sequences evolve over learning in the dish, and to test those predictions in the experiment.</p>



<p>It is remarkable how limited the performance of the cultured <em>in vitro</em> systems is when they were trained to control a virtual agent or a game. The performances are, seemingly without exceptions, barely above chance level, and nowhere close to mastering the virtual world. Years ago, deep Q-learning has achieved performances that are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk">close to perfection</a> in video games way more complex than &#8220;pong&#8221;. I do not think that anybody should make a point of &#8220;intelligence in a dish&#8221; when the dish can barely process a binary input.</p>



<p>However, I am still somehow intrigued by the experimental findings, especially those made initially by Shahaf and Marom [1,2]. Would it be possible to observe the same behavior with a more naturalistic network, for example a cultured slice, or an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2012.072">ex vivo explant of a brain</a>, or even a brain region in a living animal? For example, one could use optogenetics to stimulate a subset of cortical neurons in the mouse (&#8220;sensory&#8221; neurons), use calcium imaging or electrophysiology to record from another subset of neurons in the same brain area (&#8220;motor&#8221; neurons) and stop the stimulation once the &#8220;motor&#8221; neurons show a specific activity pattern. Using this experimental design, one could test for example whether the learning by stimulation avoidance can also be elicited <em>in vivo</em>.</p>



<p>Another aspect that might deserve attention is the apparent dependence of plasticity processes on a strong stimulus. In the experiments by Shahaf et al. [1], the stimulus co-occurs with the activity pattern that is then modified by plasticity. In Bakkum et al. [4], the plasticity-inducing stimulus is a tetanic stimulation following the activity pattern. Very similarly, in Kagan et al. [9], the tetanic stimulus is directly following the activity pattern that is strengthened afterwards. The observed effect could therefore be the reflection of a very coarse form of plasticity which occurs in a network that is strongly stimulated by an external stimulus that somehow reinforces previous activity patterns.</p>



<p>Overall, from all these studies it becomes clear that networks of cultured neurons do indeed seem to show some level of systems-level learning when integrated into a closed loop. I have the impression that the plasticity induced (e.g., by a strong tetanic stimulation) is not very naturalistic. Despite this limitation, it would be interesting to investigate experimentally what plasticity rules underlie such behavior. It is likely that the plasticity studied in slices since the &#8217;90s is in some similar way artificial since it does not integrate neuromodulation or realistic levels of external calcium. And still these slice experiments brought forward useful concepts that can be tested in living organisms. Similarly, I think there might be interesting aspects of studying plasticity rules in cultered neurons in closed loops. But I do not think that it is of any use to frame such cultured networks as &#8220;synthetic biological intelligence&#8221; [9] or to overinterpret the results in a theoretical framework of choice &#8211; in particular if the performance of this &#8220;intelligence&#8221; remains so much lower than the lowest standards of both biological and artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>The University of Zurich in Switzerland has announced that it will open an investigation into an adjunct professor alleged to have taken images and other material from a popular blog on medieval manuscripts and published them in her book without attribution.</p>



<p>The news, <a href="https://www.kath.ch/newsd/carla-rossi-ist-nach-wie-vor-titularprofessorin-uni-zuerich-kuendigt-untersuchung-an/">first reported by kath.ch</a>, follows an eyebrow-raising exchange between the researcher who discovered his work had been used without citation and someone claiming to be the professor’s secretary, who told him, “nobody cares about your blog!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The professor, <a href="https://www.carlarossi.info/">Carla Rossi</a>, is also director of the Research Centre for European Philological Tradition, abbreviated as <a href="https://www.receptio.eu/">RECEPTIO</a>. The center operates an academic press that published Rossi’s 2022 work, <a href="https://www.receptio.eu/publishing-house"><em>The Book of Hours of Louis de Roucy: a.k.a. The Courtanvaux-Elmhirst Hours, Digitally Restored Through the Wayback Recovery Method</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The book describes a manuscript that Rossi purported to have digitally reconstructed.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126307"></span>



<p>Peter Kidd, an independent scholar who blogs at <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/">Medieval Manuscripts Provenance</a>, wrote a <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/nobody-cares-about-your-blog.html">post</a> on Christmas Eve detailing instances in which Rossi appeared to use text and images from his earlier blogging about the manuscript without attribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he attempted to contact Rossi, Kidd heard back from someone representing herself as Rossi’s secretary who first denied that the book’s images had been taken from Kidd’s blog, then told him:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I regret to inform you that blogs are not scientific texts, published by academic publishers, so their value is nil!</p>

<p>The exchange also included:</p>

<p>Kidd followed up with several posts <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-part-i-staff.html">scrutinizing RECEPTIO’s website</a>, which seemed to present stock photos for its staff and <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-part-ii.html">offices</a>, and <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-iii-my.html">commenting on documents</a> Rossi <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-part-v.html">posted to Academia.edu</a> (and now seems to have removed) <a href="https://mssprovenance.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-receptio-rossi-affair-iv-my.html">responding to his posts</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher added this to the book’s download page:</p>

<p>Kidd told us he didn’t have any comment to add beyond his blogs, which are quite detailed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement to the news website kath.ch <a href="https://www.kath.ch/newsd/carla-rossi-ist-nach-wie-vor-titularprofessorin-uni-zuerich-kuendigt-untersuchung-an/">published December 27</a>, the University of Zurich said it would investigate the allegations:&nbsp;</p>

<p>An article that critiqued a study on what happened after women did not get abortions that they sought has been retracted after observers raised concerns that the peer review process had not been objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905221/full">The Turnaway Study: A Case of Self-Correction in Science Upended by Political Motivation and Unvetted Findings</a>,” was originally published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> in June of 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ansirh.org/research/ongoing/turnaway-study">Turnaway Study</a> itself was an effort of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, which followed women who had received abortions and women who sought abortions but did not get them because they were too far along in their pregnancies “to describe the mental health, physical health, and socioeconomic consequences of receiving an abortion compared to carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term,” according to its website. </p>



<span id="more-126304"></span>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/09/author-critical-of-study-involving-abortion-hires-lawyers-after-journal-flags-paper/">we reported in November</a>, the journal placed an expression of concern on the paper after critics pointed out that the editor and all four reviewers (whose names Frontiers published on the first page of the paper) were associated with pro-life organizations. The researchers behind the Turnaway Study responded to the article’s critiques in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1003116/full">commentary</a> published in December.</p>



<p>The paper’s author, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscilla-coleman-712ab416/">Priscilla K. Coleman</a>, a professor of human development and family studies at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, told us at the time that she would “actively pursue all options available including legal avenues to rectify the situation.” (She also said she would “pursue all avenues available to me should your article, which is premature at this time cause me any additional reputational harm.”)</p>



<p>On December 26, <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> retracted Coleman’s article with the following notice:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following publication, undisclosed competing interests were brought to our attention, which undermined the objective editorial assessment of the article during the peer review process.</p>



<p>Frontiers conducted a post-publication assessment of the article, including consulting with independent expertise, which concluded that the article does not meet the standards of publication of Frontiers in Psychology.</p>



<p>This retraction was approved by the Field Chief Editor of Frontiers in Psychology and the Chief Executive Editor of Frontiers. The authors did not agree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to our request for comment on the retraction, Coleman told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The only information ever provided to me by Frontiers (just prior to posting) was the public retraction notice. Relying solely on this statement, I was asked if I agreed or disagreed with the retraction. Via my attorneys, I requested clarity to make the determination. No further information was provided regarding the rationale or internal findings. Frontiers responded that they would get back to us on substance in the New Year; yet that same day (December 26th) they proceeded with the retraction, posted the original ambiguous statement, and inappropriate presumed my response. Given Frontiers&#8217; membership in COPE, it is difficult to reconcile my experience in this matter with their obligations as a member.</p>

<p>Few scholars of the work of William Faulkner know that the winner of the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1949/summary/">1949 Nobel Prize</a> in Literature toyed with the <a href="https://www.primescholars.com/articles/wave-energy-and-switching-it-over-completely-to-power-by-actual-embankment-gadget-114889.html">above passage</a> in early drafts of his 1936 novel, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He went instead with the more memorable: </p>



<span id="more-126294"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>‘Why do you hate the South?’ ‘I dont hate it,’ Quentin said quickly, at once, immediately; ‘I dont hate it,’ he said. <em>I dont hate it</em> he thought, panting in the cold air, the iron New England dark; <em>I don’t I don’t! I don’t hate it! I don’t hate it!”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, the genius of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass&nbsp; – “I celebrate myself, and sing myself, And what I assume you shall assume, For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you” – echoes in his lesser known work, “<a href="https://www.primescholars.com/articles/role-of-human-resources-pay-disparity-and-sustainable-power-utilization-on-co2-alleviation-114887.html">Role of Human Resources, Pay Disparity and Sustainable Power Utilization on Co2 Alleviation</a>,” whose soaring lines include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>Okay, clearly not. But the editors of the <a href="https://www.primescholars.com/british-journal-of-research.html"><em>British Journal of Research</em></a> would <a href="https://www.primescholars.com/archive/ipbjr-volume-9-issue-9-year-2022.html">have readers believe </a>that Faulkner and Whitman, along with other long-dead luminaries including Charlotte Brontë, of the Department of Basic Sciences at the University of Aberdeen, in the UK, and Herman Hesse, of the Department of Basic Sciences, University of Cologne, in Germany, wrote papers for a recent issue of the periodical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Published by Prime Scholars, the <em>BJR </em>claims to be “an international quarterly open access journal which aims to publish articles related to different research fields and specialities.” One of the journal’s purported editors in chief did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We learned about the bogus papers thanks to Dorothy Bishop, who <a href="https://twitter.com/deevybee/status/1608424393683914755">tweeted about them</a> Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Bishop noted, the motive for the scheme isn’t clear:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">that’s what I’m trying to understand.

<p>Of course, readers of Retraction Watch will not find it surprising that it&#8217;s possible to get <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/10/03/science-reporter-spoofs-hundreds-of-journals-with-a-fake-paper/">just about anything</a> published in something <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/06/hello-newman-yet-another-sting-pranks-a-predatory-journal-seinfeld-style/">that looks like a journal</a>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, as Bronte wrote in <em>Jane Eyre</em>, motive is less important than results:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I could bend you with my finger and my thumb…But whatever I do with this cage, I cannot get at you, and it is your soul that I want. </p>

<p>Update, 1345 UTC, 12/30/22: We heard back from <a href="https://www.primescholars.com/editor/dr-obumneke-amadionuoha-19756">Obumneke Amadi-Onuoha</a>, one of the listed editors in chief of the journal, who said she has &#8220;contacted my publishing company to respond to your inquiry and will give you feedback accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>A microbiology research group at the University of Hong Kong lost five papers for image duplication in late October, weeks after other scientists published a critique in <em>Retraction Watch</em> of one of the group’s COVID-19 articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00283-X">paper on COVID-19</a> was published in <em>Cell</em> in 2021 and was led by <a href="http://www.microbiology.hku.hk/02_HKU_Staff_Prof_PCY_Woo.html">Patrick Chiu Yat Woo</a> and <a href="http://www.microbiology.hku.hk/02_HKU_Staff_Prof_KY_Yuen.html">Kwok-Yung Yuen</a>, chair of infectious diseases in the university’s Department of Microbiology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83C3B6AAB386978026AAB1E81ACE1F#5">posted a longer response</a> from Jin, which stated that Yuen and Woo “were not involved in preparation of the figure concerned,” and ended:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I apologize to Dr. Yuen, Dr. Woo and other coauthors. It was my supervisory oversight and not theirs in this paper. I feel bad that another co-author’s honest error and my own oversight have resulted in criticism and attack of Dr. Yuen in the media. This is completely unfortunate and unhealthy. It does not help to keep a high standard of responsible science. It is completely unfair, groundless and counterproductive. It will only bring more harms than benefits to science. This has already wasted tremendous amount of energy and resources from different parties. Dr. Yuen&#8217;s response to the papers concerned was quick and highly responsible.

                <h4>A paean to being boring</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ME8B0j_3Uh1Si7vsdVYc3Q.jpeg" /><figcaption>Credit: Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p>Can we go back to boring now? No wars launched by a slightly unhinged despot, no global inflation, energy crisis, or ongoing pandemic. No morally-bankrupt World Cup for which the usual euphemism of “questionable human rights record” doesn’t quite do justice to the thousands of workers who died building the carbon-spewing stadia, transport, and facilities in a desert. And no UK led in succession by a self-absorbed, morally dubious sack of straw, a cosplay Margaret Thatcher with no impulse control, and the richest person in the entire House of Commons. (Although admittedly the last of these, Rishi Sunak, is reassuringly, almost cutely, boring: he volunteered — even as Prime Minister — to do the modelling spreadsheets for the recent budget; and used to dress up in Star Wars costumes for non-uniform day at school). Boring is so underrated.</p><p>Neuroscience could do with being a bit more boring. Slowing down a bit, giving us all a chance to catch up. A chance to take it all in. But the torrent shows no abating. So here are some shiny pebbles I’ve plucked from the raging waters, to hold up to the light for you. That on closer inspection the shiny pebble might turn out to be a slime-covered, half-rotten bit of old wood is a risk I’m willing to take on your behalf.</p><p>So let’s plunge in. We’ve got technological advances, from a neuroimaging technique that can allegedly see the spikes coming out of neurons in the living human brain to tantalising steps towards neural activity recorded in a protein (yes, “in”). And we’ve insights into how the brain copes when things are less than optimal: when you’re hungry; and when some of it is missing.</p><h4>Seeing spikes in fMRI</h4><p>fMRI has for decades been the best way of looking at the activity of the intact human brain. But its limitations are frustrating: it’s a proxy, reporting the flow of oxygen-rich blood that is presumably demanded by active neurons, not the neurons’ activity itself; it’s blurry, reporting on chunks of brain that hold up to 100,000 neurons in a normal scanner, and still 1000s of neurons in the strongest scanners; it’s slow, as the blood signal it measures changes over seconds, but neurons fire with millisecond timing so their activity patterns are invisible. This year the teams of Jang-Yeon Park and Jeehyn Kwag <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abh4340">reported in <em>Science</em></a> a type of fMRI signal that, if real, can overcome all of these issues: it directly reports the activity of neurons, at much finer scales of time and space.</p><p>They showed some compelling evidence. It’s a signal whose peaks aligned with the peaks of spiking activity in a mouse’s cortex after its whiskers were tweaked, and those peaks of activity were just 25 milliseconds after the tweaking. The signal and spiking also aligned well when directly driving neurons to spike using optogenetics. And the signal could resolve different peaks of spiking activity in thalamus and cortex separated by 15ms or so. Roughly, the signal they found changed on the order of 10ms, and could resolve down to 0.22mm. Still thousands of neurons, but it would seem churlish to complain.</p><p>Some caveats are worth noting though. For one, there is no firm idea yet of where this signal is coming from: of exactly how the changing voltage of hundreds or a few thousand neurons can affect the magnetic field strongly enough to be detected. It also needs an absurdly powerful scanner (9.4T). For another, it requires repeated trials to build up the signal, so it can’t be used to look at spontaneous activity, or ongoing behaviour. And as a consequence it requires the subject in the scanner does not move at all. Preferably anaesthetised. A dead fish would be fine, for example.</p><p>But if it all holds up then, wow, what science could be done.</p><h4><strong>A ticker-tape parade for neurons</strong></h4><p>Back in the realm of animal neuroscience, recording the activity from lots of individual neurons is old hat. Decades now, of electrodes and microscopes implanted in brains to capture all that juicy firing. No, the science-fiction scenario for us is a way to record the activity of neurons for weeks or months, across the entire brain, without having to stick anything in it. To track development, learning, ageing; to let the animals behave as they want, free from the constraints of dull lab tasks — watch these moving dots, push this button, pull this lever — and capture their brain’s activity while they do it. And one of the blue-sky ideas was <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002291">the molecular ticker-tape</a>.</p><p>The ticker-tape is a thought experiment of using some kind of growing molecule as a way of time-stamping events in a neuron, then sequencing that molecule at the end of the experiment to recover the order of events: most usually, some kind of DNA. Now <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.13.463862v1.full">a preprint from Adam Cohen and friends</a> has shown us a proof-of-principle for this ticker tape idea. They found a protein that can grow over time at a constant, slow rate inside mammalian cells, and happens to have pores in it that are the right shape to fit a fluorescent marker for neural activity. They showed that the protein not only grows in neurons, but when activating the fluorescent markers at different time points, that sequence of events could be read out simply by checking where along the protein the marker glowed. And they showed that the combination of growing protein and fluorescent marker could encode c-Fos expression, a gene quickly and transiently transcribed when a neuron has sustained activation. These are baby steps: the fluorescent markers were activated by dyes, not by neural activity; the time resolution was 2 hours; and c-Fos was explicitly activated by a drug in cultured neurons. Still, a first step!</p><p>And not without precedent: at the same time as molecular ticker-tapes for activity were being dreamt up, so was the equivalent molecular machinery for finding connections between neurons. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2011.6452.1">A thought experiment</a> of taking a unique barcode of DNA, injecting it into each neuron, then slicing up the brain and sequencing the DNA to find where each neuron sent its axons. Now, that’s reality: Tony Zador’s team developed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.07.036">barcoding RNA for neurons</a>, and have since used it to trace <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature26159">the detailed connections </a>of single neurons in visual cortex. So if barcoding for connections has gone from thought experiment to a fully-realised process in a decade or so, might we see the ticker-tape before the decade is out? Watch this space.</p><h4>What happens when the brain is less than optimal?</h4><p>I don’t know about you, but being hungry makes my brain a little fuzzy, hard of thinking — attempting to put socks in the dishwasher hard-of-thinking. This is perhaps not surprising. Your brain is less than 2 percent of your mass but burns about 20 percent of your energy every day. So if there was one organ that could do with conserving energy, it’s your brain. And for it to conserve energy, the best place to start would be make its neurons less active, for it is in the sending and receiving of spikes that the brain burns through much of its energy. Nathalie Rochefort and her lab asked just that question: does a brain’s processing get altered by hunger?</p><p>Yes, was the answer. They took some hungry mice and some full-up, happy mice, and recorded how neurons in their visual cortex responded to different, boring pictures of straight lines all at the same angle. Neurons in these bits of cortex tend to each send the most spikes to lines at a particular angle, like 30 degrees or 170 degrees; and the further the angle of the lines is from this preferred angle, the fewer spikes they send. In full-up, happy mice, this meant that a neuron wouldn’t respond at all to lines far from its preferred angle; but in hungry mice, it did. Which means that the information the neuron was sending about the world indeed got fuzzier.</p><p>How do fuzzier neurons save energy, you may wonder. What seemed to be happening is that neurons in the hungry mice reduced the flow of current in response to each input they received, so saving energy out in its big, metabolically-expensive dendrites. But at the same time the neurons increased the resistance of their membrane, so increasing the change in voltage caused by the input currents. The result was a noisier voltage at the neuron’s body — and a noisier voltage means a higher chance of a spike being sent when it should not have been. Hence: neurons sending spikes to lines they should not have been responding to.</p><p>An interesting side-note: doesn’t this flatly contradict efficient coding theories?</p><p>These theories propose that brains minimise redundancy between neuron firing, in order to maximise information transmission for the energy available. In other words, have as few neurons as possible send the same message at once. This would seem to predict that as available energy reduces so neuron firing becomes more sparse. But the Rochefort lab paper shows that when energy reduces, neuron firing does not become more sparse, but more noisy, as their tuning becomes broader. Which implies that, for any given picture, more neurons are firing at the same time, not fewer!</p><p>Three possibilities: I’m wrong (seems likely); the brain is already at the limit of efficient coding, so any drop in available energy leads to a drop in coding efficiency (maybe); or efficient coding theories have (mostly) focussed on the wrong end of the neuron — of how to make their output more efficient, when it is the input that uses the most energy, and so it is the input which needs to be optimised. Over to you, theorists.</p><h4>The really sub-optimal brain</h4><p>A hungry brain might be suboptimal, but missing half of it is surely worse. As you may know, recognising written words is mostly handled by your left cortex; the right cortex tends to handle recognising faces. The current hypothesis is that face recognition is initially handled by both sides, but learning to read drives a competition for cortical real-estate, so word recognition ends up on the left (where language is), and faces predominantly on the right (where language isn’t). Which suggests this left/right split of words and faces is pre-ordained. To test this you’d want to ask what would happen if there was only one hemisphere to begin with: is the brain plastic enough to cope with that?</p><p>Marlene Behrmann and team were able to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2212936119">ask just this question</a>, by studying a group of people who’d had one hemisphere removed in childhood. This may sound drastic, and it is — it’s a last resort treatment for intractable, severe epilepsy, restoring some quality of life by cutting out all the tissue which generates the seizures. Behrmann and co could ask of them: how well could they recognise previously presented words or faces? If words and faces really were pre-ordained to be left and right hemisphere, then if one was missing then presumably recognition would be terrible. But it wasn’t.</p><p>Sure, those missing half a cortex couldn’t quite match the accuracy of people with intact cortices, but they still got over 80% correct on average. And did so in both face and word recognition, irrespective of which hemisphere was missing. So there is no pre-ordained mapping of word or face recognition to the left and right hemispheres. And both face and word recognition can happen, and happen well, in one hemisphere alone. Remarkable thing, the brain.</p><p>Lots more to catch up on. We’ve had <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04554-y">brain charts for the human lifespan</a>, of how it grows and evolves and shrinks with age, a paper notable for the lead authors’ extraordinary effort in gathering the necessary data together. You may remember me banging on about <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/the-dark-neuron-problem-47d758d7600b">“dark” neurons</a>, the rather large set of neurons in the cortex that don’t seem do anything. Well, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01203-5">it turns out</a> that ketamine causes inactive neurons to become active, and vice-versa. So the weird dissociation effects of Special K may simply be down to the dark neurons sparking to life, sending spikes about stuff that isn’t out there in the world. And <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04486-7">it turns out</a> the reason urbanite North Americans get lost in European cities is that they were raised in grid cities — so their brains can’t cope with the concept of streets that bend, or meet at any angle other than 90 degrees.</p><p>And finally. Researchers at Facebook revealed the best thing people in poverty could do to improve their lot: make better friends. I wish I was joking. Looking at 72.2 million Facebook users in the USA, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04996-4">they found</a> the best predictor of increased income was how many better-off friends a person had. Which led them to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04997-3">a simple solution</a> for solving poverty, of creating more opportunities for people on low incomes to make friends with people on higher incomes. So that’s world poverty solved. See you next year, when Facebook researchers will discover that the best predictor of people having enough food is their income, and propose that we give people enough money to buy stuff.</p><p>psst… my book all about how neurons passing spikes makes seeing, thinking, and doing happen <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691241487/the-spike">is out in paperback</a> on Jan 24th 2023.</p><p>Other than that, please, 2023: be more boring.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href="https://twitter.com/markdhumphries"><em>@markdhumphries</em></a><em><br>Mastodon: </em><a href="https://neuromatch.social/@markdhumphries"><em>@neuromatch.social@markdhumphries</em></a></p><p>Enjoyed this story?

<p>A Russian philosophy journal has retracted a paper about lesbian fashion magazines, citing a newly passed law that bans “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and (or) preferences.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal <em>Logos</em>, which <a href="https://logosjournal.ru/about/">describes itself</a> as “​​the leading Russian-language journal in the fields of philosophy, social sciences, humanities and cultural studies” and counts the philosopher Slavoj Žižek as a <a href="https://logosjournal.ru/council/">member of its editorial council</a>, earlier this month retracted a paper titled “<a href="https://logosjournal.ru/upload/iblock/6bd/Logos%201-2022_Press-173-196.pdf">Looking good: The lesbian gaze and fashion imagery</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, by <a href="https://researchers.arts.ac.uk/579-reina-lewis/about">Reina Lewis</a> of the London College of Fashion, still appears online, but an <a href="https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=48052624">entry</a> on the Russian database eLIBRARY indicates it was retracted for being “in violation of standards.” The notice continued:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126281"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction was issued by the decision of the editorial board due to the presence of signs that fall under the scope of Law No. 217471-8 &#8220;On Amendments to the Federal Law &#8220;On Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection&#8221; and certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation (regarding the prohibition of propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and (or) preferences)&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The abstract of the paper stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This paper is concerned with the different forms of pleasure and identification activated in the consumption of dominant and subcultural print media. It centers on an analysis of the lesbian visual pleasures available in reading fashion articles in the new lesbian and gay lifestyle magazines. This consideration of the lesbian gaze is contrasted with the lesbian visual pleasures obtained from an against-the-grain reading of mainstream women’s fashion magazines. The rise of lesbian and gay lifestyle magazines fueled by the pink pound (the commercial potential of appealing to non-heterosexual consumers) has turned eroticized lesbian visual pleasure into the overt purpose of these magazine, rather than a clandestine pleasure obtained through a transgressive reading of dominant cultural imagery.</p>



<p>In contrast to the polysemic free-play of fashion fantasy through which readers derive lesbian pleasure in the consumption of mainstream magazines, responses to the fashion content in the lesbian magazine <em>Diva</em> suggest that readers in a subcultural context deploy a realist mode of reading that demands a monosemic positive iconography. To consider the different ways in which lesbians read mainstream and subcultural print media the author uses the concept of subcultural competency and suggests that the conflict over <em>Diva</em>’s fashion spreads may be linked to changing patterns of identification and the use of dress for recognizability.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the beginning of December, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a law “completely banning propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations, gender reassignment and pedophilia,” the state news agency <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1545959">TASS wrote</a>. According to TASS:&nbsp;</p>



<p>The country’s mass media watchdog will be authorized to put websites with the propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations, pedophilia, and gender reassignment on the register of prohibited resources subject to blocking. It will also be authorized to determine the procedure of internet monitoring to spot such sites.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-parliament-passes-law-banning-lgbt-propaganda-among-adults-2022-11-24/">Reuters reported</a> that individuals could be fined up to 400,000 roubles (about $5,800) and organizations up to 5 million roubles (about $72,400) for violating the law, and foreigners could be arrested for 15 days and deported from the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We emailed Lewis for comment and got an out of office reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Valery Anashvili, editor in chief of <em>Logos</em>, whether the journal had received any indication from the government that the paper violated the law, and didn’t receive any response. Anashvili is also editor-in-chief of the Gaidar Institute Publishing House and the Delo Publishing House of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.</p>

Retraction data from Retraction Watch Database, overall publication figures via U.S. NSF.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2002, journals retracted 119 papers from the scientific literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What a difference two decades make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On several occasions this year, publishers announced they were retracting several times that number, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">all at once</a>. (For some of the stories among 2022’s retractions that captured the most attention, see our <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/the-top-retractions-of-2022-70852">10th annual roundup</a> for <em>The Scientist</em>.)</p>



<p>This year’s 4,600-plus retractions bring the total in the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org">Retraction Watch Database</a> to more than 37,000 at the time of this writing. </p>



<span id="more-126277"></span>



<p>As the graphic at the top of this post illustrates, the annual rate of retractions as a share of total published papers continues to grow, to now about 8 in 10,000 papers published. The spike in 2015 reflects the lag of how long some retractions can take, and recent greater scrutiny of papers by sleuths. It also suggests – along with many publishers’ realizations that they are being overwhelmed by paper mills – that the growth isn’t slowing down.</p>



<p>We had a few key developments of our own this year. A sampling:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ellie Kincaid joined us as editor, the first time we have been funded to have a salaried person in that role since 2018. Her impact was immediate, we’re sure you’d agree, breaking stories right and left.</li>



<li><em>Nature</em> invited us to contribute a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02071-6">World View column</a> reflecting on a dozen years of Retraction Watch, notably the growth in retractions and the fact that so many papers that should be retracted haven’t yet been.</li>



<li>We presented, or were part of teams who presented, findings at the World Conference on Research Integrity and the Peer Review Congress.</li>



<li>In partnership with Anna Abalkina, we launched the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01666-3">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>.</li>



<li>We published an invited editorial in <em>Anesthesiology</em>, “<a href="https://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article/137/3/280/136809/How-to-Stop-the-Unknowing-Citation-of-Retracted">How to Stop the Unknowing Citation of Retracted Papers</a>.”</li>



<li>We partnered with Clarivate, who used the Retraction Watch Database to exclude researchers “found to have committed scientific misconduct in formal proceedings conducted by a researcher’s institution, [or] a government agency” from their list of Highly Cited Researchers.</li>



<li>The WoodNext Foundation <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/retraction-watch-grows-again-thanks-to-a-250000-grant-from-the-woodnext-foundation/">awarded us</a> a two-year, $250,000 grant that will allow us to hire another editor who will join us in the first week of 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our database – with about three times as many retractions as PubMed – continues to power retraction alerts in <a href="https://twitter.com/RetractionWatch/status/1458421915761221643">EndNote</a>, <a href="https://www.papersapp.com/blog-papers-announces-expanded-retraction-support/">Papers</a> and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/retracted-item-notifications/">Zotero</a>. It is also frequently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/papers-that-cite-retraction-watch/">cited in the scholarly literature</a>. Our work is regularly featured in major news outlets such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/sports/football/paul-mccrory-plagiarism-concussions.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/stanford-presidents-research-draws-concern-from-scientific-journals-11671142757"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-01/stanford-presidents-scientific-papers-draw-scrutiny"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/12/13/science/scientific-journal-investigating-umass-hydrogen-study-after-revelations-gas-industry-influence/"><em>Boston Globe</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/11/prestigious-medical-journal-retracts-nine-more-articles-authored-by-concussion-expert-paul-mccrory"><em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/word-cloud-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong><em>BMC Ecology and Evolution &#8211;</em> <a href="https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-022-02089-4">Land use and soil characteristics affect soil organisms differently from above-ground assemblages</a></strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13111 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/EcoEvo.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />This week almost 200 countries signed a historic deal at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal in a big push to halt our planet’s biodiversity loss by 2030. This deal includes plans to restore 30% of earth’s degraded terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. While this is a great step into the right direction, understanding all parts of ecosystem loss is important to implement the right actions. Soil biodiversity (the variety of organisms that live in soil and leaf litter) has been notoriously underrepresented in biodiversity indicators like the Living Planet Index, despite its fundamental role in soil health, water purification and carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>In this study published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution,</em> researchers modelled abundances of above-ground and soil organisms in different land uses and soil properties based on data from the <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/biodiversity/predicts.html">PREDICTS</a> project. This project analyzes ecological data on the human impact &#8211; particularly related to land use change and intensification &#8211; on changing biodiversity. Their results show that soil biodiversity responds differently to land use than above-ground organisms. For instance, soil biodiversity is much more impacted by high-intensity farming and recovers much more slowly from clear felling and reforestation with different tree species than above-ground organisms.</p>
<p>This study highlights the need to find more sustainable ways to feed a rapidly growing population without impacting soil biodiversity. In addition, off-setting carbon with plantation forests should be weighed against the risk of losing healthy soil biodiversity, required to underpin ecosystem function. More research is needed to understand the complexities of soil biodiversity, ecology, and the interplay between below- and above-ground communities.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Genomics</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-022-08963-1">Genomic trajectories of a near-extinction event in the Chatham Island black robin</a></strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13112 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/Genomics.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As species extinction accelerates at unprecedented rate, finding reliable ways to protect endangered species has become one of the top priorities of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Critically endangered species pose a particular challenge as inbreeding in small populations can lead to the accumulation of harmful mutations and reduced fitness. Eventually this may either cause extinction due to a so-called “mutational meltdown” or enhance natural selection by more efficiently reducing harmful mutations in offspring – a process called genetic purging.</p>
<p>In this study, published in <em>BMC Genomics, </em>researchers used the critically endangered Chatham Island black robin as a model to obtain insights into the genomic impact of near-extinction events. This bird was driven to near extinction due to habitat fragmentation and introduction of rats, with a population size of 5 individuals in 1976. Conservation efforts managed to increase the population number, with a total of 25 birds in 2021, all of which were descendants of a single breeding pair. Comparing the genome of 52 Chatham Island black robin genomes over the span of 150 years the researchers found evidence of a decrease in genome-wide diversity and an increase in mutational load. Some of the results also support the loss of harmful mutations through genetic purging, which may have been a side-effect of early habitat fragmentation.</p>
<p>The genetic mechanisms described in this paper are important factors to consider in conservation biology and genetic management of threatened species. The authors suggest that when it comes to future conservation efforts, individuals with the lowest mutational load should be selected to maximize breeding success.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01778-4">Applying the 4Ps of social marketing to retain and engage participants in longitudinal cohort studies: generation 2 Raine study participant perspectives</a></strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13114 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/MRM.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />The Raine Study is one of the largest prospective longitudinal cohort studies, established in 1989 in Australia. The aim of this study was to investigate how events during pregnancy and early childhood affect people’s adult health and disease. In the first recruitment phase, 2,900 pregnant women (Generation 1) were included and their resultant 2,868 births were followed up with as Generation 2. Multi-generational long-term studies are invaluable for our understanding of human health and disease and can help shape policies and medical practice further down the line. But how do we retain participants over such a long period of time?</p>
<p>In this qualitative study published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology,</em> researchers describe the experience of active and inactive participants of Generation 2 in relation to the so-called 4Ps &#8211; Product, Price, Place and Promotion &#8211; of social marketing. Social marketing uses commercial marketing principles to influence people’s behaviors for their own or society’s benefit. Based on participant responses, researchers could define the Raine Study’s product as regular health check-ups for participants and the feeling of contributing to the greater good. These beneficial products came at the price of “feeling like a lab rat” and the inconvenience of repeatedly completing surveys and questionnaires. Having to attend the Raine Study headquarters for regular check-ups (place) was mentioned as an inconvenience that could deter participants from actively participating in the study. However, the biggest promotional asset for active members was the feeling of being part of the “Raine Study family” and its associated purpose, prestige, and importance.</p>
<p>The social marketing framework described in this paper illustrates how researchers can create a deeper understanding of how participants perceive cost and benefit accrued through their participation in longitudinal studies. This in turn can help to specifically target these issues and retain participants over a longer period of time.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirt</em><em>h</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-022-05225-6">The human right to safely give birth: data from 193 countries show that gender equality does affect maternal mortality</a></strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13115 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/PC.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="200" />Due to a big effort to improve child survival, numbers of neonatal deaths dropped worldwide by more than 50% over the past 3 decades. In contrast, maternal mortality is still unacceptably high and in the majority of cases completely preventable. Most maternal deaths occur in low-income countries which greatly reflects inequalities in access to appropriate healthcare. But this is only part of the picture. Research has shown that gender inequality plays a major role in maternal health outcomes.</p>
<p>In this article, published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,</em> researchers examine the correlation between gender equality and the reduction of maternal mortality using 512 gender-sensitive variables representing 193 countries. Their results show a clear reduction in the maternal mortality ratio with an increase in gender equality. Female education is an important marker for gender equality and positively influences other crucial factors, including the use of contraception and financial independence. In addition, women in leadership and political positions have an irrefutable impact on maternal health. Not surprisingly, child marriage, intimate partner violence and lack of autonomy have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>This article clearly identifies the variables that play a role in improving maternal health and can be used to monitor progress in this field. Addressing gender equality through women’s education and empowerment are at the forefront of improving maternal health. In addition, the authors recommend reinforcing policies and laws aimed at eliminating child marriage and intimate partner violence.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13113 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/METH.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a useful and cost-efficient tool to assist healthcare professionals in medical decision-making. The applications of AI in the medical field are broad and reach from interpreting images in pathology and radiology to identifying patients for clinical trials or analyzing genetic data. While this is a clear advancement for the medical field, an important question remains to be tackled: do we trust medical AI?</p>
<p>This qualitative study published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics </em>explores the question of under which conditions we trust AI, from the developers&#8217; and clinical users&#8217; perspective. In this study, researchers interviewed members of the Minerva Initiative, a consortium of commercial, clinical, and academic researchers who work on computational phenotyping using facial recognition algorithms. This study found that trust in the reliability and quality of the tool is crucial from both the clinicians&#8217; and the patients&#8217; side. The tools need to work well and produce reliable and validated results. Over time the clinician’s positive experience will be directly influence the patient’s trust in the AI tools.</p>
<p>This study emphasizes the need for deliberate and meticulous steps in designing trustworthy and confidence-worthy AI processes. The authors suggest that randomized controlled trials or increased transparency would help signify the epistemic trustworthiness of these tools.</p>

<p>Remember the paper that made the rounds on Twitter after readers discovered that the error bars in one of its figures were really just capital Ts?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, it’s now been retracted, with the notice citing “concerns about the article’s scientific reliability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Error bars are supposed to express the statistical uncertainty of a measurement depicted in a graph, but the ones in this paper appeared to be capital letter Ts pasted on for looks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we mentioned in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/05/a-paper-used-capital-ts-instead-of-error-bars-but-wait-theres-more/">previous post</a>, the error bars were just the most obvious strange thing about the paper, “<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2022/3802603/">Monitoring of Sports Health Indicators Based on Wearable Nanobiosensors</a>,” which was published earlier this year in a special issue of the Hindawi journal <em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126263"></span>



<p>The journal published an expression of concern for the paper on December 1, days after the error bars attracted attention that led to readers finding other oddities in the article, saying that the publisher “is investigating these concerns and will revisit this article with any necessary post-publication amendments.”</p>



<p>On December 19, the journal published the following retraction <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2022/9758123/">notice</a>, which acknowledged that one of the issues a reader spotted was its own fault:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em> has retracted the article titled “Monitoring of Sports Health Indicators Based on Wearable Nanobiosensors” [1]. Since publication, readers have raised concerns that the error bars in Figure 9 appear to be the letter “T.” Moreover, it has been noted that the authors state that “no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study” which is contradictory to the study described. This therefore raises questions about the reliability of the underlying data and the article’s conclusions.</p>



<p>The article includes several instances where different sections are clearly unrelated. For instance, as the survey collecting information on the fitness activity of elderly people in Jilin province is not well described, it is unclear how it relates to the research on nanomaterials and wearable biosensors. Furthermore, several references cited do not support the article and have been found to be irrelevant. Of note, in addition to not being relevant to the corresponding text, reference [16] was retracted prior to the submission of the current article due to containing nonsensical content [2].</p>



<p>Finally, we would like also to acknowledge that a reader raised concerns that an incorrect notation was used in Equations (13) and (14); however, upon review, this appears to be an error made during the production process. The Publisher apologizes for this error.</p>



<p>The authors did not respond to our summary of the concerns nor our request to provide the original data and ethics approval documentation. After careful assessment of the concerns raised, we have concerns about the article’s scientific reliability and are therefore retracting.</p>



<p>The authors agree to the retraction and the notice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-glass-frogs-blood-liver">Sleeping glass frogs hide by storing most of their blood in their liver</a></h4>

              
                <p>As tiny glass frogs fall asleep for the day, they take almost 90 percent of their red blood cells out of circulation.</p>



<p>The colorful cells cram into hideaway pockets inside the frog liver, which disguises the cells behind a mirrorlike surface, a new study finds. Biologists have known that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glass-frog-wears-its-heart-all-see">glass frogs</a> have translucent skin, but temporarily hiding bold red blood brings a new twist to vertebrate camouflage (<em>SN: 6/23/17</em>).</p>



<p>“The heart stopped pumping red, which is the normal color of blood, and only pumped a bluish liquid,” says evolutionary biochemist Carlos Taboada of Duke University, one of the discoverers of the hidden blood.</p>





<p>What may be even more amazing to humans — prone to circulatory sludge and clogs — is that the frogs&nbsp;hold almost all their red blood cells packed together for hours with no blood clots, says co-discoverer Jesse Delia, now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Wake the frog up, and cells just unpack themselves and get circulating again.</p>



<p>Hiding those red blood cells can <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl6620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double or triple the transparency of glass frogs</a>, Taboada, Delia and colleagues report in the Dec. 23 <em>Science</em>. That greenish transparency can matter a lot for the snack-sized frogs, which spend the day hiding like little shadows on the undersides of the leaves high in the forest canopy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122122_SM_transparent-frog_inline-675x450.png" alt="A photo on the left showing a sleeping female glass frog with most of her red blood cells tucked into her liver. While the photo on the right shows the frog while awake with blood circulating and less transparent." class="wp-image-3120637" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122122_SM_transparent-frog_inline-675x450.png 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122122_SM_transparent-frog_inline-575x383.png 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122122_SM_transparent-frog_inline-279x186.png 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122122_SM_transparent-frog_inline.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120637">When a glass frog wakes up and starts moving around, the blood that it had hidden in its liver while sleeping starts to circulate once more, decreasing the tiny frog’s transparency.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120637">Jesse Delia</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>What got Delia wondering about transparency was a photo emergency. He had studied glass frog behavior, but had never even seen them asleep. “They go to bed, I go to bed — that was my life for years,” he says. When he needed some charismatic portraits, however, he put some frogs in lab dishes and at last saw how the animals sleep the day away.</p>



<p>“It was really obvious that I couldn’t see any red blood in the circulatory system,” Delia says. “I shot a video of it — it was crazy.”</p>



<p>As he pitched his project to a Duke University lab for support, he was stunned&nbsp;to discover that another young researcher was pitching the same lab to study transparency in glass frogs. “I was like, oh, man,” Delia says. But the leader of the biological optics lab at Duke,&nbsp;Sönke Johnsen, told Delia and his rival, Taboada, that they had different skill sets and should tackle the problem together. “I think we were hardheaded at first,” Delia says. “Now I consider him as close as family.”</p>





<p>To show what red blood cells do in living frogs made a tough puzzle. Light microscopy wouldn’t work for seeing through the mirrorlike outer tissue of the liver. Nor would anything that woke up the frogs (<em>Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni</em>), because the red blood cells would rush out through the body. Even anesthetizing the frogs kept the liver trick from working.</p>



<p>The answer Delia and Taboada found comes from a technique called photoacoustic imaging, mostly used by engineers. It reveals hidden interiors thanks to the subtle vibrations created by light striking various molecules and causing slight energy releases. Duke’s&nbsp;Junjie Yao joined team glass frog to tailor the technique to frog livers, taking special care not to wake the animals in the process.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">When tiny glass frogs fall asleep, they store almost 90 percent of their red blood cells in their liver, increasing the animals’ transparency (seen in the first clip), which may help hide them from predators. When the animals wake up, their blood starts to course again (second clip). </figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite glass frogs’ name, transparency among vertebrates can get much more extreme, says fish biologist Sarah Friedman of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. She <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahtfried/status/1538596561738903552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted an image</a> in June of a newly caught blotched snailfish (<em>Crystallichthys cyclospilus</em>), clear enough in most of its body to show flesh tones and finger lines in her hand as she cradled it. And that’s not even the best example. The larval stages of tarpon fish and eels, glassfishes and a kind of Asian glass catfish “are almost perfectly transparent,” says Friedman, who wasn’t involved in the new study.</p>



<p>But these marvels have the advantage of living in water, she says. Evolving exquisite glassiness is easier where there’s not as sharp a visible difference between animals’ bodies and their watery homes. Still, having a transparent body is pretty cool, on land or sea.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-weather-climate-change-2022">Extreme weather in 2022 showed the global impact of climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was another shattering year.</p>



<p>Climate change amped up weather extremes around the globe, smashing temperature records, sinking river levels to historic lows and raising rainfall to devastating highs. Droughts set the stage for wildfires and worsened food insecurity. Researchers found themselves pondering <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">the limits of humans’ ability to tolerate extreme heat</a> (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>The extreme events from 2022 pinpointed on the map below are just a sample of this year’s climate disasters. Each was exacerbated by human-caused climate change or is in line with projections of regional impacts.</p>





<p>In its Sixth Assessment Report, released in 2021 and 2022, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, warned that humans are dramatically overhauling Earth’s climate (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). Earth’s average surface temperature <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already risen by at least 1.1 degree Celsius</a>&nbsp;since preindustrial times, thanks to human inputs of heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide and methane (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). That warming has shifted the flow of energy around the planet, altering weather patterns, raising sea levels and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-extreme-heat-wave-past-climate-new-normal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turning past extremes into new normals</a> (<em>SN: 2/1/22</em>).</p>



<p>And the world will have to weather more such climate extremes as carbon keeps accumulating in the atmosphere and global temperatures continue to rise. But IPCC scientists and others hope that, by highlighting the regional and local effects of climate change, the world will ramp up its efforts to reduce climate-warming emissions — averting a more disastrous future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/io-magma-ocean-hot-metal-core-jupiter">Io may have an underworld magma ocean or a hot metal heart</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> — An entire ocean of liquid magma, or maybe a hot heart of solid metal, may lurk in Io’s underworld.</p>



<p>The surface of Jupiter’s innermost moon is covered in scorching lava lakes and gored by hundreds of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/three-volcanic-eruptions-rock-jupiters-moon-io">active volcanoes</a>, some spitting molten rock dozens of kilometers high (<em>SN: 8/6/14</em>). Over the years, the moon’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/io-jupiter-moon-lava-frost-mystery-lumps-dunes">restless, mesmerizing hellscape</a> has attracted the attention of many planetary scientists (<em>SN: 5/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>Now, researchers are digging into the nature of Io’s infernal interior to explain what is driving the spectacular volcanism on the moon’s fiery surface. “It’s the most volcanically active place in the solar system,” says planetary scientist Samuel Howell of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “But it’s not really clear where that energy comes from.”</p>





<p>Researchers generally agree that Io gets most of its energy from a gravitational tug-of-war between its parent planet Jupiter and its sibling moon Europa. Those grand forces pull on Io’s rocky body, generating tremendous frictional heat in its interior. But how that heat is stored and moved around remains a mystery.</p>



<p>One explanation is that Io’s netherworld may house <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1200202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an enormous ocean of liquid magma</a>, planetary scientist David Stevenson of Caltech said December 15 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. Though the exact size of the proposed molten sea remains uncertain, it would need to be relatively large, he said. “The magma ocean could be, say, 100 kilometers thick.”</p>



<p>In 2011, researchers reported that Io’s mantle couldn’t be completely solid. Magnetic measurements of Io from the Galileo spacecraft indicated there must be an electrically conductive layer inside the moon. A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1201425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global underground layer containing molten rock</a>, the scientists wrote, would fit the bill. &nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="451" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-451x450.jpg" alt="An infrared image of Io with hot spots speckling the surface." class="wp-image-3120540" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-451x450.jpg 451w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-384x383.jpg 384w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-187x186.jpg 187w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-582x580.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120540">Hot spots speckle the surface of the volcanic moon Io in this infrared image captured by NASA’s Juno spacecraft on July 5, 2022, when the spacecraft was about 80,000 kilometers from the moon.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120540">JPL-Caltech/NASA, SwRI, ASI, INAF, JIRAM</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But the researchers couldn’t tell whether that layer would consist of a continuous sea of magma or many little pockets of molten rock dispersed throughout solid rock, resembling a soggy sponge.</p>



<p>Building off that previous work, Stevenson and Caltech geophysicist Yoshinori Miyazaki calculated that a mixed layer of magma and solid rock beneath Io’s crust would be fundamentally unstable under the amount of heating they predict occurs inside the moon. The molten rock and solid rock would split into distinct layers, with the molten rock coalescing into a subsurface sea, Stevenson said. “The final conclusion is [that] Io has a magma ocean.”</p>





<p>But there are other possibilities. “A lot of information is consistent with a large, global conductive layer that could be a magma ocean,” Howell says. “But I wouldn’t say there’s consensus on how to interpret that data.”</p>



<p>Instead, the truth may lie within Io’s heart, where <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1048370" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a core made of solid metal may lurk</a>, Howell reported December 15 at the meeting. Previous research has suggested that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Io has a core rich in metals</a>. Howell and colleagues calculate that a metal core that’s about as rigid as solid ice and a rocky mantle as viscous as Earth’s could fully dispense the immense quantities of heat that Io is estimated to emit. That would fulfill the energy-shedding role of a magma ocean.</p>



<p>Future measurements collected by NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-juno-jupiter-moons-mission">ongoing Juno mission</a> as well two future spacecraft — NASA’s Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency’s JUICE — may provide the data needed to determine whether either, or some combination, of the hypotheses is correct, Stevenson and Howell said (<em>SN: 12/15/22</em>). Until then, the mystery of what dwells in Io’s dark depths may have to remain in purgatory.</p>

                <p><em>Science News</em> drew over 13 million visitors to our website this year. Here’s a recap of the most-read news stories and long reads of 2022.</p>



<h4>Top news stories</h4>



<h5>1. A special brew may have calmed Inca children headed for sacrifice</h5>



<p>The mummified remains of two Inca children ritually sacrificed more than 500 years ago contain chemical clues to their final days and weeks. On the journey to the Peruvian mountain where they were sacrificed, the children <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-children-sacrifice-ayahuasca-chemical">may have chewed coca leaves and drunk a beverage</a> with antidepressant-like ingredients to soothe their nerves (<em>SN: 6/4/22, p. 10</em>).</p>





<h5>2. A ‘mystery monkey’ in Borneo may be a rare hybrid. That has scientists worried</h5>



<p>An unusual monkey first spotted six years ago appears to be a cross between a female silvered leaf monkey (<em>Trachypithecus cristatus</em>) and a male proboscis monkey (<em>Nasalis larvatus</em>). The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-monkey-hybrid-borneo-habitat">possible cross-genera pairing</a> has scientists worried because such matings are usually a sign that species are facing ecological pressures (<em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 11</em>).</p>



<h5>3. What experts told me to do after my positive COVID-19 at-home test</h5>



<p>After <em>Science News</em> intern Anna Gibbs came down with COVID-19, she <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">turned to health experts</a> to figure out how to report her case to public health officials and how long she needed to isolate (<em>SN Online: 4/22/22</em>).</p>



<h5>4. All of the bases in DNA and RNA have now been found in meteorites</h5>





<p>Here’s more evidence that life’s precursors could have come from space. All five of the nucleobases that store information in DNA and RNA have been discovered in meteorites. This year, scientists reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">detecting cytosine and thymine in fallen space rocks</a>, completing the list (<em>SN: 6/4/22, p. 7</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Humans may not be able to handle as much heat as scientists thought</h5>



<p>For years, it was thought the human body can tolerate heat up to a “wet bulb” temperature — a measure combining humidity and air temperature — of 35° Celsius (95° Fahrenheit). But experiments <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">hint that the threshold may be several degrees lower</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/22, p. 6</em>).</p>

<h4>Top feature stories</h4>



<h5>1. Tardigrades could teach us how to handle the rigors of space travel</h5>



<p>Tardigrades can withstand punishing levels of radiation, the freezing cold and the vacuum of outer space. Researchers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-space-travel-survival-humans">are learning the death-defying tricks of these hardy microscopic animals</a> to better prepare astronauts for long-term voyages (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 30</em>).</p>



<h5>2. Muons spill secrets about Earth’s hidden structures</h5>



<p>Just like doctors use X-rays to see inside the human body, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">are using muons</a>, a type of subatomic particle, to peer inside Egyptian pyramids, volcanoes and other hard to penetrate structures (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<h5>3. Multiple sclerosis has a common viral culprit, opening doors to new approaches</h5>



<p>Evidence is mounting that Epstein-Barr virus somehow instigates multiple sclerosis. Understanding the link between the virus and MS may lead to better treatments for the neurological disorder. Vaccines against the virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-virus-vaccines-treatments">may even prevent MS altogether</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 14</em>).</p>



<h5>4. The discovery of the Kuiper Belt revamped our view of the solar system</h5>



<p>In 1992, two astronomers discovered a doughnut-shaped region far beyond Neptune, dubbed the Kuiper Belt, that’s home to a swarm of frozen objects left over from the solar system’s formation. By studying these far-off objects over the last 30 years, scientists have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-discovery-solar-system-planets-space">gained new insights into how planets form</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/22, p. 22</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Clovis hunters’ reputation as mammoth killers takes a hit</h5>



<p>Ancient Americans may have been big-game scavengers rather than big-game hunters. Some recent analyses suggest that Clovis stone points <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clovis-hunter-stone-points-mammoth-kill-north-america">were more likely tools for butchering large carcasses than weapons</a> for taking down mammoths and other large animals (<em>SN: 1/15/22, p. 22</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/">2022 PLOS accomplishments</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was a banner year for PLOS. We set some ambitious objectives and worked diligently and passionately in achieving them. And, our goals all have one core question: how can we best serve researchers and the scholarly publishing ecosystem in which they work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some highlights:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/#expand">Our new journals, launched to address global issues like climate change, published more than 1,000 papers</a></li><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/#advance">We just published our first dataset on our Open Science Indicators, a new initiative that will help us surface and understand researcher practices with regards to sharing data and code, among other Open Science practices&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/#partner">We set up PLOS entities across the globe and formed relationships with stakeholders within local research ecosystems</a></li><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/#remove">We doubled the number of our institutional partnerships</a></li></ul>



<p>As you can see, our goals can be placed in broad categories: expanding and accelerating our journal offerings, advancing Open Science adoption, establishing a more global presence, expanding our institutional partnerships and creating efficiencies in our infrastructure.</p>



<h2 id="expand"><strong>Expand and accelerate journal offerings</strong></h2>



<p>Two years ago, we made a momentous decision to expand our journal portfolio. We had not launched a journal since 2007, when we introduced <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>. But as we considered how best to effect change in communicating research, we saw an opportunity to work with communities to co-create opportunities for Open Science. Launching more focused journals like PLOS Water enables us to address the challenges facing researchers in those fields. Our journal offerings were prioritized by titles in which Open Science could have the greatest impact in increasing the visibility of research to key stakeholders and facilitating an exchange of knowledge across disciplines studying social, economic, and ethical aspects of some of the world&rsquo;s biggest challenges. In 2022, the journals[1] began publishing their <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/plos-sustainability-and-transformation-publishes-first-papers/">first papers</a>.&nbsp; We are happy to announce that collectively these five journals have already published over 1,000 papers.</p>



<h2 id="advance"><strong>Advancing Open Science</strong></h2>



<p>Our journals are not static. We continue to innovate every year and provide our authors with new opportunities for openness. While PLOS is a publisher first, we also have a mission to change the scholarly ecosystem, and the way we best achieve this aim is through our Open Science offerings and practices. Our goal in 2022 was to increase adoption of Open Science practices around data, methods (such as code and protocols), and preprints, especially in disciplinary communities with diverse geographic representation.</p>



<p>To help us reach our goals, we partnered with<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/"> DataSeer,</a> who are collaborating with us to create a suite of&nbsp; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">Open Science Indicators,</a> which will enable us all to understand how Open Science is being practiced. We recently released the <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">first set of Open Science Indicators results</a>, and are seeking feedback from the community on their development. We&rsquo;re studying PLOS content from 2019 onwards, as well as a comparator set of 6,000 publicly-available research articles from PubMed Central. These indicators will initially focus on three Open Science practices, expanding to other practices in 2023:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Data sharing: </strong>As part of a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">project funded by the Wellcome Trust</a>, we are experimenting with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">solutions</a> designed to increase sharing and discovery of research data. Earlier this year we launched a solution intended to promote the use of data repositories for data sharing and the linking of data to publications. It&rsquo;s an <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">&lsquo;Accessible Data&rsquo; feature</a> deployed on articles that link to research data in one of several repositories. This complements our dryad integration, which allows authors at PLOS Pathogens to deposit data in the Dryad repository for free, right from our submission system.</li><li><strong>Code sharing: </strong>We shared <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010193">the results</a> of the first year of <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s mandatory code sharing policy, which showed rates of code sharing in the journal have reached 86% since the policy was introduced. In addition, PLOS <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13933/">published research</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19122611">supporting data</a> on research conducted to understand the needs and habits of researchers in relation to code sharing and reuse as well as to gather feedback on prototype code notebooks and help determine strategies that publishers could use to increase code sharing. You can learn more about our findings in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/which-solutions-best-support-sharing-and-reuse-of-code/">this blog</a>.</li><li><strong>Preprint posting: </strong>We expanded our commitment to preprints with facilitated posting to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-extend-partnership-to-accelerate-preprint-sharing-in-medicine/">medRxiv</a> this year, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/plos-announces-partnership-with-eartharxiv/">EarthArXiv</a>&nbsp;in early 2023. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52646">Research</a> suggests that early sharing via preprint is associated with increased attention and citations for the corresponding peer-reviewed publication. In addition, we are engaged with the evolving landscape of preprint review through our participation in <a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</a>. We&rsquo;ve now published more than 150 articles submitted through this initiative, which makes the review process more efficient and reduces overall burden on the reviewer pool.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Other Open Science progress</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, PLOS shared <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/7jxav/">the results</a> of a first-of-its-kind survey that aimed to understand researchers&rsquo; practices and priorities around sharing detailed methods information, such as <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/11/how-do-researchers-really-feel-about-methods-sharing/">protocols</a>. We also <a href="https://everyone.plos.org/2022/06/16/protocol-entry-service-expanded-to-all-lab-protocol-authors/">expanded the protocol entry service</a> available to authors of Lab Protocols, who can now get support for formatting step-by-step protocols on protocols.io at no charge and at any stage of the writing or review process, even prior to submission.</p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; journal offerings and Open Science aims all ensure that research quality, rigor and integrity are at the forefront of our decisions. This is exemplified by our (<em>PLOS ONE </em>and <em>PLOS Biology</em>) <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/04/partnering-with-cruk/">partnership with Cancer Research UK</a> to improve quality and reproducibility in cancer research through preregistration. Preregistration is a practice of depositing a study design with a repository (and, optionally, submitting it for peer review at a journal) <em>before </em>experimentation and data collection begin. <em>PLOS Biology</em> has now <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001611">published two registered reports, </a>and <em>PLOS ONE </em>has published 17 registered reports.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="partner"><strong>Partnering globally to drive change in research communication</strong></h2>



<p>We now have an established presence in Singapore (following establishment of a presence in Germany in 2021). These virtual entities will enable PLOS to embed ourselves in, learn from, and be influenced by, local communities. This will enable us to form networks and relationships with key stakeholders in local research ecosystems: governments, funders, policymakers, institutional leaders, as well as librarians and researchers. We are already up and running and achieving this in<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/"> Africa</a> via our partnership with TCC in Kenya.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some tangible ways that PLOS has made global progress:<br></p>



<ol><li>Key initiatives include our collaborations with high-level stakeholders in Africa, including the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/expanding-globally-listening-locally-open-science-in-africa/nce-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/">African Association of Universities</a>, and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/n-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/">East African Commission for Science &amp; Technology</a> with our partners <a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/">TCC Africa</a>. These organizations are looking to increase education and awareness around the benefits of Open Science with institutional leadership, national research councils and higher education commission, with a view to increasing Open Science policies and mandates at institutional, national and regional levels. Our work in Africa has brought the support of UNESCO and they are involved with the majority of our activities on the continent.</li><li>Our Regional Directors (in Europe and Asia) advocate for Open Science at a local level and via the networks and relationships they form, aim to advance Open Science adoption. This is Open Science adoption in its broadest sense, whether engaging with the philosophical principles of Open Science and its potential to increase equitable participation, or from a purely practical perspective. The UNESCO Open Science recommendation provides a handy (and broad) reference point here that can be applied globally.</li></ol>



<h2 id="remove"><strong>Removing barriers to Open Access publishing</strong></h2>



<p>One challenge that we&rsquo;re still tackling, and with great success, is how to fairly allocate the cost of Open Access publishing. PLOS was part of the vanguard of publishers who demonstrated that Open Access publishing could be sustainable, but we only had half the equation right because the APC business model was so biased towards highly funded regions and disciplines. In short, we weren&rsquo;t fulfilling our entire vision for an open and inclusive research ecosystem that facilitated the exchange of free and unrestricted knowledge. Anyone could read the research we published, but the cost of publishing in an Open venue was&ndash;and continues to be&ndash;a barrier for many authors. To solve that riddle without the use of subscriptions, we developed new, more equitable&nbsp; models to reduce or remove financial and administrative burdens on authors. We have models that target specific challenges in the Open Access ecosystem&mdash;keeping costs low for selective journals through <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">Community Action Publishing</a>, reflecting regional economic differences through <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a>. And our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee</a> model similarly aims to make Open Access publishing easier and more accessible for researchers while being flexible and granular enough to suit many different communities. Though we still have more work ahead of us and many more conversations to be had with research stakeholders around the world, as of today, 181 institutions in 26 countries have partnered with us, that&rsquo;s up from 93 and 6, respectively from last year.</p>



<h2 id="Infrastructure"><strong>Infrastructure progress</strong></h2>



<p>Efficiency in PLOS&rsquo; infrastructure is not a topic that stirs people&rsquo;s passion, but it&rsquo;s really important for authors in an unseen way. The more inefficiencies we remove from the publishing process, the faster we can get papers published. One of our goals this year was to improve author experience through a less time-intensive submission process.&nbsp;Papers submitted to PLOS undergo a rigorous technical check before undergoing review. We wanted to reduce friction in the technical check and formatting stages to speed up the time these papers move to review. As a result of many internal improvements, manuscripts submitted to <em>PLOS ONE</em> are assigned an Academic Editor under ten days of submission, and the time to first decision has decreased by more than 20%.</p>



<h2 id="looking-ahead"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>



<p>We are really excited for what we have in store for 2023. We&rsquo;ll have more data to share on Open Science Indicators, our partnership with EarthArXiv will take effect, and we&rsquo;ll be announcing new institutional partnerships, among other things. Watch this space for all of our updates.</p>

                <p>COVID-19 may continue to dominate headlines, but this year’s biomedical advances weren’t all about “the Rona.” 2022 saw fruitful and seemingly fantastical research that could one day mean good news for patients.</p>



<h4>Growing synthetic embryos</h4>



<p>Two reports this year revealed how to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05246-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fabricate the early stages of mammalian life</a>. With a bit of laboratory wizardry, scientists mingled mouse stem cells, which self-assembled to spawn what appears to be a kind of <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00981-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fledgling embryo</a> — no egg or sperm required. As they grow, these stem cell–derived synthetic embryos can form proto hearts, brains and guts. But the similarity to natural mouse embryos fades quickly. The synthetic and natural versions match up for only about eight days of development. Still, studying similar clusters of human stem cells might one day offer a way to probe the development of human embryos without relying on the real thing.</p>





<h4>Next-level organ transplants</h4>



<p>Organ transplants have started mirroring science fiction. In January, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">an ailing 57-year-old man received a heart from a genetically engineered pig</a> and survived for two months with the transplanted organ (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 26</em>). Other surgeries <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pig-heart-organ-transplant-brain-dead-people">plugged pig hearts into the bodies of brain-dead patients</a>, a step that prepares researchers for future clinical trials (<em>SN Online: 7/12/22</em>). And a high-tech system hooked up to pigs’ bodies an hour after death helped keep organs functioning. The technology, which might one day preserve human organs slated for surgery, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/organ-donation-pig-death-artificial-system-restored-cell-life">pumps a mix of real and artificial blood through the animals</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/22, p. 12</em>).</p>

<h4>Epstein-Barr’s link to MS</h4>



<p>Scientists dropped an Epstein-Barr bombshell early this year when they suggested that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the virus is the main cause of the neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis</a>. Infection with the virus greatly upped the odds of later developing MS, an analysis of millions of U.S. military recruits found. The link between the virus and MS, which scientists had suspected but never outlined so clearly, might guide the way to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-virus-vaccines-treatments">potential MS treatments</a> — or even, one day, vaccines to prevent the disease (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 14</em>).</p>

<h4>A complete human genome, finally</h4>



<p>Researchers announced back in 2003 that they had read all the genetic info packed into strands of human DNA — the first sequence of the human genome. But that genome was not quite complete; some tangled-up lengths of DNA remained difficult to decipher. This year, a team tied up the loose ends. In March, the researchers reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">a new and improved human genome</a> — this time, complete from end to end (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 6</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="382" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_medicine_human-genome.jpg" alt="an illustration of shining square puzzle pieces with G, A, T or C falling into place on a puzzle board" class="wp-image-3120531" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_medicine_human-genome.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_medicine_human-genome-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120531">New technologies have helped researchers decipher the final, challenging stretches of DNA bases in the human genome.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120531">ERNESTO DEL AGUILA III/NHGRI</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>AI predicts protein structures</h4>



<p>Artificial intelligence has taken structural biology to warp speed. A deep-learning program called AlphaFold has now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alphafold-ai-protein-structure-folding-prediction">predicted the 3-D shapes of more than 200 million proteins</a> (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 16</em>). Though the shapes are not lab-verified structures, the massive dataset could help researchers studying health and disease in all sorts of organisms, from humans to honeybees. Now, looking up a protein’s predicted structure is almost as easy as typing it into Google, according to the cofounder of the AI company that created AlphaFold.</p>

<p><strong>A perfect ending for the final Apollo</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/perfect-ending-final-apollo">Science News</a></em>, December 23, 1972</p>



<p>Project Apollo ended this week. The last moon men … returned to Earth … and splashed down on a target in the Pacific Dec. 19.… All of the surface and orbital instruments appear to be working with the exception of the surface gravimeter.… The geology investigation team summed it up this way: “Apollo 17 will be remembered as the most scientifically sophisticated, not as the last, manned lunar landing.”</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The Apollo missions continue adding to our knowledge of the moon and Earth. Scientists have used lunar soil samples collected by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-dirt-plants-farming-regolith">Apollo astronauts</a> to show that growing plants on the moon, while challenging, may be possible (<em>SN: 7/2/22, p. 4</em>). In May, NASA researchers began scrutinizing<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/apollo-17-lunar-samples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> untouched lunar rock and soil samples from the Apollo 17 mission</a> for hints of past moon conditions and the chemicals crucial for life. Then in November, a new era of moon missions dawned with the launch of NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">Artemis I mission</a>. NASA hopes to land humans on the moon in 2025 to pick up where Apollo 17 astronauts left off.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/record-breaking-science-discoveries-2022">Here are 5 record-breaking science discoveries from 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>New scientific records are set every year, and 2022 was no exception. A bacterial behemoth, a shockingly speedy supercomputer and a close-by black hole are among the most notable superlatives of the year.</p>



<h4>Earliest surgery</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amputation-surgery-oldest-fossil-borneo">first known surgical operation was a leg amputation</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 5</em>). That’s the conclusion researchers came to after investigating the skeleton of a person who lived on the Indonesian island of Borneo about 31,000 years ago. Healed bone where the lower left leg had been removed suggests the individual survived for several years after the procedure. The discovery pushes surgery’s origin back by some 20,000 years.</p>





<h4>Biggest single-celled bacterium</h4>



<p>Bacteria normally dwell in the microscopic world. Not <em>Thiomargarita magnifica</em>. Averaging about a centimeter long, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-eukaryote-thiomargarita-magnifica-namibiensis-largest-bacterium">this newfound bacterium is visible to the naked eye</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 17</em>). <em>T. magnifica</em>, which lives in the mangrove forests of the Caribbean’s Lesser Antilles, is about 50 times larger than other species of big bacteria and about 5,000 times larger than typical bacteria. Why this species evolved into such a giant is unknown.</p>

<h4>Fastest supercomputer</h4>



<p>A supercomputer named Frontier crunched numbers with mind-blowing speed this year: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercomputer-exascale-frontier-speed-record-computing-calculations">1.1 quintillion operations per second</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/1/22</em>). That makes the machine, run by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the first exascale computer — a computer that can perform at least 10<sup>18</sup> operations per second. The next fastest computer tops out at 442 quadrillion (that’s 10<sup>15</sup>) operations per second. Exascale computing is expected to lead to breakthroughs in everything from climate science to health to particle physics.</p>

<h4>Largest fish colony</h4>



<p>Deep off the coast of Antarctica, icefish congregate in a breeding colony as big as Orlando, Fla. Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-fish-nest-antarctica-breeding-colony-largest-group">60 million nests of Jonah’s icefish</a> (<em>Neopagetopsis ionah</em>) stretch across at least 240 square kilometers of seafloor (<em>SN: 2/12/22, p. 12</em>). Previously, nest-building species of fish were known to gather in only the hundreds. An abundant food supply and access to a zone of unusually warm water may explain the exceptionally large group.</p>

<h4>Closest black hole </h4>



<p>By sifting through data released by the Gaia spacecraft, astrophysicists discovered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/closest-known-black-hole-to-earth">a black hole that’s just over 1,560 light-years from Earth</a> (<em>SN Online: 11/4/22</em>). Dubbed Gaia BH1, it’s about twice as close as the previously nearest known black hole. But that record may not stand. About 100 million black holes are predicted to exist in the Milky Way. Since most are invisible, they’re hard to find. But when Gaia, which is precisely mapping a billion stars, releases its next batch of data in a few years, even closer black holes may turn up.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-rna-cold-adaptation">Squid edit their RNA to keep cellular supply lines moving in the cold</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — Squid don’t have thermostats to control ocean temperatures. Instead, the cephalopods tweak RNA to adjust to frigid waters, a study suggests.</p>



<p>Usually, genetic instructions encoded in DNA are faithfully copied into messenger RNA, or mRNA, and then into proteins. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-their-genetic-material-uniquely-weird-place">squid</a> and other soft-bodied <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cephalopods-may-have-traded-evolution-gains-extra-smarts">cephalopods edit many of their mRNAs</a> so that the resulting proteins contain some different building blocks than are inscribed in DNA (<em>SN: 3/25/20; SN: 4/6/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In these animals, 60 percent or more of their proteins are actually recoded. This is astonishing in comparison to how [rarely RNA] editing is used in mammals,” molecular biologist Kavita Rangan said December 5 at Cell Bio 2022, the annual joint meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology and the European Molecular Biology Organization.</p>





<p>Rangan, of the University of California, San Diego, examined the consequences that editing has on proteins called kinesins. Those molecular motors ferry cargo throughout cells along protein tracks called microtubules. Problems on the cellular railway can lead to cells’ disfunction or death and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prion-proteins-clog-cell-traffic-brains-neurodegenerative-diseases">may contribute to disease</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/19</em>).</p>



<p>Squid hatchlings put in chilly 6° Celsius water for a day <a href="https://plan.core-apps.com/ascbembo2022/abstract/afc643f2-d071-4dab-8868-f2d66dbc6ec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edited mRNAs for a kinesin protein</a> differently and more heavily than hatchlings placed in warm 20° C water, Rangon found.</p>



<p>She then made an unedited version and several edited versions of kinesin in the laboratory and compared the proteins’ movements on microtubules. In the cold, unedited kinesin moved more slowly, traveled shorter distances and fell off microtubule tracks more often than it did when warm.</p>



<p>Two of the edited kinesins, like those made by squid in cold water, moved a little slower than the unedited protein. But the renovated versions grabbed on to microtubules more often and had longer runs than unedited kinesin. “This suggests that recoding can allow kinesin to stay on its tracks and travel farther” in the cold, Rangan said.</p>



<p>Changing some made-on-demand RNAs instead of permanently altering DNA may give squid more flexibility to adjust to fluctuating ocean temperatures, she said.</p>
