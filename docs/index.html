<p>The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), an international organization that establishes best practices for scholarly journals, has endorsed specific ethical standards for studies that involve vulnerable groups. Among these standards is this statement in the Declaration of Helsinki: “Reports of research not in accordance with this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.” The current controversy about the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for a proposed study of hepatitis B vaccines in Guinea-Bissau must serve as a reminder of this core requirement of publication ethics.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/18/2025-23245/notice-of-award-of-a-single-source-unsolicited-grant-to-fund-university-of-southern-denmark-sdu">unsolicited $1.6 million grant</a> to the Bandim Health Project at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) would randomly assign more than 14,000 newborns into two groups, those who would receive the vaccine at birth and those who would act as a control group with delayed vaccination. The purpose of the controversial study was to assess the “broader health effects” of the vaccine for the control group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we already know the most critical health effect beyond the 48-months of the study: Withholding vaccination will predictably result in an increased incidence of liver disease later in life, including liver failure, cirrhosis and cancer. Therefore, the true scale of the tragedy brought on by this study would never be fully be known.</p>

<p>Already patently unethical, the study design would also exploit one of the world’s poorest countries, where more than 50 percent of its population live in poverty, <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/pt/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099629204212528253">according to the World Bank</a>. The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy of the University of Minnesota reports that about 1 in 5 people born in Guinea-Bissau has chronic hepatitis B, that 9 in 10 babies who are exposed at birth develop a chronic infection and that 1 out of 4 of them will die of hepatitis B-related liver disease. </p>



<p>There is a larger bizarre context surrounding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00220-9">this now paused study</a>: The Trump administration’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in December to abandon a 30-year recommendation that all babies born in the U.S. be vaccinated for hepatitis B at birth. This is a recommendation that flies in the face of the best available evidence about the dangers of failing to vaccinate. The World Health Organization and pediatric and infectious disease groups uniformly recommend hepatitis B vaccination at birth. It is only Kennedy and his cadre of anti-vaccination zealots who see harm from a beneficial vaccine where none has been shown and sought to initiate a study to vindicate their dangerous view.</p>

<p>How, then, should science journals respond to efforts by the SDU investigators to publish results if the study goes forward? Following the COPE guidance, none of that data should be published. Unlike flawed analysis or intentional fraud, unethical research is a moral failure at the outset, one that is evident not only to the scientific community but to the world at large.<strong> </strong>Journal editors therefore have a special responsibility to ensure that studies that violate consensus moral standards do not find their way into their pages. In the last two decades <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02763869.2025.2588222">there has been an uptick in retractions</a> for ethical violations and lack of ethics approval — retractions that could be prevented by abiding by COPE guidelines and not publishing the research in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not a matter of censorship or “cancellation&#8221; of results that do not square with biases. It is a question of ensuring that there are no incentives for unethical research. The responsibility of journal editors is clear: No “data” from any discriminatory and life-threatening study including this one should be published.</p>



<p>The Guinea-Bissau Hepatitis B study is not a hard case. No study that is sure to expose newborns to a life-threatening involvement with a well-understood fatal disease that can easily be prevented is justifiable. Responsibility for even proposing manifestly unethical research falls on many parties, in this case not only the CDC funding agency which, before pushback, had contracted for the investigation but also the study group involved and Danish health and science authorities who approved it. The leadership of the University of Southern Denmark itself must also be called to account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be sure, there are other ways to publish data these days, and there are plenty of disreputable outlets that might enjoy the attention that a prominent scandalous research project would attract. But that does not change the duties of responsible publication outlets. The community of legitimate journal editors recognized by their peers as upholding moral standards must, to maintain their legitimacy, draw a bright line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last August, a reader alerted the editor of a medical journal to a recent <a href="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2025/05000/aortic_aneurysm_rupture_in_a_postpartum_patient.59.asp">case report</a> “riddled with irreconcilable contradictions, medically impossible claims, fictional terminology, and ethical lapses.”</p>



<p>The paper, about a woman who allegedly suffered an aortic aneurysm rupture three days after giving birth, stated that written “informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication.” But the woman died less than two hours after arriving in the emergency room, according to the report.</p>



<p>“If she did not survive, she could not have provided consent post-event,” the concerned reader pointed out in an email to Riaz Agha, editor-in-chief of <em>Annals of Medicine and Surgery</em>, which published the case report in April.</p>



<span id="more-134131"></span>



<p>The email went on to list a litany of concerns, the most glaring of which perhaps was the report’s statement that, ”Cardiac monitoring revealed PEA [pulseless electrical activity] with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and with blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg.”</p>



<p>During PEA, the heart is unable to contract despite showing electrical discharges and so, by definition, there is <a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/health-and-medicine/pulseless-electrical-activity">no detectable pulse or blood pressure</a>. “A blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg implies organized perfusion, which contradicts the diagnosis of PEA. This error reveals a profound misunderstanding of basic resuscitation physiology,” the email stated.</p>



<p>Other problems included contradictory timelines, an “implausible surgical narrative,” made-up medical terminology and irrelevant references.</p>



<p>“The combination of these flaws, especially the impossible consent, PEA with 90/60 BP, and conflicting timelines strongly suggests that the case is not a genuine clinical event, but rather a constructed narrative&nbsp; assembled from generic templates,” the email, sent under a pseudonym to both Agha and Retraction Watch, concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same reader previously alerted us to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/15/tin-man-syndrome-case-plagiarized-from-hoax-sleuths-say/">a report</a> of a patient whose heart was in their abdomen, a case plagiarized from an April Fool’s joke. The paper, published in Wolters Kluwer’s <em>Medicine</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/02/tin-man-syndrome-five-other-case-studies-retracted-following-retraction-watch-coverage/">was retracted</a> after our story ran.</p>



<p>Zatollah Asemi, the corresponding author of the case report in <em>Annals of Medicine and Surgery </em> and a nutrition researcher at Kashan University of Medical Sciences in Iran, did not respond to requests for comment. Asemi, whom we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/11/10/journals-flag-concerns-in-three-dozen-papers-by-nutrition-researchers/">written </a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/14/yep-pretty-slow-nutrition-researchers-lose-six-papers/">about</a> in the past, has had <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3Azatollah+asemi">more than 160 papers</a> flagged on PubPeer and has earned <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dzatollah%2basemi">34 retractions</a>, including nine last year, and several dozen expressions of concern, according to our database. Researchers notified publishers about <a href="https://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(25)00251-3/fulltext">concerns over 172 clinical trial publications</a> from Asemi’s group in 2019.</p>



<p>Agha did not respond to our request for comment. But a spokesperson for Wolters Kluwer, the journal’s publisher, told us <a href="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2025&amp;issue=11000&amp;article=00167&amp;type=Fulltext">an erratum</a> had been published in November, although it didn’t appear on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260203133407/https:/journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2025/05000/aortic_aneurysm_rupture_in_a_postpartum_patient.59.aspx">the online version of the paper</a> until after our inquiry.</p>



<p>The erratum states informed consent “was obtained from the patient’s legally authorized representative” rather than the dead patient herself. It also corrects “Feinstein incision,” a non-existent procedure, to “Pfannenstiel incision,” and replaces a reference.</p>



<p>But it makes no mention of all the other concerns in the email, including how a patient with no pulse could have had a blood pressure.</p>



<p>Wolters Kluwer did not respond to a follow-up email asking why it judged a short erratum sufficient in the face of the report’s many flaws.</p>

<p>A former cancer researcher at University of Oklahoma Health Science Center has been barred from participating in federally funded research without supervision for three years after the U.S. Office of Research Integrity found he falsified data in grant applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel Andrade committed research misconduct by falsifying data in two grant applications, <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-andrade-daniel">according to a summary</a> published Feb. 6 on the ORI website and to be published in the Federal Register. The finding is the agency’s first in 2026 and follows <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/12/18/ori-has-released-just-two-misconduct-findings-this-year/">just two findings</a> in 2025.</p>



<p>N<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-andrade-5473694a/">ow a scientist at Cytovance Biologics</a>, according to LinkedIn, Andrade did not return messages seeking comment. ORI also did not get back to us.</p>



<span id="more-134122"></span>



<p>A spokesperson for the university told us by email the institution was “aware of ORI’s findings regarding a former faculty member,” and that the university “followed established procedures and communicated with the Office of Research Integrity.” The spokesperson declined to provide further details about the investigation.</p>



<p>The findings resulted from an investigation by the university that was supervised by ORI, which determined Andrade faked data in two grant applications: “Exosomes as Liquid Biopsies: Biomarkers for Tumor Heterogeneity and Subclonal Evolution,” submitted to National Institutes of Health (NIH), on August 20, 2020, and “miRNA signatures that predict chemoradiation response and resistance in cervical cancer using patient-derived organoids and their exosomes,” submitted to NIH and the National Cancer Institute on November 18, 2019.<br><br>Specifically, Andrade fabricated exosome nanoparticle tracking analysis&nbsp; data by relabeling data obtained from a cell line as data derived from cancer patient-derived organoids (PDO) and reporting the relabeled graph to a principal investigator, who included it in one of the grant applications, according to ORI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andrade also manipulated western blot data by splicing together blot image panels from unrelated experiments on different cell lines to depict a composite image of western blot data derived from exosomes of cancer PDOs, according to ORI. In addition, he falsely reported a transmission electron micrograph image was obtained from patient serum when the image was from another source.</p>



<p>The finding letter states that, on December 8, 2024, ORI proposed a three-year supervision period for Andrade and a three-year ban from PHS advisory service. Andrade had the opportunity to request a hearing, but did not contest the actions within the 30-day notice period, according to ORI’s summary.<br><br>Andrade is also prohibited from serving in any advisory capacity with the Public Health Service, including peer review committees.</p>



<p>According to Andrade’s LinkedIn profile, he was a postdoc at the university from 2014 to 2017, and an assistant professor of research at the Stephenson Cancer Center at the university from 2018 to 2021. He has been at Cytovance Biologics since 2021.</p>



<p>ORI typically releases about 10 findings a year. Last year’s total of two findings marked the fewest the office has released since at least 2006. According to ORI’s 2024 annual report, <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/blog/ori-announces-release-2024-annual-report">released on the last day of 2025</a>, the office received 713 allegations, and closed 119 cases.&nbsp;</p>
