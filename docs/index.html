              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/04/20/how-can-a-neural-network-be-like-the-brain/">How can a neural network be like the brain?</a></h4>

              
                <p>NeuroAI is the budding research field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. One of the core concepts used in the field is that artificial neural networks can act as good models of the brain. For example, it’s often claimed that convolutional neural networks can account for the response of the ventral visual stream to images. Similarly, large language models have been found that capture what’s going on inside the language network of the brain. When I have discussions with people outside of our narrow field, this often triggers surprise. Wait, how can a deep neural network be like the brain? What does it mean to be a good model? How can the squishy stuff be like the silicon?</p>



<p>Here I want to get into the specifics of how, mechanically, you compare a brain to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). I give some historical background first, focusing on classic results and methods that originated in the field of visual perception. I will explain the nitty gritty of how correspondence scores between brains and ANNs are calculated. I discuss some of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the classic methods of linear regression and RSA, and explain some of the proposed alternative metrics in Williams et al. (2021). You’ll get the most out of these sections if you’re coming from a math background: statistician, data scientist, computational neuroscientist, etc. Nevertheless, if you’re less math-oriented, I will give intuitive explanations so you can follow along. I conclude with a call to create and use more nuanced and detailed comparisons between brains and neural nets.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">History: the visual ventral stream as a convolutional neural net</h1>



<p>Let’s start with the classic example of convolutional neural networks vs. the ventral visual stream. In the late 80’s, Yann LeCun was inspired by the classic work of Hubel and Wiesel on the physiology of the visual cortex. He created a neural network consisting of sandwiched layers of selectivity and invariance operations, not unlike the simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex. His network, LeNet, was the first example of a convolutional neural net (CNN) trained with gradient descent, and it could classify handwritten digits. Two decades later, this work was then greatly scaled up by Alex Krizhevsky and co. in Geoff Hinton’s lab at the University of Toronto. AlexNet led to the ImageNet moment, in 2012, where a CNN did far better than state-of-the-art classical machine learning methods at image classification, showing that “deep learning has arrived”.</p>



<p>If CNNs were inspired by the brain, and they do the same thing as a brain (image classification), could they be a little like the brain? If it talks like a duck, and it walks like a duck, is it a duck? This is a surprisingly subtle question, and two teams (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1403112111">Dan Yamins in Jim DiCarlo’s</a> lab, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003915">Khaligh-Razavi in Niko Kriegeskorte’s</a>) answered this question with a vigorous “yes, maybe!?” in 2014. They looked at the responses of the ventral visual stream—areas of the brain traditionally associated with shape perception and image classification—and compared them against the ANNs of the time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The mechanics of comparing a brain to an ANN</h2>



<p>So how did they compare a brain to an ANN? They followed what’s now considered a classic recipe. You need three inputs:</p>



<ol>
<li>an ANN trained for some task (e.g. visual classification)</li>



<li>a brain (human or non-human)</li>



<li>a set of benchmark stimuli (e.g. a set of images, sentences, videos, etc.)</li>
</ol>



<p>You then proceed as follows:</p>



<ol>
<li>You probe the ANN with all the benchmark stimuli. You obtain a matrix of responses <strong>X</strong>. Each row is one stimulus (=one image, one movie clip, one sentence, etc.). Each column corresponds to a subunit of the neural network (e.g. the collected intermediate activations of the ANN).</li>



<li>You do the same with the brain. That means, for instance, having someone sit inside the scanner, looking at the same set of images that the neural network was exposed to, and you recording their functional responses. You collect the data into a new matrix. The rows are again exemplars, but now the columns represent something else: physical neurons, EEG sensors, fMRI voxels, etc. This gives us a matrix of responses <strong>Y</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>By construction, <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> have the same number of rows, but different column counts. We’ve thus reduced the problem of comparing a brain and an ANN to the problem of comparing two matrices of different shapes.</p>



<p>There are two now classic ways of doing this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Linear regression: Do multiple linear regression to map one matrix onto the other. Learn a weight matrix <strong>W</strong> such that the residual ||<strong>Y</strong> &#8211; <strong>XW</strong>|| is minimized. This requires some regularization: Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes the sum-of-squares of <strong>W</strong>, might help here. An alternative is to require that the mapping is low-rank using partial least-squares with a limited number of components. This is the path used by Yamins &amp; DiCarlo. The final score is the R2 of the linear regression, perhaps calculated through cross-validation (CV).</li>



<li>Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA): One difficulty with the previous method is that it requires learning a weight vector <strong>W</strong>. This is necessary, in part because the dimensionality of the two matrices might be different. If we form the matrices <strong>XX</strong>’ and <strong>YY</strong>’, however, we obtain two square matrices of the same size. Furthermore, these matrices are invariant to a relabeling (permutation) of the columns. Thus, we can compare the elements of the two similarity matrices via a correlation coefficient. Technically, you could have a negative score, but you could threshold or square to get a score in the 0-1 range. This <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full">is the method pioneered by Niko Kriegeskorte back in 2008</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>These procedures will result in two distinct scores for the similarity of matrices: the linear regression score (really, CV R2) and the RSA score. Both have the property that 0 is maximally misaligned and 1 is maximally aligned. This way, we have reduced the difficult philosophical question of what it means for a brain to be like an ANN to a problem of <em>big number good, small number bad.</em></p>

<p>Using these tools, the two historical papers came to similar conclusions: deep neural nets trained on images have similar representations to the ventral visual stream of the brain. For the Yamins paper, it was with linear regression and with single-cell neurophysiology; for Khaligh-Razavi, it was RSA on fMRI data.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conceptual difficulties with comparing brains and ANNs</strong></h1>



<p>Procedures to map brains to ANNs like linear regression and RSA swap out deep philosophical issues about the nature of perception with a technocratic procedure. In fact, there’s a lot that hides under these scoring procedures.</p>



<p>Both methods are <em>correct</em> at the extremes: if you try to compare two random matrices against each other, you’ll get a score of 0; and if you compare a brain (or an ANN) against itself, you’ll get a score of 1. So a brain is similar to itself but not to random noise: cool. That’s a pretty low bar to achieve, and it’s in the middle scores that we run into conceptual difficulties. What does a 0.5 similarity between the brain and an ANN mean? What are we actually trying to quantify?</p>

</figure>



<p>There are different ways in which we can conceptualize how the brain can be like an ANN. Let’s name some of these ways:</p>



<ol>
<li>We could ask for a 1-to-1 correspondence: each subunit in the ANN should correspond to a neuron in the brain. That’s a very high bar to clear! Let’s call this 1-to-1 correspondence.</li>



<li>We could ask that distances are preserved in the brain and in the ANN. An analogy in 3d will help. Two three-dimensional shapes (say, rubber duckies, above) can be similar, regardless of their (arbitrary) orientation. Distances between two points on the surface of the duckies are preserved: they are invariants. Let’s call this orthogonal correspondence.</li>



<li>We could ask that one manifold of responses can be morphed into another through a linear transformation. Let’s call this linear correspondence.</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s not clear how traditional linear regression and RSA scores map to these desiderata. You can make a verbal argument that linear regression is similar to linear correspondence (2), while RSA is most similar to orthogonal correspondence (2). However, there are complications in real implementations: regularization in linear regression, selection of voxels with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio in RSA. This means that we might not capture our (unstated) goals in complex ways.</p>



<p>Traditionally, these concerns have been more or less swept under the rug, and each subfield has converged on its own widely agreed-upon scores: RSA for human neuroscience, linear regression for single-cell neurophysiology. The argument goes that whatever score we choose, alternative scores would correlate with it. This encourages papers from using whatever is the most commonly used score in their subfield, which allows the scores to be compared more readily from paper to paper. A perfectly reasonable heuristic, but a little unsatisfying.</p>

<p>First, they project the two representations (brain and ANN) onto a fixed, common-sized representation. You could use random projections, subsampling, PCA, etc. to get two matrices with different widths to the same width. Call the resulting matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;hat{&#92;bold{X}}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;hat{&#92;bold{Y}}" class="latex" />. One of their proposed distances is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin_%7BT+%5Cin+G%7D+%7C%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BX%7D%7D+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cbold%7BY%7D%7D%7C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;min_{T &#92;in G} ||&#92;hat{&#92;bold{X}} - &#92;hat{&#92;bold{Y}}||" class="latex" />. <strong>T</strong> is a transformation within some group <em>G</em> that captures what is it that we mean by “same”. Some potential choices:</p>



<ol>
<li>If you want one-to-one correspondence between the brain and ANN, <em>G</em> can be the set of all permutation matrices</li>



<li>If you want distances to be preserved, then <em>G</em> can be the orthonormal matrices</li>



<li>If you want to allow squishing along arbitrary linear dimensions, you can let <em>G</em> be arbitrary linear transformations</li>
</ol>



<p>It turns out the resulting scores are proper distances that respect the triangle inequality, which has some nice benefits for clustering. They also introduce more metrics for more unusual scenarios. For example, for convolutional neural networks, you’d want something that allows remapping along the channel dimension, but not along the space dimension. Although each metric seems like it requires a brute-force search, it turns out there are clever ways of calculating the optimal transformations in each scenario.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The advantage of axiomatic methods</h1>



<p>Overall, Williams et al. take cues from the recent success of geometric deep learning (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478">Bronstein et al. 2021</a>) to ask deep questions about the metrics we use. More than just an incremental numerical improvement, I think it’s a big conceptual improvement over linear regression and RSA: you know what you’re getting into. An axiomatic approach tells you very explicitly what the underlying assumptions are.</p>



<p>Ironically, this makes it easier to poke holes in some of these scores. For instance, one of the core desiderata that Williams et al. fulfill is that their chosen score should be symmetric. Now, I would argue that a brain can be more similar to a neural network than vice-versa. Modern large language models (LLMs) represent more stuff than humans: GPT-4 knows markdown, latex, English, German, how to write listicles and poems and sound like a pirate. Most people can only do a subset of these things. Divergences for distributions are naturally asymmetric, so there’s nothing inherently fishy about a score that is asymmetric. I’m sure there is a variant of linear regression’s asymmetric R2 which can be properly axiomatized according to the framework laid out by Williams et al.</p>



<p>In the meantime, one can use combinations of these well-justified metrics to answer interesting questions about how brains vs. ANNs represent information. For example, the delta between linear correspondance (metric 3) and the orthogonal correspondance (metric 2) is an index about how much warping is necessary to get two latent spaces to match. This could help reveal whether a brain’s representation is <em>a subset of</em> or <em>a noisy approximation of</em> a particular artificial neural net, which is ambiguous for each individual metric. Williams et al. have made their metrics available in <a href="https://github.com/ahwillia/netrep">this Python package</a>, so you can try this out yourself.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Discussion</h1>



<p>For all their justification, we haven’t seen much empirical work using well-axiomatized scores beyond linear regression and RSA. I think the reason for the status quo is that we’ve been focused on coarse characterizations thus far. This will surely need to change as we go beyond <em>ANNs as metaphors for the brain</em> and start using them as <em>in silico models</em> of the brain.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://xcorr.net/2022/05/18/whats-the-endgame-of-neuroai/">I’m interested in using ANNs as models for the brain for the purpose of neural engineering</a>. What I really want is that when I create a virtual lesion in a neural network, it predicts how the real brain will react to a real lesion. Such a <em>causal manipulation score</em> doesn’t yet exist, but I think it would be both conceptually and practically useful. The axiomatic approach of Williams et al. points us towards ways of building this type of score.</p>



<p>For other purposes, however, it may be that the metrics we have are good enough. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.16.537080v1">This recent paper from Tuckute et al.</a> shows that one can learn a transfer function between a large language model and the brain’s language network using linear regression. The model can predict which sentences drive or don’t drive the brain. Using in silico models to predict the response of the brain is helpful in this scenario, and in a certain meaningful sense it means that the brain <em>is like a neural network</em>, along this prediction axis, but perhaps not according to more stringent criteria.</p>



<p>The work from Williams et al. is just one of a number of recent approaches looking at this problem in depth. We’ve seen <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11665">some of the same authors extend this work to stochastic representations</a>. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/01/01/2022-in-review-neuroai-comes-of-age/">Furthermore, empiricists have pointed out problems that current metrics don’t capture</a>, for example, hierarchical correspondence. I think it’s an exciting time to think deeply about our metrics and what it really means for a brain to be like an ANN.</p>

                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, April 20 at 2pm Eastern</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; PLOS today announced that<em> PLOS Genetics </em>is expanding the scope of its journal with a renamed section called <em>Microbial Genetics. </em>This section will replace the former Prokaryotic Genetics section to emphasize research on microbes more broadly with the aim to publish studies that use genetic approaches to provide insights into how bacteria as well as archaea and their phages/viruses, fungi (including yeasts and filamentous fungi), and protists function and interact with the biotic and abiotic world.</p>



<p><em>PLOS Genetics</em> has an established presence in the fungal genetics community, but this research has not easily found a home within its existing journal sections. Currently, the majority of these submissions, primarily studies in yeast, are handled within the General section of the journal. The new microbial section will rectify that issue.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We believe the new <em>Microbial Genetics</em> section will provide a logical new home for these submissions and reaffirm our continued support for this type of research,&rdquo; said Gregory Copenhaver, Co Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are excited that the relaunch of this section will include a Curated Collection for malaria-related research, which will also include other protozoan parasites,&rdquo; said Gregory Barsh, Co Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Genetics.</em></p>



<p>The new section on Microbial Genetics will be headed by Geraldine Butler, Eva Stukenbrock, Lotte S&oslash;gaard-Andersen and Sean Crosson. These four section editors are supported by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/editorial-board">associate editors</a> with broad expertise in microbial genetics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jellyfish-nervous-system-animal">Comb jellies have a bizarre nervous system unlike any other animal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Shimmering, gelatinous comb jellies wouldn’t appear to have much to hide. But their mostly see-through bodies cloak <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade5645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a nervous system unlike that of any other known animal</a>, researchers report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>In the nervous systems of everything from anemones to aardvarks, electrical impulses pass between nerve cells, allowing for signals to move from one cell to the next. But the ctenophores’ cobweb of neurons, called a nerve net, is missing these distinct connection spots, or synapses. Instead, the nerve net is fused together, with long, stringy neurons sharing a cell membrane, a new 3-D map of its structure shows.</p>





<p>While the nerve net has been described before, no one had generated a high-resolution, detailed picture of it.</p>



<p>It’s possible the bizarre tissue represents a second, independent evolutionary origin of a nervous system, say Pawel Burkhardt, a comparative neurobiologist at the University of Bergen in Norway, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Superficially similar to jellyfish, ctenophores are often called comb jellies because they swim using rows of beating, hairlike combs. The enigmatic phylum is considered one of the earliest to branch off the animal tree of life. So ctenophores’ possession of a simple nervous system has been of particular interest to scientists interested in how such systems evolved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous genetics research had hinted at the strangeness of the ctenophore nervous system. For instance, a 2018 study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0575-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t find a cell type in ctenophores</a> with a genetic signature that corresponded to recognizable neurons, Burkhardt says.</p>



<p>Burkhardt, along with neurobiologist Maike Kittelmann of Oxford Brookes University in England and colleagues, examined young sea walnuts (<em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>) using electron microscopes, compiling many images to reconstruct the entire net structure. Their 3-D map of a 1-day-old sea walnut revealed the funky synapse-free fusion between the five sprawling neurons that made up the tiny ctenophore’s net.</p>

<p>The conventional view is that neurons and the rest of the nervous system evolved once in animal evolutionary history. But given this “unique architecture” and ctenophores’ ancient position in the animal kingdom, it raises the possibility that nerve cells actually evolved twice, Burkhardt says. “I think that&#8217;s exciting.”</p>





<p>But he adds that further work — especially on the development of these neurons — is needed to help verify their evolutionary origin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The origins of the animal nervous system is a murky area of research. Sponges — the traditional competitors for the title of most ancient animal — don’t have a nervous system, or muscles or fundamental vision proteins called opsins, for that matter.&nbsp;But there’s been mounting evidence to suggest that ctenophores are actually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-origins-shift-comb-jellies">the most ancient animal group</a>, older even than sponges (<em>SN: 12/12/13</em>).</p>



<p>If ctenophores arose first, it “implies that either sponges have lost a massive number of features, or that the ctenophores effectively evolved them all independently,” says Graham Budd, a paleobiologist at Uppsala University in Sweden who was not involved in the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If sponges emerged first, it’s still possible that ctenophores evolved their nerve net independently rather than inheriting it from a neuron-bearing ancestor, Burkhardt says. Ctenophores have other neurons outside the nerve net, such as mesogleal neurons embedded in a ctenophore’s gelatinous body layer and sensory cells, the latter of which may communicate with the nerve net to adjust the beating of the combs. So, it’s possible they’re a mosaic of two nervous systems of differing evolutionary origins.</p>



<p>But Joseph Ryan, a bioinformatician at the University of Florida in Gainesville, doesn’t think the results necessarily point to the parallel evolution of a nervous system. Given how long ctenophores have been around — especially if they are older than sponges — the ancestral nervous system may have had plenty of time to evolve into something weird and highly-specialized, says Ryan, who was not part of the study.&nbsp;“We&#8217;re dealing with close to a billion years of evolution. We&#8217;re going to expect strange things to happen.”</p>



<p>The findings are “one more bit of the jigsaw puzzle,” Budd says. “There&#8217;s a whole bunch we don&#8217;t know about these rather common and rather well-known animals.”</p>



<p>For instance, it’s unclear how the nerve net works. Our neurons use rapid changes in voltage across their cell membranes to send signals, but the nerve net might work quite differently, Burkhardt says.<br><br>There are reports of potentially similar systems in other animals, such as by-the-wind-sailor jellies (<em>Velella velella</em>). Studying them in detail, along with nerve nets in other ctenophore species, could determine just how unusual this synapse-less nervous system is.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/northern-elephant-seals-sleep-sea">Northern elephant seals sleep just two hours a day at sea</a></h4>

              
                <p>Northern elephant seals are the true masters of the power nap.</p>



<p>On long trips out to sea, the seals <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snooze less than 20 minutes at a time</a>, researchers report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>. The animals average just two hours of shut-eye per day while swimming offshore for months — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-elephants-clock-shortest-shut-eye-recorded-mammals">rivaling African elephants</a> for the least sleep measured among mammals (<em>SN: 3/1/17</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s important to map these extremes of [sleep behavior] across the animal kingdom to get a better sense of the evolution and the function of sleep for all mammals, including humans,” says Jessica Kendall-Bar, an ecophysiologist at the University of California, San Diego. Knowing how seals catch their z’s could also guide conservation efforts to protect places where they sleep.</p>





<p>Northern elephant seals (<em>Mirounga angustirostris</em>) spend most of the year out in the Pacific Ocean. On these odysseys, the animals forage around the clock for fish, squid and other food to sustain their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-seals-eating-males-huge-death-risk-survival">enormous bodies</a>, which can be as hefty as a car (<em>SN: 2/4/22</em>). Because northern elephant seals are most vulnerable to sharks and killer whales at the surface, they come up for air only a couple minutes at a time between 10- to 30-minute <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-whales-dolphins-seals-dive-so-deep">deep dives</a> (<em>SN: 9/28/02</em>).</p>



<p>“People had known that these seals dive almost all the time when they’re out in the ocean, but it wasn’t known if and how they sleep,” says Niels Rattenborg, a neurobiologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Seewiesen, Germany, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To find out if the seals sleep while diving, Kendall-Bar and her colleagues developed a watertight EEG cap for the animals. Using the cap and other sensors, the team tracked the brain waves, heart rates and 3-D motion of 13 young female seals, including five at a lab and six hanging out at coastal Año Nuevo State Park north of Santa Cruz, Calif. EEG data recorded while seals were slumbering revealed what the animals’ naptime brain waves looked like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kendall-Bar’s team also took two sensor-strapped seals from Año Nuevo and released them at another beach about 60 kilometers south. To swim home, the seals had to cross the deep Monterey Canyon — a locale similar to the deep, predator-fraught waters frequented by seals on months-long foraging trips. Matching the seals’ EEG readings to their diving motions on this journey showed how northern elephant seals sleep on long voyages.</p>



<p>The animals first swim 60 to 100 meters below the surface, then relax into a glide, Kendall-Bar says. As they nod off into slow-wave sleep, the animals keep holding themselves upright for several minutes. But as REM sleep sets in, so does sleep paralysis. The animals flip upside-down and drift in gentle spirals toward the seafloor. Seals can descend hundreds of meters deep during these naps — far below where their predators normally prowl. When the seals wake after five to 10 minutes of sleep, they swim up to the surface. The whole routine takes about 20 minutes.</p>



<p>Looking for that distinct sleep dive motion, the researchers could pick out naps in the dive records of 334 adult seals that had been outfitted with tracking tags from 2004 to 2019. Those sleep patterns revealed that northern elephant seals conk out, on average, around two hours per day while on months-long foraging missions. But the seals sleep nearly 11 hours per day while on land to mate and molt, where they can indulge in long, beachside siestas without worrying about predators.</p>

But at sea, the seals catch only brief snatches of sleep.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123862">Photo by Jessica Kendall-Bar, NMFS 23188</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“What the seals are doing might be something like what we do when we sleep in on the weekend, but it’s on a much longer timescale,” Rattenborg says. He and his colleagues have found a similar feast-and-famine style of sleep in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frigate-birds-fly-nonstop-months">great frigate birds</a>, which fly over the ocean (<em>SN: 6/30/16</em>). “Although they can sleep while they’re flying,” he says, “they sleep less than an hour a day for up to a week at a time, and once back on land, they sleep over 12 hours a day.”</p>



<p>Curiously, northern elephant seals’ sleep habits are quite different from how other marine mammals have been seen sleeping in labs. “Many of them … sleep in just half of their brain at a time,” Kendall-Bar says. That half-awake state allows dolphins, fur seals and sea lions to practice constant vigilance, literally sleeping with one eye open.</p>





<p>“I think it’s pretty cool that elephant seals are doing this without [one-sided] sleep,” Kendall-Bar says. “They’re shutting off both halves of their brain completely and leaving themselves vulnerable.” It seems the key to enjoying such deep sleep is sleeping deep in the sea.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-antimatter-origins-fermi-bubbles-galaxy">Cosmic antimatter hints at origins of huge bubbles in our galaxy’s center</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS </strong>— Bubbles of radiation billowing from the galactic center may have started as a stream of electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons, new observations suggest. An excess of positrons zipping past Earth suggests that the bubbles are the result of a burp from our galaxy’s supermassive black hole after a meal millions of years ago.</p>



<p>For over a decade, scientists have known about bubbles of gas, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-ways-black-hole-may-blow-bubbles">Fermi bubbles</a>, extending above and below the Milky Way’s center (<em>SN: 11/9/10</em>). Other observations have since spotted the bubbles in microwave radiation and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/x-ray-bubbles-center-milky-way-galaxy">X-rays</a> (<em>SN: 12/9/20</em>). But astronomers still aren’t quite sure how they formed.</p>





<p>A jet of high-energy electrons and positrons, <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/U13.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emitted by the supermassive black hole in one big burst</a>, could explain the bubbles’ multi-wavelength light, physicist Ilias Cholis reported April 18 at the American Physical Society meeting.</p>



<p>In the initial burst, most of the particles would have been launched along jets aimed perpendicular to the galaxy’s disk. As the particles interacted with other galactic matter, they would lose energy and cause the emission of different wavelengths of light.</p>



<p>Those jets would have been aimed away from Earth, so those particles can never be detected. But some of the particles could have escaped along the galactic disk, perpendicular to the bubbles, and end up passing Earth. “It could be that just now, some of those positrons are hitting us,” says Cholis, of Oakland University in Rochester, Mich.</p>



<p>So Cholis and Iason Krommydas of Rice University in Houston analyzed positrons detected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station. The pair found an excess of positrons whose present-day energies could correspond to a burst of activity from the galactic center between 3 million and 10 million years ago, right around when the Fermi bubbles are thought to have formed, Cholis said at the meeting.</p>



<p>The result, Cholis said, supports the idea that the Fermi bubbles came from a time when the galaxy’s central black hole was busier than it is today.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urchins-dying-off-caribbean-disease">Urchins are dying off across the Caribbean. Scientists now know why</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since early 2022, sea urchins have been mysteriously dying off across the Caribbean. Now scientists say they have identified the main culprit: a type of relatively large, single-celled marine microorganism called a scuticociliate.</p>



<p>The discovery is a little surprising given that “ciliates are not normally seen as agents of mass mortality,” says Ian Hewson, a marine microbial ecologist at Cornell University. But the evidence, described April 19 in <em>Science Advances</em>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg3200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all points to the organism</a>, <em>Philaster apodigitiformis</em>, infecting the urchins, he says. “In all of my years of investigating marine diseases, this is the one which we are 100 percent confident about.”</p>





<p>Scuticociliates are found across the world’s oceans. Given their ubiquity, it’s unknown what conditions may have allowed <em>P. apodigitiformis</em> to become so detrimental to the urchins. It’s also unclear how it causes infection.</p>



<p>While there are no available treatments for the disease, knowing the pathogen’s identity allows for the development of possible options. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Long-spined sea urchins (<em>Diadema antillarum</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saba-caribbean-island-species-conservation">play a crucial role</a> in Caribbean coral reefs, grazing algae that would otherwise smother corals (<em>SN</em>: <em>9/27/22</em>). In the 1980s, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sea-urchins-death-caribbean">urchins nearly disappeared during a massive die-off</a>, the cause of which remains unknown (<em>SN: 6/16/84</em>).</p>



<p>Decades of restoration efforts had made some progress when an alarmingly similar mortality event began to spread in January 2022, wiping out thousands of urchins. This time, scientists across the United States and the Caribbean sprang into action.</p>



<p>Three teams independently reached the same conclusion about <em>P. apodigitiformis</em>, using different approaches. Hewson’s team compared the entire set of active genes, or the transcriptome,&nbsp;of healthy and sick urchins from 23 sites across the Caribbean. The researchers noticed that some of the active genes in the sick urchins’ transcriptomes weren’t from the urchins but from the microorganism. Meanwhile, teams in Florida and Hawaii observed the scuticociliates in the tissues and fluids of sick urchins, reinforcing the genetic finding.</p>



<p>Upon a closer look, the scuticociliates tended to cluster in the sick urchins’ body walls and at the base of their spines. The microorganisms were absent from healthy urchins.</p>





<p>The next step was to isolate the pathogen and infect healthy urchins. Four days after infection, six of 10 infected urchins lost many spines — a common symptom of sick urchins. None of the uninfected urchins lost spines.</p>



<p>“It was really exciting to see,” says Michael Sweet, a marine disease ecologist at the University of Derby in England, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Scary, but also exciting to see the [ciliate’s] name mentioned in a different context because <em>Philaster</em> has never been related to urchin diseases before.” His research <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110115300095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">points to the involvement of the genus</a> in several coral diseases.</p>



<p>While the scuticociliate clearly plays a pivotal role, Sweet says, there are almost certainly other factors at play, such as other microorganisms or environmental stressors, that could help explain what triggered the start of the recent die-off. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, it’s unknown if the same pathogen was involved in the 1980s die-off. Hewson’s team hopes to answer that question by looking at museum specimens from the period.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/map-human-brain-movement-homunculus">The classic map of how the human brain manages movement gets an update</a></h4>

              
                <p>The classical view of how the human brain controls voluntary movement might not tell the whole story.</p>



<p>That map of the primary motor cortex — the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homunculus-reimagined">motor homunculus</a> — shows how this brain region is divided into sections assigned to each body part that can be controlled voluntarily (<em>SN: 6/16/15</em>). It puts your toes next to your ankle, and your neck next to your thumb. The space each part takes up on the cortex is also proportional to how much control one has over that part. Each finger, for example, takes up more space than a whole thigh.&nbsp;</p>





<p>A new map reveals that in addition to having regions devoted to specific body parts, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05964-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three newfound areas control integrative, whole-body actions</a>. And representations of where specific body parts fall on this map are organized differently than previously thought, researchers report April 19 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Research in monkeys had hinted at this. “There is a whole cohort of people who have known for 50 years that the homunculus isn&#8217;t quite right,” says Evan Gordon, a neuroscientist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. But ever since pioneering brain-mapping work by neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield starting in the 1930s, the homunculus has reigned supreme in neuroscience.</p>



<p>Gordon and his colleagues study synchronized activity and communication between different brain regions. They noticed some spots in the primary motor cortex were linked to unexpected areas involved in action control and pain perception. Because that didn’t fit with the homunculus map, they wrote it off as a result of imperfect data. “But we kept seeing it, and it kept bugging us,” Gordon says.</p>



<p>So the team gathered functional MRI data on volunteers as they performed various tasks.</p>



<p>Two participants completed simple movements like moving just their eyebrows or toes, as well as complex tasks like simultaneously rotating their wrist and moving their foot from side to side.</p>



<p>The fMRI data revealed which parts of the brain activated at the same time as each task was done, allowing the researchers to trace which regions were functionally connected to one another. Seven more participants were recorded while not doing any particular task in order to look at how brain areas communicate during rest.</p>



<p>Testing only a few participants, each for many hours, offers unique insights into neural connectivity, Gordon says. “When we collect this much data in individuals, we constantly start seeing things that people have never really noticed before.”</p>





<p>The team discovered that while the brain-body part connections vaguely follow the pattern discovered by Penfield, the primary motor cortex is organized into three distinct sections. Each represents different body regions: lower body, torso and arms, and head.</p>



<p>Within each of these sections, the outermost body part of that region is mapped to the center of that section. For example, the area of the primary motor cortex assigned to the lower body has the toes in the middle with other leg parts radiating out in each direction from it. As a result, the entire section is organized like this: hip, knee, ankle, toes, ankle, knee, hip.</p>

<p>The team also unexpectedly found three mysterious spots not linked to a specific body part. Dubbed intereffector regions, they connect to an external network involved in action control and the sensing of pain. These regions alternate with the sections devoted to specific body parts. The team suspects that intereffector regions may integrate action goals and body movements involving multiple body parts, while the spaces in between are used for precise movements of isolated body parts.</p>



<p>Using previous data from three large fMRI studies, which include data from around 50,000 people, the team verified that this organization was consistent across a wide swath of people. Similar patterns also appeared in existing datasets from macaque monkeys, children and clinical populations.</p>



<p>“I think it was just easy to miss anything that seemed anomalous — must be noise,” says Michael Graziano, a neuroscientist at Princeton University who was not involved in the research. But with access to these huge datasets, “you get these vast numbers of subjects, and the pattern is crystal clear, and you can&#8217;t ignore it …. This is really the best example I&#8217;ve seen in a long, long time of looking at humans and trying to figure out at a detailed level what is the organization.”</p>



<p>Gordon’s team now plans to see whether these intereffector regions play a role in certain kinds of pain. More broadly, the team hopes their findings will prompt more in-depth research of what specific areas of the brain do. With new techniques and equipment, there is much left to explore, Gordon says. “Brain mapping isn’t dead.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prehistoric-method-clothes-bone-leather">A prehistoric method for tailoring clothes may be written in bone</a></h4>

              
                <p>An animal bone fragment full of human-made pits hints at how prehistoric people in Western Europe may have crafted clothing.</p>



<p>The nearly 40,000-year-old artifact probably served as a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg0834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punch board for leatherwork</a>, researchers report April 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>. They suggest that the bone fragment rested beneath animal hide while an artisan pricked holes in the material, possibly for seams. If so, it’s the earliest-known tool of its kind and predates eyed needles in the region by about 15,000 years.</p>





<p>Found at an archaeological site south of Barcelona, the roughly 11-centimeter-long bone fragment contains 28 punctures scattered across one flat side, with 10 of them aligned and fairly evenly spaced.</p>



<p>The marks don’t seem to have been a notation system or decoration, given that some holes are hard to see and the bone fragment wasn’t otherwise shaped, says archaeologist Luc Doyon of the University of Bordeaux in France. He thought leatherwork could have made the marks. But it wasn’t until he visited a cobbler shop and <a></a>saw one of the artisan’s tools that the hypothesis solidified, guiding Doyon’s next steps.</p>



<p>He and colleagues attempted to re-create the artifact’s holes by puncturing cattle rib bones with tools including sharpened flint, horns and antlers. Piercing leather atop bone with a burin — a pointed stone chisel — by tapping it with a hammerlike tool created pits that resemble those on the bone fragment.</p>



<p>Further experiments suggested the artifact’s 10 orderly punctures were made by the same tool and intentionally aligned and regularly spaced. This hints that holes were created in the leather to make a seam sewn with a threading tool.</p>



<p>Scientists knew that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lice-hang-ancient-date-first-clothes">humans wore clothing long before the oldest-known eyed needles existed</a> (<em>SN: 4/20/10</em>). “What [the new finding] tells us is that the first modern humans who lived in Europe had the technology in their toolkit for making fitted clothes,” Doyon says.</p>

<p>A professor of cell biology in Japan faked data in an influential cancer study published in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> in 2019, according to an investigation by Okayama University. </p>



<p>The school, which released a <a href="https://www.okayama-u.ac.jp/up_load_files/news/20230324houkoku01.pdf">report</a> with its findings last month (in Japanese), found no fewer than 113 instances of fabrication as well as problems with several images in the<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0430-3"> paper</a>, titled “Genetic manipulation of autonomic nerve fiber innervation and activity and its effect on breast cancer progression.”</p>



<p>The report identified Okayama&#8217;s<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamiya-atsunori-7b01024b/?originalSubdomain=jp"> Atsunori Kamiya</a> as being involved in the misconduct and recommended retracting the article, which has been cited 134 times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science. The paper has yet to be retracted, but an editor from the journal said they are looking into the case.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126906"></span>



<p>Kamiya also is a former director of the Department of Cardiovascular Control at the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute in Suita, Japan. The center took part in Okayama&#8217;s investigation.</p>



<p>A Google-translated version of the report reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The investigative committees of both organizations judged that the maliciousness was high (large) because it consisted of fictitious experimental results over a fairly wide range and a large number of specific misconducts were recognized.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A third-party investigative committee concluded that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The defendant was found to have failed to comply with the ethical guidelines, and it was determined that the degree of non-compliance was serious.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked for the paper’s underlying data, Kamiya claimed that the hard disk storing them fell and broke during the June 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/osaka-earthquake-japan-61-magnitude-tremor">North Osaka earthquake</a>. The paper versions were destroyed after chemical liquids from refrigerators and shelves fell on them during the earthquake, Kamiya told investigators.</p>



<p>The report also notes that Kamiya claimed the problems with figures in the paper were due to a &#8220;mix-up&#8221; with images.</p>



<p>According to a news<a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14869862"> story</a> in <em>The Asahi Shimbun</em> about the case, &#8220;The two organizations concluded that Kamiya’s fabrications were so flagrant that he lacked a sense of ethics as a scientist.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study was first<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/64FCCAB9E4267D5A1DBC8A631F0509"> flagged on PubPeer</a> in 2021. The probe also looked into two other studies coauthored by Kamiya, but found no evidence of misconduct.</p>



<p>Elisa Floriddia, senior editor at <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> in the UK, told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are working on this, but haven’t reached a decision (correction or retraction).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kamiya did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/methane-warm-earth-atmosphere-radiation">Methane may not warm the Earth quite as much as previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Methane is a greenhouse gas with dual personalities. It heats Earth’s atmosphere 28 times as potently as carbon dioxide, gram for gram. But its absorption of the sun’s radiation high in the atmosphere also alters cloud patterns — casting a bit of shadow on its warming effect.</p>



<p>So rather than adding even more thermal energy to the atmosphere, as previously thought, methane’s solar absorption sets off a cascade of events that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01144-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces its overall warming effect by about 30 percent</a>, researchers report March 16 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>





<p>“These are really interesting and important results,” says Rachael Byrom, a climate scientist at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo who wasn’t involved in the new study. Nonetheless, she says, “methane still remains a really key gas that we need to target in emissions reductions.”</p>



<p>Humans are responsible for most of the methane entering the atmosphere, where it worsens global warming.

<p>Greenhouse gases like methane exert their strongest effects by absorbing infrared “longwave” radiation emitted from the planet’s surface. Earth emits this longwave radiation when it is struck by “shortwave” radiation coming directly from the sun. Most studies of greenhouse gases focus on longwave absorption.</p>



<p>But scientists are learning that greenhouse gases, including methane, also absorb some of the sun’s shortwave radiation. Recent estimates suggested that methane might contribute up to <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 percent more</a> thermal energy to the atmosphere than previously thought, due to this additional shortwave absorption.</p>



<p>However, the new study reveals that methane’s shortwave absorption has the opposite effect. This finding is based on a detailed analysis of the gas’s absorption at various wavelengths.</p>



<p>The result is “counterintuitive,” says climate scientist Robert Allen of the University of California, Riverside. It happens because of the way that methane’s shortwave absorbance affects clouds in different layers of the atmosphere, Allen and colleagues’ simulations suggest.</p>



<p>When methane absorbs shortwave radiation in the middle and upper troposphere, above about three kilometers, it further warms the air — leading to fewer clouds in that upper layer. And because methane absorbs shortwave radiation high up, less of that radiation penetrates down to the lower troposphere. This actually cools the lower troposphere, leading to more clouds in that layer.</p>



<p>These thicker low-level clouds reflect more of the sun’s shortwave radiation back out to space — meaning that less of this solar radiation reaches Earth’s surface, to be converted into longwave radiation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, upper-level clouds, in addition to greenhouse gases, are known to absorb longwave radiation. So fewer of these clouds means that less of the longwave radiation emitted by Earth is captured in the atmosphere — and more of it escapes to space without contributing to climate change.</p>



<p>With methane’s shortwave absorption, “you expect warming of the climate system,” Allen says. “But these cloud adjustments actually overwhelm the heating due to absorption, leading to a cooling effect.”</p>



<p>Allen and his colleagues conducted the study using a computational model of Earth’s climate. When they took the traditional approach — considering only methane’s longwave absorbance — they estimated that the gas has caused 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming since preindustrial times, out of <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature#:~:text=Earth&#039;s%20temperature%20has%20risen%20by,2%C2%B0%20F%20in%20total." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.06 degrees C total warming</a>. But when they also included shortwave absorbance, methane’s contribution to warming fell to about 0.16 degrees C.</p>



<p>In addition to warming the planet, methane is also thought to increase global precipitation, due to greater evaporation of water with higher temperatures. But the researchers found that inclusion of shortwave absorbance also reduced methane’s precipitation effect, from a predicted 0.3 percent increase in precipitation (based on longwave absorbance alone), down to an increase of about 0.18 percent.</p>

<p>It will be important to include methane’s shortwave effects in future climate projections, says Daniel Feldman, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved in the study. But he thinks that more work needs to be done to clarify those effects.</p>



<p>The new study analyzed methane’s shortwave impact using only one comprehensive model that included both the atmosphere and ocean, he says. “I would just like to see that sort of analysis done across multiple models,” increasing confidence in the results.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-squid-cuttlefish-arms-evolve-taste">Octopus, squid and cuttlefish arms evolved to ‘taste’ different compounds</a></h4>

              
                <p>People have different tastes. It turns out that octopuses, squid and cuttlefish do too.</p>



<p>These soft-bodied cephalopods have proteins on suckers along their tentacles that allow them to “taste” by touching objects. But the species have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05822-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved to detect different compounds</a>, researchers report in two studies published in the April 13 <em>Nature</em>. And the differing tastes may be tied to the species’ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05808-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hunting styles</a>.</p>



<p>All the species have modified versions of proteins called neurotransmitter receptors, which detect brain chemicals. Evolution morphed the brain proteins to take on new roles as taste-sensing proteins. But octopus evolution led them to develop a taste for greasy things, while squid and cuttlefish evolution tweaked the brain proteins to detect bitter compounds, the researchers discovered.</p>





<p>“This is an entirely new sensory system,” says Maude Baldwin, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Seewiesen, Germany, who was not involved in the work. “Together these papers offer unprecedented insight into how sensory systems evolve.” </p>



<p>Studying cephalopod receptors might also shed some light on how human taste-sensing proteins evolved. “It greatly enhances our understanding of how proteins evolve in general,” Baldwin says, as well as how proteins and even entire organisms acquire new functions.</p>



<h4>Octopuses can taste many “greasy, sticky” molecules</h4>



<p>In a previous study, Harvard physiologist Nicholas Bellono and colleagues discovered that barrel-shaped proteins known as chemotactile receptors in the suckers of California two-spot octopuses (<em>Octopus bimaculoides</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-taste-touch-arm-suckers">allow the animals to taste terpenes</a> — “greasy,” insoluble molecules — with their arms (<em>SN: 10/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>To get a detailed look at these proteins, Bellono teamed up with structural biologist Ryan Hibbs of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Hibbs and colleagues used cryoelectron microscopy to examine the three-dimensional structure of the protein.</p>



<p>When looking at the structure of the octopus protein, the researchers found an unexpectedly large molecule stuck in a special pocket used to detect certain chemicals. Finding a molecule stuck in one of these pockets can give clues to the protein’s function.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="452" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline.jpg" alt="A close up photo of the sucker cups on an octopus' arms." class="wp-image-3123752" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041423_TS_cephalopod-taste_inline-280x186.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123752">The sucker cups on an octopus’ arms contain taste-sensing proteins that help the animal hunt in the dark and find prey hidden in nooks and crannies.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123752">Anik Grearson</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The mystery molecule turned out to be part of the detergent the researchers used to prepare the protein for the microscope. That’s very different from the types of molecules that bind to the neurotransmitter receptors from which chemotactile receptors evolved, says Hibbs, now at the University of California, San Diego. “Neurotransmitters are small and soluble. This thing is bulky and greasy.”</p>



<p>By testing a variety of molecules collected from neighboring labs, Bellono’s team determined that the octopus receptors can detect a variety of “greasy, sticky molecules” that don’t dissolve in water. Because octopuses feel around for their prey, it makes sense that their taste receptors evolved to detect molecules that remain stuck to underwater surfaces such as crab shells or their own eggs, rather than small chemicals that easily diffuse in water, Hibbs says. &nbsp;</p>





<p>But octopuses don’t seem to find all greasy molecules tasty. In one experiment, the researchers tested the response of a severed tentacle to one such chemical. The arm crawled off the measuring apparatus and right out of the bath.</p>



<h4>Squid and cuttlefish can discern bitter compounds</h4>



<p>To see if other cephalopods share octopuses’ tastes, the researchers turned to genetic analyses. Octopuses have 26 genes that each encode a slightly different chemotactile receptor protein. Those proteins can come together in combinations of five to detect a wide variety of molecules, the team found.</p>



<p>Examining genes from squid and cuttlefish, the researchers discovered that these cephalopod species also have modified neurotransmitter receptors in their suckers. But some of the squid and cuttlefish receptors detect bitter compounds which can diffuse in water, not the greasy ones octopuses taste. (Squid could also taste some terpenes, but not all of the greasy molecules octopuses detect.)</p>



<p>Bitter taste is often a signal that something is spoiled or poisonous, so animals usually avoid bitter compounds, says Harold Zakon, a neuroscientist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Bitter compounds also caused squid to turn up their noses — or in this case, tentacles — at prey. Squid given shrimp soaked in a bitter compound handled the food longer before eating it than they did with undoctored prey. Or the squid rejected the bitter shrimp, something researchers never saw the animals do with regular prey.</p>



<p>The type of receptors the species have reflect their hunting strategies. Octopuses ”explore everything with their arms,” Bellono says, and likely use chemotactile receptors to guide their explorations. While octopuses use sight to catch prey out in the light of day, chemotactile receptors help them hunt in the dark and to find prey hidden in cracks and crevices, Bellono says. Squid and cuttlefish are ambush predators that rely on eyesight alone. The bitter receptors help squid decide whether to eat their prey only after they have it in their grasp.</p>



<p>The octopus and squid receptors evolved about 300 million years ago, early in the species’ histories. But it’s impossible to tell whether hunting style or receptor type came first or if the traits evolved together.</p>



<p>Octopuses also have another type of chemotactile receptor, the researchers found, but they don’t yet know what sorts of molecules those receptors sense.</p>



<p>It will take years to work out the details of what all the cephalopods’ receptors detect and how they influence animals’ behavior, Zakon says. “This is really a first announcement that these receptors have changed in fundamentally important ways.”</p>

<p>As Retraction Watch looked into the case, we found something “very upsetting,” in Turcu’s words. The article with her name on it appeared to paraphrase, sentence by sentence, a paper that had been published in another journal a few months prior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not only are they faking a publication in my name, but they are adding my name to something they have plagiarized?” Turcu asked. “This is absolutely terrible! What is it with these people?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421521005620">earlier article’s title</a> was nearly identical, and it had appeared online in the Elsevier journal <em>Energy Policy</em> in November 2021. It has been cited ten times since, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The one with Turcu’s name on it was received at the journal in January 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We emailed the authors of the <em>Energy Policy </em>paper, who are affiliated with Tongji University in Shanghai, to ask if they were aware of the plagiarism, but they didn’t reply. We also emailed Stephen D. Thomas, senior and coordinating editor of the journal and a professor at the University of Greenwich in London, and got an out of office response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>African Journal of Political Science</em> is published by International Scholars Journals (ISJ).The <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/about.html">journal’s website</a> states this policy on plagiarism:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The editors of ISJ take a very serious stance against any evidence of plagiarism including self-plagiarism in manuscripts submitted to them. Every reasonable effort will be made to investigate any allegations of plagiarism brought to their attention, as well as instances that come up during the peer review process.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We notified Jephias Mapuva, the <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/editorial-board.html">editor in chief of the journal</a> and a professor at the Bindura University of Science Education in Zimbabwe, of the plagiarism, and the fact that Turcu was not involved with the paper that had her name on it. He has not responded to our email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our email to the address listed on the paper as Turcu’s, which does not belong to her, bounced back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ISJ states on its website that it “is a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and abides by its Code of Conduct and aims to adhere to its Best Practice Guidelines.” We could not find the publisher in <a href="https://publicationethics.org/members?t=International%20Scholars%20Journals&amp;type%5B0%5D=Publisher&amp;sort=score">COPE’s member directory</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The experience has prompted Turcu to wonder:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Why the heck me??? I have nothing to do with that subject matter, never saw that article before, what on earth made them do this? I do not think I&#8217;ve ever interacted with anyone from this fake journal, or anyone who wrote the legitimate article, so&#8230; I am really at a loss.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a> with applications and nominations for this year&rsquo;s awards open until <strong>April 30th, 2023</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>.&nbsp; The awards program honors researchers who&nbsp;reflect&nbsp;<strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong>&nbsp;in their work. To get a flavor of what the Einstein Foundation is looking for we have asked previous finalists and winners to write about their work. Earlier this year we featured the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/the-open-science-atlas/">Open Science Atlas</a>, the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/ape-research-index-ari-quantifying-the-effect-of-previous-experience-in-research-tasks-on-cognitive-skills-in-captive-chimpanzees/">Ape Research Index</a> and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/the-trialstracker-project/">TrialsTracker project</a>.</p>



<p>Today PLOS is providing more information on the <a href="https://manybabies.org/MB5/">ManyBabies 5 </a>project spearheaded by <a href="https://jkosie.github.io/">Jessica Kosie</a> and <a href="https://mzettersten.github.io/">Martin Zettersten,</a> both from Princeton University.</p>



<p>The ManyBabies 5 project is a large-scale and cross-cultural study on influential models in infant attention research. Current theories on this subject are largely only based on studies with a small number of participants, who are primarily from western industrialized countries. The ManyBabies 5 team is a large-scale collaborative effort of more than 200 scientists from 122 laboratories in 40 countries on 6 continents. The overarching goal is to build a more robust and valid developmental science.</p>



<p>Unlike adult subjects, babies cannot tell you what they are thinking. Therefore, researchers studying infant development use looking patterns to understand how babies think and feel about the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-icy-ring-heat-atmosphere-ultraviolet-glow">Saturn’s icy rings are probably heating its atmosphere, giving it an ultraviolet glow</a></h4>

              
                <p>The rings that make Saturn such a spectacle are probably heating its atmosphere and making it glow at ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>



<p>Researchers detected an excess of ultraviolet emission in Saturn’s northern hemisphere that comes from hydrogen atoms. The emission, known as Lyman-alpha radiation, is probably the result of water ice, which contains hydrogen, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/acaf78" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling into the atmosphere from the planet’s rings</a>, the researchers propose March 30 in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>



<p>The detection of similar emission from a distant world could someday lead to the discovery of a Saturn-like planet orbiting another star.</p>





<p>The key to the discovery came after two spacecraft — the Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini — observed Saturn simultaneously in 2017, right before Cassini plunged into the planet’s atmosphere, says Lotfi Ben-Jaffel, an astrophysicist at the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris.</p>



<p>This allowed Ben-Jaffel and colleagues to calibrate the ultraviolet detectors on those spacecraft as well as detectors on Voyager 1 and 2, which flew past Saturn in 1980 and 1981, and the International Ultraviolet Explorer, an Earth-orbiting satellite that also observed Saturn. Comparing these ultraviolet observations revealed a band of excess Lyman-alpha radiation spanning 5° to 35° N latitude on Saturn.</p>



<p>The researchers’ explanation for the extra ultraviolet glow is plausible, says Paul Estrada, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., who was not involved with the new work.</p>



<p>“We know material is falling in from the rings,” he says, because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-rings-age-young-moons">Cassini detected it during the spacecraft’s spiral into Saturn</a><em> </em>(<em>SN: 12/14/17</em>). “The rings are predominantly water ice. It may be the source of the atomic hydrogen” emitting the Lyman-alpha radiation that the researchers have detected, he says.</p>



<p>When icy ring particles fall into Saturn’s atmosphere, they carry kinetic energy with them. “They have to release that energy to the surrounding gas,” Ben-Jaffel says, and that energy heats up the atmosphere. When the icy particles vaporize, they release additional energy, further heating the atmosphere and making it glow at UV wavelengths. The researchers suspect that the emission also appears in the planet’s southern hemisphere.</p>



<p>All the giant planets of our solar system have rings, but only Saturn’s are so bright and beautiful. Astronomers don’t yet know whether any of the thousands of worlds found orbiting other stars have rings that are equally magnificent.</p>





<p>The new discovery may help astronomers identify those spectacularly ringed worlds, if they exist. Future planet hunters could look for the telltale ultraviolet glow of the Lyman-alpha radiation, Ben-Jaffel says, and then further observations could confirm the rings’ existence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-salt-lake-shrinking-utah-drought">The Great Salt Lake is shrinking. What can we do to stop it?</a></h4>

              
                <p>At Antelope Island State Park near Salt Lake City in the fall of 2022, three duck hunters dragged a sled across cracked desert sand in search of the water’s edge. The birds they sought were bunched in meager puddles far in the distance. Just to the west, the docks of an abandoned marina caved into the dust and a lone sailboat sat beached amid sagebrush.</p>



<p>“Biologists are worried that we’re on the brink of ecological collapse of the lake,” says Chad Yamane, the regional director of Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit that conserves, restores and manages habitats for North America&#8217;s waterfowl, and a waterfowl hunter himself.</p>





<p>Last fall, the Great Salt Lake hit its lowest level since record keeping began. The lake’s elevation sank to nearly six meters below the long-term average, shriveling the Western Hemisphere’s largest saline lake to half its historic surface area. The lake’s shrinking threatens to upend the ecosystem, disrupting the migration and survival of 10 million birds, including ducks and geese.</p>



<p>Duck hunters aren’t the only ones worried about the Great Salt Lake. The decades-long decline in lake level is raising alarm bells for millions of people who live in the region. As the lake recedes, its namesake city and surrounding communities face a host of potential problems. The low lake level and increasing salinity threaten to disrupt economic mainstays like agriculture, tourism, mineral extraction and brine shrimp harvesting. Exposed sediments can also reduce air quality and so threaten public health. “It concerns everyone,&#8221; Yamane says. “It’s now on the forefront of every Utahan’s mind.”</p>



<p>And the Great Salt Lake isn’t unique. Many of the world’s saline lakes are facing a double whammy: People are taking more water from the tributaries that feed the lakes, while a hotter, drier climate means it takes longer to refill them.</p>



<p>Found on every continent, saline lakes include the Caspian Sea, the largest lake in the world, as well as the lowest, the Dead Sea. Saline lakes are terminal lakes — they have no drain, meaning no rivers flow out of them. As water evaporates, salts are left behind from the minerals that wash off the surrounding landscape. Since they are usually found in arid landscapes that receive little precipitation, saline lakes are the first in line to be affected by long-term droughts, which are becoming more common with climate change.</p>



<p>At the same time, the people who live in these deserts divert freshwater for crops, homes and industry. Residents siphon water from streams and rivers into canals, pipelines or reservoirs before it reaches the lakes. And as the lakes shrink, their concentration of salt increases.</p>



<p>Lake Poopó, a high-elevation lake in Bolivia that used to stretch 90 kilometers long and 32 kilometers wide, is now a salty mud flat. The Aral Sea in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, once the world’s fourth largest lake, has at times in recent decades withered to a tenth of its historic 68,000-square-kilometer surface area. India’s largest inland salt lake, Sambhar Salt Lake, is in severe decline, as is Africa’s Lake Chad. Some saline lakes, like Nevada’s Winnemucca Lake, dried up so long ago — the waters that fed it diverted to agricultural fields — that most people have forgotten they were ever wet.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://pws.byu.edu/great-salt-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report released by researchers at Brigham Young University</a> in January, the Great Salt Lake will likely also disappear within five years if residents continue their current rate of “unsustainable” water consumption.</p>





<p>The good news is Utahans still have time to halt or even reverse the Great Salt Lake’s decline by using less water. Cutting agricultural and other outdoor water use by a third to half through a combination of voluntary conservation measures and policy changes would allow the lake to refill enough to support the region’s economy, ecology and quality of life, the report says. If Utahans succeed, the Great Salt Lake can be a model for how to save other saline lakes around the world.</p>

<h4>Why is the Great Salt Lake declining?</h4>



<p>Like other terminal lakes, the Great Salt Lake naturally rises or falls based on how much water falls into and evaporates out of its watershed each year. Most of the precipitation falls as snow in the winter, melting each spring to fill streams that eventually empty into the lake. Because it’s surprisingly shallow for its size — an average of just over four meters deep — the Great Salt Lake fills or drains quickly. In the 1980s, for instance, a wet spell swelled the lake’s surface area to nearly 6,000 square kilometers, more than twice as big as it is today.</p>



<p>Despite natural variations, the lake level is undisputedly trending downward. Hydrologic modeling by Wayne Wurtsbaugh and Sarah Null, both experts on the lake based at Utah State University in Logan, shows that if people had not started siphoning water from the rivers and streams in the region in 1847, when Mormon settlers led by Brigham Young arrived, the lake would be 3.4 meters higher than it is currently.</p>



<p>Today, three-quarters of the water consumed within the Great Salt Lake watershed is used to irrigate crops, mainly hay that feeds cattle that produce beef or dairy, the state’s chief agricultural commodities.</p>



<p>Mineral extraction from the Great Salt Lake accounts for 9 percent of the water consumed. Companies divert briny water directly from the lake to extract its minerals and produce table salt, fertilizer or magnesium metal. Another 9 percent of the water consumed in the basin gets piped to cities to supply homes and businesses with water for indoor, outdoor and industrial uses. The remaining 8 percent is lost from evaporation from lakes and reservoirs in the basin.</p>



<p>Climate change has also contributed to the Great Salt Lake’s record lows. The worst megadrought in 1,200 years has ensnared the American Southwest for the last 22 years. The lake isn’t refilling fast enough to keep up with the withdrawals upstream, while higher temperatures spur more evaporation from the lake.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>How Great Salt Lake water is used</h3>



<p>The vast majority of water consumed in the Great Salt Lake watershed goes toward agriculture, with mineral extraction, homes, industries and evaporation accounting for smaller proportions.</p>

<p>People use more water to grow crops or keep lawns green when it’s hot and dry, which Patrick Donnelly, a research scientist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Missoula, Mont., likens to a climate tax on our waterways. An agricultural producer needs 20 percent more water to grow the same crops in northern Utah than he did 15 years ago, Donnelly says.</p>



<p>Donnelly and colleagues measured changes in 18 saline lakes in the Intermountain West, including the Great Salt Lake, finding an average surface area decrease of 27 percent from 1984 to 2018. The surface area of wetlands in the region diminished by nearly half. The researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Global Change Biology </em>that these losses were driven <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely by demands from irrigated agriculture coupled with higher temperatures</a> that increase evaporation.</p>



<p>And the demand for freshwater in is only increasing. Utah is the fastest growing state in the United States, and 80 percent of the people live in the Great Salt Lake watershed.</p>



<p>Donnelly says it’s “unrealistic” to think that the Great Salt Lake region can stretch its water far enough to meet current and increasing demands. He points to a proposal to further dam and divert the Bear River — the tributary that provides over half of the Great Salt Lake’s freshwater and is already riddled with canals, ditches and reservoirs — to supply growing communities in Utah. The project would lower the level of the Great Salt Lake by more than a meter and a half and push salinity to over 22 percent, damaging the lake’s invertebrate community, Wurtsbaugh and Null reported in the book <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-40352-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Salt Lake Biology</a></em>, published in 2020.</p>



<h4>The consequences of a dry Great Salt Lake</h4>



<p>The region is already feeling the consequences of a shrinking lake. Mineral extraction industries are finding it increasingly difficult to get water to their ponds and processing plants. Some ranchers worry they won’t be able to take their full allotment of irrigation water from the lake’s freshwater tributaries. Even Utah’s famous ski resorts feel the impact: An estimated 5 to 10 percent of the fluffy powder that draws millions of tourists to the area’s slopes comes from snowfall triggered by the lake’s relatively warm waters.</p>



<p>If the Great Salt Lake dries completely, the consequences become much more dire. Owens Lake in Central California offers an example of what happens when saline lakes are drained for human water consumption. It went dry in 1926, just 13 years after the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power diverted the Owens River into a 375-kilometer-long aqueduct&nbsp;to supply water to Southern California. This engineering feat turned fertile farmlands into an eerie dust bowl and caused health problems for residents in nearby communities.</p>



<p>Once a lake bed is exposed, winds kick up ferocious dust storms. Those windblown sediments contribute to air pollution and can contribute to asthma, lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease, among other health issues. Owens Lake has been among the largest sources of dust pollution in the nation. The City of Los Angeles has spent more than $2.5 billion mitigating the dust through projects at the lake bed such as shallow flooding, seeding and planting vegetation, spreading gravel or tilling the ground.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="673" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/060323_salt-lake_inline2_1030.jpg" alt="A photo of several wooden docking slips sitting on top of vegetation on dry ground instead of resting in water." class="wp-image-3123395" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/060323_salt-lake_inline2_1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/060323_salt-lake_inline2_1030-586x383.jpg 586w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/060323_salt-lake_inline2_1030-689x450.jpg 689w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/060323_salt-lake_inline2_1030-285x186.jpg 285w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/060323_salt-lake_inline2_1030-768x502.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/060323_salt-lake_inline2_1030-888x580.jpg 888w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123395">A marina near Antelope Island northwest of Salt Lake City sits high and dry in 2022, when the Great Salt Lake water level hit a record low.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123395">B. Randall</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is sobering news for Salt Lake City, which had at least seven times as much lake bed exposed last fall as Owens Lake. “In the summers when we get a strong south wind, you can literally watch a cloud of dust coming off the lake where the lake bed has been exposed because of the low receding water,” Yamane says.</p>



<p>Sediments at the bottom of saline lakes also collect a slew of pollutants from human activities, such as chemicals from urban and agricultural runoff and toxic mine waste. Historical mining and smelting around the Great Salt Lake, for example, deposited heavy metals like mercury and lead that have accumulated in the lake bed’s sediments. Once exposed, these metals can be transported by dust particles and may increase rates of disease associated with air pollution, according to the January report from the BYU team.</p>



<p>The drying is also bad for birds. The Great Salt Lake supports nearly 350 different species, many of them migratory birds that use the lake to rest and refuel as they cruise north or south along the Central and Pacific flyways. While many migrating birds can make do with any lake, fresh or salty, some species are saline specialists, like eared grebes and phalaropes.</p>



<p>According to a 2017 report by the National Audubon Society, more than half of the saline lakes in the West that are most important for birds have shrunk by 50 to 95 percent in their surface area over the last 150 years. “The birds are competing now for a much more limited resource than they did before,” says John Luft, manager of the Great Salt Lake Ecosystem Program at the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.</p>



<p>During some fall migrations, 5 million eared grebes — perhaps 95 percent of the species’ entire population — have stopped over in Utah, Luft says. Each grebe needs to eat up to 30,000 brine shrimp per day from the Great Salt Lake before continuing on its long migratory journey. Brine shrimp flourish between 12 and 17 percent salinity, but they start to decline drastically once salinity passes that threshold — and the south arm of the Great Salt Lake reached 18 percent <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/great-salt-lake-record-salinity-and-low-water-imperils-millions-birds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last September</a>. (For comparison, the ocean averages about 3.5 percent salinity.)</p>

<h4>What to do about Great Salt Lake’s drying?</h4>



<p>While Wurtsbaugh says that “drying is definitely the projection and the worry,” he believes residents can help halt the decline by using less water.</p>



<p>Null agrees. “We can save Great Salt Lake, but it’s a long solution, not something that we’re going to fix overnight.” The most important way to make progress, she says, is for people to care enough to change their behavior.</p>



<p>Utahans have the second highest per capita use of water in the country. Encouraging people to use less water is the simplest — and cheapest — way to begin refilling the Great Salt Lake. This includes using rain barrels, permeable pavement or xeriscaping in urban or suburban areas, as well as improving the efficiency of irrigation structures on farms and ranches.</p>



<p>Permanently mandating water cutbacks would cost between $5 to $32 per person, according to Wurtsbaugh and Null’s <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345220917_Great_Salt_Lake_Biology_A_Terminal_Lake_in_a_Time_of_Change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a>. The BYU team’s report, coauthored by 32 Great Salt Lake experts, emphasizes that conservation is not only the most cost-effective response, but also “the only way to provide adequate water in time to save Great Salt Lake.” Specifically, the report stresses the importance of reducing outdoor water use, especially on agricultural fields.</p>



<p>Last year, faced with withering streams and ominous lake levels, the Utah State Legislature passed a slew of bills focused on voluntary water conservation. “Honestly, I look at this as our time to shine,” says Joel Ferry, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources. “The people of Utah … want to solve the problem.”</p>



<p>Some of the recent legislation calls for obvious fixes — like banning any requirements that residents water their lawns. Before this legislation, fines for not keeping your grass green were common around Salt Lake City. Other laws focus on making sure basic systems are in place to track water use, from the individual to the watershed level.</p>



<p>For instance, the legislature allocated $250 million to install tens of thousands of meters to track people’s outdoor water use. According to Wurtsbaugh, a previous effort to install meters in the Weber River, which flows into the Great Salt Lake, showed that “just knowing how much water you&#8217;re using compared to what your neighbor’s using” meant people used about 25 percent less water. Metering also opens the door to charging people accurately — or more — for the water they use. Currently, most residents pay a flat fee for all outdoor water, regardless of whether they are watering a few flowers or filling an entire swimming pool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since agriculture accounts for three-quarters of the water use in the Great Salt Lake region, Utah is also encouraging farmers and ranchers to conserve water. This shift has the advantage of making operations more drought resilient, says Ferry, who is also a fifth-generation rancher who irrigates with water from the Bear River. “Producers want to be part of the solution. They have to be.”</p>



<p>In 2022, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food’s Water Optimization Program granted <a href="https://le.utah.gov/interim/2022/pdf/00003611.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$70 million</a> to help farmers and ranchers install drip or sprinkler systems that use less water. The Utah State Legislature also appropriated $40 million last year to preserve flows to the lake. Much of that is dedicated to setting up a water trust to lease water rights from farmers or ranchers willing to sell. Essentially, a water trust would pay irrigators to leave some or all of the water they are permitted to use in the stream or river instead of diverting it to water crops. These water leases could last a single summer or several years.</p>



<p>Water leasing is helping restore other ailing saline lakes. In Nevada, purchasing water rights from willing sellers has boosted the level of <a href="https://www.walkerbasin.org/request-for-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walker Lake</a>, about 150 kilometers southeast of Reno. But because water is so valuable in the arid West, it’s an expensive way to refill a lake. The Walker Basin Restoration Program has spent at least $92 million but has only acquired 53 percent of the water needed to support native fish and wildlife in the lake.</p>



<h4>Big infrastructure and Mother Nature</h4>



<p>If water conservation programs don’t work, Utahans might be faced with a more extreme solution to save the Great Salt Lake.</p>



<p>The alternative to conservation measures, says Null, is “hanging our hopes on big new infrastructure projects” that attempt to refill the lake by bringing water from other basins. One example is the Central Utah Project, which has been in the works for more than 80 years and is still incomplete. This project pipes up to 310 billion liters of water from the Colorado River Basin in eastern Utah, infamously over-tapped already, into a series of reservoirs and tunnels to supply water for irrigation, municipal and industrial uses in the Great Salt Lake’s watershed. According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the initial plans for the Central Utah Project put it “among the most complex” water resources development projects ever undertaken by the bureau, estimated to cost $3 billion once all phases are complete.</p>

<p>In the Aral Sea, dikes were built to preserve the remaining sliver of wet habitat, which meant permanently sacrificing the rest of the historical lake area. In California, Mono Lake was saved by a lawsuit based on the public trust doctrine, which says that the government has a responsibility to protect the resources that belong to everyone. The court’s decision cut off water to cities in Southern California that held water rights to the river that fed Mono Lake. Los Angeles made up the difference in part through water conservation measures.</p>



<p>Ferry says Utah isn’t closing the door on any options. Some of the more unorthodox ideas floating around Salt Lake City include cloud seeding to boost precipitation and piping water from the Pacific Ocean to refill the lake. But the most common strategy echoed by the Utahans interviewed for this story: Pray for snow.</p>



<p>“I’m very optimistic that we are at the lowest of lows,” Ferry said last fall, “as long as we get some snow.”</p>



<p>Utah received a record-setting amount of snow this winter, so the situation is looking up … at least for now. But it will take several years of&nbsp;above-average&nbsp;precipitation to reverse Utah’s lingering drought.</p>



<p>“Mother Nature has a huge role to play in this,” Yamane says. “And it’s going to take a mind-set change, a cultural change and policy changes. But along with Mother Nature, we should be able to save it.”</p>

<p>A researcher and former faculty member at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston has been banned from working with animals for a year following repeated cases of abuse under his supervision, according to documents obtained by an animal-rights group.</p>



<p>In an Oct. 26, 2022, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tufts-October-26.pdf">letter</a> to the federal <a href="https://olaw.nih.gov/home.htm">Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare</a>, the university reported &#8220;serious and continuing noncompliance with&#8221; animal-welfare regulations. These breaches included &#8220;injections in mice via an unapproved route/location, failure to provide required analgesia, inadequate supportive care and monitoring, and failure to euthanize mice upon reaching the approved humane endpoints,&#8221; Tufts said.</p>



<p>When asked for his comments, the researcher “refuted most of the allegations and took no responsibility for his actions,” the university added.</p>



<span id="more-126930"></span>



<p>An earlier <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tufts-May-16-letter.pdf">letter</a> from Tufts, dated May 16, 2022, described “a cage of mice containing one adult male with a litter of dead and moribund neonatal pups. Further investigation revealed the dam was misidentified as male and removed from the cage prematurely.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The school has pulled the responsible researcher off the project he was overseeing, revoked his privilege to work as principal investigator on experiments involving animals and suspended him from doing animal research for one year, the university said in the letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare was <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/OLAW-letter.pdf">satisfied with Tufts’ handling of the case</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Tufts spokesperson Patrick Collins, the researcher, whose name is redacted from the documents obtained by Stop Animal Exploitation Now (SAEN), “was performing research for a company that contracted with the university to use its lab space.”</p>

<p>The University takes this incident seriously and proactively reported it to the National Institutes of Health. The researcher in question is not and was not a Tufts University employee at the time, no longer performs research at Tufts, and is permanently prohibited from being a principal investigator at Tufts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;IACUC number B2020-91,&#8221; which is referenced in the Tufts documents, appears in a <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230089267#history">patent application</a> describing several mouse experiments conducted at Tufts. One of the inventors listed is Abdulraouf Ramadan, who is head of immunology at <a href="https://lapix.com/">Lapix Therapeutics</a> and was a research assistant professor at Tufts between 2017 and 2020, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulraouf-ramadan-ph-d-7057a357">now-deleted LinkedIn profile</a>. The two other inventors are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anas-fathallah-8068bb73/">Anas Fathallah</a>, Lapix’ co-founder and CEO, and <a href="https://pharmacy.umich.edu/people/sdlarsen">Scott D. Larsen</a> of the University of Michigan.</p>



<p>Ramadan’s name also appears on one of the emails obtained by SAEN, which includes an attachment titled “Tufts OLAW notification Ramadan 102622.pdf.”</p>



<p>We called Tufts and were told that Ramadan “is listed as a research assistant professor in the department of ophthalmology.&#8221; Ramadan did not reply to our requests for comment, but his LinkedIn profile was deleted shortly after we contacted him at the Tufts email we were provided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lapix-Therapeutics-USPTO-Letter-4-17-23.pdf">letter</a> to the United States Patent and Trademarking Office dated April 17, SAEN took issue with the <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20230089267">patent</a> application that we identified.</p>



<p>The application, filed by Lapix Therapeutics, repeatedly states that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All animal studies were conducted under IACUC number B2020-91 and in compliance with Tufts University/Tufts Medical Center &amp; Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>SAEN called this statement “patently untrue, and therefore fraudulent” given the violations that Tufts reported:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Therefore, since this patent filing is in fact both fraudulent, and connected to “serious and continuing noncompliance” with PHS policy and federal regulations, it must be revoked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Twice round the world by Boomerang balloon</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/twice-round-world-boomerang-balloon"><em>Science News</em></a>, April 7, 1973</p>



<p>Scientists recovered for the first time … a balloon scientific payload after a long-duration, twice-around-the-world flight. The project is called Boomerang and is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of using balloons for long-duration research.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Balloons fill an important niche in science, bearing instruments to study physics, atmospheric chemistry and astronomy, or to test technologies for space missions. For instance, data collected by balloons have helped reveal that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/balloon-sounds-out-early-universe">the universe is geometrically flat</a>, that Earth’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-lower-atmosphere-rising-climate-change-troposphere">lower atmosphere is rising</a> due to climate change and how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worst-wildfires-can-send-smoke-high-enough-affect-ozone-layer">wildfire smoke impacts the ozone layer</a> (<em>SN: 10/08/02</em>; <em>SN: 12/18/21</em>; <em>SN: 8/8/19</em>). </p>



<p>Earlier this year, the United States shot down several objects high above the country, one of which is alleged to be a surveillance balloon from China. Others are likely “tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions studying weather or conducting other scientific research,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/16/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-united-states-response-to-recent-aerial-objects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Joe Biden said February&nbsp;16 in a news briefing</a>. Some scientists worry rising concerns over spying could limit where high-altitude balloons go — a tall order for vessels that follow the wind.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-tree-rings">The summer of 2021 was the Pacific Northwest’s hottest in a millennium</a></h4>

              
                <p>A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">two-week-long heat wave</a> in the Pacific Northwest in 2021 helped make that summer a record breaker for the region (<em>SN: 7/7/21</em>). Now, tree ring data from the area’s forests reveal that the summer of 2021 was also the region’s hottest of the last millennium.</p>



<p>The average temperature for that year&#8217;s summer not only shattered the previous record, set in 2015, by 0.4 degrees Celsius. It was also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-023-00340-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unprecedented since the year 950</a>, researchers reported February 17 in <em>npj Climate and Atmospheric Science</em>.</p>





<p>The average temperature in the Pacific Northwest from June through August was a whopping 3.6 degrees warmer than the average summer temperature worldwide for the years 1951 through 1980. That global value, 15.2 °C, is a common benchmark used for comparison. </p>



<p>Based on modern meteorological records for the area, the scientists also found that such an extremely high average temperature has only a 1-in-25,000 chance of occurring in any one particular year.</p>



<p>Starting in late June 2021, daytime temperatures at some spots in the Pacific Northwest reached nearly 50° C (or about 122° Fahrenheit). The extreme heat caused wildfires to rage and boosted the rates of heat-related deaths in the region, says Karen Heeter, a dendrochronologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y.</p>



<p>To see how the record-setting summer temperatures stacked up against those in years before meteorologists compiled weather data, Heeter and her colleagues looked at tree ring samples collected from dozens of trees at 17 sites in the Pacific Northwest. The core samples were taken from living trees between the early 1990s and 2021. Two of the core samples chronicled temperatures as far back as the year 950, the team found.</p>



<p>The team measured the widths and densities of the portions of tree rings that had formed in summer months. Generally for conifers in the Pacific Northwest, the warmer the growing season temperature, the wider the tree ring and the denser the wood formed during that period. By statistically blending data from the 17 sites, the team created a year-by-year profile of the entire region’s average summertime temperatures from 950 through 2021.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h2>Tree ring temps</h2>



<p>Tree ring data from the Pacific Northwest let researchers reconstruct the year-to-year average summer temperature in the region from 950 to 2021. This graph shows the distribution of those temperatures relative to the 1951–1980 global summer average. Summertime temperatures for most of the years fell within a degree of that long-term average. But at roughly 3.6 degrees Celsius warmer, the summer of 2021 (arrow) stands out — hotter than any summer in the past millennium.</p>

<p>Evidence of 2021’s record heat in the Pacific Northwest doesn’t come as a surprise to Bryan Black, a dendrochronologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. As he conducted field work in the area that summer, he noticed that many of the region’s trees showed a notable browning on their southwestern sides, which would have borne the brutal brunt of afternoon sunshine. </p>



<p>“The tree scorch was shocking,” says Black, who was not part of the new study. The average summer temperatures “were extraordinarily away from the norm.”</p>



<p>That anomaly, says Lauren Stachowiak, a geographer at Eastern Washington University in Cheney who studies tree rings and lived in the area at the time, will undoubtedly show up in tree ring samples obtained in future studies.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691191317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Period</a><br><em>Kate Clancy</em><br><em>Princeton Univ., $27.95</em></p>



<p>In a February golf tournament, after Tiger Woods hit his ball farther on the ninth tee than Justin Thomas, Woods handed Thomas a tampon. Get it? Thomas is weak! Haha.</p>



<p>Contrast this with the viral videos of writhing men hooked up to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw-WbC8qNqE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">menstrual cramp simulator</a> created to bring awareness to period pain. When CBS News correspondent Jamie Yuccas’ producer tried the simulator set at the pain level Yuccas regularly experiences, he was visibly distressed. “Are you serious? This is your baseline?” he said, with a following comment bleeped out.</p>





<p>There probably aren’t enough cramp simulators to enlighten everyone who doesn’t menstruate. But here’s another option: Hand them a copy of Kate Clancy’s <em>Period: The Real Story of Menstruation</em>. Better yet, give this book to everyone. Getting accurate information about the why and how of periods is difficult even for those who do menstruate. There remains considerable stigma and revulsion toward this physiological event that half the population experiences during a large portion of life.</p>



<p>Clancy, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, studies the impact of environmental stressors on the physiology of menstruating people. In <em>Period</em>, she lays out the science of menstruation along with details on the reproductive cycle and the uterus. She also challenges readers to think about the research climate, dominated by white men, that has shaped the views of menstruation and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vagina-obscura-book-female-biology-sexism">the female reproductive system</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/22, p. 29</em>).</p>



<p>“Given anthropology’s history of removing women from the hero myths of human evolution or never noticing their worth in the first place,” Clancy writes, “menstruation is worth a closer look.”</p>



<p>For example, Clancy lays out emerging evidence on menstrual priming, the idea that each time the body prepares the lining of the uterus for a possible embryo and then repairs the lining during menstruation, it’s conditioning the uterus to better provide a rich and nourishing site for an eventual pregnancy. In other words, periods serve an evolutionary purpose. It’s not just the body expelling the lining because it’s reached the end of its shelf life, as a major hypothesis contends.</p>



<p>Clancy also discusses the long history of viewing menstruation as polluting. A popular “medical” textbook from medieval times contended that menstruating women emitted dangerous fumes that could “poison the eyes of children lying in their cradles by a glance.”</p>





<p>This notion has persisted. In 1920 in Vienna, a doctor named Béla Schick claimed that menstruating women secreted toxins, after a series of experiments in which such women handled flowers that then wilted. These “menotoxins” became a go-to explanation for a number of women’s illnesses — as well as the ailments of those who were <em>nearby</em> a menstruating woman — for decades. Poisonous fumes all over again.</p>



<p>Of course, “menotoxins” aren’t real. But the idea that menstruation is polluting still shapes attitudes. Clancy writes of a 2002 study in which a participant was paired with a woman, an actor playing a participant. After reaching into her handbag, the actor would <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-01317-004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accidentally drop either a tampon</a> or a hair clip. In questionnaires, the participants who had seen the tampon rated the woman less capable and likeable. And in a sign of disgust, participants were more likely to sit away from the actor after she had dropped a tampon than after she had dropped a hair clip.</p>



<p>Considering the stigma, it’s no surprise that menstruating people tend to hide their periods. To change attitudes, Clancy writes, it’s time to become “more visible as menstruating people.” The disgust about menstruation is learned and it leads to silence, she writes, which means that people with uteruses cede their agency. When menstruation is hidden, it makes it easier for the rest of society to ignore menstruating people.</p>



<p>Clancy would like society to acknowledge and better accommodate menstruation, and she’s not alone. In a survey of nearly 33,000 women in the Netherlands, 81 percent reported that <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e026186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">menstrual symptoms are disruptive</a> to work and school, researchers reported in <em>BMJ Open</em> in 2019. Sixty-eight percent said that, during their periods, they’d like more flexibility with tasks and their work and school hours. The Spanish parliament took a step in this direction in February, passing legislation for paid menstrual leave. </p>



<p>Clancy ends <em>Period</em> by envisioning a society that considers menstruating people’s needs, that offers contraception and menstrual suppression options that work for more people, that takes menstrual pain seriously, and more. “What I am imagining is a world where it is as unremarkable for someone to openly carry a tampon as it is to carry a hair clip and where discussing the care of our bodies does not label us weak.”</p>

<p>A health services journal has retracted a recent commentary about diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) activities at the University of Minnesota after the authors said they had unintentionally “mischaracterized the authenticity of experiences represented.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The four-page commentary, titled “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1475-6773.14130">Transactional and transformative diversity, equity, and inclusion activities in health services research departments</a>,” had appeared in the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14756773"><em>Health Services Research</em></a> for almost three months before its retraction in March. It was co-authored by three employees at the University of Minnesota: professor <a href="https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/janette-dill">Janette Dill</a>, lecturer <a href="https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/stuart-grande">Stuart Grande</a> and <a href="https://pop.umn.edu/people/tongtan-bert-chantarat">Tongtan Chantarat</a>, a research scientist at the institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article details the DEI-related activities within the school’s Division of Health Policy and Management that were implemented from 2020 onwards amid calls for racial equity. (Minneapolis, where the university’s main campus is based, was the site of George Floyd’s murder in May 2020.) They label some efforts as “performative”, but go on to outline hopes for “transformative change” in the division – referring to attempts to build trust and relationships with students and faculty belonging to racial and ethnic minority groups.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126901"></span>



<p>The article was a response to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-6773.14032">an earlier paper</a> by Chantarat that surveyed health services researchers in the United States and found more than half did not believe their colleagues reflected the diversity of the communities affected by their research. Of the participants who said that their institutions had DEI initiatives, almost 40% described them as “tokenistic,” according to the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6773.14130">retraction notice</a> for the commentary stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The above article… has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief, Austin B. Frakt, the Health Research and Education Trust, and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. The retraction has been agreed following concerns raised by the authors following publication that their characterisation of specific data (personal narratives and experiences) was either inaccurate, misleading, or false. The final submitted manuscript unintentionally contained content that mischaracterised the authenticity of experiences represented, and the authors have requested retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the text, the authors specifically refer to the personal experiences of “one Black faculty member and one Native American faculty member [who were] overwhelmed with advising and mentoring responsibilities, in addition to teaching much of the content in the Division on structural racism.”</p>



<p>Other faculty members, they wrote, “do not feel equipped or trained to incorporate content related to DEI and issues of structural inequity into their classroom.”</p>



<p>They also wrote that some students “do not feel that race or racial inequity, structural racism, and other systems of oppression are adequately or comprehensively covered in the classroom.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dill, the corresponding author on the paper, declined to speak on the record about the retraction or point to which parts of the article mischaracterized personal narratives and experiences. The two other authors did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The division received an “outpouring” of correspondence from students and faculty in the days following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, pointing out that “change was needed” at the university, according to the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the commentary the authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This communication provided specific experiences of racist behaviors by faculty, staff, and students, and widespread systemic and structural racism within our institution.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The university’s School of Public Health was <a href="https://mndaily.com/261925/news/ctsphletter/">scrutinized at the time</a> for alleged racism. An <a href="https://medium.com/@marygilbertson07/open-letter-to-dean-finnegan-university-of-minnesota-school-of-public-health-4141e9200069">open letter</a> demanding change in the school was addressed to the dean at the time, John Finnegan. It was <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktNd63CTdAeZUsePyRA_JLlpSCmijcmWhM7H-K-kmMU/edit#gid=0">signed by 239</a> students and alumni.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sirry Alang, an alumna of the School of Public Health, also <a href="https://medium.com/@sma206/to-john-f-finnegan-jr-umn-school-of-public-health-da96131c0eb3">published an open letter</a> addressed to the dean in June 2020, writing that she was treated “cruelly and inhumanely” during her time as a doctoral student in health policy and management. </p>



<p>Finnegan <a href="https://www.sph.umn.edu/news/u-of-mn-school-of-public-health-dean-john-finnegan-jr-to-retire/">retired from his post</a> in fall 2021. The interim dean, Timothy Beebe, has not responded to requests for comment on the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dill and Grande are co-chairs of the Division of Health Policy and Management’s <a href="https://www.sph.umn.edu/academics/divisions/hpm/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">Anti-Racism Practice Committee</a>, formed in the summer of 2020.</p>



<p>In the paper they wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are White health service researchers serving as co-chairs of a committee charged with executing Division anti-racism and DEI goals. Both of us have some training and experience in DEI issues, but we have certainly made mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An earlier version of the webpage confirmed that the retracted commentary had undergone a full peer review.</p>



<p>The editor of the journal, <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/austin-b-frakt/">Austin Frakt</a>, deferred to the authors for comment. We also reached out to the leadership and faculty members at the School of Public Health, who have not responded to requests for comment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hibernating-bears-blood-clots">Hibernating bears don’t get blood clots. Now scientists know why</a></h4>

              
                <p>People stuck sitting in tight airplane seats for an entire long-haul flight are at risk of dangerous blood clots. But somehow immobile, hibernating bears are not. Now scientists know why.</p>



<p>Bears settled in for winterlong slumbers have <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low levels of a key protein that helps blood clots form</a>, researchers report in the April 14 <em>Science</em>. Platelets lacking this protein don’t easily stick together, protecting the animals from developing potentially dangerous blood clots. And low levels of the protein are not just found in bears, the team writes. Mice, pigs and humans with a largely sedentary lifestyle because of long-term mobility problems have the same protection.</p>





<p>The study is a “huge step forward,” says Tinen Iles, a computational biologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who was not involved with the research. It brought together researchers from a wide variety of backgrounds — from wildlife biologists to health care experts — to show how animals have adapted to stop immobility-related blood clots. Now, researchers have a roadmap to mimic nature’s solutions with drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heat shock protein 47, or HSP47, is normally found in the cells that make up connective tissues like bone and cartilage. It’s also found in platelets, where HSP47 attaches to collagen, a protein that helps platelets stick together. This is helpful when the body responds to a cut or other injury; it’s dangerous when a clump of platelets blocks blood flow to the lungs. Potential drugs based on this study’s finding would aim to stop HSP47 from interacting with proteins or immune cells that spark clots, says Tobias Petzold, a cardiologist at University Hospital at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.</p>



<p>Staying still for long periods of time — like during <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inactivity-not-altitude-probably-behind-blood-clots">air travel</a> — can put people at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis, rare but dangerous blood clots that usually take shape in the legs (<em>SN: 6/13/06</em>). During such periods of inactivity, inflammation and slow blood flow can make clots more likely to form. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Hibernating bears spend months in a dormant state, lowering their heart rate below what’s typical in active months. But studies have suggested that the animals don’t <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lessons-torpid">die of conditions linked to blood clots in veins</a> during hibernation (<em>SN: 2/10/12</em>). What’s more, people who experience long-term immobility, such as those with spinal cord injuries, do not develop more clots than people with typical mobility, Petzold says. But it was unclear why immobile bears and some people are protected from potentially deadly clots.</p>



<p>Petzold and colleagues analyzed blood samples from 13 wild brown bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) in winter and summer. Platelets from blood samples taken during hibernation were less likely to clump together than summer samples, and ones that did clot did so more slowly. That seasonal difference was pinned to HSP47 in platelets: In hibernating bears, levels of the protein were about one-fiftieth the amount found in active animals.</p>

<p>To confirm that HSP47 could be behind the bears’ lack of blood clots, the team did lab tests with mice. Mice lacking the protein had fewer clots and lower levels of inflammation than animals that did have HSP47. What’s more, pigs that had recently given birth — rendering them largely immobile for up to 28 days while feeding their piglets — also had lower HSP47 levels compared with active pigs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These findings extend to people, too. People with long-term immobility because of spinal cord injury had low levels of HSP47 and no other signs of inflammation-related clotting. The same was also true among 10 otherwise healthy people who spent a month participating in a voluntary bed rest study. After 27 days of immobility, their HSP47 levels went down.</p>





<p>Overall, most animals use similar proteins and cells to make clots and prevent blood loss, says Marjory Brooks, a veterinarian and comparative hematologist at Cornell University who wasn’t involved in the study. But there may be some variation among species in the sequence of events that come before the clot.</p>



<p>Understanding how human bodies specifically regulate HSP47 is important so that potential drugs find the right balance between preventing clots and too much bleeding.</p>



<p>The next big question to address, Petzold says, is how motionlessness prompts the body to make less HSP47.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/estrogen-birth-control-reduced">Estrogen in birth control could be cut way back, a study suggests</a></h4>

              
                <p>Estrogen causes hormonal birth controls’ most serious and rare side effects, such as stroke and heart attack. The hormone is also at the root of some of the contraceptives’ less serious but still annoying symptoms, including nausea and headaches.</p>



<p>Designing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birth-control-research-moving-beyond-pill">birth control</a> that has a lower dose of estrogen but is still effective is an area of active research (<em>SN: 8/22/17</em>). Now, using a mathematical model, researchers have found that cutting the dose of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estrogen in common contraceptives by 92 percent</a> might still prevent pregnancy.</p>





<p>And a tiny dose of progesterone, another contraceptive hormone, or even teenier doses of the two hormones combined, may be enough to squelch ovulation — if the drugs are delivered during a critical window of the menstrual cycle, the researchers report April 13 in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Many highly effective contraceptive options contain enough estrogen that they are inaccessible to some people, such as those with a family history of breast cancer or high blood pressure. Verifying in clinical trials that such lower doses of the hormone do, in fact, prevent ovulation could increase access to estrogen-based contraceptives for people at risk of serious side effects.</p>



<p>Building on an existing mathematical model of the menstrual cycle, Brenda Lyn Gavina and Aurelio de los Reyes, both computational biologists at the University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City, added real-world data from 23 women ages 20 to 34. The model captured the complex tango among hormone levels in the blood coming from three main sources: the pituitary glands, ovaries and hormonal birth control.</p>



<p>The researchers modeled how consistent doses of either progesterone or estrogen — at about the levels currently found in common birth control options — prevented ovulation throughout a menstrual cycle. Then, the team applied a mathematical strategy called optimal control theory to determine the lowest amount of estrogen or progesterone able to halt ovulation.</p>



<p>Delivering just 8 percent of the estrogen about 11 days after the start of the menstrual cycle — right before an egg is released — prevented the ovary from releasing an egg. Giving an even lower dose of estrogen and progesterone at that phase also prevented ovulation, the team found. The dose could be delivered either as a shot or an implant, the researchers speculate.</p>



<p>“We did not only lower the dosage, but we also identified when to administer the contraceptive,” de los Reyes says.</p>



<p>Such a low estrogen dose probably would alleviate some adverse symptoms, but the new research probably won’t be used to make better contraceptives anytime soon, says Alison Edelman, a gynecologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland who studies hormonal birth control.</p>





<p>The model assumes that the estrogen coming from birth control stays at a consistent value and doesn’t incorporate how the body absorbs the hormone over time, which is likely to fluctuate and might affect how well the drug works.</p>



<p>“I want to assure people that [low-dose estrogen in birth control] is already being looked at,” Edelman says. And she emphasizes that the hormone-based birth control methods that “we have are already safe and effective” for the people cleared to use them.</p>



<p>Gavina and de los Reyes say they hope to collaborate with clinicians like Edelman to make their model more useful for researchers working on creating lower-dose birth control options.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flash-drought-common-climate-rain">‘Flash droughts’ are growing increasingly common</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fast-forming droughts are occurring more often and with greater speed in many parts of the world due to climate change, a new study finds. These “flash droughts” are replacing more typical, slower ones and are harder to predict and prepare for, which could make their management more difficult.</p>



<p>Most major droughts have tended to occur over seasonal or yearly time scales, resulting from variability in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-teleconnections-droughts-fires">large-scale climate patterns</a> such as El Niño (<em>SN: 2/13/23</em>). But in roughly the last six decades, there has been a transition toward <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn6301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more droughts that form over just a few weeks</a> with little warning in most of the world, researchers report in the April 14 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“This finding has massive implications for ecosystem conservation and agricultural management,” says Christine O’Connell, an ecosystem ecologist at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., who was not involved in the study. “Will some species of plants be less able to survive a trend towards flash droughts? What would that mean for biodiversity or the amount of carbon stored in an ecosystem?”</p>



<p>Some flash droughts develop into seasonal ones, yet even those that do not can cause significant damage to agriculture and contribute to other extreme weather events such as wildfires and heat waves. In the summer of 2012, a severe flash drought across the United States caused over $30 billion in damages. Many affected areas transformed from normal conditions to extreme drought within a month, and no climate models predicted it.</p>



<p>Previous research has suggested that flash droughts are on the rise in some areas. But it was unclear whether they were replacing slower-onset droughts, meaning the usually slow droughts were coming on faster, or if both fast- and slow-onset droughts were increasing in tandem.</p>



<p>To find out, Xing Yuan, a hydrologist at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in China, and colleagues analysed soil moisture data from around the world from 1951 to 2014. They distinguished between flash and slow subseasonal droughts by exploring the rate at which soils dried during the initial period of drought onset, then calculated how often each occurred and the geographic spread.</p>



<p>The speed of drought onset on subseasonal scales has increased in much of the world, the team found. And the ratio of fast to slow droughts has increased in over 74 percent of global regions set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Extreme Events. Certain regions such as South Australia, North and East Asia, the Sahara, Europe and the western coast of South America were most affected.</p>



<p>By comparing climate models that included or omitted factors like greenhouse gases, the researchers found that human-induced climate change is a major influence on the global trends. These patterns intensify under higher-emission scenarios, and the onset speed for droughts also increases.</p>



<p>The climate anomalies, such as heat waves, driving these flash droughts are more extreme than those that drive seasonal or interannual droughts, which leads to severe droughts in a shorter time, Yuan says.</p>





<p>As with most droughts, a period of low rainfall is still the main driver of flash droughts. But excessive evapotranspiration — water moving into the atmosphere from soil and plants — plays a key role in these droughts’ emergence by drying out soils quickly, the analysis shows. Flash droughts happen two to three times as often in humid regions such as northwest North America, Europe and southern China as elsewhere, the study found.</p>



<p>As the world continues to warm, causing more evapotranspiration and less rainfall, flash drought frequency is expected to continue to rise, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The study is “very important as we are living in it now,” says Mark Svoboda, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln who first coined the term “flash droughts” 20 years ago but wasn’t involved in the new research. “We now have more data to confirm my hunch that the interplay of drought with winds, evapotranspiration and heat waves in particular could really lead to rapid onset drought.”</p>



<p>Predicting flash droughts is challenging as current monitoring systems often cannot capture their onset at short enough time scales. “We have to improve these systems,” Yuan says, by exploring the mechanisms behind flash droughts and improving simulations, perhaps with the help of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dealing with these droughts isn’t just about having a better tool set, Svoboda says, but also a different mind-set. “It is human nature not to deal with drought until you&#8217;re in it. Instead, we advocate that drought be dealt with proactively instead of reactively.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-black-hole-m87-machine-learning">The first black hole portrait got sharper thanks to machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>If the first image of a black hole looked like a fuzzy doughnut, this one is a thin onion ring.</p>



<p>Using a machine learning technique, scientists have sharpened the portrait of the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87, revealing a thinner halo of glowing gas than seen previously.</p>



<p>In 2019, scientists with the Event Horizon Telescope unveiled <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">an image of M87’s black hole</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). The picture was the first ever taken of a black hole and showed a blurry orange ring of swirling gas silhouetted by the dark behemoth. The <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acc32d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new ring&#8217;s thickness is half that of the original</a>, despite being based on the same data, researchers report April 13 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Scientists created a new, sharper version of the first image of a black hole. The supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87, imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019, originally looked like a fuzzy ring, created by the glowing gas surrounding the black hole. A machine learning technique allowed scientists to refine that image to reveal a thinner band. This video morphs from the fuzzier image into its new, improved version.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Event Horizon Telescope takes data using a network of telescopes across the globe. But that technique leaves holes in the data. “Since we can’t just cover the entire Earth in telescopes, what that means is that there is some missing information,” says astrophysicist Lia Medeiros of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. “We need to have an algorithm that can fill in those gaps.”</p>





<p>Previous analyses had used certain assumptions to fill in those gaps, such as preferring an image that is smooth. But the new technique uses machine learning to fill in those gaps based on over 30,000 simulated images of matter swirling around a black hole, creating a sharper image.</p>



<p>In the future, this technique could help scientists get a better handle on the black hole’s mass and perform improved tests of gravity and other studies of black hole physics.</p>

<p>The corresponding author of a recently published – and then quickly retracted – letter in <em>The Lancet</em> decrying the failure of the Chinese Ministry of Health to pay doctors and other health care workers says authorities did not pressure him to withdraw the piece.</p>



<p>The letter begins:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end in China, medical personnel who have worked tirelessly to fight the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant are now facing a new challenge. Despite their heroic efforts, many of them are now struggling to receive the financial compensation they deserve.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673623006918">retraction notice</a>, published on March 31, just eight days after the original letter, blames “inaccurate statements and personal opinions from social media” for the authors’ decision to retract, which was communicated to the journal on March 27.</p>



<p>By our count, there have now been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">315 retractions of COVID-19 papers</a>.</p>



<p>Tian Yang, the corresponding author of the letter and a liver specialist at Hangzhou Medical College and Second Military Medical University (Navy Medical University) in Shanghai, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The reason for the retraction is due to “inaccurate statements and personal opinions” that this correspondence cited one reference from personal social media sources.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-bat-skeletons-oldest-fossils">Newfound bat skeletons are the oldest on record</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two fossilized bat skeletons unearthed in western Wyoming represent a new species and are the oldest set of bat bones yet discovered, researchers say.</p>



<p>The incredibly <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283505" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete fossils of <em>Icaronycteris gunnelli</em></a>, which show all the animals’ bones in lifelike positions, are from limestone rocks that accumulated as lake sediments about 52.5 million years ago, vertebrate paleontologist Tim Rietbergen and colleagues report April 12 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Skeletons of the few other bat species, including another one from the <em>Icaronycteris</em> genus, found in the same limestones, called the Green River Formation, were preserved at least 40 centimeters above the new fossils — and are thus younger.</p>





<p>But it’s difficult to estimate just how much younger those fossils are because researchers don’t know how rapidly sediments accumulated over time, says Rietbergen, of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands.</p>



<p>An analysis of the newfound skeletons indicates <em>I</em>. <em>gunnelli</em> is the runt of its genus. The species has a wingspan, typically estimated from the length of forearm bones, that is almost 7 percent smaller than that of the bat’s closest known cousin, Rietbergen and colleagues say. During its lifetime, <em>I. gunnelli </em>weighed somewhere between 22.5 and 28.9 grams — roughly half as heavy as a tennis ball, the team calculates.</p>



<p>These skeletons “are a great discovery,” says Zhe-Xi Luo, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the study. The arrangement of bones in <em>I. gunnelli</em>’s feet suggest that it, like many modern bats, hung upside down when roosting, he says.</p>



<p>Because the skeletons are so much like those of some modern bats, “we’re not any closer to knowing what type of creatures bats evolved from,” says Brock Fenton, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, who also was not involved with the work. The world’s oldest known bats lived about 56 million years ago, but the fossils of those species are mostly isolated teeth, not entire skeletons. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gold-nanoparticles-crystal-structure">Videos of gold nanoparticles snapping together show how some crystals grow</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mesmerizing videos offer a new look at the ways crystals form.</p>



<p>The real-time clips, described March 30 in <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em>, show closeup views of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-023-01355-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microscopic gold particles tumbling, sliding and flitting about</a> before clicking into place in crystalline structures.</p>



<p>Before embarking on the study, physicist Erik Luijten of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., had expected to simply confirm century-old perceptions about how crystals form. But, he says, “there was still so much to discover about crystallization.” &nbsp;</p>





<p>Atoms that make up familiar crystals such as salt, sugar and quartz are hard to image in action. So the team turned to gold nanoparticles, each about 60 billionths of a meter across, or roughly one-thousandth the diameter of a typical human hair. The researchers used transmission electron microscopy to track the particles as they snapped into position after floating in a salty fluid.</p>



<p>Among the surprises in the videos, Luijten says, is the way crystallization depended on the gold nanoparticles skittering across crystal surfaces, as well as how the particles rapidly made their way to the growing crystals from the surrounding fluid. The videos allowed the researchers to find ways to control both of those processes.</p>

<p>By adjusting the chemistry of the fluid, the researchers tuned the rate at which the nanoparticles were deposited from the surrounding solution to build up the crystals. Choosing among shapes including cubes, cubes with indented faces and spheres changed how the particles moved along the crystals. By changing both fluid chemistry and particle shape, the researchers controlled whether the nanoparticle crystals grew smooth planes or rough surfaces.</p>



<p>The nanoparticles are hundreds of times the size of atoms. But the researchers think that atoms grow into crystals in much the same way, making the nanoparticles handy stand-ins. The study could aid in the design of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/future-smart-clothes-could-pack-serious-gadgetry">bendable electronics</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perovskites-power-solar-industry">high-efficiency solar cells</a> and other materials with properties that rely on crystal structures (<em>SN: 6/1/18; SN: 7/26/17</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chatgpt-ai-artificial-intelligence-education-cheating-accuracy">How ChatGPT and similar AI will disrupt education</a></h4>

              
                <p>“We need to talk,” Brett Vogelsinger said. A student had just asked for feedback on an essay. One paragraph stood out. Vogelsinger, a ninth grade English teacher in Doylestown, Pa., realized that the student hadn’t written the piece himself. He had used ChatGPT.</p>



<p>The artificial intelligence tool, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made available for free</a> late last year by the company OpenAI, can reply to simple prompts and generate essays and stories. It can also write code.</p>



<p>Within a week, it had more than a million users. As of early 2023, Microsoft planned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to invest $10&nbsp;billion into OpenAI</a>, and OpenAI’s value had been put at $29 billion, more than double what it was in 2021.</p>





<p>It’s no wonder other tech companies have been racing to put out competing tools. Anthropic, an AI company founded by former OpenAI employees, is testing a new chatbot called Claude. Google <a href="https://bard.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched Bard</a> in early February, and the Chinese search company Baidu released Ernie Bot in March.</p>



<p>A lot of people have been using ChatGPT out of curiosity or for entertainment. I asked it to invent a silly excuse for not doing homework in the style of a medieval proclamation. In less than a second, it offered me: “Hark! Thy servant was beset by a horde of mischievous leprechauns, who didst steal mine quill and parchment, rendering me unable to complete mine homework.”</p>



<p>But students can also use it to cheat. ChatGPT marks the beginning of a new wave of AI, a wave that’s poised to disrupt education.</p>



<p>When Stanford University’s student-run newspaper polled students at the university, 17 percent <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/01/22/scores-of-stanford-students-used-chatgpt-on-final-exams-survey-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said they had used ChatGPT on assignments or exams</a> at the end of 2022. Some admitted to submitting the chatbot’s writing as their own. For now, these students and others are probably getting away with it. That’s because ChatGPT often does an excellent job.</p>



<p>“It can outperform a lot of middle school kids,” Vogelsinger says. He might not have known his student had used it, except for one thing: “He copied and pasted the prompt.”</p>



<p>The essay was still a work in progress, so Vogelsinger didn’t see it as cheating. Instead, he saw an opportunity. Now, the student and AI are working together. ChatGPT is helping the student with his writing and research skills.</p>





<p>“[We’re] color-coding,” Vogelsinger says. The parts the student writes are in green. The parts from ChatGPT are in blue. Vogelsinger is helping the student pick and choose a few sentences from the AI to expand on — and allowing other students to collaborate with the tool as well. Most aren’t turning to it regularly, but a few kids really like it. Vogelsinger thinks the tool has helped them focus their ideas and get started.</p>



<p>This story had a happy ending. But at many schools and universities, educators are struggling with how to handle ChatGPT and other AI tools.</p>



<p>In early January, <a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2023/1/3/23537987/nyc-schools-ban-chatgpt-writing-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City public schools banned ChatGPT</a> on their devices and networks. Educators were worried that students who turned to it wouldn’t learn critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. They also were concerned that the tool’s answers might not be accurate or safe. Many other school systems in the United States and around the world have imposed similar bans.</p>



<p>Keith Schwarz, who teaches computer science at Stanford, said he had “switched back to pencil-and-paper exams,” so students couldn’t use ChatGPT, according to the <em>Stanford Daily</em>.</p>



<p>Yet ChatGPT and its kin could also be a great service to learners everywhere. Like calculators for math or Google for facts, AI can make writing that often takes time and effort much faster. With these tools, anyone can generate well-formed sentences and paragraphs. How could this change the way we teach and learn?</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Who said what? </h3>



<p>When prompted, ChatGPT can craft answers that sound surprisingly like those from a student. We asked middle school and high school students from across the country, all participants in our <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/outreach-and-equity/science-news-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science News Learning education program</a>, to answer some basic science questions in two sentences or less. The examples throughout the story compare how students responded with how ChatGPT responded when asked to answer the question at the same grade level.</p>

<h5>What effect do greenhouse gases have on the Earth?</h5>



<h6>Agnes B. | Grade 11, Harbor City International School, Minn.</h6>



<p>Greenhouse gases effectively trap heat from dissipating out of the atmosphere, increasing the amount of heat that remains near Earth in the troposphere.</p>



<h6>ChatGPT</h6>



<p>Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, causing the planet to warm up and leading to climate change and its associated impacts like sea level rise, more frequent extreme weather events and shifts in ecosystems.</p>

<h4>The good, bad and weird of ChatGPT</h4>



<p>ChatGPT has wowed its users. “It’s so much more realistic than I thought a robot could be,” says Avani Rao, a sophomore in high school in California. She hasn’t used the bot to do homework. But for fun, she’s prompted it to say creative or silly things. She asked it to explain addition, for instance, in the voice of an evil villain.</p>



<p>Given how well it performs, there are plenty of ways that ChatGPT could level the playing field for students and others working in a second language or struggling with composing sentences. Since ChatGPT generates new, original material, its text is not technically plagiarism.</p>



<p>Students could use ChatGPT like a coach to help improve their writing and grammar, or even to explain subjects they find challenging. “It really will tutor you,” says Vogelsinger, who had one student come to him excited that ChatGPT had clearly outlined a concept from science class.</p>



<p>Educators could use ChatGPT to help generate lesson plans, activities or assessments — perhaps even personalized to address the needs or goals of specific students.</p>



<p>Xiaoming Zhai, an expert in science education at the University of Georgia in Athens, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4312418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested ChatGPT to see if it could write an academic paper</a>. He was impressed with how easy it was to summarize knowledge and generate good writing using the tool. “It’s really amazing,” he says.</p>



<p>All of this sounds wonderful, but really big problems exist. Most worrying, ChatGPT and other similar tools can often get things very wrong. They don’t pull facts from databases. Rather, they are trained to generate new text that sounds natural. They remix language without understanding it, which can lead to glaring mistakes.</p>



<p>The news website CNET came under fire earlier this year for using AI to churn out dozens of articles, many of them packed with errors. In an early advertisement for the Bard chatbot, it made a factual error about the James Webb Space Telescope, incorrectly claiming that it had taken the very first picture of an exoplanet. And ChatGPT said in a conversation posted on Twitter that the fastest marine mammal was the peregrine falcon. A falcon, of course, is a bird and doesn’t live in the ocean.</p>



<p>ChatGPT is “confidently wrong,” says Casey Fiesler, an expert in the ethics of technology at the University of Colorado Boulder. “There are mistakes and bad information.” She has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@professorcasey/video/7176001815341944110?is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made multiple TikTok videos about the pitfalls of ChatGPT</a>.</p>



<p>Most of ChatGPT’s training data come from before September 2021, and it does not provide sources for its information. If asked for sources, it makes them up, Fiesler <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@professorcasey/video/7175274448231173419?_r=1&amp;_t=8Y9IFiLVQg2&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed in one video</a>. Zhai, who sees the tool as an assistant, discovered the exact same thing. When he asked ChatGPT for citations, it gave him sources that looked correct. But they didn’t actually exist.</p>

<h4>How ChatGPT works</h4>



<p>ChatGPT’s mistakes make sense if you know how it works. “It doesn’t reason. It doesn’t have ideas. It doesn’t have thoughts,” explains Emily M. Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>ChatGPT was developed using at least two types of machine learning. The primary type is a large language model based on an artificial neural network. Loosely inspired by how neurons in the brain interact, this computing architecture finds statistical patterns in vast amounts of data.</p>



<p>A language model learns to predict what words will come next in a sentence or phrase by churning through vast amounts of text. It places words and phrases into a multidimensional map that represents their relationships to one another. Words that tend to come together, like peanut butter and jelly, end up closer together in this map.</p>



<p>The size of an artificial neural network is measured in parameters. These internal values get tweaked as the model learns. In 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3. At the time, it was the biggest language model ever, containing 175 billion parameters. It had trained on text from the internet as well as digitized books and academic journals. Training text also included transcripts of dialog, essays, exams and more, says Sasha Luccioni, a Montreal-based researcher at Hugging Face, a company that builds AI tools.</p>



<p>OpenAI improved upon GPT-3 to create GPT-3.5. In early 2022, the company released a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 called InstructGPT. This time, OpenAI added a new type of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning with human feedback, it puts people into the training process. These workers check the AI’s output. Responses that people like get rewarded. Human feedback can also help reduce hurtful, biased or inappropriate responses. This fine-tuned language model powers freely available ChatGPT. As of March, paying users receive answers powered by GPT-4, a bigger language model.</p>



<p>During ChatGPT’s development, OpenAI added extra safety rules to the model. It will refuse to answer certain sensitive prompts or provide harmful information. But this step raises another issue: Whose values are programmed into the bot, including what it is — or is not — allowed to talk about?</p>



<p>OpenAI is not offering exact details about how it developed and trained ChatGPT. The company has not released its code or training data. This disappoints Luccioni because it means the tool can’t benefit from the perspectives of the larger AI community. “I’d like to know how it works so I can understand how to make it better,” she says.</p>



<p>When asked to comment on this story, OpenAI provided a statement from an unnamed spokesperson. “We made ChatGPT available as a research preview to learn from real-world use, which we believe is a critical part of developing and deploying capable, safe AI systems,” the statement said. “We are constantly incorporating feedback and lessons learned.” Indeed, some experimenters have gotten the bot to say biased or inappropriate things despite the safety rules. OpenAI has been patching the tool as these problems come up.</p>



<p>ChatGPT is not a finished product. OpenAI needs data from the real world. The people who are using it are the guinea pigs. Notes Bender: “You are working for OpenAI for free.”</p>

<h4>ChatGPT’s academic performance</h4>



<p>How good is ChatGPT in an academic setting? Catherine Gao, a doctor and medical researcher at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, is part of one team of researchers that is putting the tool to the test.</p>



<p>Gao and her colleagues gathered 50 real abstracts from research papers in medical journals and then, after providing the titles of the papers and the journal names, asked ChatGPT to generate 50 fake abstracts. The team asked people familiar with reading and writing these types of research papers <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.23.521610v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to identify which were which</a>.</p>



<p>“I was surprised by how realistic and convincing the generated abstracts were,” Gao says. The reviewers mistook roughly one-third of the AI-generated abstracts as human-generated.</p>



<p>In another study, Will Yeadon and colleagues <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11661.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested whether AI tools could pass a college exam</a>. Yeadon, a physics instructor at Durham University in England, picked an exam from a course that he teaches. The test asks students to write five short essays about physics and its history. Students have an average score of 71 percent, which he says is equivalent to an A in the United States.</p>



<p>Yeadon used the tool davinci-003, a close cousin of ChatGPT. It generated 10 sets of exam answers. Then Yeadon and four other teachers graded the answers using their typical standards. The AI also scored an average of 71 percent. Unlike the human students, though, it had no very low or very high marks. It consistently wrote well, but not excellently. For students who regularly get bad grades in writing, Yeadon says, it “will write a better essay than you.”</p>



<p>These graders knew they were looking at AI work. In a follow-up study, Yeadon plans to use work from the AI and students and not tell the graders whose is whose.</p>

<h4>Tools to check for cheating</h4>



<p>When it’s unclear whether ChatGPT wrote something or not, other AI tools may help. These tools typically train on AI-generated text and sometimes human-generated text as well. They can tell you how likely it is that text was composed by an AI. Many of the existing tools were trained on older language models, but developers are working quickly to put out new, improved tools.</p>



<p>A company called Originality.ai sells access to a tool that trained on GPT-3. Founder Jon Gillham says that in a test of 10,000 samples of texts composed by models based on GPT-3, the tool tagged 94 percent of them correctly as AI-generated. When ChatGPT came out, his team tested a smaller set of 20 samples. Each only 500 words in length, these had been created by ChatGPT and other models based on GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. Here, Gillham says, the tool correctly identified 97&nbsp;percent of them as AI-generated.</p>



<p>In late January 2023, OpenAI released its own free tool for spotting AI writing, cautioning that the tool was “not fully reliable.” The company is working to add watermarks to its AI text, which would tag the output as machine-generated, but doesn’t give details on how. Gillham describes one possible approach: Whenever it generates text, the AI ranks many different possible words for each position. If its developers told it to always choose the word ranked in third place rather than first place at specific points in its output, those words could act as a fingerprint, he says.</p>



<p>As AI writing tools improve, the tools to sniff them out will need to improve as well. Eventually, some sort of watermark might be the only way to sort out true authorship.</p>

<h4>ChatGPT and the future of writing</h4>



<p>There’s no doubt we will soon have to adjust to a world in which computers can write for us. But educators have made these sorts of adjustments before. As high school student Rao points out, Google was once seen as a threat to education because it made it possible to look up facts instantly. Teachers adapted by coming up with teaching and testing materials that don’t depend as heavily on memorization.</p>



<p>Now that AI can generate essays and stories, teachers may once again have to rethink how they teach and test. Rao says: “We might have to shift our point of view about what’s cheating and what isn’t.”</p>



<p>Some teachers will prevent students from using AI by limiting access to technology. Right now, Vogelsinger says, teachers regularly ask students to write out answers or essays at home. “I think those assignments will have to change,” he says. But he hopes that doesn’t mean kids do less writing.</p>



<p>Teaching students to write without AI’s help will remain essential, agrees Zhai. That’s because “we really care about a student’s thinking,” he stresses. And writing is a great way to demonstrate thinking. Though ChatGPT can help a student organize their thoughts, it can’t think for them, he says.</p>



<p>Kids still learn to do basic math even though they have calculators (which are often on the phones they never leave home without), Zhai acknowledges. Once students have learned basic math, they can lean on a calculator for help with more complex problems.</p>



<p>In the same way, once students have learned to compose their thoughts, they could turn to a tool like ChatGPT for assistance with crafting an essay or story. Vogelsinger doesn’t expect writing classes to become editing classes, where students brush up AI content. He instead imagines students doing prewriting or brainstorming, then using AI to generate parts of a draft, and working back and forth to revise and refine from there.</p>



<p>Though he’s overwhelmed about the prospect of having to adapt his teaching to another new technology, he says he is “having fun” figuring out how to navigate the new tech with his students.</p>



<p>Rao doesn’t see AI ever replacing stories and other texts generated by humans. Why? “The reason those things exist is not only because we want to read it but because we want to write it,” she says. People will always want to make their voices heard.</p>

<p>Six months after the authors of a 2012 paper requested its retraction, a marketing journal is still investigating the concerns,&nbsp; Retraction Watch has learned. Other researchers had failed to replicate the findings – that consumers choose portion sizes based on their desire to signal higher social status –&nbsp; and discovered anomalies in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/38/6/1047/1790951">Super Size Me: Product Size as a Signal of Status</a>,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> and attracted media attention from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/us/a-new-linkage-offers-possibilities-in-the-anti-obesity-campaign.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/11/04/142019920/do-people-pick-super-sized-portions-to-boost-their-social-status">NPR</a>, among other outlets. The lay media interpreted the findings as helping to explain the rise in obesity in the United States. The article has been cited 180 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same authors requested the retraction of another paper, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/43/1/68/2379624">Dynamics of Communicator and Audience Power: The Persuasiveness of Competence versus Warmth</a>, published in 2016 and cited 61 times, which the journal is also still investigating.</p>



<span id="more-126889"></span>



<p>Problems with the portion size paper date back to 2020, when a team of researchers posted a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/fm7aj">preprint</a>, later published in <a href="https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/2538"><em>Meta-Psychology</em></a>, about their unsuccessful attempt to directly replicate one of its experiments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was slightly disappointed but not too surprised,” said Ignazio Ziano, now a professor at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, who oversaw the replication by a master’s student of his when he was a professor at the Grenoble Ecole de Management in France. “I thought this was just another unreplicable finding like so many others that are published in consumer behavior journals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group not only failed to replicate the results, but they also found inconsistencies in the statistical calculations. Ziano told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We realized that there had to be a statistical mistake in the data reporting (some standardized effect sizes, i.e., the differences between product size conditions, did not line up with the p-value and the test statistics within the same comparisons between product size).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’ve made Ziano’s full comments about his experience with the replication study available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ziano-on-Dubois.pdf">here</a>. He told us that when he and his coauthors emailed <a href="https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/david-dubois">David Dubois</a>, one of the authors of the original study who is now a professor at the Fontainebleau, France campus of <a href="https://www.insead.edu/">INSEAD</a>, to ask for the original data so they could recalculate the effect sizes, Dubois replied “that he was in the middle of moving and that he did not have the data handy at the moment.”</p>



<p>They did not follow up, Ziano said, because “my previous experiences in replication papers suggested that original authors (at least those who have already not shared data and materials in the paper) are not super keen to share data and materials, and even less keen to know that their study does not replicate.” (That’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/06/a-grad-student-finds-a-typo-in-a-psychedelic-studys-script-that-leads-to-a-retraction/">not always</a> the case, however.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Ziano and his team published their findings, another marketing researcher, Aaron Charlton, analyzed the paper and found more numerical inconsistencies in the statistical calculations. Charlton, who maintains <a href="https://openmkt.org/">OpenMKT.org</a>, a site aimed at improving evidence quality in academic publications in marketing and consumer behavior, wrote up his findings in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Numerical-inconsistencies-in-Dubois-et-al.-2012-v2.pdf">report</a> he shared with Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Erroneous <em>P</em>-values are “a fairly universal problem throughout the paper,” Charlton wrote in his report, which also identified “impossible means” using the <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/2064.pdf">GRIM test</a> developed by data sleuths <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-expose-shoddy-and-questionable-research">Nick Brown and James Heathers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dubois was responsible for the data collection and analysis, the authors told Charlton, and shared with him a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Lh0bf4F2RK958_k8HmToTbh-Lktip39-9ag-qINovM/edit#gid=170080309">spreadsheet</a> of <em>P</em>-values, in which he noted that none of the errors substantively changed the conclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charlton informed the authors of his findings about a year ago. While they were looking into the issues, another analyst, who remains anonymous, found “huge problems” in the 2016 paper, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last October, the two senior coauthors of the papers, <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/rucker_derek_d.aspx#research=page1">Derek Rucker</a> of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Chicago, and <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/detail/ag2514">Adam Galinsky</a> of Columbia Business School in New York City, requested that the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> retract both papers, Charlton told us. Neither has been pulled. Dubois is an <a href="https://consumerresearcher.com/editorial-team/associate-editors">associate editor</a> of the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The JCR policy board has assigned this matter to a special committee of experts who are thoroughly investigating it,” <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/carolyn-yoon">Carolyn Yoon</a>, the chair of the board and a professor of management and marketing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor’s Stephen M. Ross School of Business, told Retraction Watch. “We are still waiting on the report, as it took longer than expected. We hope to have a decision by the end of this month.”</p>



<p>Yoon also told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is critical that we get this right. Hence the commentaries, speculations, and foregone conclusions that are being shared are unfortunate and unhelpful given these parties do not have full information or knowledge about the case.</p>



<p>As for Dubois being listed an AE, it has not yet been determined that he did anything wrong.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rucker, Galinsky, and Dubois declined to comment while the journal’s investigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I disagree that they are ‘thoroughly investigating’ it,” Charlton told us when we shared Yoon’s comments with him. He said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my opinion a thorough investigation would require interviewing the whistleblower who discovered and reported the issues. That&#8217;s me. I&#8217;ve not heard from them. Would a police investigation be thorough if they didn&#8217;t take the time to interview the accuser/key witness? This distorts the meaning of the word &#8220;thorough.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yoon’s comments about “commentaries, speculations, and foregone conclusions” seemed “aimed at discrediting whistleblowers,” Charlton said.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My understanding is that all three coauthors jointly requested retraction of the 2012 paper back in mid-October of 2022. Why would the journal say &#8220;no you&#8217;re wrong, your paper is fine.&#8221; I first made the authors aware of the issues in early February of 2022. That was 14 months ago. Seems like it&#8217;s time for JCR to act. Every day they delay, people are citing the paper, grad students are trying to replicate it as part of their thesis, etc.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/freshwater-leeches-snails-could-control-diseases">Freshwater leeches’ taste for snails could help control snail-borne diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Leeches might seem like relics of a bygone age of medicine, but they haven’t outlived their usefulness to people yet. The freshwater leech <em>Helobdella austinensis</em> <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can eat its weight in snails every day</a>, suggesting that leeches could be used to control freshwater snail populations — and the host of diseases they carry, researchers report April 12 in <em>Biology Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Snails spread diseases such as schistosomiasis and fascioliasis to humans and livestock. Both of those conditions are caused by flukes that spend part of their life cycle in snails. In 2021, more than 250 million people — many of them children — needed preventive treatment against the blood fluke that causes schistosomiasis. A more effective prevention would be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/getting-rid-snails-effective-stopping-snail-fever">controlling snail populations</a> that host the parasite (<em>SN: 7/21/16</em>).</p>





<p>Leeches may be staple frights for horror movie characters, but the animals that should really live in terror of <em>H.</em> <em>austinensis</em> are snails. “Everybody who works in the very small leech world globally, we all know that these particular types of leeches love snails,” says Daniel Shain, an evolutionary biologist at Rutgers University in Camden, N.J. The leeches aren’t very picky in terms of the types of snails they eat. “And snails are a big problem globally, in terms of health, and so we just connected a few dots.”</p>



<p>The scientists used <em>H. austinensis</em>, a laboratory leech, and two other species, the lab leech <em>H. serendipitous</em> and <em>H. modesta</em>, which can be found in local lakes in New Jersey by turning over rocks. The team tested the leeches in the lab with seven different freshwater snail species, and only <em>H. austinensis</em> proved an indiscriminate devotee of escargot. If enough snails were present, one leech could consume 0.97 milligrams of snail per day — roughly the leech’s own weight.</p>



<p>Using different ratios of leeches and snails, Shain and colleagues put together predator-prey computer simulations that suggested leeches could tank populations of snails within six months.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Helobdella austinensis </em>can’t resist escargot. In this video, the leeches seek out and swarm a hapless snail. The leech’s taste for snails suggests that it could be used to control snail populations — and, hopefully, snail-borne diseases.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s an interesting idea, says David Civitello, an ecologist at Emory University in Atlanta who was not involved in the study. But he thinks much more research is needed. Once populations of snails decreased, he notes, the leeches had a hard time finding snails. “Having a hard time finding your prey item is indicative of a poor ability to drive it extinct,” he says. “If you are indiscriminately killing snails, but you’re not eradicating snails, you’re setting up the possibility that you are weakening competition for food.” And if the leeches leave low populations of big, well-fed snails at large, their infectiousness could mean that snail-borne disease ends up getting worse, not better, he says.</p>



<p>More importantly, Civitello says, <em>H. austinensis</em> does love snails — but it will eat other things too. This is a problem that has plagued snail biocontrol, he explains. “These predators are often not specialists on the snails we want them to eat.”</p>



<p>The leeches do happily eat many species of snails. But in the lab, they are also fed dead insect larvae, and Civitello worries that in the wild the leeches will prove to have dangerously diverse diets.</p>





<p>Shain and his colleagues want to try field trials to see if the leeches stick to snail snacks. They also want to look for similar snail-eating leech species native to particular areas. <em>H. austinensis</em> is native to Texas, but using native species elsewhere could reduce ecosystem disruption, Shain says.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Shain hopes that people won’t be put off by the concept of leeches. “The idea of having, you know, 10,000 leeches inside the pond instead of 10,000 snails probably isn&#8217;t so appealing,” he admits. On the plus side, <em>H. austinensis</em> is tiny — and uninterested in humans. Only the snails need to shiver.</p>
