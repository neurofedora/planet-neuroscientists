                The Pentagon says it’s not hiding aliens, but it stops notably short of saying what it is hiding. Here are the key questions that remain unanswered—some answers could be weirder than UFOs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-bee-species-solve-mystery">A decades-old mystery has been solved with the help of newfound bee species</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1965, renowned bee biologist Charles Michener described a new species of masked bee from “an entirely unexpected region,” the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia. Michener named the bee <em>Hylaeus tuamotuensis</em> and noted that its nearest relatives live in New Zealand — some 3,000 miles away across the Pacific Ocean. How did a small bee make such a big journey?</p>



<p>It turns out that the answer was buzzing above scientists’ heads all along. By swinging insect nets high up in the trees, researchers discovered eight species of <em>Hylaeus</em> bees that had never been described before, including six that live in Fiji. </p>



<p>The island nation lies between French Polynesia and Australia, where <em>Hylaeus </em>diversity is highest, so the scientists suspect that the ancestors of <em>H. tuamotuensis </em>reached their remote home by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2024.1339446/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island-hopping across the Pacific</a>. As individual bees moved from island to island, they steadily evolved into separate species, researchers report February 26 in <em>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</em>.</p>

<p>Most bee species live in arid regions like the southwestern United States, says bee biologist Bryan Danforth of Cornell University, who was advised by the late Michener for his Ph.D. “We don&#8217;t think of bees as being terribly diverse in islands.”</p>



<p>Bee searchers usually snag their quarry by sweeping nets low to the ground. But during a trip to Fiji in 2019, evolutionary biologist James Dorey of Wollongong University in Australia took a different approach. He knew that some bees in Australia tend to fly in the canopy of eucalypt trees, or gum trees, and thought bees in Fiji might do the same. He equipped himself with a longer net and started swinging it skyward.</p>



<p>“As soon as I was able to sample a flowering tree, we were catching <em>Hylaeus</em>,” Dorey says. “It was clear that we had more than one [new] species from that one tree.”</p>



<p>Searching for bees in treetops is relatively rare. But “we&#8217;re starting to realize that, actually, there&#8217;s a lot of bee diversity up there,” Danforth says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/030624_di_bee-mystery_inline.jpg?resize=800%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="A tropical green forest against a mountain backdrop on Viti Levu Island in Fiji." class="wp-image-3137457" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/030624_di_bee-mystery_inline.jpg?resize=800%2C450&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/030624_di_bee-mystery_inline.jpg?resize=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/030624_di_bee-mystery_inline.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/030624_di_bee-mystery_inline.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/030624_di_bee-mystery_inline.jpg?w=810&amp;ssl=1 810w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3137457">Bee diversity is typically highest in dry environments, not on tropical islands. But scientists collecting bees on Pacific islands, including Viti Levu Island of Fiji, seen here, found eight new species hiding just above their heads. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3137457">James Dorey Photography</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Dorey and his collaborators have a strong relationship with local Fijians, especially in Navai Village on the main island of Viti Levu, and with Fijian scientists like coauthor Marika Tuiwawa, a botanist at the University of the South Pacific. There is a lot of enthusiasm among Fijians for their native bees, Dorey says, and he hopes to train students there in bee collecting. Experts on Fiji’s bees, he says, should be Fijian.</p>



<p>While it’s clear that <em>H. tuamotuensis </em>is not alone in its remote island home, many mysteries remain: How did <em>Hylaeus </em>bees make it to the various islands and what path did they take?</p>



<p>It’s possible the bees were blown across the Pacific by storms, Danforth says, but he also thinks that their habit of nesting in wood may have something to do with the bees’ spread. “If you nest in wood and a piece of wood falls in the ocean, and that drifts thousands of kilometers and lands on a habitable spot, that&#8217;s a plausible way for these bees to disperse,” he says. “We know that other wood-nesting bees have done that.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>. The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. This is the last blog in our<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=einstein-awards-program"> 5-part series</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every research study involves numerous potential outcomes and conclusions, as researchers employ diverse analytical approaches when interpreting empirical data. Recognizing the variability in these methods, my colleagues from the University of Innsbruck, Stanford University, and Dartmouth College, along with myself, have established the Global Analytical Robustness Initiative.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The primary goal of this initiative is to enhance analytical standards within the behavioral and social sciences, thereby boosting the reliability and transparency of research outcomes. The team&rsquo;s plan is to have 100 studies examined by around 500 experts for analytical robustness and create an open database that makes transparent the correlation between the analytical paths taken in empirical work and the results presented in the research.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>There is a lack of analytical resilience in empirical research that slows down the knowledge accumulation process</p><cite>Psychologist Barnab&aacute;s Sz&aacute;szi</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The project will enable researchers to identify and respond to the corresponding problems and challenges. On this basis, the Global Analytical Robustness Initiative aims to issue recommendations on how to increase analytical robustness and train scientists to use the most robust analytical methodologies. &ldquo;In this way, we hope to strengthen the reliability of future empirical results and, ultimately, foster trust in science.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-brain-menstrual-cycle-and-female-sex-hormones-acknowledging-sex-bias-in-neuroimaging-research">The brain, menstrual cycle and female sex hormones: acknowledging sex bias in neuroimaging research</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Disclaimer: WiNUK acknowledges that the menstrual cycle is not a gender-specific experience. Throughout this blog, people who experience the hormone changes of the menstrual cycle are referred to as the ‘female sex’ or ‘female’, and those who were assigned female at birth.</em></p>
<hr><h5>What is the menstrual cycle?</h5><p>The menstrual cycle is the ~28 day hormone cycle females have to regulate the shedding and build up of the uterus lining. The hormones that fluctuate are oestrogen, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. Fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone are the most prominent,  lasting for the majority of the cycle, with oestrogen peaking during the follicular phase until ovulation and progesterone increasing during the luteal phase as the lining builds, and dropping when the lining sheds. </p>
<blockquote>"Even in people without PMDD, peak progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle are associated with increases in negative mood"</blockquote><h5>How can these hormones affect the brain?</h5><p>As these changes are so long-lasting and distinct, with oestrogen levels rising 8-fold and progesterone levels 80-fold during the ~28 day cycle (1), it has been hypothesised that people who experience these hormone changes will have marked differences in brain function and behaviour during these times. Indeed, many  report emotional changes, increased irritability and decreased self-esteem during their cycle. Furthermore, people who take hormonal contraception may experience similar mood disturbances. But how do sex hormones have such a profound effect on our emotions? It is all down to the distribution of sex hormone receptors in the brain. Progesterone binds to receptors located in the amygdala, a brain region responsible for a range of emotional responses, such as anxiety, social understanding (interpreting social cues), and fear. Progesterone has been implicated in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that is associated with emotional dysregulation during the luteal phase (when progesterone peaks) (2). Even in people without PMDD, peak progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle are associated with increases in negative mood (3). Progesterone can easily cross the blood brain barrier and can even accumulate in brain tissue to beyond levels found in the blood. Moreover, progesterone also has a role in stress regulation. During periods of stress, it can be converted to cortisol, the primary stress hormone (4) maintaining the actions of the sympathetic nervous system (the branch of the nervous system responsible for staying in high alert during situations of prolonged stress). </p>

<p>Other areas of the brain have sex hormone receptors too. The hippocampus is rich in sex hormone receptors and is also highly plastic, meaning it can be structurally altered in response to stimuli such as hormones. Indeed, oestrogen has been found to modulate structural plasticity in the hippocampus (5), having important implications in learning and memory. The hippocampus is also responsible for long term memory storage which can have significant implications on emotion - such as how a fond childhood memory might make us happy and reminiscent, or a negative one fearful and anxious.</p>
<blockquote>"Only 0.5% of neuroimaging studies consider the effects of sex hormones and hormone transition phases on the brain"</blockquote>
<p>Studies on the hippocampus have shown conflicting responses to sex hormones; some suggest there is a significant increase in grey matter in this region during the peak oestrogen portion of the menstrual cycle (6, 7), while others find no such result and lean towards the effect of progesterone on cycle stage-dependent changes in hippocampal volume (3). </p>
<h5>The gap in research on female sex hormones and neuroimaging</h5><p>Unfortunately, the scarcity and vagueness of research on the effect of female sex hormones in the brain is in part due to the long-standing bias towards males in neuroscientific research. In recent years, researchers have been encouraged to include both sexes in their experiments, whether it is on humans or rodents. Despite this leading to an increase in female representation in sample populations, the majority of research does not then analyse sex differences - as few as 5% of papers in neuroscience and psychiatry published in 2019 included ‘optimal analysis of possible sex differences’ (8). This emphasises a very pressing issue in neuroscience research. If we aren’t including females in our sample populations and are not analysing sex differences as a variable within research, we most certainly are not taking into account sex-dependent hormone cycles. This is evident in neuroimaging, with only 0.5% of neuroimaging studies considering the effects of sex hormones and hormone transition phases on the brain (9). It is even more alarming that this has only been flagged in the past couple years, when oral contraceptives have been readily prescribed since the 1960’s. </p>
<h5>The future of sex hormone and neuroendocrine research</h5><p>Current trends, largely driven by female neuroscientists, are to provide more clarity on the effect of the menstrual cycle on brain structure and behaviour. The overarching flaw of most neuroimaging studies evaluating the effect of the menstrual cycle on the brain is that they only observe a snapshot of the cycle. To improve our understanding of brain changes across the full 28 days, imaging experiments need to visualise the brain at a range of time points. When neuroimaging takes into account the day-to-day hormone fluctuations over the breadth of the menstrual cycle, we can begin to see just how the brain is altered over this period of time. A number of studies by the Jacobs Lab (University of California, Santa Barbara) have done just that, looking at how oestrogen and progesterone affect functional brain networks of an individual across a 30-day cycle (10).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that people are becoming more aware of the sex bias in research, attention is turning to the long-dismissed importance of sex differences in neuroscience. Soon we may uncover answers as to why females make up two thirds of people with Alzheimer’s, how to help those suffering from PMDD, and other interesting differences.</p>

<p>Human cell lines represent key reagents for many research laboratories. Cell lines are often the first models that researchers choose for experiments such as gene manipulation and drug testing, as they are relatively accessible and inexpensive, particularly compared with mouse and other animal models. </p>



<p>However, cell lines also are prone to contamination by other faster growing cell lines. As a result,  many human cell lines purported to represent particular tumor types have been found by genetic testing to be contaminated by other cancer cells. This potential for confusion poses a serious problem for researchers who want to study a particular cancer type but end up using cells from an unrelated disease.</p>



<p>Our team studies <a href="https://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/5/4/e202101203">wrongly identified nucleotide sequence reagents in cancer research</a>, such as PCR primers and gene knockdown reagents. Recently in the context of an undergraduate student project, we decided to also check the identities of cell lines in a small group of papers on the human gene <em>miR-145</em>, which codes for an mRNA. We <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.582220v1">found</a> wrongly identified nucleotide sequences and cell lines in numerous articles about <em>miR-145</em>, but also what appeared to be five misspelled identifiers of contaminated cell lines. </p>



<span id="more-128885"></span>



<p>This issue isn’t new – some cell line identifiers are known to be misspelled, although little has been written about such misspellings. We decided to study these apparent misspellings, and eventually found 23 published human cell line identifiers that were not recognised as cell lines in the most comprehensive cell line knowledgebase, <a href="https://www.cellosaurus.org/">Cellosaurus</a>. We then studied eight of these non-verifiable (NV) cell line identifiers <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.582220v1">in detail across 420 papers</a>. </p>



<p>While all eight NV identifiers likely represent misspellings in at least some papers, we also found that seven of the eight NV cell line identifiers seemed to be taking on new identities as independent cell lines. How did we separate identifier misspellings from seemingly independent cell lines? NV cell line identifiers were described as misspellings where they were only used alternately with similarly named human cell line(s), such that the misspelled identifier was never directly connected with any similarly-named cell line. </p>



<p>In contrast, NV cell line identifiers were indicated to represent independent cell lines if they were used without mentions of any similarly named human cell line; if an NV and similarly named human cell line was included in any list of cell lines studied; if results for both cell lines were shown in the same experiment(s); and/or  if both cell line identifiers were directly connected in the text. </p>



<p>We determined that more than half of the 420 papers appeared to refer to at least one NV identifier as an independent cell line. However, we could not find any published descriptions of how these cell lines were first established. Some authors claimed to have produced genetic profiles for three NV cell lines, but we could not find such profiles for these cell lines, either in publications describing NV cell lines or elsewhere. Six NV cell lines were claimed to have been sourced from large cell line repositories such as ATCC, but we could not find any of these NV identifiers or cell lines in the claimed repository catalogues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why should we be concerned by NV cell lines? As the problem of cell line contamination has shown, cell line identities underpin the results of experiments conducted with these models. The inability to independently verify cell lines raises doubts about&nbsp; the significance of associated results, how these results might be reproduced, and even which experiments were conducted in the first place. While researchers seem unlikely to source NV cell lines for their own experiments (as we could not find them in claimed repositories), they could still risk wasting time and money by following up results from NV cell lines using cell lines that they already have on hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Descriptions of NV cell lines call for a zero-tolerance approach to misspelled cell line identifiers and pairing the names of all published cell lines with their corresponding <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/18/how-a-typo-in-a-catalog-number-led-to-the-correction-of-a-scientific-paper-and-what-we-can-learn-from-that/">Research Resource Identifiers</a> (<a href="https://www.rrids.org/">RRIDs</a>). In the meantime, as we have advised for nucleotide sequence identities, researchers should check the identities of any cell lines that they don’t recognize before planning any future experiments. Simple checks could avoid wasting time on cell lines that might be found on wanted posters, but not in Cellosaurus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/four-years-covid-pandemic-grief">Four years on, the COVID-19 pandemic has a long tail of grief</a></h4>

              
                <p>March 11 marks the fourth anniversary of the World Health Organization’s declaration that the COVID-19 outbreak was a pandemic. COVID-19 hasn’t gone away, but there have been plenty of actions that suggest otherwise.</p>



<p>In May 2023, WHO announced COVID-19 was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-who">no longer a public health emergency</a> (<em>SN: 5/5/23</em>). The United States shortly followed suit, which meant <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-public-health-emergency-ending-tests-vaccines-drugs-research">testing and treatments were no longer free</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/23</em>). And on March 1 of this year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0301-respiratory-virus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loosened their isolation guidelines</a> for people with COVID-19. Now the CDC says infected people can be around others as soon as a day after a fever subsides and symptoms are improving, even though <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-home-coronavirus-isolation-filter-transmission">someone is contagious during an infection for six to eight days, on average</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>These outward signs of leaving the pandemic chapter behind <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/epidemics-infectious-disease-polio-flu-vaccine-aftermath-race">neglect to acknowledge how many people cannot</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/21</em>). Nearly 1.2 million people have died in the United States from COVID-19. Close to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db480.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9 million adults have long COVID</a>. Nearly <a href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/orphanhood_USA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300,000 children have lost one or both parents</a>.</p>



<p>There has been little official recognition in the United States of the profound grief people have experienced and continue to experience. There is no federal monument to honor the dead — mourners have constructed their own memorials. A resolution to commemorate the first Monday of March as “COVID-19 Victims Memorial Day” awaits action by the U.S. Congress.</p>

<p>Many people are coping not just with the deaths of family and friends from COVID-19, but with how the pandemic robbed them of the chance to say goodbye to loved ones and grieve with their family and community. Researchers are studying the extent to which these losses rippled out into society and how the pandemic interrupted the grieving process.</p>



<p>Emily Smith-Greenaway, a demographer at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, was part of team that estimated that for every <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-covid-normal-air-quality-clean-indoor">one COVID-19 death, there are nine bereaved family members</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/22</em>). Sarah Wagner, a social anthropologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., leads a project called <a href="https://ritualsinthemaking.com/about-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rituals in the Making</a>, which is examining how the pandemic disrupted rituals and the experience of mourning through interviews with mourners and death care workers, among other research methods. <em>Science News</em> spoke with Smith-Greenaway and Wagner about their work. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Why is it important to estimate the number of close family members affected by COVID-19 deaths?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Smith-Greenaway</strong>: We typically quantify mortality events in terms of numbers of casualties. By shedding light explicitly on the concentric circles of people surviving each of the deaths, we offer a much more experiential perspective — the burden that a large-scale mortality event imposes on those who are still alive. It also allows us to kind of rescale the true sense of the magnitude of the crisis.</p>



<p>[With the number of deaths today,] our model demonstrates that about 10.5 million people have lost a close relative to COVID, [which includes] grandparents, parents, siblings, spouses and children. We’re not even capturing cousins, aunts, uncles. Think about how many children lost teachers or how many neighbors or friends or coworkers [died]. This is an underestimate when we’re thinking about the many people who are affected by each single death.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What motivated the Rituals in the Making project?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Wagner</strong>: We began in May of 2020, and this was this period of heightened pandemic restriction and confinement. We posed what we saw as a fundamental question: How do we mourn when we cannot gather? Particularly in that first year, we were focused on the rituals around funeral, burial and commemorative practice and how they would be impacted and changed by the pandemic. In the last two years, [the project] has included the ways in which misinformation also compounds individual grief and more collective mourning.</p>



<p>A throughline in the research is that this mourning was interrupted and constrained by the conditions of the pandemic itself, but also troubled by politicization of the deaths. And then [there’s] this expectation that we move on, we push past the pandemic, and yet we have not acknowledged the enormity of the tragedy.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Why are rituals and memorials important to grieving?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Wagner</strong>: We think about rituals as providing a means to respond to rupture. We are able to come together, gathering to stand before a coffin to say goodbye, or to have a wake, to sit down and have a meal with the bereaved. They are about providing an opportunity to remember and honor that loved one. But they are also about the living — a way of supporting the surviving family members, a way of helping them out of the chasm of that grief.</p>



<p>Memorials [such as a day of remembrance or a monument] are a nation saying, we recognize these lives and we anoint them with a particular meaning. We think about memorials as forms of acknowledgement and a way of making sense of major tragedies or major sacrifices.</p>



<p>In the context of the pandemic, the rituals that are broken and [the lack of] memorials at that national level help us see that the mourners have been left in many ways to take memory matters into their own hands. The responsibility has been pushed onto them at these acute moments of their own grief.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How has the pandemic impacted survivors and the grieving process?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Smith-Greenaway</strong>: Societies have demographic memory. There is a generational effect any time we have a mortality crisis. A war or any large-scale mortality event lingers in the population, in the lives and memories of those who survived it.</p>



<p>This pandemic will stay with us for a very long time. [There are] young people who remember losing their grandma, but they couldn’t go see her in the hospital, or remember losing a parent in this sudden way because they brought COVID-19 home from school. So many lives were imprinted at such an early stage of life.</p>



<p><strong>Wagner</strong>: Whether we are talking to the bereaved, members of the clergy, health care workers or staff from funeral homes, people describe the isolation. It is incredibly painful for families because they weren’t able to be with their loved one, to be able to touch someone, to hold their hand, to caress a cheek. People were left to wonder, “was my loved one aware? Were they confused? Were they in pain?” [After the death], not being able to have people into one’s home, not being able to go out. That sort of joy of having other people around you in your depths of grief — that was gone.</p>



<p>As the study progressed, [we learned about] the impact political divisiveness had on people’s grief. [Families were asked,] did the person have underlying health issues? What was the person’s vaccination status? It was as if the blame was getting shifted onto the deceased. Then to be confronted with, “this is all just a hoax,” or “[COVID-19 is] nothing worse than a bad cold.” To be a family member, and to struggle for recognition in the face of these conversations that their loved ones’ death and memory is not just dismissed, but in a way feels denied.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How can society better support the need to grieve?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Smith-Greenaway</strong>: Bereavement policies are not very generous, as we would expect in America. Sometimes it’s one, two or three days. They’re also very restrictive, where it has to be a particular relation.</p>



<p>Think about kids. I’m a professor at a university. There’s this callous joke that college students just tell you their grandmother died because they don’t want to turn something in. This reflects how we treat bereavement as a society, especially for young people. Kids’ grief can often be misunderstood. It’s perceived to be bad behavior, that they’re acting out. I think we need comprehensive school policies that take better care to recognize how many kids are suffering losses in their lives.</p>



<p><strong>Wagner</strong>: We’re enveloped in this silence around pandemic death. I think there’s a willingness to talk about the pandemic losses in other realms, the economic losses or the loss of social connection. Why is there this silence around 1.2 million deaths — the enormity of the tragedy?</p>



<p>If you know someone who has lost a loved one to COVID-19, talk to them about it. Ask them about that loved one. Just being an active part of conversations around memory can be a beautiful act. It can be a restorative act.</p>

                Farmers in hot, arid regions are turning to low-cost solar pumps to irrigate their fields, eliminating the need for expensive fossil fuels and boosting crop production.

<p>which he describes as revealing &#8220;an extremely regular increase in casualties over the period&#8221; and from which he concludes that &#8220;this regularity is almost surely not real.&#8221; </p>



<p>Wyner&#8217;s plot shows cumulative reported deaths over a period of 15 days from October 26, 2023 to November 10, 2023. The individual reported deaths per day are plotted below. These numbers have a mean of 270 and a standard deviation of 42.25:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monarch-caterpillar-milkweed-butterfly-binge">Big monarch caterpillars don’t avoid toxic milkweed goo. They binge on it</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maybe science has misunderstood the dining style of big monarch butterfly caterpillars. What insect watchers have called defense against the toxic latex a milkweed plant oozes may not be avoidance at all. Instead of dodging the plants’ sticky, white toxic goo, the plump, older caterpillars could be gorging on it.</p>



<p>Monarch caterpillars (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) hatch and feed on milkweeds, which fight back when bitten and ooze milky toxin-rich latex. Monarchs evolved their own counter-chemistry for surviving the toxins. Yet that plant latex can still kill by sheer gooeyness, explains ecologist Georg Petschenka of University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany.&nbsp; Very tiny, recently hatched caterpillars can get fatally stuck with mouthparts clogged.</p>



<p>Caterpillars, however, can get around milkweed sticky traps by nipping leaf stalks and then waiting for the latex channels to bleed out. A swath of killer leaf becomes a harmless vegetable.</p>



<p>For older caterpillars strong enough to risk glue, Petschenka argues, those bleed-out cuts can do more than disarm a leaf. By this stage, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.2721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the monarch caterpillars feast on the latex</a> itself. Offering them a pipette loaded with latex to suckle showed they drink it readily and build up their own defensive reserves of milkweed toxins, he and entomologists Anja Betz and Robert Bischoff, also at Hohenheim, reported February 21 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>The older caterpillars dip their mouthparts in latex “like a little cat drinking milk,” Petschenka says.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Age makes a big difference in monarch caterpillars&#8217; willingness to drink the defensive toxin-rich &#8220;milk&#8221; that wells up from wounds in milkweed plants, lab experiments show. It&#8217;s dangerously gluey for the youngest and tiniest stage of monarch caterpillars. As the caterpillars grow up through five stages, they eventually switch from rejecting a pipette of it to eager drinking, as seen in this video.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Usually, the toxins, called cardenolides, attack an animal enzyme that’s crucial to cells for keeping potassium and sodium concentrations in balance. Monarch caterpillars, however, can convert some of the milkweed cardinolides into less toxic forms. These build up as lifelong deterrents against predators such as birds.</p>



<p>It was thought that monarchs gain most of that protection from nibbling the leafy greens, not going for milkweed’s vascular system. But the idea that the bigger caterpillars might be harvesting latex as protection has floated around now and then, perhaps starting with the early 20th century British pioneer of chemical ecology, Miriam Rothschild. Another idea has been that caterpillars working on leaf cuts will drink latex “to get the sticky noxious fluid out of the way,” says insect ecologist David Dussourd, at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway, who has noticed the latex licking before.</p>



<p>But it’s not obvious behavior. “I have never seen monarch caterpillars drinking beads of latex sap from milkweed, but now after reading this finding, I am going to pay more attention to what they are doing,” says ecologist Sonia Altizer of the University of Georgia in Athens.</p>



<p>What triggered Petschenka’s curiosity was noticing that he didn’t see latex left at a wound after big caterpillars ate. “We would expect this to flow out and then maybe to dry up,” he says. So maybe those cuts were not made to avoid mouthfuls of cardenolide toxins but to find some.</p>



<p>He and his team found a variety of evidence supporting the idea that older monarch caterpillars are toxin-loading. For instance, the researchers saw them now and then just settling down to feed on a leaf instead of making a preliminary bite and waiting for latex to drain. That never happened with comparison caterpillars of a <em>Euploea</em> species that will eat milkweed but not stash its toxins. These non-sequestering diners always drained latex from lab leaves before dining.</p>



<p>Also, the young monarch caterpillars themselves offered a monarch-to-monarch comparison. The very young ones avoided latex, but when older, they shifted to “eager drinking,” the researchers say.</p>



<p>These findings and others in the paper got a hard look from evolutionary biologist Anurag Agrawal of Cornell University. Even though he admires Miriam Rothschild and had supervised Petschenka’s Ph.D., Agrawal for years dismissed caterpillar latex-sipping as “a necessary evil.” The only way for a caterpillar “to successfully deactivate the pressurized latex was to suck it up,” he wrote in his 2017 book <em>Monarchs and Milkweed</em>. Now, however, he says, “the study changed my mind.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-longest-goodbye-astronaut-mental-health-documentary">‘Space: The Longest Goodbye’ explores astronauts’ mental health</a></h4>

              
                <p>NASA engineers must quantify everything. But no matter how many equations they use to calculate launch windows, estimate exposure to cosmic radiation or create flight trajectories, there’s one thing they can’t quantify: the mental health of astronauts.</p>



<p>And for a while, NASA could get away with it. Early astronauts certainly faced mental challenges — worries over mission failures, the fear of the unknown. But it wasn’t until the arrival of space stations that astronauts began spending months away from home. In 1994, with the building of the International Space Station under way, NASA formed a psychological unit.</p>



<p>Now, NASA astronauts may soon embark on even longer trips into deep space. Long-distance relationships are hard enough on Earth. On a three-year, round trip <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rigors-mars-trip-make-teamwork-priority">trek to Mars</a>, navigating the unparalleled separation from home could be one of the biggest challenges to a successful mission (<em>SN: 11/14/14</em>).</p>



<p><a href="https://greenwichentertainment.com/film/the-longest-goodbye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Space: The Longest Goodbye</em></a><em>, </em>a documentary directed by Ido Mizrahy, follows the journey of mentally preparing astronauts for such an unprecedented trip and reflects on the history of the NASA psychological unit. It premieres in theaters on March 8, as well as on Apple TV, Amazon and other streaming services.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch the trailer for <em>Space: The Longest Goodbye</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The film primarily follows astronauts Kayla Barron — a member of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">NASA’s Artemis program</a>, which aims to send people to the moon and then Mars (<em>SN: 11/16/22</em>) — and Cady Coleman, who spent over 100 days aboard the space station. The film is not just about these two astronauts going to space; it’s also about the families they leave behind.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most poignant narrative is Coleman’s. In 2010, she entered space for the third time, leaving her son, Jamey, when he was in fourth grade. Spotty video chats show Jamey’s growing anguish as his mom orbited Earth for several months. Coleman wipes tears that float away in zero gravity, which emphasizes her own homesickness.</p>



<p>But longing for loved ones isn’t the only psychological challenge astronauts face. Coleman also details the near-constant surveillance she was under while aboard the space station, from cameras following her every move to regular check-ins with psychological evaluators. The endless scrutiny caused her to take careful stock of how many feelings she could reveal to avoid being deemed unfit for life in space and then grounded, literally.</p>

<p>The film also tackles the range of external strategies devised in collaboration with the NASA psychological unit in preparation for long-term space travel, from the development of a friendly robot intended to avert loneliness to desert simulations designed to study interpersonal conflict in extreme isolation. There is an astonishing, and frankly, overwhelming number of ideas being tested for the Artemis astronauts. Woven between long, wide shots of the vast emptiness of space, these vignettes of strategies provide respite for the viewer who begins to vicariously experience the loneliness of space.</p>



<p><em>Space: The Longest Goodbye </em>is terrifying and hopeful, wistful and thrilling, reflective and overwhelming, all the contradictions present in the reality of being an astronaut.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/grumbach.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/grumbach.png?resize=200%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128891" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Isabella Grumbach</figcaption></figure></div>


<p class="has-drop-cap">On Sept. 2, 2021, a professor at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, emailed a biochemistry journal asking to correct a paper she had published the previous year. An experiment had “unintentionally” been omitted from a figure, <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/isabella-grumbach">Isabella Grumbach</a> explained, and a comparison of experimental groups contained “a minor error in the degree of statistical significance.” A correction ensued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the problems with the article, “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31711984/">Inhibition of CaMKII in mitochondria preserves endothelial barrier function after irradiation,</a>” appear to have been more deep-rooted than the email suggested. An anonymous commenter on PubPeer had first <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B9CF167BD697C8F000E02ECC74F52B">raised concerns</a> about the article, which had appeared in <em>Free Radical Biology and Medicine (FRBM),</em> in July 2021, more than a year after it was published. The commenter claimed error bars between two figures were vastly different, even though they were meant to be related data points. </p>



<span id="more-128890"></span>



<p>Grumbach, the corresponding author of the paper, promised to investigate. A month later, she wrote to Rafael Radi, an editor<em> </em>at the journal,<em> </em>saying she had omitted an experiment from the paper by mistake, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-Re_-Your-manuscript-FRBM_2019_1387_R1-has-been-accepted.pdf">according to documents Retraction Watch obtained</a> through a public records request. But, she noted, “the data interpretation or overall conclusion<em> </em>from these data are not impacted by this error.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach, who is <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/isabella-grumbach">interim chair of internal medicine</a> at the Carver College of Medicine at the University of Iowa, said the repeated analysis had strengthened the paper’s conclusions and requested a corrigendum. The correction was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34587565/">published in November 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that didn’t make the problem go away. Within a month of the correction, another comment appeared on PubPeer claiming the revision didn’t explain the errors the first comment had flagged. Again, the commenter requested the authors share the raw data. This time the authors did not respond to the post.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Then, in January 2022, a sleuth <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lFKLBxBk7cv8KhQFh6PvrYZ_SBtI5Emc/view?usp=sharing">contacted the editor-in-chief of <em>FRBM</em></a>, Kelvin J. A. Davies, claiming:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All figure in this paper have data and statistic method that is manipulated or falsified. Paper say &#8220;independent experiment&#8221; but honestly data not from independent experiment. Actually data show replicate reading of same sample from same experiment. This false statistic analysis make very small error bar so statistic significance is reached. If data points from independent experiment analyze then there is big variation and no statistic significance so major conclusions of paper not valid.</p>



<p>Check original data and see how statistic falsified to reach desired conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email was appended with the comments from PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month later, the chair of the journal’s ethics committee, Giovanni E. Mann, wrote to Grumbach saying the committee had reviewed the case following the sleuth’s email. Mann noted the authors did not respond directly to the commenter’s request for raw data. He also flagged statistical concerns and added, “We do need to see the individual data points on which these figures and statistics were based.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach said she would perform a comprehensive review and prepare a reply to the queries. In her email, she also wrote, “we have seen a very unusual increase in activities regarding the manuscripts from a select group of investigators in the Dept. of Internal Medicine.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach did not respond to our queries about the “unusual increase in activities.” She is listed as an author on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=grumbach">two other papers</a> that were called out on PubPeer around the same time. One was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35131484/">issued an erratum</a> and another <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.v63retraction1">an expression of concern</a>, both related to the inclusion of duplicate data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of <em>FRBM</em>, said the editors were not aware of the PubPeer comments before the sleuth’s email, and made the decision to publish a correction “based on mistakes raised by the author.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In April 2022, Grumbach <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iDBEony7DBlwjyJm1NlaQWvA4Dt_VYrw/view?usp=sharing">officially requested to retract the paper</a>, which has been cited 14 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. She told Davies: “I analyzed these data and inaccurately pasted the data into the analysis software, leading to an incorrect grouping of the data. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please advise me on the next steps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice, published online in May 2022, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Authors and Editor-in-Chief.</p>



<p>Some of the data presented in Figure 6C, F and G of the above-titled paper were reported incorrectly in the published article. After being contacted by the Journal, the authors discovered an unintentional error in how the original data were analyzed that could affect the accuracy of the subsequent analysis. The raw data were incorrectly grouped in the analysis software, thereby altering the comparisons. Therefore the authors wish to retract the paper and will recollect and reanalyze the data appropriately. The authors apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice added that the authors would “recollect and reanalyze the data appropriately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grumbach declined to be interviewed for this story but a spokesperson passed on a statement from her:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I take research integrity very seriously, which is why I asked for a retraction of this paper when I realized there were errors in the data and analysis after I had submitted an erratum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since its retraction, the paper has also been included among the references in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.317869">another paper by the group</a>, although that “manuscript was drafted and submitted for initial review before the retraction,” according to the university spokesperson.</p>

                <p><strong>Meghna Solanki explores the life and work of Rita Levi-Montalcini, a 'trailblazer' in the field of neuroscience, renowned for her discovery of nerve growth factor.</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong>"...let us continue to honour her memory by fostering an inclusive environment where all scientists...can thrive and make meaningful contributions...</strong><strong>"</strong></blockquote><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_7d01c048ee0f4fc9a1348a51b16eda16~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_240,h_361,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Rita Levi Montalcini (cnr.it)" ></figure><p>In the archives of neuroscience, Rita Levi-Montalcini's name shines brightly as a beacon of innovation, resilience, and gender equality. Born on April 22nd, 1909, in Turin, Italy, Rita defied societal norms and overcame numerous obstacles to become one of the most influential neuroscientists of the 20th century. Her remarkable journey and groundbreaking discoveries not only revolutionised our understanding of the nervous system, but also inspired generations of female scientists to pursue their passions, despite adversities. </p>

<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini's early years were marked by a fierce determination to pursue her scientific interests in a male-dominated field: "At 20, I realised that I could not possibly adjust to a feminine role as conceived by my father and asked him permission to engage in a professional career." Despite facing opposition from her traditional family, she pursued her education, obtaining a degree in Medicine and Surgery from the University of Turin in 1936. However, her journey as a female scientist was fraught with challenges: discrimination and prejudice against women in academia were rampant, yet Rita refused to be deterred. She persevered, determined to make her mark in the scientific world. She published the groundbreaking paper titled "Effects of mouse tumour transplantation on the nervous system" in 1951, which laid the foundation for her later work on nerve growth factor.</p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_6e0d56cb98b2413881b3b3aabe005225~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_253,h_363,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Rita Levi-Montalcini receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1986 (imsvintagephotos.com)" ></figure><p>One of Rita Levi-Montalcini's most significant contributions to neuroscience was her discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the early 1950s, alongside colleague Stanley Cohen. Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered NGF using a pioneering method, which involved studying the effects of mouse tumour transplantation on the nervous system. She observed that the tumours stimulated the growth of nearby nerve fibres, which led to the identification and isolation of NGF. This groundbreaking discovery - for which she and Stanley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986 -  fundamentally transformed our understanding of how nerve cells develop, grow and function, laying a foundation for modern neuroscience. NGF's role in promoting the survival and growth of neurones paved the way for countless studies relating to neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. </p>
<blockquote><strong>"Her life story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of diversity and inclusion"</strong></blockquote>
<p>Beyond her scientific achievements, Rita Levi-Montalcini's legacy as a woman in neuroscience is equally profound. She shattered glass ceilings and paved the way for future generations of female scientists to thrive in a field historically dominated by men. Through her tenacity, brilliance, and unwavering dedication to her craft, she inspired countless women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Her life story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of diversity and inclusion in scientific research, highlighting the invaluable contributions that women can make to advancing our understanding of the world.</p>

<p>In addition to her scientific endeavours, Rita Levi-Montalcini was a fervent advocate for education, gender equality, and social justice. She used her platform and influence to champion causes close to her heart, tirelessly advocating for the rights and empowerment of women in STEM fields. Her philanthropic efforts, including the establishment of the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation, continue to support scientific research and education initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the scientific community.</p>

<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini's contributions to neuroscience, and as a woman in STEM, are nothing short of extraordinary. Her groundbreaking discoveries, unwavering determination, and advocacy for gender equality have not only advanced our scientific knowledge, but also inspired countless individuals, particularly women, to pursue careers in science and medicine around the world. As we celebrate her legacy, let us continue to honour her memory by fostering an inclusive environment where all scientists, regardless of gender, can thrive and make meaningful contributions to advancing human knowledge and understanding by breaking barriers and stereotypes along the way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caecilian-egg-laying-amphibian-feed-milk-animal">This is the first egg-laying amphibian found to feed its babies ‘milk’</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the middle of the night in a humid coastal rainforest, a litter of pink, hairless babies snuggle with their mother. They stir and squeak for milk, their mother obliges, and they are sated. But these are no puppies or cubs. They are snake-shaped amphibians, far closer to frogs than foxes.</p>



<p>These <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi5379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ringed caecilian moms feed their hatchlings a kind of “milk”</a> brewed in the reproductive tract, researchers report in the March 8 <em>Science</em>. The long, cylindrical creatures are the first egg-laying amphibians known to feed hatchlings this way. The discovery suggests the evolution of parental care across animal life is more diverse than researchers thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an animal with so few discernable external features, caecilians are a fount of strange biology. Caecilians are elusive, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/new-fossils-shake-history-amphibians-no-legs">legless</a>, burrowing amphibians that are nearly blind (<em>SN: 6/19/17</em>). Some species, like the ringed caecilian (<em>Siphonops annulatus</em>) in the new study, have poisonous slime, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caecilians-amphibians-venomous-bites">may be venomous</a> and feed their own skin to their young (<em>SN: 7/3/20</em>).</p>



<p>Herpetologist Carlos Jared of the Instituto Butantan in São Paulo and his colleagues have been studying these eccentric animals for years. In previous studies, the team noticed that ringed caecilian hatchlings, which live their first two months out of the egg in their mother’s care, spent much of their time around the end of her body near the shared opening of the reproductive, digestive and urinary systems — an anatomical part called the vent. The female would periodically expel a thick fluid from the vent, which the young would enthusiastically feed on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Some [young] even stuck their heads inside this opening,” Jared says.</p>



<p>In the new work, the team collected 16 females and their newly hatched litters from Bahia state in Brazil, bringing them into the lab for observation. There, the researchers recorded the amphibians’ interactions, accumulating over 240 hours of video footage. The team recorded 36 feedings, which often involved the babies wriggling and nibbling at their mother’s vent while making high-pitched noises. Mom would then raise that end of her body and release the fluid. This happened up to six times per day and appeared to be in response to the babies’ pleas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The squeaking and begging is a particularly fascinating observation, says Mark Wilkinson, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London, because the adults are thought to be sensitive only to lower sound frequencies.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch as a female ringed caecilian (<em>Siphonops annulatus</em>) feeds her young a fat-rich, milk-like fluid. Her babies (smaller caecilians) nuzzle near the opening to her reproductive system. Soon after, the mother releases the nutritious fluid produced in her oviduct. This video is 600 times faster than the original.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The team also examined the internal anatomy of some of the adult female caecilians and analyzed the nutritional and biochemical makeup of the nutritional fluid. It is secreted by glands in the mother’s oviduct that enlarge while raising her hatchlings. It’s also rich in fats, much like mammal milk. This nutritious resource may help explain how the hatchlings grow so fast — bulking up their mass by up to 130 percent, an additional 0.27 grams, in the first week out of the egg — despite not leaving their mother’s side and feeding on her skin only once every few days.</p>



<p>Isabella Capellini, an evolutionary biologist at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, wonders if there is&nbsp;conflict between squiggly siblings for milk access and how that competition might play out. She’d also be curious to know more about how milk production affects the mother caecilian.</p>



<p>“In mammals, lactation is the most expensive stage of reproduction for the mother,” she says. “It would be useful to study whether milk production is as expensive in caecilians too. How is the mother impacted in the short- and long-term?”</p>



<p>It’s not known how these amphibians have evolved their version of “milk.” The substance is relatively rare in animals. Outside of mammals and some caecilians, it’s found only in certain spiders, fishes, cockroaches and birds, as well as two amphibians that give live birth.</p>



<p>In these egg-laying caecilians, the oviducts are behaving similarly to those of live-bearing caecilian species, which sometimes feed their babies a milky substance while in the womb, but do not feed them after they’re born.</p>



<p>“That makes it easier to conceive of how [live-bearing] could have evolved from [egg-laying] species that already used their oviducts to produce food,” Wilkinson says. “We really have learned a lot about caecilians in the last few decades, but we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>. The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. This is the fourth blog in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/">5-part series.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Dr. David Blumenthal, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit&auml;t, Faculty of Engineering, Department Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering</p>



<p>Disease association databases (DisGeNET [1], OMIM [2], DrugBank [3], etc.) containing disease-gene, disease-symptom, or disease-drug links are used extensively in various subfields of data-centric biomedicine. However, in such databases, diseases are annotated using our current mainly organ- or symptom-based disease definitions (UMLS concept unique identifiers (CUIs), MONDO identifiers, ICD-10 codes, etc.), which are often umbrella terms for several yet unknown causal molecular mechanisms with similar phenotypic effects [4]. Consequently, widely used large-scale disease association databases are systematically biased towards reproducing our current disease ontologies and are hence of limited use for data-driven precision medicine approaches which aim at a more fine-grained understanding of disease subtypes [5].</p>



<p>In view of this bias, one option would be to simply not use large-scale disease association databases for data-centric precision medicine. However, given the vast amount of aggregated knowledge contained therein, this is very unsatisfactory. In the proposed project, we will hence aim at salvaging large-scale disease association databases for precision medicine by disentangling the associations for ill-defined umbrella disease terms into subsets of associations for which there is solid evidence that they indeed describe endotypes corresponding to disjoint molecular mechanisms.</p>



<p>Consider the example of DisGeNET &ndash; an extremely widely used database containing associations between diseases and genes and disease and genetic variants. In DisGeNET, diseases are annotated using UMLS CUIs and disease links are defined mainly via aggregation of the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Yet, for mechanistically ill-defined &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; CUIs that do not correspond to distinct molecular mechanisms, the underlying aggregated GWAS were most likely investigating patients suffering from distinct unknown disease subtypes. In DisGeNET, genetic associations for all of these different subtypes are merged under the set of associations for the umbrella CUI.</p>



<p>In the proposed project, our aim is to develop a network-based computational approach to reverse such unspecific aggregations, which affect virtually any large-scale disease association database. As input, the envisaged algorithm will accept a set of (at least two) disease association databases containing different types of association data (e.g., disease-gene and disease-symptom associations) and a potentially ill-defined disease term D contained in all input databases. As output, it will return subsets of the term&rsquo;s associations in the input databases and a P-value which quantifies the evidence that these subsets indeed contain associations corresponding to distinct (possibly unknown) subtypes of the input disease D. Instead of starting with the unspecific associations for disease D, downstream precision medicine approaches can then make use of the uncovered subsets, potentially leading to more specific and promising hypotheses about molecular mechanisms driving complex diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/air-pollution-hard-pollinators-find-flowers">How air pollution may make it harder for pollinators to find flowers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Air pollution may blunt the signature scents of some night-blooming flowers, jeopardizing pollination.</p>



<p>When the aroma of a pale evening primrose encounters certain pollutants in the night air, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adi0858?af=R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pollutants destroy key scent molecules</a>, lab and field tests show. As a result, moths and other nocturnal pollinators may find it difficult to detect the fragrance and navigate to the flower, researchers report in the Feb. 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The finding highlights how air pollution can affect more than human health. &#8220;It&#8217;s really going deeper … affecting ecosystems and food security,” says Joel Thornton, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. &#8220;Pollination is so important for agriculture.&#8221;</p>



<p>Increasing industrialization has pumped ozone, nitrogen oxides and other pollutants into the air. During the day, sunlight typically breaks down ozone. But at night, the pollutant accumulates and reacts with nitrogen dioxide to produce nitrate radicals. These reactive molecules can affect plant fragrances, research has suggested, but the details weren’t clear. </p>



<p>Thornton and colleagues collected scent molecules from a pale evening primrose (<em>Oenothera pallida</em>) and released the fragrance into a wind tunnel containing hawk moths. The scientists could see the moths “easily flying upwind and tracking the odor,” says biologist Jeff Riffell of the University of Washington.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="474" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022224_sb_pollinatorandpollution_inline.jpg?resize=680%2C474&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3137273" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022224_sb_pollinatorandpollution_inline.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022224_sb_pollinatorandpollution_inline.jpg?resize=549%2C383&amp;ssl=1 549w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022224_sb_pollinatorandpollution_inline.jpg?resize=646%2C450&amp;ssl=1 646w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022224_sb_pollinatorandpollution_inline.jpg?resize=267%2C186&amp;ssl=1 267w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3137273">Using this glass globe, researchers absorbed the fragrance of a pale evening primrose flower. In lab, they analyzed the composition of the fragrance and identified molecules that are degraded by air pollution.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3137273">Jeremy Chan/University of Washington, Seattle</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But it was a different story when the researchers added pollutants like ozone and nitrogen dioxide to the mix. Then, the hawk moths flew in zigzag patterns, often searching fruitlessly for scent cues.</p>



<p>Exposing hawk moth antennae to each of the molecules in the fragrance pinpointed the primary cues that the moths use to find flowers: two types of<br>aromatic compounds called monoterpenes. Molecular analysis revealed that<br>the compounds break into pieces when they encounter nitrate radicals, stripping the primrose of most of its aroma.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was surprising [that] a seemingly subtle change in concentration of only two compounds — out of more than 20 — was sufficient to eliminate the flower’s attractiveness,” Riffell says.</p>



<p>The effect is akin to putting a blindfold on someone and then asking them to go fetch a cup of coffee, says Jose Fuentes, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To test the findings in nature, ecologist Jeremy Chan, now at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy, planted a field of real and faux primroses about<br>280 kilometers east of Seattle. Some of the fakes emitted lab-made primrose<br>fragrance, while others released the fragrance as well as chemicals that react in the air to make nitrate radicals. Cameras recorded the number of times moths visited the experimental buds.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nocturnal pollinators like this hawk moth rely on scent cues to find flowers. Using faux flowers, researchers tested the insect’s ability to locate night-blooming flowers that are normally fragrant and those whose scent is degraded by pollutants. Here, the moth easily finds a fake bloom emitting the scent of a pale evening primrose. But when certain air pollutants that can build up at night were added to the mix, moths had trouble homing in on the blooms.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Moths usually visited real and fake flowers that emitted unsullied primrose scent two to three times a night. For fake flowers with polluted fragrances, the average number of nightly visits was less than one, the team found.</p>



<p>Scientists need to learn how the observed insect behavior may impact<br>foraging, Fuentes says. If insects are becoming more confused in places<br>where air pollution is getting worse, “it will impact pollination, crop productions [and] health of native plant species.”</p>

<p>Iran licensed the home-grown Noora vaccine for emergency use in 2022 and has <a href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1101482/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85%DB%8C-%DB%B2-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85">reportedly administered millions</a> of doses to its citizens. The country’s health authorities say the shot is <a href="https://dolat.ir/detail/391516">94% effective</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The now-retracted paper, published in 2022 in the <em>Journal of Medical Virology</em>, was the only report on the clinical development of the vaccine to have appeared in an international journal. The article has been cited 10 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<span id="more-128882"></span>



<p>In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28731">a commentary</a> last year in the same journal, <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=2934">Donald Forthal</a>, chief of infectious diseases at the University of California, Irvine, raised several concerns about the article, titled “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28097">Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant receptor-binding domain-based protein subunit vaccine (Noora vaccine<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) against COVID-19 in adults: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported in October, Forthal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/26/publisher-looking-into-covid-vaccine-paper-with-serious-flaws/">questioned the efficacy</a> of the vaccine and expressed surprise “a manuscript containing so many serious flaws would have been accepted for publication following peer review, and given these issues, a retraction may be in order.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s editor-in-chief, Shou-Jiang Gao, said at the time the paper had undergone two rounds of “rigorously [sic] review by experts of the field” before it was published. The authors had responded to Forthal’s critique, Gao told us, and their response had “already undergone 3 rounds of review, each with 2 reviewers”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The last decision was made on October 24, 2023 and deadline for submitting the revision is November 23, 2023. So, we are waiting for the authors to submit the last revision before accepting and publishing it. This should fully address the issues that are raised.  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the response was never published. Meanwhile, in January, <a href="https://westernsydneydiabetes.com.au/staff-profiles/gideon-meyerowitz-katz/">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, an epidemiologist in Australia, flagged <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/179DB7875D6760293758F6CBD3900D#3">additional problems</a> in the paper on PubPeer, including several “impossible” and “contradictory” numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 2, the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.29509">announced</a> the paper had been retracted, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction has been agreed due to concerns raised by third parties regarding issues with the data presented in the article. Several inconsistencies concerning the information provided about the analyzed subjects were additionally identified. Furthermore, the authors failed to disclose the presence of potential conflicts of interest that may have affected the interpretation of the results presented. Accordingly, the editors consider the conclusions of this manuscript to be invalid. The authors have been informed of the decision to retract but did not agree with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corresponding author Hassan Abolghasemi of Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, in Tehran, told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Retraction of our article was a political decision not a scientific decision because there was a pressure on journal based on [apartheid] scientific issue. Our response to the comment never accepted by [PubPeer] and journal to be published.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Two days after the retraction, another group of researchers published <a href="https://iji.sums.ac.ir/article_49904.html">a study</a> in mice comparing the effect of four COVID-19 vaccines used in Iran.</p>



<p>“Our results indicate significant immunogenicity and neutralization efficacy induced by PastoCovac Plus and Sinopharm, but not by Noora and SpikoGen,” the team wrote in the article, which cited the now-retracted paper. “This suggests the need for additional comparative assessment of the potency and efficacy of these four vaccines in vaccinated subjects.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forests-neutrino-detectors-physics">Forests might serve as enormous neutrino detectors </a></h4>

              
                <p>Neutrino detectors don’t grow on trees. Or do they? Forests could one day be used to spot ultra-high-energy neutrinos, a physicist proposes.</p>



<p>Trees<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;could act as natural antennas</a>&nbsp;that pick up radio waves produced by certain interactions of the difficult-to-detect subatomic particles, astroparticle physicist Steven Prohira proposes in a paper submitted January 25 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“It is a very exciting idea,” says physicist Amy Connolly of the Ohio State University in Columbus, who was not involved with the study. “This could be … a natural solution that may have been sitting there under our noses.”</p>



<p>Neutrinos typically demand large, sensitive detectors. That’s especially true for detectors designed to snag the rarest, highest-energy neutrinos that shower down on Earth from space. Building such enormous detectors from scratch is a major hurdle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But high-energy neutrino physicists are known for building inventive detectors in natural settings. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-space-rain-down-all-directions">searches for neutrino interactions</a>&nbsp;using a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice, and the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope, KM3NeT, currently under construction, will search for neutrinos interacting in the Mediterranean Sea (<em>SN: 4/10/14</em>).&nbsp;These detectors have large enough volumes to make catching rare high-energy neutrinos possible.</p>



<p>To study neutrinos of even higher energies, scientists aim to spot one particular neutrino variety, called a tau neutrino. When such a neutrino passes inside the Earth, it can interact and produce a particle called a tau lepton. If that tau lepton escapes from the ground into Earth’s atmosphere, its decay can produce a shower of charged particles that generate radio waves. To detect these radio waves, scientists have proposed detectors such as the massive&nbsp;<a href="https://grand.cnrs.fr/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GRAND</a>&nbsp;experiment, which would use a total of 200,000 antennas divided into 20 separate arrays around the world.</p>



<p>Given the enormous undertaking involved in building that type of detector, “it dawned on me that it’d be cool if the antennas were already there,” says Prohira, of the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Previous research had shown that trees can pick up radio waves. Detecting those radio waves would require nailing a wire into each tree or wrapping a coil of wire around each tree’s trunk and connecting that to electronics to read out the signals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many questions still need to be answered to determine if the technique is plausible, Prohira acknowledges. Scientists would need to study how the trees performed for very high frequency radio waves, the range in which neutrino detectors of this type operate. And traditional radio antennas can be precisely built, allowing a detailed understanding of how they respond to different types of radio signals. Trees, of course, can’t be. For example, it’s not clear how trees would respond to the polarization of the radio waves, the orientation of their wiggles. Plus, the effect of foliage and, for deciduous forests, the seasonal dropping of leaves, needs to be investigated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the idea is inspiring, says physicist Eric Oberla of the University of Chicago, “it&#8217;s unclear if supplanting manufactured antennas with trees will solve more problems than it might create, and these detector-design challenges would need to be further addressed.”</p>



<p>Any impact the detector would have on the forest would also need to be understood. “Such a detector,” Prohira writes in the paper, “must be built in harmony with, and with respect for, nature; otherwise, this idea is not worth trying.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bmc-pregnancy-childbirth.jpeg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="110" height="156" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bmc-pregnancy-childbirth.jpeg?resize=110%2C156&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128876" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>


<p>A group of 10 members of the editorial board of <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> have resigned to protest the journal’s failure to respond to allegations of data fabrication.</p>



<p>Last week, in an email obtained by Retraction Watch, the editors wrote to Tovah Aronin, the managing editor of the journal, regarding “concerns about the publication of fraudulent research in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth and BMC Women’s Health in 2023.”</p>



<p>The allegations about two papers had been sent to the journal on Jan. 29, 2024, by Ben Mol, an obstetrician-gynecologist who has <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research">earned a reputation as a sleuth</a> for his efforts to clean up the literature in the field:</p>



<span id="more-128874"></span>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05728-w">Comparative study between oxytocin and combination of tranexamic acid and ethamsylate in reducing intra-operative bleeding during emergency and elective cesarean section after 38 weeks of normal pregnancy</a>,” published in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</li>



<li>“<a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-023-02549-z">Oxytocin versus a combination of tranexamic acid and ethamsylate in reducing intraoperative bleeding during abdominal myomectomy: a randomized clinical trial</a>,” published in BMC Women’s Health</li>
</ul>



<p>Mol told the editors he was puzzled by, among other things, the mean ages of the women in both studies, which contrasted sharply with data in other papers from the same period in the same medical center. <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/jim.thornton">Jim Thornton</a>, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Nottingham in the UK, left a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E44334B9748976BD99706983134EA1">similar comment</a> about one of the papers on PubPeer.</p>



<p>Mohamed Abdelmonem Kamel of Fayoum University in Egypt, the corresponding author of both papers, has not responded to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The editors said Mol’s evidence:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>strongly suggests this research is fabricated. While some issues are concerning, such as a zero loss to follow up, which is almost impossible in a real-world study, other issues, such as the indication for Caesarean section in a myomectomy paper, are extremely worrying.</p>



<p>Given the seriousness of the allegations, we would have expected the journal to respond immediately by placing a note of concern on these papers and asking the authors for their original data so that an investigation could be carried out. However, the journal has not even replied to Prof Mol (who is himself a leading clinical trialist in maternity care).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We cannot continue to serve on the editorial board of BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth unless the journal responds to serious, substantiated allegations of research fraud. Fraudulent research endangers women and babies by supporting ineffective treatments. We cannot allow this to go unchallenged and therefore feel that we cannot continue to serve as members of the editorial board. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>They left the door open to reversing themselves:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We would be happy to rejoin the Editorial Board if there is a strong and immediate response to raise concerns about the published manuscripts, and to retract papers where research fraud is proven. In addition, we believe that authors of proven fraudulent research should be banned from future submissions to the journal and from serving on the editorial board. For now, we can no longer justify being an editor of BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth.</p>



<p>We have long supported BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, submitting our own research and facilitating peer review of others’ research. It devalues our research and that of the majority of authors to allow fraudulent research to remain in the public domain unchallenged. We urge you to act to preserve the integrity of the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Aronin told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I would like to assure you that investigations of Ben Mol’s accusations are ongoing. We have been remiss in proper communication with the Editorial Board regarding these accusations and our investigations and we are planning on sending communications to them soon, and I hope that we will be able to reassure them that there is no need to resign.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Mol, he has so far flagged nearly 900 papers, of which 155 have been retracted and 72 have received expressions of concern. Most of the rest are in limbo, with no known outcome. Mol added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have flagged only 10% of what should be flagged. The big problem is the lack of response from the field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/colossal-biosciences-mammoth/">Scientists Are Inching Closer to Bringing Back the Woolly Mammoth</a></h4>

              
                De-extinction startup Colossal Biosciences claims it has found a way to reprogram elephant cells, a technical breakthrough that could lead to the return of the long-lost mammals.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3d-animal-anatomy-openvertebrate">See 3-D models of animal anatomy from openVertebrate’s public collection</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frog entrails, lizard scales and mouse tails, oh my.</p>



<p>These creatures are among <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/biosci/biad120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 13,000 museum specimens that had their innards CT scanned</a> as part of a six-year mission to create 3-D digital reconstructions. The effort, called openVertebrate, or oVert, aims to make vertebrate specimens freely available online. Such specimens typically have been kept in storage until put on display for the public or pulled for examination by a specialist, researchers report March 6 in <em>BioScience</em>.</p>



<p>Online replicas not only make museum collections accessible to more folks but also give people a peek inside animals without the need for scalpels or other dissection equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The best part of that is the weird, wonderful things that you weren’t expecting to see that jump out,” says evolutionary biologist Edward Stanley of the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Those things include parasitic infections, last meals and new insights into animal anatomy.</p>



<p>CT scans of pumpkin toadlets’ inner ears, for instance, revealed that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">amphibians crash-land their hops due to misshapen ear tubes</a> (<em>SN: 6/15/22</em>). And images that Stanley and colleagues took of spiny mice showed that the animals’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiny-mice-armadillo-armor-tails">tails are covered in bony armor</a> like an armadillo (<em>SN: 5/24/23</em>).</p>



<p>As part of oVert, Stanley and researchers across 25 institutions took CT scans of fluid-preserved specimens representing more than half of all known vertebrate genera, lighting up the skeletons of chameleons, frogs, bats, lizards, snakes, eagles and more. Some animals were soaked in iodine so that internal organs and muscles were visible.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A peek inside</h3>



<p>As part of the openVertebrate project, researchers created an online repository of CT scans of more than 13,000 museum specimens. The goal was to make such collections more widely available to researchers without the need for travel or shipping precious specimens, as well as the public. Here’s a tiny sample of what those scans revealed.</p>

<p>Each specimen was mounted inside a tube. The tube then rotated around a fixed X-ray scanner that captured a complete picture of the animal’s body. But few vertebrates are tube-shaped, so the team had to pack the cylinder with materials that could hold the specimen in place without interfering with the scan.</p>



<p>“It turns out bubble wrap, packing peanuts, plastic Coke bottles, that sort of thing, that’s the magic,” Stanley says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technology could help digitize additional organisms tucked away in natural history collections including invertebrates and plants, the researchers say. Some scanners may even work for living vertebrates.</p>

<p>A Springer Nature journal has issued an expression of concern for a 16-year-old paper by Carlo Croce, the cancer researcher – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/26/law-firm-sues-osu-cancer-researcher-for-900000-in-unpaid-fees-following-failed-libel-suit/">and noted art collector</a> – at The Ohio State University three years after the publication had received a correction for problematic images and roughly 20 months after the news division at <em>Nature </em>reported on a pair of institutional investigations into problems with Croce’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/22/papers-in-croce-case-with-blatantly-obvious-problems-still-arent-retracted-after-misconduct-investigation-sleuth/">we and others have reported</a>, those investigations concluded Croce had not committed misconduct but had overlooked the misdeeds of others in his lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-024-02989-3">the notice</a> for the paper, “MicroRNA signatures of TRAIL resistance in human non-small cell lung cancer,” which <em>Oncogene </em>published in 2008:</p>



<span id="more-128872"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief would like to alert the readers that following the Correction [1] of this article [2] to address the concerns raised regarding the western blot loading controls presented in Figs. 4c and 7a, further issues have been noted:</p>



<p>The western blot loading controls presented in Figs. 4d and 7c appear highly similar.</p>



<p>The U6 panel of Fig. 3b appears highly similar to the U6 panel of Fig. 4c of another article from the same author group that was submitted and published within a similar time frame [3].</p>



<p>The western blot loading controls presented in Fig. 5b and the originally published version of Fig. 7a appear highly similar to the control lanes 1 and 2 (flipped horizontally) of Fig. 3a of [4], which as also submitted and published within a similar time frame.</p>



<p>The authors have stated that the images used in the other articles [3, 4] are incorrect, and are issuing Corrections to replace them with the appropriate data. However, due to the number of concerns raised, readers are advised to interpret the presented data with caution.</p>



<p>M. Garofalo has stated on behalf of all authors that they do not agree to this editorial expression of concern.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article has been cited 229 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, of which 20 have come since the correction (which itself has received two citations).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">David Sanders, a data sleuth and biologist at Purdue University who raised issues about the papers – and who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">successfully defended himself</a> in a defamation suit Croce launched against him – told us last week he first notified Oncogene about the problematic articles in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the correction appeared in January 2021, Sanders contacted the journal again with concerns about the statement, including:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Why is there no indication that there had been image duplication in the correction?  How do you know that Figures 5b and 6a are correct? </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five months later, he raised still more questions about the article – but never heard back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In violation of COPE rules, they have never contacted me about the resolution of this issue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sanders also pointed to evidence of plagiarism in the article, which OSU documents in one of its reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Springer Nature to explain the lag – and why the journal felt an expression of concern was more appropriate than retraction in this case. The response from a spokesperson:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781645030058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Countdown</a><br><em>Sarah Scoles</em><br><em>Bold Type Books, $30</em></p>



<p>The United States is on a mission to modernize its aging nuclear weapons stockpile. And physicists have feelings about it — and the future of nuclear weapons more broadly.</p>



<p>In <em>Countdown</em>, science writer Sarah Scoles dredges up all the feels in interviews with physicists at the national laboratories dedicated to maintaining the U.S. nuclear stockpile and with researchers, activists and others who orbit that lab system. The researchers grapple with the legacy of their field’s most infamous invention and their roles as stewards of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-bomb-physics-fission-hiroshima-anniversary">the planet’s most destructive weapons</a> (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>To work on nuclear weapons, Scoles’ conversations reveal, is to embrace seemingly contradictory ideas. The weapons promote peace by deterring countries from attacking each other, but the weapons also make possible the destruction of civilization. The researchers see their work — on a variety of topics, from computer simulations of nuclear weapons to nonproliferation research — as necessary and even find beauty in it, but some also dream of a world without these bombs.</p>



<p>The United States has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-atom-matter-particle-nuclear-power-neutron">not tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s</a>, when it signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (<em>SN: 4/8/21</em>). To maintain confidence in its roughly 3,700 nuclear weapons, the country aims to replace the steadily degrading nuclear material at their hearts. These bowling ball–sized pits are hollow spheres of plutonium that kick off the nuclear explosion when a bomb detonates. Currently, the United States is stuck with its aging pits, but by 2030, the plan is to produce 80 pits per year.</p>



<p>Yet some activists oppose the pit production and other modernization efforts — the details of which are classified and thus unknown to the public. While proponents see updating the weapons as essential to shore up the deterrent, others think the deterrent is effective as is and worry modernizing could kick off a dangerous arms race.</p>



<p><em>Countdown</em> also delves into the history and culture of the national labs focused on nuclear work. While some of it seems like inside baseball — this or that management change — there is serious tea spilled. One scientist says Los Alamos “is in a 1950s bubble,” lamenting the lab’s seeming focus on the “cult of genius” — the outdated model in which a lone researcher transforms a field. And Scoles recounts drama from decades prior, of employees at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/los-alamos-laboratory-atomic-bomb-wildfire">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California rebelling against management the best way they knew how: angry blog posts and at least one snarky limerick (<em>SN: 6/6/22</em>).</p>



<p>With witty attention to detail, Scoles inserts moments of levity, pointing out the small absurdities surrounding this otherwise heavy topic. (She meets a scientist at Los Alamos’ Hot Rocks Java Cafe, “a place whose name suggests the 1990s came up with it.”) And the scientists’ passion for their field shines through, like the feeling of exhilaration that comes with taming plasma, a feral state of matter consisting of electrically charged particles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At times the book leaves the reader craving more scientific details, perhaps unavoidable when dealing with a classified subject. But some topics are glossed over more than necessary. The discussion of quantum computing — a technology that might eventually be useful for simulating nuclear weapons — is so abbreviated as to be confusing.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, Scoles highlights the deep connections that run between basic scientific research and nuclear applications. The conditions in an atomic bomb are similar to those elsewhere in the universe, such as in exploding stars. That means that even physicists who set out to reveal basic features of the universe might inadvertently advance knowledge about nuclear weapons. Like it or not, physics and nuclear weapons are inseparable.</p>



<p>The researchers Scoles profiles hope that, by understanding nuclear weapons better, we might protect ourselves from them. One research team aims to improve the detection of nuclear blasts, making it easier to verify that other countries aren’t setting them off. But such knowledge could also teach a government how to hide its own tests from prying eyes. Like so much else in nuclear weapons research, there are two sides.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-hubble-universe">Did the James Webb telescope ‘break the universe’? Maybe not</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reports that NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope broke the universe may have been exaggerated.</p>



<p>In its first images, JWST captured <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">what appeared to be gargantuan galaxies in the early universe</a> — ones much too big to be explained by current cosmological theories (<em>SN: 2/22/23</em>). But a new analysis of old data from the Hubble Space Telescope suggests that those alleged behemoths <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.061002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably have more prosaic explanations</a> fitting in with our standard understanding of the universe, cosmologist Julian Muñoz and colleagues report in the Feb. 9 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“James Webb is giving us a new dictionary to translate the language of the early universe,” says, Muñoz, of the University of Texas at Austin. “Before we say, ‘Hey, we need to throw away everything we knew in cosmology,’ we should understand this language.”</p>



<p>The trouble began almost as soon as JWST <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first pointed its eyes at the distant universe</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). Not only did some of its initial images contain enormous numbers of galaxies — far more than astronomers expected — but a good handful of those galaxies appeared to be monstrously massive, up to 100 times weightier than theories had predicted. These were dubbed “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-distant-galaxies-surprises-space">universe breakers</a>,” because they flew in the face of scientists’ assumptions about cosmic evolution (<em>SN: 8/20/23</em>).</p>



<p>The problem has to do with dark matter. Under the standard model of cosmology, dark matter collapsed into gargantuan clumps known as halos within the first few hundred million years of the universe. Ordinary matter was then gravitationally attracted to these halos, eventually forming stars and galaxies. The standard model also predicts the existence of far fewer dark matter halos than could account for JWST’s census of big galaxies.</p>



<p>But, Muñoz says, perhaps researchers simply need to be more careful when interpreting what they’ve been seeing.</p>



<p>He and his colleagues used existing data from Hubble to do a gut check on JWST’s results. Though the older telescope can’t see quite as far back in time as its successor, there is an era between roughly 450 million and 750 million years after the Big Bang where both instruments can capture light from galaxies, albeit in different wavelengths. JWST sees them in infrared, whereas Hubble can snag their ultraviolet light.</p>



<p>“If there were 10 times more dark matter structures [than expected], there would be 10 times more galaxies in James Webb, but there would also be 10 times more galaxies in Hubble,” Muñoz says. This is not what the Hubble data show.</p>



<p>The researchers tallied how many the old telescope saw across a wide range of brightnesses. Then they calculated how different populations of dark matter halos would have altered that census, for example, leading to a surplus of bright galaxies in the Hubble data. Any change in the number of halos big enough to match JWST’s observations, the team found, sharply contrasts with the Hubble data.</p>



<p>While JWST is the more powerful telescope — and therefore capable of simply seeing more galaxies than Hubble in a given epoch — Hubble has been staring at the universe for much longer, Muñoz notes. That means, he says, that, right now, Hubble’s observations are a more representative sample of what’s out there. For that reason, he and his colleagues suggest that researchers should turn to more conventional explanations for JWST’s odd galaxies.</p>



<p>It could be that environmental conditions in the early universe were different than in later epochs, allowing gas and dust to turn into stars much more efficiently than expected. Such high star formation rates could create the unusually bright objects JWST sees.</p>



<p>Star formation <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf85a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might have also been more episodic</a>, with large numbers of supernovas periodically going off. In that case, JWST might simply be capturing some galaxies at these moments of intense brightness, making them look weightier than they truly are.</p>



<p>Finally, it’s possible that some of the light JWST sees in these early galaxies comes from the blazingly bright regions around gorging supermassive black holes rather than stars, meaning the primordial galaxies aren’t quite as massive as presumed.</p>



<p>Outside researchers are impressed by these findings. “It&#8217;s very clever to look at the overlap region [between Hubble and JWST],” says Priyamvada&nbsp;Natarajan, a theoretical astrophysicist at Yale University.</p>



<p>But others point out that the cosmos isn’t entirely safe yet. JWST is currently making observations of the original handful of “universe breakers” that will pin down whether they actually existed in an era where they’re too big to explain. “If even one — especially one of the really massive ones — is there, it is a problem,” says Erica Nelson, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was part of the team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05786-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that first identified the anomalous objects</a>.</p>



<p>As astronomers become more familiar with JWST’s views of the early universe, they will likely learn how to better understand what they’re seeing, Muñoz says. “We&#8217;re doing this translation in a land where we don&#8217;t speak the language,” he says. “But you never know if your language skills are good enough.”</p>

<p>An August 2023 report on research integrity by consulting firm KPMG, commissioned by an Australian government agency, contains a made-up reference, Retraction Watch has discovered.</p>



<p>Reference 139 of the report, “<a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/attachments/Committee/International-Policy-Scan-Report.pdf">International Research Integrity Policy Scan Final Report: Compilation of information about research integrity arrangements outside Australia</a>,” reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Gunsalus CK, Marcus AR, Oransky I, Stern JM. Institutional and individual factors that promote research integrity. In: Macrina FL, editor. Scientific Integrity: Text and Cases in Responsible Conduct of Research. 4th ed. Washington, DC: ASM Press; 2018. p. 53-82.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Scientific+Integrity:+Text+and+Cases+in+Responsible+Conduct+of+Research,+4th+Edition-p-9781683673514">book with that title</a> exists, but the four authors listed did not contribute a chapter, and the 2018 edition does not appear to contain a chapter with that title. We – Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky – have indeed <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2675025">published with CK Gunsalus</a>, but nothing resembling this reference.</p>



<span id="more-128866"></span>



<p>We spot-checked about 20 of the other references in the book, and while there are some punctuation errors, the rest of the citations we reviewed exist. So this seemed to be a single error of unclear provenance. We wanted to let KPMG know, and find out what they would do about it.</p>



<p>We contacted KPMG Australia’s press team on Jan. 28. They acknowledged receipt of our email the same day, but when we didn’t hear back a week later, we followed up. On Feb. 6, we sent some questions we wanted on-the-record answers to, and waited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although as journalists we prefer to speak directly with people involved, none of this was unusual in seeking comment from companies and government agencies.</p>



<p>On Feb. 12, we followed up to check on progress, and were told scheduling had been difficult, and that answers would be forthcoming. We followed up on Feb. 14 and received no response. We then followed up again on Feb. 18 to say we were getting the impression the company had decided not to respond but that we would be publishing soon.</p>



<p>We have not heard back since. Which is puzzling – if there’s a clumsy error in a single reference, why not just acknowledge that, explain it, and move on?</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), which commissioned the document, thanked us for raising the issue with them, and said the agency “will work with KPMG to correct the report.” The consulting firm had not yet contacted NHMRC, the spokesperson said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-biomarkers-blood-paxlovid">The blood holds clues to understanding long COVID</a></h4>

              
                <p>When I talk to immunologist Paul Morgan,&nbsp;he’s on the hunt for potentially life-altering drugs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s got a call with a pharmaceutical company planned in the next half hour.&nbsp;His goal: persuade the company to supply his lab with a drug that might — maybe, hopefully, someday — ease some of the unrelenting symptoms of long COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morgan’s lab at Cardiff University in Wales has been studying people with the disease, including the first waves of patients, some of whom have been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/health-risks-persist-2-years-covid-19">living with long COVID for more than two years</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 8/21/23</em>).&nbsp;The&nbsp;“very long haulers,” he calls them. Their symptoms can include brain fog, fatigue, breathlessness and joint and muscle pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morgan and his colleagues have pinpointed an immune system anomaly in the blood of some of these long haulers. A drug that targets that quirk might be one way to treat their disease. He’s quick to tell me that this research is in its early days. First, his team needs to get its hands on a drug. Then they need to do a clinical trial — at this stage, it’s still proof-of-concept.&nbsp;“Actual treatments are still some way off,” he says.</p>



<p>But the work is one in a surge of studies mining the blood for long COVID clues, potential biomarkers of the disease. A growing cadre of labs are starting to sketch out some of the shrouded figures at play in the once-seemingly inscrutable disease.&nbsp;It’s as if there’s a&nbsp;“picture that’s being revealed from the fog,” says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Yale University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That picture features a motley cast of molecular and cellular characters that could point scientists toward potential tests and treatments — both are currently lacking. Still, the full long COVID landscape is unquestionably complicated. Assorted actors tangle together in an immunological thicket that can make the disease seem impenetrable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Iwasaki thinks researchers can crack long COVID’s mysteries.&nbsp;In fact, recent work in the field has her feeling pretty excited.&nbsp;Yes, investigating long COVID is complex, she says.&nbsp;“But it’s definitely worth doing because many people are suffering.”</p>



<p>I spoke with Iwasaki, Morgan, and other researchers about long haulers and current work to illuminate the disease — and to get clarity on the less severe but still vexing symptoms that stuck around for months after my own COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Long COVID is not a single disease, which makes diagnosis and treatment difficult&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Some 5 to 20 percent&nbsp;of COVID-19 cases develop into long COVID, though the exact number is hard to pin down. One formidable challenge is diagnosis. Does a person with bone-deep exhaustion and trouble concentrating on the pages of their book have the disease? There’s no test or nasal swab doctors can use to provide a definitive answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For diseases like diabetes and prostate cancer, scientists look for biomarkers in the blood — molecules that can serve as telltale signs of illness.&nbsp;But&nbsp;“we are not likely to come up with one biomarker or even one set of biomarkers to distinguish everyone with long COVID,”&nbsp;Iwasaki says.</p>



<p>The difficulty is that long COVID is not just one disease. It’s likely a collection of many diseases, she says, with varying sets of symptoms and triggers. Even defining long COVID is complicated. Last spring, researchers developed&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2805540#:~:text=1-,Postacute%2520sequelae%2520of%2520SARS%252DCoV%252D2%2520infection%2520(PASC),clinical%2520and%2520public%2520health%2520concern." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a long COVID scoring system that factors in a dozen signature symptoms</a>. But more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-patients-symptoms-doctors-research-clinics-brain-fog-fatigue">200 symptoms have been tied to the disease</a>, and cases can vary greatly from person to person&nbsp;<em>(SN: 11/17/22)</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, in many doctors’ offices and clinics, homing in on a diagnosis means first ruling out other conditions.&nbsp;For example, after months of feeling wrung out and faded, with unexpected pain in my legs following a COVID-19 infection last year, my doctor ordered a slew of blood tests. She was looking for signs of rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme disease, thyroid hormone abnormalities and a handful of other conditions.&nbsp;Everything was negative. It’s called a&nbsp;“diagnosis of exclusion,”&nbsp;Morgan says.&nbsp;&#8220;You test for everything else, and when nothing comes back positive, you say,&nbsp;‘well, it must be [long COVID], then.’”</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">percent</h5>



<p class="has-text-align-center">survey respondents with long COVID who reported that medical professionals had dismissed their illness&nbsp;</p>
</div>



<p>He compares it to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, another debilitating condition that also lacks clear diagnostic tests.&nbsp;“Many physicians don’t take it very seriously at all because of that.”&nbsp;That concern is even listed on the&nbsp;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html#:~:text=Most%2520medical%2520schools%2520in%2520the,seriously%2520by%2520some%2520healthcare%2520providers." target="_blank" rel="noopener">ME/CFS Web page</a>.&nbsp;And it’s true of long COVID, too, says Wolfram Ruf, an immunologist at&nbsp;University Medical Center Mainz in Germany.&nbsp;“There’s still some misconception that this is just a psychological disease.” A 2022 survey found that a third of long COVID patients felt as if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9448633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical professionals dismissed their illness</a>. And stories from frustrated long haulers continue to appear in the news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Better diagnostics mean people suffering from long COVID’s myriad symptoms could put a firm label on their condition.&nbsp;That’s important, Morgan says.&nbsp;But tests that spot long COVID biomarkers in the blood could also do far more.&nbsp;“If those tests actually lead you to a mechanism and to a treatment,” he says,&nbsp;“then that’s transformational.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A complicated cast of immune and other characters may contribute to long COVID&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Morgan’s lab and others have zeroed in on immune proteins that defend us from bacteria and viruses. These proteins, part of a defense called complement, circulate in the blood, and get chopped up during an infection.&nbsp;The resulting fragments sound a&nbsp;“we’re under attack” alarm and help form a molecular machine that busts pathogens.</p>



<p>Once the infection clears, the fragments fade away. But in some people with long COVID<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.23297597v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.23297597v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(24)00041-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the alarm-raising fragments can linger in the blood,</a>&nbsp;Morgan’s team reported February 14 in&nbsp;<em>Med</em>. That’s a sign that the defense system is still whipping up inflammation — in some cases, even years after a person’s initial COVID-19 infection. In January, a different group reported something similar in&nbsp;<em>Science</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a study of 113 COVID-19 patients</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not everyone with long COVID will have complement abnormalities.&nbsp;Even in the patients Morgan studies,&nbsp;“there will&nbsp;be some people who have no changes in their complement markers at all.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for those who do, it can be a double-edged sword, he says.&nbsp;Turning complement on briefly can knock out some bugs, but keeping it on chronically can damage your cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s an ever-growing list of other blood-borne anomalies, too. A protein found in the brain can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak out into the blood in people with brain fog</a>, scientists found in February. And long COVID patients can have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low levels of the stress hormone cortisol</a>, Iwasaki’s team reported in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>&nbsp;in September.&nbsp;In some patients, she and others have also spotted other suspicious signs, like long-slumbering herpes viruses that reawaken and start infecting cells again.&nbsp;“Whether this is a cause or effect [of long COVID],” Iwasaki says,&nbsp;“we don’t know.” Usually, the immune system keeps these viruses under control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some people with long COVID, powerful immune players called T cells also seem to go out of whack.&nbsp;Scientists in England analyzing the blood of long COVID patients found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi9379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T cells that release high levels of an alarm signal called interferon-gamma</a>. That signal could serve as a potential biomarker in some patients, the study’s authors suggested.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Perhaps there’s SARS-CoV-2 somewhere in the body that can’t be cleared.” </p><cite><em>Nadia Roan</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>At&nbsp;the University of California, San Francisco, virologist and immunologist Nadia Roan’s team is also taking a look at T cells. In some long COVID patients,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01724-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T cells that recognize SARS-CoV-2 can become exhausted</a>, her team reported in&nbsp;<em>Nature Immunology</em>&nbsp;in January. And scientists know that tired-out T cells can have trouble&nbsp;wiping out infection.</p>



<p>“Perhaps there’s SARS-CoV-2 somewhere in the body that can’t be cleared,” Roan says.&nbsp;If a hidden reservoir of virus lurks in people’s tissues long-term, certain T cells might gather there for continued attack, eventually wearing&nbsp;the cells down.&nbsp;Last summer, a different team&nbsp;found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.27.23293177v1.full-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viral traces in some people’s guts nearly two years after their initial infection</a>. Scientists have also&nbsp;spotted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9839201/#:~:text=Several%2520reports%2520have%2520pointed%2520towards,stool%2520and%2520urine55–60." target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs&nbsp;of SARS-CoV-2 in other body tissues</a>, including brain, lung and liver. These traces may be enough to irritate the immune system long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Residual virus isn’t likely to explain everything.&nbsp;“Different mechanisms may drive different forms of the disease,” Roan says. But together, work from her lab and others paints a portrait of an immune system under enduring duress. And as the pictures comes into focus, scientists are starting to explore new experiments, trials and treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clinical trials will test whether antiviral drugs can ease long COVID symptoms&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Iwasaki and her colleagues are nearly done recruiting 100 people with long COVID for a randomized clinical trial of the antiviral drug Paxlovid. A similar trial by the National Institutes of Health is also in the works. That study aims to enroll 900 people and should conclude testing by this summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An idea targeted by both trials is that SARS-CoV-2 persists in the body, triggering symptoms. Scientists will follow participants as they take Paxlovid for 15 or 25 days. (For COVID-19 infection, the typical treatment length is five days.)</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-aligncenter">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/021424_mr_long-covid-biomarkers_inline.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="Six oval-shaped pills rest on yellow and blue packaging.

<p>Iwasaki’s team also plans to scan participants’&nbsp;blood for molecules that might predict a person’s response to Paxlovid. Suppose participants who improve after Paxlovid had high levels of certain blood molecules prior to treatment. Scientists could then measure those molecules in other people with long COVID to see if they might be good candidates for the drug.&nbsp;“There’s not one drug cure-all,” Iwasaki says,&nbsp;“but even knowing who might benefit is a huge thing.”</p>



<p>And though Morgan’s complement work is still at an early stage, he considers it a&nbsp;“strong lead to a potential therapy.” One bright spot is the number of complement-targeting drugs that already exist. Doctors currently use the drugs to treat certain blood disorders and other rare conditions. Morgan and other scientists have tried using some of these drugs to treat&nbsp;severe cases of acute COVID-19 infection, but large-scale trials didn’t pan out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, he wants to repurpose those drugs for long COVID patients whose complement system has gone out of control. Dialing down those defenses might help quench the fire of chronic inflammation.</p>



<p>So far, Morgan hasn’t seen much interest from pharmaceutical companies. Repurposing generic drugs isn’t a big money maker.&nbsp;And Morgan’s team doesn’t envision long COVID patients needing to use the drugs long-term&nbsp;— another financial disincentive for companies. But when I email him later, he says his call after our interview went well. Morgan&#8217;s not naming the company yet&nbsp;but he knows that patients are standing by, waiting day after day for anything that will offer some relief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For me, lingering symptoms turned the once-easy tasks of everyday life into energy-sucking feats performed while my body’s battery blinked down to zero. If I miscalculated and walked too fast or moved too much, I’d pay for it later and crash on the couch or in bed, sometimes taking days to recover. That symptom is known as post-exertional malaise and it’s common for people with long COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I was never officially diagnosed with the disease. Keeping up with doctors’&nbsp;appointments felt daunting, and I wasn’t sure how much my doctor would be&nbsp;able to help. There may be many people who fall into this category, Morgan says — people who have long-term symptoms but lack clear-cut answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though white women like myself are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/05/long-covid-19-symptoms-reported.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely to be diagnosed with the disease</a>,&nbsp;in a survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanic and Black people were more likely to report long-lasting symptoms. Access to care could be one factor in the diagnosis discrepancy. Previous data have shown that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/health-coverage-by-race-and-ethnicity/#:~:text=(Figure%202).-,Nonelderly%20AIAN%20and%20Hispanic%20people%20had%20the%20highest%20uninsured%20rates,their%20White%20counterparts%20(6.6%25)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">people from these groups are less likely to have health insurance</a>. Another factor may be the changeling nature of the disease itself.&nbsp;Long COVID can show up differently in different groups of people, scientists have found.</p>



<p>I’m lucky because my symptoms started improving after about six months. I knew I was mostly recovered the first time I went grocery shopping and carried my bags into the house by myself, without crashing afterwards. But so many others continue to struggle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morgan sees that firsthand.&nbsp;Since his paper came out,&nbsp;“I’ve been absolutely deluged by letters from patients,” he says.&nbsp;They ask to be tested and if he has drugs that can treat them. For Morgan, those letters show the depth of the problem.<br><br>“I reply to them all,” he says.</p>

                <p>Before modern astronomers and mathematicians figured out how to accurately predict solar eclipses, the extinction of the sun sparked terror. The god Zeus turned midday into night, the ancient Greek poet Archilochus wrote of a 647 B.C. eclipse, “and sore fear came upon men.” Thanks to science, we can now skip the fear and go straight to awe. And on April 8, millions of people across North America will be treated to an awe-inspiring view.</p>



<p>In fact, almost 32 million people in the United States alone live in the zone of totality for next month’s solar eclipse. The path runs from northern Mexico through the United States and then to southeastern Canada. As luck would have it, this will be an extra-special, superduper eclipse. If skies are clear, viewers will be treated to a blackout of nearly 4.5 minutes. That’s almost two minutes longer than the August 2017 eclipse, which was the last total solar eclipse to pass over North America.</p>



<p>And the sun will be close to solar maximum, when its activity is greatest, so observers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/total-solar-eclipse-sun-science-viewing-2024">may see bright streamers of plasma and perhaps even a coronal mass ejection</a>, freelance writer James R. Riordon reports. Scientists are poised to make the most of this special eclipse to investigate a wide range of questions, Riordon writes, including how the sun’s radiation generates the Earth’s ionosphere and what gives rise to zippy solar winds — an important question for predicting the space weather that can disrupt communications and power grids on Earth.</p>



<p>Needless to say, we here at <em>Science News</em> have been looking forward to this eclipse since the 2017 one brushed by us. Back then, our staffers trekked from our office in Washington, D.C., to the National Mall, joining throngs of people enjoying a partial view of the eclipse. D.C. won’t be in totality this year, either, but we’ll get more than two hours of partial eclipse. Because the path of totality sweeps across so much of the United States, it’s a great year for eclipse tourism. More than a few Science Newsers are planning to travel to catch the full show.</p>



<p>I may be a bit late for that. I just checked hotel listings in the path of totality, and a Holiday Inn Express in Painesville, Ohio, on Lake Erie, would cost me $1,899 a night. So I’ll be content with the partial view at home.</p>



<p>Also in this issue, astronomy writer Adam Mann gets <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-sample-weight-bennu-asteroid">the latest on the space rocks collected from asteroid Bennu</a> and delivered to Earth last year by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. Much to researchers’ consternation, difficulties opening the sample canister kept their prize out of reach for months. It took clever work-arounds and making a new kind of ratchet wrench for them to get the job done. And do check out molecular biology and senior writer Tina Hesman Saey’s report on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-retrovirus-myelin-speedy-nerves-evolve">how ancient viruses helped make our sophisticated human brains possible</a>  and freelance writer Simon Makin’s story on a new technology that let <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-device-sense-temperature-prosthetic-hand-touch">a person with a prosthetic hand sense hot and cold</a>.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Get low (cholesterol’s version)</h4>



<p><em>An experimental genetic treatment called VERVE-101 can deactivate a cholesterol-raising gene in people with hypercholesterolemia, <strong>Meghan Rosen</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/verve-101-gene-editing-ldl-cholesterol-base-editing">Base editing can lower cholesterol</a>” (</em>SN: 1/27/24, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p><strong>Rosen</strong> wrote that researchers are testing to see what dosage of VERVE-101 is most effective. Given that the treatment edits a gene, reader <strong>Linda Ferrazzara</strong> wondered why the dose matters.</p>



<p>Too low a dose may mean that not enough VERVE-101 makes it to the liver, where it turns off the gene, <strong>Rosen</strong> says. If too few cells have the gene switched off, patients will not experience the drug’s cholesterol-lowering effects. If cholesterol levels remain high after an initial treatment, a second infusion of the drug may help, <strong>Rosen </strong>says. But the developers prefer for the treatment to be one dose.</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Jack Miller </strong>asked whether VERVE-101 affects germ cells, which give rise to sperm and egg cells.</p>



<p>In mice, scientists have found that most of the drug ends up in the liver, and none goes to the germ line, <strong>Rosen</strong> says. The offspring of treated mice are also unaffected by the drug. So if the children of treated patients also have hypercholesterolemia, those kids would still need their own treatment, she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">AI etiquette</h4>



<p><em>To develop better safeguards, scientists are studying how people have tricked AI chatbots into answering harmful questions that the AI have been trained to decline, such as how to build a dangerous weapon, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/generative-ai-chatbots-chatgpt-safety-concerns">Chatbots behaving badly</a>” (</em>SN: 1/27/24, p. 18<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Linda Ferrazzara</strong> wondered if AI chatbots have been trained on languages other than English.</p>



<p>AI chatbots like ChatGPT are based on large language models, or LLMs, a type of generative AI typically trained on vast swaths of internet content. Many of the biggest, most capable LLMs right now are tailored to English speakers, <strong>Conover </strong>says. Although those LLMs have some ability to write in other languages, most of their training data is in English. But there are language models designed to use other languages, she says. Efforts so far have focused on languages that are widely spoken and written, and for which large amounts of training data are available, such as Mandarin.</p>



<p><strong>Ferrazzara</strong> also asked if boosting computing power could help the bots better defend against trickery.</p>



<p>LLMs already use a lot of computing power, and it will only increase as people use LLMs more and more, <strong>Conover</strong> says. But even if increased power would make establishing safeguards easier, we need to recognize that greenhouse gas emissions linked to such energy-intensive calculations contribute to climate change, she says. “The time and energy needed to respond to a chatbot query is not something we want to overlook while waiting for computers to improve.”</p>



<p>Many of the defensive techniques described in the story screen for harmful questions. Reader <strong>Mike Speciner</strong> wondered if filtering the responses to those questions would be easier.</p>



<p>Some filters like this are already applied on some chatbots, <strong>Conover</strong> says. For example, Microsoft’s Bing AI tends to cut off its answers if it wades into forbidden territory. These filters are more general, rather than targeted specifically at one kind of attack. “To avoid letting bad stuff slip through, they may cast too wide of a net, filtering out innocuous answers as well as dangerous ones and making the user’s experience worse,” <strong>Conover</strong> says. What’s more, an attacker who knows how the LLM’s self-filtering works may figure out a way to fool that filter.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Correction</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/overdose-prevention-opioid-safe-injection-harm-reduction">Saving lives with safe injection</a>” incorrectly described Elizabeth Samuels of UCLA as an epidemiologist and emergency medicine physician (<em>SN: 2/10/24, p. 16</em>). She is an emergency and addiction medicine physician. That story also mistakenly stated that drug policy consultant Edward Krumpotich helped write the 2023 legislation in Minnesota that authorized funding for an overdose prevention center. He advocated for that legislation but did not help write it.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Deepak Panday will talk about his paper in the presentation entitled &quot;CEPS: An Open Access MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Analysis of Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Background: We developed CEPS as an open access MATLAB® GUI (graphical user interface) for
the analysis of Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals (CEPS), and demonstrate
its use with an example data set that shows the effects of paced breathing (PB) on
variability of heart, pulse and respiration rates. CEPS is also sufficiently adaptable to
be used for other time series physiological data such as EEG (electroencephalography),
postural sway or temperature measurements. Methods: Data were collected from a convenience
sample of nine healthy adults in a pilot for a larger study investigating the effects on
vagal tone of breathing paced at various different rates, part of a development programme
for a home training stress reduction system. Results: The current version of CEPS focuses
on those complexity and entropy measures that appear most frequently in the literature,
together with some recently introduced entropy measures which may have advantages over
those that are more established. Ten methods of estimating data complexity are currently
included, and some 28 entropy measures. The GUI also includes a section for data pre-
processing and standard ancillary methods to enable parameter estimation of embedding
dimension m and time delay τ (‘tau’) where required. The software is freely available
under version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3) for non-commercial
users. CEPS can be downloaded from Bitbucket. In our illustration on PB, most complexity
and entropy measures decreased significantly in response to breathing at 7 breaths per
minute, differentiating more clearly than conventional linear, time- and frequency-domain
measures between breathing states. In contrast, Higuchi fractal dimension increased during
paced breathing. Conclusions: We have developed CEPS software as a physiological data
visualiser able to integrate state of the art techniques. The interface is designed for
clinical research and has a structure designed for integrating new tools. The aim is to
strengthen collaboration between clinicians and the biomedical community, as demonstrated
here by using CEPS to analyse various physiological responses to paced breathing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urinary-tract-infection-pain-uti">Here’s why pain might last after persistent urinary tract infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>Urinary tract infections are painful, inconvenient and incredibly common. For decades, doctors haven’t had any leads on why, even after several rounds of antibiotics, UTI pain can linger. Now they do.</p>



<p>Nerve growth from <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adi5578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune responses to the infection might be to blame</a>, researchers report March 1 in <em>Science Immunology. </em>Understanding immune and nerve responses to persistent UTIs, the team says, could possibly lead to new, antibiotic-free forms of treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749018/#:~:text=Around%2050%E2%80%9360%25%20of%20women,causes%20UTIs%20in%20most%20patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over half of women will have a UTI</a> in their life, and around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502976/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quarter of infections come back within six months</a>. The pain from these infections can be quite difficult to treat, says Marcus Drake, a neurological urologist at Imperial College London. “It’s a ‘<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heartsink situation</a>’ for the patients, and it’s a heartsink situation for the doctors, because there isn’t much that you can do.”</p>



<p>Puzzled by why pain persisted after UTI-related bacteria were wiped out, immunologist Soman Abraham of Duke University and colleagues collected urine samples from women with recurring infections. Compared with samples of women without recurring UTIs, these showed signs of nerve activation.</p>



<p>To better understand what was happening at the tissue level, the team induced multiple UTIs in mice. Compared with uninfected mice, “we saw a tremendous growth of nerves,” Abraham says. But that only confirmed what the team suspected about humans. The researchers still wanted to know what spurred the nerves to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abraham knew that when the urinary tract is infected, one of the bladder’s first defenses is to shed a tissue layer to remove bacteria. But in this process, nerves are sloughed off, which jolts nerve-growing immune cells into action. A close look at the bladder tissue of the mice with repeat UTIs revealed an abundance of two kinds of immune cells.</p>



<p>Specifically, there were high levels of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/role-change-mast-cells-show-anti-inflammatory-side">mast cells</a>, which are stored in bladder tissue and produce a substance called nerve growth factor (<em>SN: 9/5/07</em>). And there were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/not-so-dispensable-spleen">monocytes</a>, blood-based immune cells that rush to the site of infection to produce even more nerve growth factor (<em>SN: 7/30/09</em>). Similar to respiratory infections, the more often the body has to fight off bladder infections, the better it gets at it; monocytes and mast cells get faster at their job with each UTI. “The unfortunate part is [it becomes] an overzealous response,” Abraham says.</p>



<p>Pain continues because nerve growth factor doesn’t just generate nerve growth; it also lowers the threshold at which nerve pain and pressure receptors activate. Even after no infection-related bacteria remained, the mice in the study had frequent urination and showed signs of lingering pain. “The slightest, innocuous volume of urine was enough to trigger the voiding response,” Abraham says. But with antihistamines and blockers of nerve growth factor, the mice were able to feel some relief.</p>



<p>Right now, persistent pain in UTIs in humans is usually treated with anti-inflammatory or other pain-reducing drugs, including antihistamines, but all of these are a bit unsatisfactory, Drake says. The researchers hope that understanding how nerves grow with recurrent UTIs can lead to more effective pain relief treatments in the future.</p>

<p>A cardiologist in Pakistan has been selling coauthorship of his research papers to scientists, particularly medical students, who were not involved in the work, Retraction Watch has learned. Several of his articles were published after the journal learned of his underhand activities.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jahanzeb-malik-61ba36159_i-will-be-giving-a-talk-on-international-activity-6971470075463634944-5IZX?trk=public_profile">Jahanzeb Malik</a>, of the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, publishes in a variety of journals,&nbsp;including <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em> and <em>Cardiology in Review</em>, with a number of co-authors on each study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, not all of these authors contributed to the work. Malik, who is also a member of the <a href="https://archive.fo/pdj0L">Cardiovascular Analytics Group</a>, an international network of researchers, runs a WhatsApp messaging group titled &#8220;Research Associates,&#8221; where he posts about articles he is working on and offers authorship &#8220;slots&#8221; in exchange for money, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.05-PM.jpeg">messages</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.06-PM.jpeg">shown</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.07-PM-1.jpeg">to</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.07-PM.jpeg">Retraction</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.08-PM.jpeg">Watch</a> reveal. He has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/533203374144644/posts/1514936009304704/">advertised on the “United States Medical Licensing Examination Pakistan” Group Facebook page</a>, writing that he runs the group to &#8220;help students and other doctors in doing medical research and writing research papers.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going by the username &#8220;Darklord&#8221; on WhatsApp, Malik <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image1-1.jpeg">charges up to $300</a> for a first-author position. Less prominent positions on the manuscript can be bought for around $150. Malik has since changed his username to &#8220;Dr. Jahanzeb Malik&#8221; on the app.</p>



<span id="more-128848"></span>



<p>Asked about his response to these allegations, Malik told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are not selling author positions; all my coauthors are contributing according to the ICMJE criteria. Junior authors write all papers so they can learn and move ahead in manuscript writing. We only share funding when opting for an open-access journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This type of group, known as a &#8220;paper mill,&#8221; has become increasingly common as academics and medical students have faced pressure to publish. A six-month Retraction Watch investigation <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">published last month</a> suggested the dean of the faculty of health sciences at Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias in Spain, Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas, bought his way onto nearly all of the papers he published last year.</p>



<p>Among more than 40 of the scientific articles advertised in Malik’s WhatsApp group over the past year, at least 13 have been published. The researcher appears as a coauthor on more than half of these, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014628062300542X?via%3Dihub">Safety and Efficacy of Ferric Carboxymaltose in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Iron Deficiency</a>; <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em></li>



<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146280623004140#:~:text=Some%20studies%20suggest%20that%20individuals,challenges%20in%20quantifying%20positive%20emotions.">Role of Positive Emotions in Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy</a>; <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em></li>



<li><a href="https://journals.lww.com/cardiologyinreview/abstract/9900/coronary_stent_infection__a_systematic_review_of.180.aspx">Coronary Stent Infection: A Systematic Review of Literature</a>; <em>Cardiology in Review</em></li>
</ul>



<p>A source who requested anonymity to avoid potential backlash from the authors in the papers learned about the group through a friend. After joining, the source reported Malik&#8217;s behavior to the editor-in-chief of <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em>, Hector O. Ventura, as well as its publisher Elsevier on October 15, 2023. Josie Liu, an associate publisher at Elsevier, wrote back saying the team took the concerns seriously and asked to allow &#8220;some time to closely investigate the issue.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, however, Malik has published four papers in the Elsevier title <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em>. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0146280623005820">One of them</a> matches a paper “Darklord” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.11-PM-1-1.jpeg">advertised on WhatsApp</a>.</p>



<p>Liu told the whistleblower on January 15 that Elsevier&#8217;s ethics team has been investigating the case and would &#8220;flag Dr. Jahanzeb Malik in the submission system.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked for comment, an Elsevier spokesperson told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are aware of the situation and our ethics and research integrity teams are indeed investigating. It is our policy to not comment on on-going investigations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also reached out to Ventura, the editor of <em>Current Problems in Cardiology,</em> but did not receive a response.</p>
