              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-perseverance-rover-nasa-water-life">What has Perseverance found in two years on Mars?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In August 2021 on a lonely crater floor, the newest Mars rover dug into one of its first rocks.</p>



<p>The percussive drill attached to the arm of the Perseverance rover scraped the dust and top several millimeters off a rocky outcrop in a 5-centimeter-wide circle. From just above, one of the rover’s cameras captured what looked like broken shards wedged against one another. The presence of interlocking crystal textures became obvious. Those textures were not what most of the scientists who had spent years preparing for the mission expected.</p>





<p>Then the scientists watched on a video conference as the rover’s two spectrometers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103522002809?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the chemistry</a> of those meshed textures. The visible shapes along with the chemical compositions showed that this rock, dubbed Rochette, was volcanic in origin. It was not made up of the layers of clay and silt that would be found at a former lake bed.</p>



<p>Nicknamed Percy, the rover <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">arrived at the Jezero crater two years ago</a>, on February 18, 2021, with its sidekick helicopter, Ingenuity. The most complex spacecraft to explore the Martian surface, Percy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">builds on the work</a> of the Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars since 2012, the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers, the Sojourner rover and other landers.</p>



<p>But Perseverance’s main purpose is different. While the earlier rovers focused on Martian geology and understanding the planet’s environment, Percy is looking for signs of past life. Jezero was picked for the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars 2020 mission</a> because it appears from orbit to be a former lake environment where microbes could have thrived, and its large delta would likely preserve any signs of them. Drilling, scraping and collecting pieces of the Red Planet, the rover is using its seven science instruments to analyze the bits for any hint of ancient life. It’s also collecting samples to return to Earth.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where on Mars is Perseverance?</h3>



<p>After landing on the Red Planet, Perseverance tested its movements and instruments for several months before exploring the floor of the Jezero crater. Percy then journeyed to the delta, arriving in April 2022. The rover explored the delta front through December, before carefully depositing samples on the surface. Next, it’s headed to the top of the delta.</p>

<p>Since landing, “we’ve been able to start putting together the story of what has happened in Jezero, and it’s pretty complex,” says Briony Horgan, a planetary scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who helps plan Percy’s day-to-day and long-term operations.</p>



<p>Volcanic rock is just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-mars-photos-nasa">one of the surprises the rover has uncovered</a>. Hundreds of researchers scouring the data Perseverance has sent back so far now have some clues to how the crater has evolved over time. This basin has witnessed flowing lava, at least one lake that lasted perhaps tens of thousands of years, running rivers that created a mud-and-sand delta and heavy flooding that brought rocks from faraway locales.</p>



<p>Jezero has a more dynamic past than scientists had anticipated. That volatility has slowed the search for sedimentary rocks, but it has also pointed to new alcoves where ancient life could have taken hold.</p>



<p>Perseverance has turned up carbon-bearing materials — the basis of life on Earth — in every sample it has abraded, Horgan says. “We’re seeing that everywhere.” And the rover still has much more to explore.</p>

<h4>Perseverance finds unexpected rocks</h4>



<p>Jezero is a shallow impact crater about 45&nbsp;kilo­meters in diameter just north of the planet’s equator. The crater formed sometime between 3.7&nbsp;billion and 4.1&nbsp;billion years ago, in the solar system’s first billion years. It sits in an older and much larger impact basin known as Isidis. At Jezero’s western curve, an etched ancient riverbed gives way to a dried-out, fan-shaped delta on the crater floor. </p>



<p>That delta “is like this flashing signpost beautifully visible from orbit that tells us there was a standing body of water here,” says astrobiologist Ken Williford of Blue Marble Space Institute of Science in Seattle.</p>



<p>Perseverance landed on the crater floor about two kilometers from the front of the delta. Scientists thought they’d find compacted layers of soil and sand there, at the base of what they dubbed Lake Jezero. But the landscape immediately looked different than expected, says planetary geologist Kathryn Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Stack Morgan is deputy project scientist for Perseverance.</p>

<p>For the first several months after the landing, the Mars 2020 mission team tested the rover’s movements and instruments, slowly, carefully. But from the first real science drilling near the landing location, researchers back on Earth realized what they had found. The texture of the rock, Stack Morgan says, was “a textbook igneous volcanic rock texture.” It looked like volcanic lava flows.</p>



<p>Over the next six months, several more rocks on the crater floor revealed igneous texture. Some of the most exciting rocks, including Rochette, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed olivine crystals throughout</a>. “The crystal fabric was obviously cooled from a melt, not transported grains,” as would be the case if it were a sedimentary sample, says Abigail Allwood of the Jet Propulsion Lab. She leads the rover’s PIXL instrument, which uses an X-ray beam to identify each sample’s composition.</p>



<p>Mission scientists now think the crater floor is filled with igneous rocks from two separate events — both after the crater was created, so more recently than the 3.7 billion to 4.1 billion years ago time frame. In one, magma from deep within the planet pushed toward the surface, cooled and solidified, and was later exposed by erosion. In the other, smaller lava flows streamed at the surface.</p>

<h3>Seeking signs of ancient life</h3>



<p>X-ray spectrometry of an abraded rock from the floor of the Jezero crater offers clues to the rock&#8217;s chemistry. These and other data can help scientists in the search for ancient life.</p>

<p>Sometime after these events, water flowed from the nearby highlands into the crater to form a lake tens of meters deep and lasting tens of thousands of years at least, according to some team members. Percy’s instruments have revealed the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2196" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways that water altered the igneous rocks</a>: For example, scientists have found sulfates and other minerals that require water to form, and they’ve seen empty pits within the rocks’ cracks, where water would have washed away material. As that water flowed down the rivers into the lake, it deposited silt and mud, forming the delta. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flooding delivered 1.5-meter-wide boulders</a> from that distant terrain. All of these events preceded the drying of the lake, which might have happened about 3&nbsp;billion years ago.</p>



<p>Core samples, which Perseverance is collecting and storing on board for eventual return to Earth, could provide dates for when the igneous rocks formed, as well as when the Martian surface became parched. During the time between, Lake Jezero and other wet environments may have been stable enough for microbial life to start and survive.</p>



<p>“Nailing down the geologic time scale is of critical importance for us understanding Mars as a habitable world,” Stack Morgan says. “And we can’t do that without samples to date.”</p>



<p>About a year after landing on Mars, Perseverance rolled several kilometers across the crater floor to the delta front — where it encountered a very different geology.</p>



<h4>The delta might hold signs of ancient life</h4>



<p>Deltas mark standing, lasting bodies of water — stable locales that could support life. Plus, as a delta grows over time, it traps and preserves organic matter.</p>



<p>Sand and silt deposited where a river hits a lake get layered into sedimentary material, building up a fan-shaped delta. “If you have any biological material that is trapped between that sediment, it gets buried very quickly,” says Mars geologist Eva Scheller of MIT, a researcher with the Percy team. “It creates this environment that is very, very good for preserving the organic matter.”</p>



<p>While exploring the delta front between April 2022 and December 2022, Perseverance found some of the sedimentary rocks it was after.</p>

<p>Several of the rover’s instruments zoomed in on the textures and shapes of the rocks, while other instruments collected detailed spectral information, revealing the elements present in those rocks. By combining the data, researchers can piece together what the rocks are made of and what processes might have changed them over the eons. It’s this chemistry that could reveal signs of ancient Martian life — biosignatures. Scientists are still in the early stages of these analyses.</p>



<p>There won’t be one clear-cut sign of life, Allwood says. Instead, the rover would more likely reveal “an assemblage of characteristics,” with evidence slowly building that life once existed there.</p>



<p>Chemical characteristics suggestive of life are most likely to hide in sedimentary rocks, like those Perseverance has studied at the delta front. Especially interesting are rocks with extremely fine-grained mud. Such mud sediments, Horgan says, are where — in deltas on Earth, at least — organic matter is concentrated. So far, though, the rover hasn’t found those muddy materials.</p>



<p>But the sedimentary rocks studied have revealed carbonates, sulfates and unexpected salts — all <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">materials indicating interaction with water</a> and important for life as we know it. Percy has found carbon-based matter in every rock it has abraded, Horgan says.</p>



<p>“We’ve had some really interesting results that we’re pretty excited to share with the community,” Horgan says about the exploration of the delta front. Some of those details may be revealed in March at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.</p>



<h4>Perseverance leaves samples for a future mission</h4>



<p>As of early February, Perseverance <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-rock-samples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has collected 18&nbsp;samples</a>, including bits of Mars debris and cores from rocks, and stored them on board in sealed capsules for eventual return to Earth. The samples come from the crater floor, delta front rocks and even the thin Martian atmosphere.</p>



<p>In the final weeks of 2022 and the first weeks of 2023, the rover dropped — or rather, carefully set down — half of the collected samples, as well as a tube that would reveal whether samples contained any earthly contaminants. These captured pieces of Mars are now sitting at the front of the delta, at a predetermined spot called the Three Forks region.</p>

If the rover isn’t operable when a future mission arrives at Mars, the samples can still be collected and returned to Earth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3121933">JPL-CALTECH/NASA, MSSS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If Perseverance isn’t functioning well enough to hand over its onboard samples when a future sample-return spacecraft arrives, that mission will collect these samples from the drop site to bring back to Earth.</p>



<p>Researchers are currently working on designs for a joint Mars mission between NASA and the European Space Agency that could retrieve the samples. Launching in the late 2020s, it would land near the Perseverance rover. Percy would transfer the samples to a small rocket to be launched from Mars and returned to Earth in the 2030s. Lab tests could then confirm what Perseverance is already uncovering and discover much more. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Percy is climbing up the delta</a> to explore its top, where muddy sedimentary rocks may still be found. The next target is the edge of the once-lake, where shallow water long ago stood. This is the site Williford is most excited about. Much of what we know about the history of how life has evolved on Earth comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-vertebrates-earth-arose-shallow-coastal-waters">environments with shallow water</a>, he says. “That’s where really rich, underwater ecosystems start to form,” he says. “There’s so much going on there chemically.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-limbs-ants-locomotion">This robot automatically tucks its limbs to squeeze through spaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inspired by how ants move through narrow spaces by shortening their legs, scientists have built a robot that draws in its limbs to navigate constricted passages.</p>



<p>The robot was able to hunch down and walk quickly through passages <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202200258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that were narrower and shorter than itself</a>, researchers report January 20 in <em>Advanced Intelligent System</em>s. It could also climb over steps and move on grass, loose rock, mulch and crushed granite.</p>



<p>Such generality and adaptability are the main challenges of legged robot locomotion, says robotics engineer Feifei Qian, who was not involved in the study. Some robots have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/four-legged-robot-hints-how-ancient-tetrapods-walked">specialized limbs</a> to move over a particular terrain, but they cannot squeeze into small spaces (<em>SN: 1/16/19</em>).</p>





<p>“A design that can adapt to a variety of environments with varying scales or stiffness is a lot more challenging, as trade-offs between the different environments need to be considered,” says Qian, of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>For inspiration, researchers in the new study turned to ants. “Insects are really <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-robots-could-learn-fire-ants">a neat inspiration for designing robot systems</a> that have minimal actuation but can perform a multitude of locomotion behaviors,” says Nick Gravish, a roboticist at the University of California, San Diego (<em>SN: 8/16/18</em>). Ants adapt their posture to crawl through tiny spaces. And they aren’t perturbed by uneven terrain or small obstacles. For example, their legs collapse a bit when they hit an object, Gravish says, and the ants continue to move forward quickly.</p>



<p>Gravish and colleagues built a short, stocky robot — about 30 centimeters wide and 20 centimeters long — with four wavy, telescoping limbs. Each limb consists of six nested concentric tubes that can draw into each other. What’s more, the limbs do not need to be actively powered or adjusted to change their overall length. Instead, springs that connect the leg segments automatically allow the legs to contract when the robot navigates a narrow space and stretch back out in an open space. The goal was to build mechanically intelligent structures rather than algorithmically intelligent robots.</p>



<p>“It’s likely faster than active control, [which] requires the robot to first sense the contact with the environment, compute the suitable action and then send the command to its motors,” Qian says, about these legs. Removing the sensing and computing components can also make the robots small, cheap and less power hungry.</p>



<p>The robot could modify its body width and height to achieve a larger range of body sizes than other similar robots. The leg segments contracted into themselves to let the robot wiggle through small tunnels and sprawled out when under low ceilings. This adaptability let the robot squeeze into spaces as small as 72 percent its full width and 68 percent its full height.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Like ants, a new type of robot can contract its legs to move through narrow spaces and hunch down to traverse spaces shorter than itself. It can also climb over steps and move on grass and loose rock.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Next, the researchers plan to actively control the stiffness of the springs that connect the leg segments to tune the motion to terrain type without consuming too much power. “That way, you can keep your leg long when you are moving on open ground or over tall objects, but then collapse down to the smallest possible shape in confined spaces,” Gravish says.</p>





<p>Such small-scale, minimal robots are easy to produce and can be quickly tweaked to explore complex environments. However, despite being able to walk across different terrains, these robots are, for now, too fragile for search-and-rescue, exploration or biological monitoring, Gravish says.</p>



<p>The new robot takes a step closer to those goals, but getting there will take more than just robotics, Qian says. “To actually achieve these applications would require an integration of design, control, sensing, planning and hardware advancement.”</p>



<p>But that’s not Gravish’s interest. Instead, he wants to connect these experiments back to what was observed in the ants originally and use the robots to ask more questions about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-robot-pigeon-can-bend-wings-like-real-bird">the rules of locomotion in nature</a> (<em>SN: 1/16/20</em>). </p>



<p>“I really would like to understand how small insects are able to move so rapidly across certain unpredictable terrain,” he says. “What is special about their limbs that enables them to move so quickly?”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593492307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Climate Book</a><br><em>Greta Thunberg</em><br><em>Penguin Press, $30</em></p>



<p>The best shot we have at minimizing the future impacts of climate change is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since the Industrial Revolution began, humankind has already raised the average global temperature by about 1.1 degrees. If we continue to emit greenhouse gases at the current rate, the world will probably surpass the 1.5-degree threshold by the end of the decade.</p>



<p>That sobering fact makes clear that climate change isn’t just a problem to solve someday soon; it’s an emergency to respond to now. And yet, most people don’t act like we’re in the midst of the greatest crisis humans have ever faced — not politicians, not the media, not your neighbor, not myself, if I’m honest. That’s what I realized after finishing <em>The Climate Book</em> by Greta Thunberg.</p>





<p>The urgency to act now, to kick the addiction to fossil fuels, practically jumps off the page to punch you in the gut. So while not a pleasant read — it’s quite stressful — it’s a book I can’t recommend enough. The book’s aim is not to convince skeptics that climate change is real. We’re well past that. Instead, it’s a wake-up call for anyone concerned about the future.</p>



<p>A collection of bite-size essays, <em>The Climate Book</em> provides an encyclopedic overview of all aspects of the climate crisis, including the basic science, the history of denialism and inaction, and what to do next. Thunberg, who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/youth-climate-change-activists-heat-waves-top-science-stories-2019-yir">became the face of climate activism</a> after starting the Fridays For Future protests as a teenager (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>), assembles an all-star roster of experts to write the essays.</p>



<p>The first two sections of the book lay out how a small amount of warming can have major, far-reaching effects. For some readers, this will be familiar territory. But as each essay builds on the next, it becomes clear just how delicate Earth’s climate system is. What also becomes clear is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">the significance of 1.5 degrees</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). Beyond this point, scientists fear, various aspects of the natural world might reach tipping points that usher in irreversible changes, even if greenhouse gas emissions are later brought under control. Ice sheets could melt, raise sea levels and drown coastal areas. The Amazon rainforest could become a dry grassland.</p>



<p>The cumulative effect would be a complete transformation of the climate. Our health and the livelihood of other species and entire ecosystems would be in danger, the book shows. Not surprisingly, essay after essay ends with the same message: We must cut greenhouse gas emissions, now and quickly.</p>



<p>Repetition is found elsewhere in the book. Numerous essays offer overlapping scientific explanations, stats about emissions, historical notes and thoughts about the future. Rather than being tedious, the repetition reinforces the message that we know what the climate change threat is, we know how to tackle it and we’ve known for a long time.</p>





<p>Thunberg’s anger and frustration over the decades of inaction, false starts and broken pledges are palpable in her own essays that run throughout the book. The world has known about human-caused climate change for decades, yet about half of all human-related carbon dioxide emissions ever released have occurred since 1990. That’s the year <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/global-warming-politics-muddle-policy">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its first report</a> and just two years before world leaders met in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to sign the first international treaty to curb emissions (<em>SN: 6/23/90</em>).</p>



<p>Perversely, the people who will bear the brunt of the extreme storms, heat waves, rising seas and other impacts of climate change are those who are least culpable. The richest 10 percent of the world’s population accounts for half of all carbon dioxide emissions while the top 1 percent emits more than twice as much as the bottom half. But because of a lack of resources, poorer populations are the least equipped to deal with the fallout. “Humankind has not created this crisis,” Thunberg writes, “it was created by those in power.”</p>



<p>That injustice must be confronted and accounted for as the world addresses climate change, perhaps even through reparations, Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, a philosopher at Georgetown University, argues in one essay.</p>



<p>So what is the path forward? Thunberg and many of her coauthors are generally skeptical that new tech alone will be our savior. Carbon capture and storage, or CCS, for example, has been heralded as one way to curb emissions. But less than a third of the roughly 150 planned CCS projects that were supposed to be operational by 2020 are up and running. </p>



<p>Progress has been impeded by expenses and technology fails, science writer Ketan Joshi explains. An alternative might be “rewilding,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kenya-mangrove-trees-forest-carbon-storage-climate">restoring damaged mangrove forests</a>, seagrass meadows and other ecosystems that naturally suck CO<sub>2</sub> out of the air (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>), suggest environmental activists George Monbiot and Rebecca Wrigley.</p>



<p>Fixing the climate problem will not only require transforming our energy and transportation systems, which often get the most attention, but also our economies (endless growth is not sustainable), political systems and connection to nature and with each other, the book’s authors argue.</p>



<p>The last fifth of the book lays out how we could meet this daunting challenge. What’s needed is a critical mass of individuals who are willing to make lifestyle changes and be heard. This could trigger a social movement strong enough to force politicians to listen and create systemic and structural change. In other words, it’s time to start acting like we’re in a crisis. Thunberg doesn’t end the book by offering hope. Instead, she argues we each have to make our own hope.</p>



<p>“To me, hope is not something that is given to you, it is something you have to earn, to create,” she writes. “It cannot be gained passively, through standing by and waiting for someone else to do something. Hope is taking action.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glassy-eyes-young-crustaceans-predators">Glassy eyes may help young crustaceans hide from predators in plain sight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fledgling crustaceans have eyes like the sea, a peculiarity that could help them hide from predators.</p>



<p>Young shrimp, crab or lobster larvae already rock nearly translucent bodies to stay out of view. But dark eye pigments essential for vision pose the risk of exposing the animals anyway.</p>



<p>Some see-through ocean animals rely on mirrored irises or minuscule eyes to avoid detection. Young shrimp and prawns, on the other hand, camouflage their dark pigments behind light-reflecting <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glass made of tiny, crystalline spheres</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Variations in the size and placement of the orbs allow the crustaceans’ eyes to shine light that precisely matches the color of the surrounding water, possibly rendering them invisible to predators on the hunt for a meal. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Technologies that mimic the nanospheres’ structure could one day inspire more efficient solar energy or bio-friendly paints, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“I’ve often wondered what’s going on with [these animals&#8217;] eyeshine,” says evolutionary biologist Heather Bracken-Grissom of Florida International University in Miami, who was not involved in the study. She and colleagues often collect crustaceans from the deep sea, giving them nicknames like “blue-eyed arthropod” or “green-eyed, weird-looking shrimp” because the creatures don’t resemble their adult forms. Now, she says, that eye color makes sense.</p>



<p>In the study, chemist Keshet Shavit and colleagues used an electron microscope to peer into the eyes of lab-raised and wild crustaceans. Inside shrimp and prawn eyes, the team found crystalline nanospheres made of isoxanthopterin, a molecule that reflects light.</p>



<p>The spheres are a bit like disco balls, with highly reflective surfaces pointing outward, says study coauthor Benjamin Palmer, a chemist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer-Sheva, Israel. Each sphere is made of thin, isoxanthopterin plates that stick together to form balls that range in size from around 250 to 400 nanometers in diameter.</p>



<p>These balls are arranged in clusters at the base of protein-dense cones that focus light on the animal’s light-sensing nerves, and form a protective cover over the pigmented cells. But crustacean larvae can still see because there are small holes in the glass, Palmer says. “It’s basically allowing light to go down to the retina on some specific angles, but on other angles, it’s reflecting light back.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>The size and order of the spheres seem to influence the color of the reflected light, the team’s observations and computer simulations show.</p>



<p>“The correlation between the particle size and the eyeshine color is beyond amazing,” says Shavit, also at Ben-Gurion University. Nanosphere size appears to help the animals’ eyes match the color of their native habitat, helping the critters blend into the background. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Blue-eyed shrimp that inhabit the Gulf of Aqaba’s clear blue waters off the coast of Israel, for instance, have spheres that are approximately 250 to 325 nanometers in diameter. The 400-nanometer-wide spheres of a freshwater prawn (<em>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</em>)<em> </em>glitter yellow-green, mimicking muddy waters found in the salty estuaries where they live.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="256" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623eg_crustacean-eye-camo_inline.jpg" alt="The color reflected from the eyes of some crustacean larvae (top) is linked to the size of isoxanthopterin nanoparticles that make up glass nanospheres (bottom) in the eyes.

Shavit</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The prawn’s eyes also seem to be able to reflect different colors in different environments. Individuals exposed to sunlight for four hours in the lab had silvery yellow eyes, possibly a result of nanospheres arranged in a disorganized jumble. But individuals left in the dark overnight had green eyes. Their nanospheres are arranged in layers — though the orbs within each layer are still disorganized, Palmer says.</p>



<p>Such adaptable eyes could help larvae move undetected through different parts of the ocean as changing light levels alter the color of the water, Bracken-Grissom says. At night, young crustaceans migrate to shallow waters to feed and dive back down when the sun rises. “If they are in fact using it as a form of camouflage, it would be an ingenious way to camouflage themselves as they move through these different light environments.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelics-improve-mental-health-nerve-cells">Psychedelics may improve mental health by getting inside nerve cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Psychedelics go beneath the cell surface to unleash their potentially therapeutic effects.</p>



<p>These drugs are showing promise in clinical trials as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelic-drugs-treatment-mental-health-disorders-depression">treatments for mental health disorders</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/21</em>). Now, scientists might know why. These substances <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can get inside nerve cells in the cortex</a> — the brain region important for consciousness — and tell the neurons to grow, researchers report in the Feb. 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Several mental health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are tied to chronic stress, which degrades neurons in the cortex over time. Scientists have long thought that repairing the cells could provide therapeutic benefits, like lowered anxiety and improved mood.</p>





<p>Psychedelics — including psilocin, which comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psilocybin-treat-depression-mushrooms-psychedelic">magic mushrooms</a>, and LSD — do that repairing by promoting the growth of nerve cell branches that receive information, called dendrites (<em>SN: 11/17/20</em>). The behavior might explain the drugs’ positive outcomes in research. But how they trigger cell growth was a mystery.</p>



<p>It was already known that, in cortical neurons, psychedelics activate a certain protein that receives signals and gives instructions to cells. This protein, called the 5-HT2A receptor, is also stimulated by serotonin, a chemical made by the body and implicated in mood. But a study in 2018 determined that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serotonin doesn’t make these neurons grow</a>. That finding “was really leaving us scratching our heads,” says chemical neuroscientist David Olson, director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics at the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>To figure out why these two types of chemicals affect neurons differently, Olson and colleagues tweaked some substances to change how well they activated the receptor. But those better equipped to turn it on didn’t make neurons grow. Instead, the team noticed that “greasy” substances, like LSD, that easily pass through cells’ fatty outer layers resulted in neurons branching out.</p>



<p>Polar chemicals such as serotonin, which have unevenly distributed electrical charges and therefore can’t get into cells, didn’t induce growth. Further experiments showed that most cortical neurons’ 5-HT2A receptors are located inside the cell, not at the surface where scientists have mainly studied them.</p>



<p>But once serotonin gained access to the cortical neurons’ interior — via artificially added gateways in the cell surface — it too led to growth. It also induced antidepressant-like effects in mice. A day after receiving a surge in serotonin, animals whose brain cells contained unnatural entry points didn’t give up as quickly as normal mice when forced to swim. In this test, the longer the mice tread water, the more effective an antidepressant is predicted to be, showing that inside access to 5-HT2A receptors is key for possible therapeutic effects. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It seems to overturn a lot about what we think should be true about how these drugs work,” says neuroscientist Alex Kwan of Cornell University, who was not involved in the study. “Everybody, including myself, thought that [psychedelics] act on receptors that are on the cell surface.”</p>





<p>That’s where most receptors that function like 5-HT2A are found, says biochemist Javier González-Maeso of the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who was also not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Because serotonin can’t reach 5-HT2A receptors inside typical cortical neurons, Olson proposes that the receptors might respond to a different chemical made by the body. “If it’s there, it must have some kind of role,” he says. DMT, for example, is a naturally occurring psychedelic made by plants and animals, including humans, and can reach a cell’s interior.</p>



<p>Kwan disagrees. “It’s interesting that psychedelics can act on them, but I don’t know if the brain necessarily needs to use them when performing its normal function.” Instead, he suggests that the internal receptors might be a reserve pool, ready to replace those that get degraded on the cell surface.</p>



<p>Either way, understanding the cellular mechanisms behind psychedelics’ potential therapeutic effects could help scientists develop safer and more effective treatments for mental health disorders.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, I hope this leads to better medicines,” Olson says. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Setting sail into a plastic sea</strong> —<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environment-190"><em>Science News</em></a>, February 10, 1973</p>



<p>Scientists on an oceanographic voyage in the Central North Pacific last August became startled about the number of manmade objects littering the ocean surface. [Far from civilization and shipping lanes], they recorded 53 manmade objects in 8.2&nbsp;hours of viewing. More than half were plastic. They go on to compute that there are between 5 million and 35&nbsp;million plastic bottles adrift in the North Pacific.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is larger now than it was in 1973, containing an estimated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-pacific-garbage-patch-new-size-estimates">1.8 trillion pieces of plastic</a> within an area twice the size of Texas (<em>SN Online: 3/22/18</em>). In recent years, marine biologists have started seeing evidence that garbage is disrupting ocean ecosystems. For instance, large pieces of trash have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heres-breakdown-animals-crossed-pacific-2011-tsunami-debris">helped species cross into new territories</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/17, p. 32</em>). But an even greater threat may lurk beneath the waves. Tiny bits of plastic concentrate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">hundreds of meters deep</a> where they can be eaten by filter feeders and potentially make their way into the guts of larger predators (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 5</em>).</p>

<p>A university investigation in Hong Kong found that a professor used the email account of a former student to conduct all the correspondence needed to edit special issues of two journals, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two special issues, which were published last year, are full of articles with the hallmarks of paper mills, said Dorothy Bishop, an Oxford psychologist and scientific sleuth who flagged the matter to the institution involved in the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last November, Bishop emailed the president of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) with the information that Kaifa Zhao, a PhD student at the university, was listed as the lead editor for two special issues of the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em> and <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, </em>both journals published by Hindawi. The nearly 300 articles in the special issues were “mostly meaningless gobbledegook” that suggested they came from a paper mill, she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The episode is the latest of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/27/disbelief-researchers-watch-out-for-this-new-scam-involving-journal-special-issues/">many</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/14/journal-run-by-new-ama-president-elect-caught-in-special-issue-scam/">problems</a> involving <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">questionable</a> peer review of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">special issues</a> – and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/06/publisher-retracts-400-papers-at-once-for-violations-of-peer-review-process-policies/">subsequent</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">retractions</a> – we’ve covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126561"></span>



<p>“There is no question that whoever is letting these fraudulent papers into the literature is guilty of serious academic fraud,” Bishop wrote, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. “The only possible defense that I can imagine is if Mr Zhao Kaifa is a victim of identity theft.”</p>



<p>According to the university’s response to Bishop, that’s indeed what happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">PolyU’s Department of Computing convened a panel to meet with Zhao and his supervisor 10 days after receiving Bishop’s email. In the meeting, Zhao said that Yizhang Jiang, one of the supervisors of his master’s degree studies at Jiangnan University in Wuxi, China, “borrowed” his Hindawi journal account and PolyU email account and passwords and used them to edit the special issues. It’s unclear why he did so.</p>



<p>“According to Mr Zhao, he was not aware of relevant emails from Hindawi and has never responded to emails that are related to the two special issues,” a university staffer wrote to Bishop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university contacted Jiang, who confirmed that he had been “managing” Zhao’s accounts. The researcher said that Zhao did not know he was named an editor of the journal special issues until Bishop’s emails. Both Zhao and Jiang told the university that Zhao didn’t receive any payments related to the special issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for consequences, the university’s email stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The panel reminded Mr Zhao regarding proper use of his email account and personal data protection in the meeting. Mr Zhao admitted and understood that he should not have shared information of his PolyU account email and password with others.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email also said that the department would refer the matter to the university’s IT office “to further investigate if Mr. Zhao has been involved in any misconduct related to these two journal special issues through the usage of his PolyU email account, and will consider proper penalty to be imposed onto the student.”</p>



<p>Neither Zhao nor Jiang has responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We reached out to Hindawi for comment on PolyU’s findings, as well as the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Advanced+Big+Data+Analysis+Technologies+for+Environmental+Monitoring+Data%22%2C">PubPeer</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22BCI-based+Mobile+Computing+in+the+Internet+of+Medical+Things%22">posts</a> about papers in the two special issues, &#8220;<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/si/870528/">Advanced Big Data Analysis Technologies for Environmental Monitoring Data</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/si/736482/">BCI-based Mobile Computing in the Internet of Medical Things</a>.&#8221; A spokesperson replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are investigating these papers and will take appropriate action on the articles and author in question.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The whole thing is a huge mess,” Bishop told us when we asked for her take on the situation.&nbsp;She continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My personal view is that where we have editor of a special issue that contains clearly weird content – with inappropriate citations, gobbledegook text, content that is way off topic – then the default assumption should be that the editor is working for a paper mill and all content of the special issue is suspect and needs to be retracted. If more evidence is needed, it should be obtained from the peer review record – my guess is that this would reveal superficial and very rapid reviews that totally fail to engage with the content (such as it is) and may come from reviewers with fake email addresses.</p>



<p>Instead, we seem to have a system where the publisher is slowly going through articles one at a time, checking with the authors and editors (who may be using fake email addresses from paper mills, and so can slow things down by delayed replies or silence), and using a very high bar of evidence for retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Separately, last October Bishop contacted the <a href="https://doaj.org/about/">Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)</a>, an index of journals that publish papers without paywalls, about Hindawi titles on its list with paper mill content. One of those journals was the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em>, for which Zhao had appeared to edit a special issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bishop told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I think DOAJ, and indeed other indices, could play an important role in delisting journals found to have more than a minimal level of paper mill content, as this would remove the value to those placing articles there.</p>



<p>The only issue then is the collateral damage to honest authors who have published in those journals – I’m sure these do exist, and it is very unfortunate that they will find themselves&nbsp; published in a journal that has a tainted reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Within a few days of Bishop’s email, a DOAJ staffer told her by email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We would be happy to work with you and other members of the research community to be able to identify these problems sooner, remove offending journals from DOAJ and try to ensure these practices are eliminated as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, months later, no Hindawi journals seem to have been removed from DOAJ’s index. Bishop said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I always hope organisations will act more quickly than they do, but I think DOAJ behaved reasonably, but were perhaps too trusting that Hindawi would take the initiative in getting paper mill content removed quickly.&nbsp; To my mind the key question is whether DOAJ will now act quickly to suspend from the register the journals that have been identified as having a very large number of PubPeer comments by paper mill sleuths.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about Consciousness and Information Theory based on selection of 3 papers. For more information, please see the list of papers and an abstract below.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper presents Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness 3.0, which
incorporates several advances over previous formulations. IIT starts from phenomenological
axioms: information says that each experience is specific - it is what it is by how it
differs from alternative experiences; integration says that it is unified - irreducible to
non-interdependent components; exclusion says that it has unique borders and a particular
spatio-temporal grain. These axioms are formalized into postulates that prescribe how
physical mechanisms, such as neurons or logic gates, must be configured to generate
experience (phenomenology). The postulates are used to define intrinsic information as
&quot;differences that make a difference&quot; within a system, and integrated information as
information specified by a whole that cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts. By
applying the postulates both at the level of individual mechanisms and at the level of
systems of mechanisms, IIT arrives at an identity: an experience is a maximally
irreducible conceptual structure (MICS, a constellation of concepts in qualia space), and
the set of elements that generates it constitutes a complex. According to IIT, a MICS
specifies the quality of an experience and integrated information Φ_Max its quantity.
From the theory follow several results, including: a system of mechanisms may condense
into a major complex and non-overlapping minor complexes; the concepts that specify the
quality of an experience are always about the complex itself and relate only indirectly to
the external environment; anatomical connectivity influences complexes and associated
MICS; a complex can generate a MICS even if its elements are inactive; simple systems can
be minimally conscious; complicated systems can be unconscious; there can be true
&quot;zombies&quot; - unconscious feed-forward systems that are functionally equivalent to conscious
complexes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-fossil-leaves-fold-insect-bites">Insect bites in plant fossils reveal leaves could fold shut millions of years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>As early as 252 million years ago, some plants may have curled up their leaves at night for a cozy “sleep.”</p>



<p>Fossilized leaves of two now-extinct <em>Gigantonoclea</em> species bear signs of nyctinasty, or circadian rhythmic folding at night, researchers report February 15 in <em>Current Biology</em>. That would make these specimens the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.12.043" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first known fossilized examples of this curious plant behavior</a>, the team says.</p>



<p>The two leaf fossils were discovered in a rock layer in southwestern China that dates to between 259 million and 252 million years ago. In both species, the leaves were broad, with serrated edges. But most curiously, they bear oddly symmetrical holes.</p>

<p>Insects made those holes while feeding on the leaves while they were folded, say paleontologist Zhuo Feng of Yunnan University in Kunming, China and colleagues. Similar symmetrical patterns of insect damage in leaf fossils can be used to distinguish folding behavior from leaves that might have shriveled as the plant died, the team says.</p>



<p>Modern plants, including many in the legume family such as the orchid tree, that fold and unfold their leaves use specialized cells called pulvinus cells, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-muscles-fold-mimosa-leaf">which act somewhat like muscles</a> (<em>SN: 2/3/23</em>). By shifting water from one part of the leaf to another, the cells can bloat or deflate, allowing the leaves to fold or curl. </p>



<p>These cells would be at the base of the leaves, which weren’t preserved in the fossils, so it’s not possible to say whether these ancient plants also had pulvinus cells, the team says. Although it&#8217;s also hard to prove this was nighttime behavior, the leaves would also have had to be folded long enough for insects to do their munching. But the find does suggest that such leaf folding emerged independently in different plant lineages: Nearly all the modern plants that do this are angiosperms, or flowering plants. But <em>Gigantonoclea</em> plants were gymnosperms, seed-producing plants such as conifers and ginkgos.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">Rapid melting is eroding vulnerable cracks in Thwaites Glacier’s underbelly</a></h4>

              
                <p>Antarctica’s most vulnerable climate hot spot is a remote and hostile place — a narrow sliver of seawater, beneath a slab of floating ice more than half a kilometer thick. Scientists have finally explored it, and uncovered something surprising.</p>



<p>“The melt rate is much weaker than we would have thought, given how warm the ocean is,” says Peter Davis, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge who was part of the team that drilled a narrow hole into this nook and lowered instruments into it. The finding might seem like good news — but it isn’t, he says. “Despite those low melt rates, we’re still seeing rapid retreat” as the ice vanishes faster than it’s being replenished.</p>





<p>Davis and about 20 other scientists conducted this research at Thwaites Glacier, a massive conveyor belt of ice about 120 kilometers wide, which flows off the coastline of West Antarctica. Satellite measurements show that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-glaciers-antarctica-pine-island-melting-climate-change-global-warming">Thwaites is losing ice more quickly</a> than at any time in the last few thousand years (<em>SN: 6/9/22</em>). It <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/5187/2021/tc-15-5187-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has accelerated its flow into the ocean by at least 30 percent</a> since 2000, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL082182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemorrhaging over 1,000 cubic kilometers of ice</a> — accounting for roughly half of the ice lost from all of Antarctica.</p>



<p>Much of the current ice loss is driven by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-thwaites-glacier-under-ice-shelf-risks-warm-water">warm, salty ocean currents</a> that are destabilizing the glacier at its grounding zone — the crucial foothold, about 500 meters below sea level at the drilling location, where the ice lifts off its bed and floats (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, this first-ever look at the glacier’s underbelly near the grounding zone shows that the ocean is attacking it in previously unknown and troubling ways.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A glacier’s underbelly</h3>



<p>Thwaites Glacier and most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet sit on a gravelly bed that is hundreds of meters below sea level — making the ice vulnerable to warm, salty ocean currents that hug the seafloor. Thwaites is especially vulnerable because parts of its grounding zone (where it lifts off its bed and floats on the ocean) sit as far as 1 kilometer below sea level, exposing it to the warmest water.</p>

<p>When the researchers sent a remote-operated vehicle, or ROV, down the borehole and into the water below, they found that much of the melting is concentrated in places where the glacier is already under mechanical stress — within massive cracks called basal crevasses. These openings slice up into the underside of the ice.</p>



<p>Even a small amount of melting at these weak spots could inflict a disproportionately large amount of structural damage on the glacier, the researchers report in two papers published February 15 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>These results are “a bit of a surprise,” says Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not part of the team. Thwaites and other glaciers are monitored mostly with satellites, which make it appear that thinning and melting happen uniformly under the ice.</p>



<p>As the world continues to warm due to human-caused climate change, the shrinking glacier itself has the potential to raise global sea level by 65 centimeters over a period of centuries. Its collapse would also destabilize the remainder of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, triggering an eventual three meters of global sea level rise.</p>



<p>With these new results, Scambos says, “we’re seeing in much more detail processes that will be important for modeling” how the glacier responds to future warming, and how quickly sea level will rise.</p>



<h4>A cold, thin layer shields parts of Thwaites Glacier’s underside</h4>



<p>Simply getting these observations “is kind of like a moon shot, or even a Mars shot,” Scambos says. Thwaites, like most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, rests on a bed that is hundreds of meters below sea level. The floating front of the glacier, called an ice shelf, extends 15 kilometers out onto the ocean, creating a roof of ice that makes this spot almost entirely inaccessible to humans. “This might represent the pinnacle of exploration” in Antarctica, he says.</p>



<p>These new results stem from a $50 million effort — the <a href="https://thwaitesglacier.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration</a> — conducted by the United States’ National Science Foundation and United Kingdom’s Natural Environment Research Council. The research team, one of eight funded by that collaboration, landed on the snowy, flat expanse of Thwaites in the final days of 2019.</p>



<p>The researchers used a hot water drill to melt a narrow hole, not much wider than a basketball, through more than 500 meters of ice. Below the ice sat a water column that was only 54 meters thick.</p>



<p>When Davis and his colleagues measured the temperature and salinity of that water, they found that most of it was about 2 degrees Celsius above freezing — potentially warm enough to melt 20 to 40 meters of ice per year. But the underside of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05586-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ice seems to be melting at a rate of only 5 meters per year</a>, researchers report in one of the <em>Nature</em> papers. The team calculated the melt rate based on the water’s salinity, which reveals the ratio of seawater, which is salty, to glacial meltwater, which is fresh.</p>



<p>The reason for that slow melt quickly emerged: Just beneath the ice sat a layer of cold, buoyant water, only 2 meters thick, derived from melted ice. “There is pooling of much fresher water at the ice base,” says Davis, and this cold layer shields the ice from warmer water below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those measurements provided a snapshot right at the borehole. Several days after the hole was opened, the researchers began a broader exploration of the unmapped ocean cavity under the ice.</p>



<p>Workers winched a skinny, yellow and black cylinder down the borehole. This ROV, called Icefin, was developed over the last seven years by a team of engineers led by Britney Schmidt, a glaciologist at Cornell University.</p>

<p>Schmidt and her team piloted the craft from a nearby tent, monitoring instruments while she steered the craft with gentle nudges to the buttons of a PlayStation 4 controller. The smooth, mirrorlike ceiling of ice scrolled silently past on a computer monitor — the live video feed piped up through 3½ kilometers of fiber-optic cable.</p>



<p>As Schmidt guided Icefin about 1.6 kilometers upstream from the borehole, the water column gradually tapered, until less than a meter of water separated the ice from the seafloor below. A few fish and shrimplike crustaceans called amphipods flitted among otherwise barren piles of gravel.</p>



<p>This new section of seafloor — revealed as the ice thins, lifts and floats progressively farther inland — had been exposed “for less than a year,” Schmidt says.</p>



<p>Now and then, Icefin skimmed past a dark, gaping cleft in the icy ceiling, a basal crevasse. Schmidt steered the craft into several of these gaps — often over 100 meters wide — and there, she saw something striking.</p>



<h4>Melting of Thwaites&#8217; underbelly is concentrated in deep crevasses</h4>



<p>The vertical walls of the crevasses were scalloped rather than smooth, suggesting a higher rate of melting than that of the flat icy ceiling. And in these places, the video became blurry as the light refracted through vigorously swirling eddies of salty water and freshwater. That turbulent swirling of warm ocean water and cold meltwater is breaking up the cold layer that insulates the ice, pulling warm, salty water into contact with it, the scientists think. <strong></strong></p>



<p>Schmidt’s team calculated that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the walls of the crevasses are melting at rates of up to 43 meters per year</a>, the researchers report in the second <em>Nature</em> paper. The researchers also found rapid melt in other places where the level ceiling of ice is punctuated by short, steep sections.</p>



<p>The greater turbulence and higher melt also appear driven by ocean currents within the crevasses. Each time Schmidt steered Icefin up into a crevasse, the ROV detected streams of water flowing through it, as though the crevasse were an upside-down ditch. These currents moved up to twice as fast as the currents outside of crevasses.</p>



<p>The fact that melting is concentrated in crevasses has huge implications, says Peter Washam, an oceanographer on Schmidt’s team at Cornell: “The ocean is widening these features by melting them faster.”</p>



<p>This could greatly accelerate the years-long process by which some of these cracks propagate hundreds of meters up through the ice until they break through at the top — calving off an iceberg that drifts away. It could cause the floating ice shelf, which presses against an undersea mountain and buttresses the ice behind it, to break apart more quickly than predicted. This, in turn, could cause the glacier to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">spill ice into the ocean more quickly</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). “It’s going to have an impact on the stability of the ice,” Washam says.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This video, captured by a remote-operated vehicle called Icefin, shows the underside of Thwaites Glacier where it flows off the coastline of West Antarctica. Horizontal sections of the ice are smooth, indicating slow melting. But on steep ice surfaces — especially along the walls of deep cracks in the ice — the surfaces are scalloped, suggesting a much higher rate of melt, driven by turbulent swirling of warm, salty ocean water and cold, fresh meltwater. An example of the difference between those two surfaces is clearly visible from 0:11 to 0:13 in the video, when Icefin captures a scalloped vertical surface intersecting with a smooth horizontal one.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These new data will improve scientists’ ability to predict the future retreat of Thwaites and other Antarctic glaciers, says Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who assisted the team by providing satellite measurements of changes in the glacier. “You just cannot guess what the water structure might look like in these zones until you observe it,” he says.</p>



<p>But more work is needed to fully understand Thwaites and how it will further change as the world continues to warm. The glacier consists of two side-by-side fast-moving lanes of ice — one moving 3 kilometers per year, the other about 1 kilometer per year. Due to safety concerns, the team visited the slower lane — which still proved extremely challenging. Rignot says that scientists must eventually visit the fast lane, whose upper surface is more cracked up with crevasses — making it even harder to land aircraft and operate field camps.</p>



<p>The research reported today “is a very important step, but it needs to be followed by a second step,” the investigation of the glacier’s fast lane, he says. “It doesn’t matter how hard it is.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/02/new-policies-address-paper-mills-and-unprofessional-conduct/">New policies address paper mills and unprofessional conduct</a></h4>

              
                <p>Author: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team</p>



<p>On February 1, 2023, PLOS introduced two new policies: one addressing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-manipulation-of-the-publication-process">manipulation of the publication process </a>and the other outlining <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-standards-for-professional-conduct">standards for professional conduct</a>. Here, we provide brief excerpts and information about the policies for which the full text is on our journals&rsquo; Ethical Publishing Practice pages.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Manipulation of the Publication Process</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>&ldquo;PLOS will reject or retract articles suspected of any manipulation of the publication process.&rdquo;</em></p>



<p>Manipulation of the publication process encapsulates a variety of issues currently vexing the publishing industry, such as fabrication and/or sale of content, peer review, or authorship (e.g. via &ldquo;paper mills&rdquo;) and peer review manipulation. Each of these cases can involve 100s of submissions/articles across publishers, posing a large-scale threat to the integrity and reliability of the published record and demanding extensive editorial resources to address. If the problematic content is published, it can have deleterious effects on active research and those affected by applied research, and can also harm public trust in science.</p>



<p>PLOS is taking multiple approaches to strengthen our internal processes so as to better prevent, identify and address these cases. Our new <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-manipulation-of-the-publication-process">Manipulation of the Publication Process policy</a> represents one aspect of this work. It provides authors information about practices and services that should be avoided, states that PLOS will reject or retract articles suspected of any manipulation of the publication process, and explains that we may not disclose details about specific concerns in these cases. These measures are needed to safeguard the integrity of our publications, maintain confidentiality required in multi-manuscript cases, and ensure that bad actors do not obtain information that could be used to evade our checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, this policy supports our teams in taking a hard line in cases where we suspect manipulation of publication cases, even if we do not have concrete, indisputable evidence in hand. We apply editorial judgment in determining whether the cumulative evidence, including circumstantial, supports concerns to a degree that per our internal standards warrants editorial action. We are aware of the serious implications that retractions can have for researchers&rsquo; careers, and we do not take these decisions lightly. While notices we issue in these cases may be brief, they represent extensive bodies of investigative work and careful consideration by our Publication Ethics and journal teams.</p>



<p><strong><em>Standards for Professional Conduct</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&ldquo;<em>PLOS is committed to open scientific communications and professional conduct. We expect that all interactions with PLOS through any medium of communication &hellip; will be courteous, respectful, and adherent to high standards of professionalism</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS works with an expansive network of contributors around the globe, including our internal and external staff, authors, and volunteer editors and reviewers who support peer review. In our publishing activities, we do not always deliver positive news. At times, authors, readers, and other stakeholders may be disappointed by a decision or frustrated by aspects of our processes.</p>



<p>We welcome feedback and questions, and our journals have dedicated appeal processes by which decisions can be challenged. However, we expect all communications to adhere to high standards of professionalism regardless of the circumstances. Unfortunately, this expectation is not always met. In a minority of cases, our teams receive communications that go beyond what can be considered acceptable, for example including personal threats or abusive messages. We have also encountered situations wherein excessively repeated inquiries or resubmissions detract resources from our core publishing functions.</p>



<p>Our new <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-standards-for-professional-conduct">Standards for Professional Conduct policy</a> underscores that such behaviors will not be tolerated, and that PLOS will take steps as needed to support our contributors and resolve these situations. It provides transparency as to PLOS&rsquo; standards for interactions with our teams in the context of their work for PLOS, provides examples of behaviors that we consider unacceptable, and outlines actions we may take in response. While communication and language norms vary around the globe, we consider the expectations of respect and professionalism set in this policy to be universal.</p>



<p><strong><em>Closing remarks</em></strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>As a publisher, we have a duty to ensure the papers we publish are scientifically valid and adhere to the highest standards of research and publication ethics. We take this responsibility very seriously. PLOS has had a specialized publication ethics team since early 2018, and over the past five years we have resolved &gt;1500 cases, publishing ~900 notices to address integrity issues. Policies such as those outlined above are integral to supporting this work, and in line with PLOS&rsquo; commitment to openness the policies also provide transparency as to our standards and the approaches we take to address concerns.</p>



<p><em>If you have concerns about non-compliance with these policies, please contact the relevant journal office for Standards for Professional Conduct issues, or the </em><a href="mailto:pub-ethics@plos.org"><em>PLOS Publication Ethics team</em></a><em> for Manipulation of the Publication Process issues.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icicles-pure-water-salt-ripples">Here’s why icicles made from pure water don’t form ripples</a></h4>

              
                <p>Icicles made from pure water give scientists brain freeze.</p>



<p>In nature, most icicles are made from water with a hint of salt. But lab-made icicles free from salt disobey a prominent theory of how icicles form, and it wasn’t clear why. Now, a study is helping to melt away the confusion.</p>



<p>Natural icicles tend to look like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ripple-effect">skinny cones with rippled surfaces</a> — the result of a thin film of water that coats the ice, researchers think (<em>SN: 11/24/13</em>). As icicles grow, the film freezes. Any preexisting small bumps in the icicle get magnified into large ripples because the water layer is thinner above the bumps and can freeze more readily. But this theory fails to explain the salt-free variety, which have more irregular shapes reminiscent of drippy candles, says physicist Menno Demmenie of the University of Amsterdam.</p>





<p>So Demmenie and colleagues grew icicles in the lab, adding a blue dye that was visible only when the water was liquid. Salted icicles not only had ripples, but they also were covered in a thin, blue film. Icicles made from pure water had no such film. Only small <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.024005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">droplets of blue appeared on those icicles</a>, the team reports in the February <em>Physical Review Applied</em>.</p>



<p>In icicles with salt, the temperature at which the water on the surface freezes is lowered, allowing a liquid layer to coat the entire icicle. Without the salt, icicles must build up drop by drop.</p>

<p>Citing an investigation by Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, two journals last week retracted five articles by <a href="https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/edward-e-whang-md/">Edward Whang</a>, an associate professor of surgery at the school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journals, <em>Oncogene</em> and <em>Surgery</em>, <a href="https://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(23)00008-9/fulltext">both</a> <a href="https://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(23)00009-0/fulltext">refer</a> to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-023-02626-5">problems</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-023-02625-6">with</a> images of Western blots that could not be resolved because &#8220;no underlying research data&#8221; were available, according to the investigation.</p>



<p>Questions have loomed over Whang&#8217;s research <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/12/04/pubpeer-selections-questions-stem-cells-price-shopping-access-charges/">for a decade</a>, and more than 20 of his studies <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=+Edward+Whang">have been flagged</a> on PubPeer for possible image problems. As one commenter <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/28F5B2E923CD97D6F1D58B78A20FE7#1">wrote</a> in 2014 about one of the now-retracted papers, &#8220;It is perhaps fortunate that figure assembly and liver surgery require such unrelated skill sets.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not clear how many of Whang’s papers were affected by the investigation. We reached out to Harvard Medical School for more details, but it declined to share information about the investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126555"></span>



<p>In 2013, the German magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em> quoted a professor at a university there as saying that figures from two separate papers by Whang and his colleagues were sufficiently similar as to justify &#8220;<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/zu-gleich-a-fa24644d-0002-0001-0000-000118184432?context=issue">the suspicion of manipulation</a>.&#8221; Whang conceded the likeness, but said he could &#8220;vouch for the accuracy of the data.&#8221;</p>



<p>That same year, the well-known anonymous tipster writing under the pseudonym <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=clare+francis">Clare Francis</a> alerted Michael Sarr, then an editor of <em>Surgery</em>, to the same problem. After reviewing the papers and concluding that they described &#8220;totally different experiments,&#8221; Sarr <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/what-to-do-about-clare-francis-38704">reportedly replied</a> to the tipster in an email: &#8220;Quite frankly, in the future, unless you wish to point out how these articles are exactly the same and unless you do your research, we (at Surgery) are going to ignore any further claims that you send us.”</p>



<p>A PubPeer commenter later <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/67F00A871ABAE836F7B471C13203F9#5">pointed out</a> that Sarr, an emeritus professor of surgery at Mayo Clinic, had once <a href="https://jamesivassociationsurgeons.com/report_edward_whang_md.php">seconded Whang&#8217;s nomination</a> for a surgical traveling fellowship. Sarr is no longer at <em>Surgery</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a list of the retracted papers, which were published in 2004 and dealt with potential new cancer treatments:</p>

</ul>



<p>(As of this writing, a retraction notice for the last paper has not yet been published &#8220;due to a technical issue,&#8221; according to Springer Nature, the publisher of <em>Oncogene</em>.)</p>



<p>The retraction notices issued by <em>Oncogene</em> on February 9 and 10 state that Whang and one of his coauthors, U.K. surgeon <a href="https://www.markduxbury.info/">Mark Duxbury</a>, did not agree to the retractions. Neither researcher responded to requests for comments from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>A spokesperson from Springer Nature told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We became aware of issues with these papers when Harvard contacted us detailing the outcome of their institutional investigation and requesting the papers be retracted. Following this, the journal Editors and Springer Nature Research Integrity Group investigated and agreed that the papers should be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Springer Nature is not aware of other papers published in its journals that are implicated in the Harvard investigation, the spokesperson added.</p>



<p>A spokesperson from Elsevier, which publishes <em>Surgery</em>, said Harvard contacted them last year following the investigation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After reviewing the materials, the Journal of Surgery [sic] Editors reached out to the corresponding authors and asked for a response. The Editors were not satisfied by the explanation and the papers were retracted at the end of last year. [Editor’s note: The notices are dated Feb. 10 and 11, 2023.]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Harvard Medical School&#8217;s media relations team declined to share the investigation report, but said in an emailed statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-male-giraffes-drink-female-mate-pee">Why male giraffes drink potential mates’ pee</a></h4>

              
                <p>A female giraffe has a great Valentine’s Day gift for potential mates: urine.</p>



<p>Distinctive anatomy helps male giraffes <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/3/354" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get a taste for whether a female is ready to mate</a>, animal behaviorists Lynette and Benjamin Hart report January 19 in <em>Animals</em>. A pheromone-detecting organ in giraffes has a stronger connection to the mouth than the nose, the researchers found. That’s why males scope out which females to mate with by sticking their tongues in a urine stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Animals such as male gazelles will lick fresh urine on the ground to track if females are ready to mate. But giraffes’ long necks and heavy heads make bending over to investigate urine on the ground an unstable and vulnerable position, says Lynette Hart, of the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>The researchers observed giraffes (<em>Giraffa giraffa angolensis</em>) in Etosha National Park in Namibia in 1994, 2002 and 2004. Bull giraffes nudged or kicked the female to ask her to pee. If she was a willing participant, she urinated for a few seconds, while the male took a sip. Then the male curled his lip and inhaled with his mouth, a behavior called a flehmen response, to pull the female’s scent into two openings on the roof of the mouth. From the mouth, the scent travels to the vomeronasal organ, or VNO, which detects pheromones.</p>



<p>The Harts say they never saw a giraffe investigate urine on the ground.</p>



<p>Unlike many other mammals, giraffes have a stronger oral connection — via a duct — to the VNO, than a nasal one, examinations of preserved giraffe specimens showed. One possible explanation for the difference could be that a VNO-nose link helps animals that breed at specific times of the year detect seasonal plants, says Benjamin Hart, a veterinarian also at the University of California, Davis. But giraffes can mate any time of year, so the nasal connection may not matter as much.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-quenched-galaxy">The James Webb telescope spotted the earliest known ‘quenched’ galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has spotted the earliest known galaxy to abruptly stop forming stars.</p>



<p>The galaxy, called GS-9209, <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2301.11413v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quenched its star formation</a> more than 12.5 billion years ago, researchers report January 26 at arXiv.org. That’s only a little more than a billion years after the Big Bang. Its existence reveals new details about how galaxies live and die across cosmic time.</p>



<p>“It’s a remarkable discovery,” says astronomer Mauro Giavalisco of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved in the new study. “We really want to know when the conditions are ripe to make quenching a widespread phenomenon in the universe.” This study shows that at least some galaxies quenched when the universe was young.</p>





<p>GS-9209 was first noticed in the early 2000s. In the last few years, observations with ground-based telescopes identified it as a possible quenched galaxy, based on the wavelengths of light it emits. But Earth’s atmosphere absorbs the infrared wavelengths that could confirm the galaxy’s distance and that its star-forming days were behind it, so it was impossible to know for sure.</p>



<p>So astrophysicist Adam Carnall and colleagues turned to the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST. The observatory is very sensitive to infrared light, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">it’s above the blockade of Earth’s atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>). “This is why JWST exists,” says Carnall, of the University of Edinburgh. JWST also has much greater sensitivity than earlier telescopes, letting it see fainter, more distant galaxies. While the largest telescopes on the ground could maybe see GS-9209 in detail after a month of observing, “JWST can pick this stuff up in a few hours.”</p>



<p>Using JWST observations, Carnall and colleagues found that GS-9209 formed most of its stars during a 200-million-year period, starting about 600 million years after the Big Bang. In that cosmically brief moment, it built about 40 billion solar masses’ worth of stars, about the same as the Milky Way has.</p>



<p>That quick construction suggests that GS-9209 formed from a massive cloud of gas and dust collapsing and igniting stars all at once, Carnall says. “It’s pretty clear that the vast majority of the stars that are currently there formed in this big burst.”</p>



<p>Astronomers used to think this mode of galaxy formation, called monolithic collapse, was the way that most galaxies formed. But the idea has fallen out of favor, replaced by the notion that large galaxies form from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-origins-merger-collision-star-age">slow merging of many smaller ones</a> (<em>SN: 5/17/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Now it looks like, at least for this object, monolithic collapse is what happened,” Carnall says. “This is probably the clearest proof yet that that kind of galaxy evolution happens.”</p>





<p>As to what caused the galaxy’s star-forming frenzy to suddenly stop, the culprit appears to be an actively feeding black hole. The JWST observations detected extra emission of infrared light associated with a rapidly swirling mass of energized hydrogen, which is a sign of an accreting black hole. The black hole appears to be up to a billion times the mass of the sun.</p>



<p>To reach that mass in less than a billion years after the birth of the universe, the black hole must have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-cant-figure-out-why-some-black-holes-got-so-big-so-fast">feeding even faster</a> earlier on in its life, Carnall says (<em>SN: 3/16/18</em>). As it gorged, it would have collected a glowing disk of white-hot gas and dust around it.</p>



<p>“If you have all that radiation spewing out of the black hole, any gas that’s nearby is going to be heated up to an incredible extent, which stops it from falling into stars,” Carnall says.</p>



<p>More observations with future telescopes, like the planned <a href="https://elt.eso.org/instrument/HARMONI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extremely Large Telescope</a> in Chile, could help figure out more details about how the galaxy was snuffed out.</p>

<p>In 2018, when <em>The Lancet</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/07/06/the-final-verdict-lancet-retracts-two-papers-by-macchiarini/">pulled two</a> studies by <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/celebrity-surgeon-nbc-news-producer-scam">once-celebrated</a> transplant surgeon Paolo Macchiarini after he was found <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/25/karolinska-finds-macchiarini-six-other-researchers-guilty-of-misconduct/">guilty of misconduct</a>, we suggested in a post that the journal&#8217;s chapter of the long-running Macchiarini saga was finally over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were wrong.</p>



<p>Last week, the journal<em> </em><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00293-3/fulltext">issued</a> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00292-1/fulltext#bib1">expressions</a> of concern about a pair of papers by the Italian doctor, who is currently on probation after a court in Sweden  <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/disgraced-italian-surgeon-convicted-of-criminal-harm-to-stem-cell-patient">convicted</a> him of causing bodily harm to a patient.</p>



<span id="more-126548"></span>



<p>In the first paper, published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61598-6/fulltext">2008</a>, Macchiarini and his colleagues reported how they implanted a cadaveric windpipe seeded with stem cells into a 30-year-old woman; in the second, from <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62033-4/fulltext#section-7c530872-6235-4433-899c-b3f276970189">2013</a>, they described how the patient fared over the next five years. Despite needing repeated bronchoscopic interventions, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62033-4/fulltext">the authors wrote</a>, she “had a normal social and working life.&#8221;</p>



<p>The research made headlines across the globe. But it did not live up to its promise: Of eight patients who had an artificial windpipe implanted by Macchiarini between 2011 and 2014, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/disgraced-italian-surgeon-convicted-of-criminal-harm-to-stem-cell-patient">seven died following complications</a> from the procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likewise, the woman described in the 2008 report suffered multiple complications, including respiratory failure, and had to have surgery to remove her left lung, according to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30485-4/fulltext">a 2019 <em>Lancet</em> report</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Macchiarini – who has had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMacchiarini%252c%2bPaolo">eight papers retracted</a> – first came to our attention <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/11/26/misconduct-leads-to-retraction-from-italian-super-surgeon-under-house-arrest/">more than a decade ago</a>, when he had a paper retracted in November 2012 “for scientific misconduct for reproducing a table but failing to acknowledge and cite the previous, original work from which it was taken.” At the time, he was reportedly under house arrest for fraud and attempted extortion charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years later, <em>The New York Times</em> revealed that Macchiarini, then at the Karolinska Institutet, was facing <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/12/12/revealed-complaint-lodged-macchiarini-super-surgeon-investigation/">misconduct allegations</a>. The story took numerous twists and turns, particularly in 2016, when filmmakers released a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/12/meet-the-filmmakers-who-cracked-open-the-case-against-star-surgeon-macchiarini/">documentary about the allegations</a> and <em>Vanity Fair</em> published a piece on how the surgeon scammed – in the romantic way – <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/celebrity-surgeon-nbc-news-producer-scam">an NBC News producer</a>.</p>



<p>For years, critics continued to press for investigations, sanctions, and retractions. Last year, a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o498">letter to the editor in <em>The BMJ</em></a> called for the retraction of the case report in <em>The Lancet</em>, noting the journal:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>was informed in May 2018 that the key findings of the article were false. Despite this, and subsequent demands for retraction of the paper by us and others, the Lancet has refused to retract, without providing any explanation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The case report has been cited more than 1,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and the follow-up has garnered 196 citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In its expression of concern from February 8, the journal noted:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Lancet has received continuing questions over the reliability of the findings and conduct of this reported case, since Paolo Macchiarini was found guilty of scientific misconduct in 2018.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) has discussed these concerns at length again and their view, as an expert body in publication ethics, is that these two unretracted articles should, at a minimum, have received an Expression of Concern given the severity of the concerns raised and the length of time during which the concerns have persisted. As members of COPE, we are now following this advice and are issuing an Expression of Concern for these two Articles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Reached for comment in Spain, Macchiarini said he was not aware of the new expressions of concern and did not have time to look at them. &#8220;I&#8217;m doing surgery, so… busy,&#8221; he told Retraction Watch, adding &#8220;I don&#8217;t give interviews.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-teleconnections-droughts-fires">Climate ‘teleconnections’ may link droughts and fires across continents</a></h4>

              
                <p>Large-scale climate patterns that can impact weather across thousands of kilometers may have a hand in synchronizing multicontinental droughts and stoking wildfires around the world, two new studies find.</p>



<p>These profound patterns, known as climate teleconnections, typically occur as recurring phases that can last from weeks to years. “They are a kind of complex butterfly effect, in that things that are occurring in one place have many derivatives very far away,” says Sergio de Miguel, an ecosystem scientist at Spain’s University of Lleida and the Joint Research Unit CTFC-Agrotecnio in Solsona, Spain.</p>





<p>Major droughts arise around the same time at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35531-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drought hot spots</a> around the world, and the world’s major climate teleconnections may be behind the synchronization, researchers report in one study. What’s more, these profound patterns may also regulate the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36052-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scorching of more than half of the area</a> burned on Earth each year, de Miguel and colleagues report in the other study.</p>



<p>The research could help countries around the world forecast and collaborate to deal with widespread drought and fires, researchers say.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-may-make-el-nino-la-nina-less-predictable">El Niño-Southern Oscillation</a>, or ENSO, is perhaps the most well-known climate teleconnection (<em>SN: 8/21/19</em>). ENSO entails phases during which weakened trade winds cause warm surface waters to amass in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, known as El Niño, and opposite phases of cooler tropical waters called La Niña.</p>



<p>These phases influence wind, temperature and precipitation patterns around the world, says climate scientist Samantha Stevenson of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in either study. “If you change the temperature of the ocean in the tropical Pacific or the Atlantic … that energy has to go someplace,” she explains. For instance, a 1982 El Niño caused severe droughts in Indonesia and Australia and deluges and floods in parts of the United States.</p>



<p>Past research has predicted that human-caused climate change will provoke <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40641-018-0093-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more intense droughts</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">worsen wildfire seasons</a> in many regions (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>). But few studies have investigated how shorter-lived climate variations — teleconnections — influence these events on a global scale. Such work could help countries improve forecasting efforts and share resources, says climate scientist Ashok Mishra of Clemson University in South Carolina.</p>



<p>In one of the new studies, Mishra and his colleagues tapped data on drought conditions from 1901 to 2018. They used a computer to simulate the world’s drought history as a network of drought events, drawing connections between events that occurred within three months of each other.</p>



<p>The researchers identified major drought hot spots across the globe — places in which droughts tended to appear simultaneously or within just a few months. These hot spots included the western and midwestern United States, the Amazon, the eastern slope of the Andes, South Africa, the Arabian deserts, southern Europe and Scandinavia.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“When you get a drought in one, you get a drought in others,” says climate scientist Ben Kravitz of Indiana University Bloomington, who was not involved in the study. “If that&#8217;s happening all at once, it can affect things like global trade, [distribution of humanitarian] aid, pollution and numerous other factors.”</p>



<p>A subsequent analysis of sea surface temperatures and precipitation patterns suggested that major climate teleconnections were behind the synchronization of droughts on separate continents, the researchers report January 10 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. El Niño appeared to be the main driver of simultaneous droughts spanning parts of South America, Africa and Australia. ENSO is known to exert a widespread <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-made-southwestern-u-s-drought-worst-1200-years">influence on precipitation patterns</a> (<em>SN: 4/16/20</em>). So that finding is “a good validation of the method,” Kravitz says. “We would expect that to appear.”</p>

<p>In the second study, published January 27 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, de Miguel and his colleagues investigated how climate teleconnections influence the amount of land burned around the world. Researchers knew that the climate patterns can influence the frequency and intensity of wildfires. In the new study, the researchers compared satellite data on <a href="https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global burned area</a> from 1982 to 2018 with data on the strength and phase of the globe’s major climate teleconnections.</p>



<p>Variations in the yearly pattern of burned area strongly aligned with the phases and range of climate teleconnections. In all, these climate patterns regulate about 53 percent of the land burned worldwide each year, the team found. According to de Miguel, teleconnections directly influence the growth of vegetation and other conditions such as aridity, soil moisture and temperature that prime landscapes for fires.</p>



<p>The Tropical North Atlantic teleconnection, a pattern of shifting sea surface temperatures just north of the equator in the Atlantic Ocean, was associated with about one-quarter of the global burned area — making it the most powerful driver of global burning, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>



<p>These researchers are showing that wildfire scars around the world are connected to these climate teleconnections, and that’s very useful, Stevenson says. “Studies like this can help us prepare how we might go about constructing larger scale international plans to deal with events that affect multiple places at once.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protein-3d-maps-toxic-substances-organs">3-D maps of a protein show how it helps organs filter out toxic substances</a></h4>

              
                <p>A close look at one protein shows how it moves molecular passengers into cells in the kidneys, brain and elsewhere.</p>



<p>The protein LRP2 is part of a delivery service, catching certain molecules outside a cell and ferrying them in. Now, 3-D maps of LRP2 <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00046-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867423000466%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal the protein’s structure</a> and how it captures and releases molecules, researchers report February 6 in <em>Cell</em>. The protein adopts a more open shape, like a net, at the near-neutral pH outside cells. But in the acidic environment inside cells, the protein crumples to drop off any passengers.</p>





<p>The shape of LRP2’s structure — and how it enables so many functions — has stumped scientists for decades. The protein helps the kidneys and brain filter out toxic substances, and it operates in other places too, like the lungs and inner ears. When the protein doesn’t function properly, a host of health conditions can occur, including chronic kidney disease and Donnai-Barrow syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and brain.</p>



<p>The various conditions associated with LRP2 dysfunction come from the protein’s numerous responsibilities — it binds to more than 75 different molecules. That’s a huge amount for one protein, earning it the nickname “molecular flypaper,” says nephrologist Jonathan Barasch of Columbia University.</p>



<p>Typically, LRP2 sits at a cell membrane’s surface, waiting to snag a molecule passing by. After the protein binds to a molecule, the cell engulfs the part of its surface containing the protein, forming an internal bubble called an endosome. LRP2 then releases the molecule inside the cell, and the endosome carries the protein back to the surface.</p>



<p>To understand this shuttle system, Barasch and colleagues collected LRP2 from 500 mouse kidneys. The researchers put some of the protein in a solution at the extracellular pH of 7.5, and some in an endosome-mimicking solution at pH 5.2. Using a cryo-electron microscope, they captured images of the proteins and then stitched the images together in a computer, rendering 3-D maps of the protein at both open and closed formations.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This 3-D model of the protein LRP2 shows how it transforms from a more open structure at near-neutral pH outside of a cell to a crumpled-up shape at the acidic pH inside a cell. These pH-driven changes in shape let LRP2 snag molecules outside of a cell and release them inside. Two copies of one protein — one pink and one blue — make up LRP2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers suggest that charged calcium atoms hold the protein open at extracellular pH. But as pH drops due to hydrogen ions flowing into the endosome, the hydrogen ions displace the calcium ions, causing the protein to contract.</p>

<p>More than a year after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/07/introducing-two-sites-that-claim-to-sell-authorships-on-scientific-papers/">we reported on two websites</a> advertising authorships of scientific papers for sale, one of the posted articles has been retracted, while publishers say they are still investigating others.</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00366-020-01246-x">Dynamic simulation of moderately thick annular system coupled with shape memory alloy and multi-phase nanocomposite face sheets</a>,” appeared in the journal <em>Engineering with Computers</em>, a Springer Nature title, in January 2021. The article has been cited 28 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Although the retraction notice doesn’t say as much, the journal’s publisher told us that it removed the article in part due its having been advertised for sale.</p>



<p>After our September 2021 article on the websites selling authorships, the anonymous whistleblower “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/15/a-researcher-with-30-retractions-and-counting-the-whistleblower-speaks/">Artemisia Stricta</a>” identified several papers from a cached version of one of the websites, Teziran.org, and notified the editors and publishers of the journals about the finding.</p>



<span id="more-126540"></span>



<p>In an email to Jessica Zhang, editor-in-chief of <em>Engineering with Computers</em>, and Allison Keene, who was an associate editor at Springer Nature at the time, Artemisia identified the article from the journal that had been posted for sale, and linked to our post. Artemisia wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As I am sure you will agree, the listing of authorship for sale is a major red flag, and, in many cases, is accompanied by outright falsification of the article for scalability of authorship sales.</p>



<p>Are you able to review the point during the review process when the authors were added? If any were added after initial submission, this would be a strong indication of authorship manipulation, which may constitute grounds for retraction.Of course, it is also possible that authorship was sold prior to submission. In any case, I hope that you will investigate this matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article’s first two authors, Haiquan Wang and Hongyan Zhang, are affiliated with Weifang University in China, while the second two, Ramin Dousti and Hamed Safarpour, are affiliated with Isfahan University of Technology and Imam Khomeini International University, respectively, both in Iran. Wang, the paper’s corresponding author, did not respond to Retraction Watch’s request for comment.</p>



<p>In November of last year, the paper was retracted. The retraction notice states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editor in Chief has retracted this article because of significant overlap with a previously-published article by different authors [1] and an article by different authors that was simultaneously under consideration in a different journal [2].</p>



<p>Hamed Safarpour has not explicitly stated whether they agree to this retraction notice. Haiquan Wang, Hongyan Zhang, and Ramin Dousti have not responded to any correspondence from the publisher about this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice’s references point to two articles: “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00366-020-01200-x">Frequency simulation of viscoelastic multi-phase reinforced fully symmetric systems</a>,” published in 2020 in the same journal, and “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263822320330762">On the vibrations of the imperfect sandwich higher-order disk with a lactic core using generalize differential quadrature method</a>,” published in the journal <em>Composite Structures</em> in 2021.</p>



<p>Both papers list as the first author M.S.H. Al-Furjan, who is affiliated with Zhejiang University in China, in addition to several other common co-authors. Many are&nbsp; also listed on three other papers posted on Teziran, two in <em>Composite Structures</em> and another in <em>Engineering with Computers</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to an email inquiry from Retraction Watch, Tim Kersjes, head of Research Integrity, Resolutions at Springer Nature, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We can confirm that this retraction relates to the fact that this article had been listed for sale on Teziran.org and had significant overlap with two other papers.</p>



<p>For paper [sic] that we identify as associated with Teziran.org, we will take editorial action once these investigations are complete and all parties have had a chance to respond.</p>



<p>We continue to actively monitor for articles where their authorship may have been offered for sale and have a zero-tolerance policy regarding these activities. When we identify papers that may have violated our editorial policies, we take all necessary steps to investigate and correct the scientific record, in compliance with COPE guidelines.</p>



<p>We are working with colleagues to develop guidelines and best practice for counteracting cases of authorship sale, which undermine the integrity of and public trust in the scientific record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">None of the other articles Artemisia flagged from our post has been retracted.&nbsp;According to other emails we have seen between Artemisia and editors and publishers of papers that had been posted on Teziran, multiple publishers confirmed they were investigating the matter. The articles have not been marked with expressions of concern or other editorial notes indicating that they are under investigation and may not be reliable. These articles are:</p>

</ul>



<p>Taylor and Francis, the publisher of one of the journals, initially responded to our inquiry that they would get back to us, but have not yet provided any other comment.</p>



<p>In response to an email from Retraction Watch, a spokesperson for Elsevier, the publisher of three of the Teziran articles Artemisia raised concerns about, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The integrity of research is of paramount importance to Elsevier. We have been investigating this matter and will provide an update once our investigations have concluded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an August 2022 response to Artemisia’s inquiry about the Al-Furjan article published in <em>Engineering with Computers</em>, an employee at Springer Nature cited a backlog of cases and lack of author response as reasons the investigation was delayed, writing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Thanks for reaching out, and apologies for my lack of response regarding this concern. Regrettably I have no updates to provide on this investigation at this time. Progress has been delayed by lack of author responses and a large backlog of cases on the part of the SN Research Integrity Group. Please know that the SNRIG and I are looking into this issue, and that I will update you as soon as I’m able.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">A chemical imbalance doesn’t explain depression. So what does?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">You’d be forgiven for thinking that depression has a simple explanation.</p>



<p>The same mantra — that the mood disorder comes from a chemical imbalance in the brain — is repeated in doctors’ offices, medical textbooks and pharmaceutical advertisements. Those ads tell us that depression can be eased by tweaking the chemicals that are off-kilter in the brain. The only problem — and it’s a big one — is that this explanation isn’t true.</p>



<p>The phrase “chemical imbalance” is too vague to be true or false; it doesn’t mean much of anything when it comes to the brain and all its complexity. Serotonin, the chemical messenger often tied to depression, is not the one key thing that explains depression. The same goes for other brain chemicals.</p>





<p>The hard truth is that despite decades of sophisticated research, we still don’t understand what depression is. There are no clear descriptions of it, and no obvious signs of it in the brain or blood.</p>



<p>The reasons we’re in this position are as complex as the disease itself. Commonly used measures of depression, created decades ago, neglect some important symptoms and overemphasize others, particularly among certain groups of people. Even if depression could be measured perfectly, the disorder exists amid myriad levels of complexity, from biological confluences of minuscule molecules in the brain all the way out to the influences of the world at large. Countless combinations of genetics, personality, history and life circumstances may all conspire to create the disorder in any one person. No wonder the science is stuck.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why a simple “chemical imbalance” explanation holds appeal, even if it’s false, says Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. What causes depression is nuanced, he says — “not something that can easily be captured in a slogan or buzzword.”</p>



<p>So here, up front, is your fair warning: There will be no satisfying wrap-up at the end of this story. You will not come away with a scientific explanation for depression, because one does not exist. But there is a way forward for depression researchers, Aftab says. It requires grappling with nuances, complexity and imperfect data.</p>



<p>Those hard examinations are under way. “There’s been some really interesting and exciting scientific and philosophical work,” Aftab says. That forward motion, however slow, gives him hope and may ultimately benefit the millions of people around the world weighed down by depression.</p>



<h4>How is depression measured?</h4>





<p>Many people who feel depressed go into a doctor’s office and get assessed with a checklist. “Yes” to trouble sleeping, “yes” to weight loss and “yes” to a depressed mood would all yield points that get tallied into a cumulative score. A high enough score may get someone a diagnosis. The process seems straightforward. But it’s not. “Even basic issues regarding measurement of depression are actually still quite open for debate,” Aftab says.</p>



<p>That’s why there are dozens of methods to assess depression, including the standard description set by the fifth edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, or DSM-5. This manual is meant to standardize categories of illness.</p>



<p>Variety in measurement is a real problem for the field and points to the lack of understanding of the disease itself, says Eiko Fried, a clinical psychologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Current ways of measuring depression “leave you with a really impoverished, tiny look,” Fried says.</p>



<p>Scales can miss important symptoms, leaving people out. “Mental pain,” for instance, was described by patients with depression and their caregivers as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32711710/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an important feature of the illness</a>, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em>. Yet the term doesn’t show up on standard depression measurements.</p>



<p>One reason for the trouble is that the experience of depression is, by its nature, deeply personal, says clinical psychologist Ioana Alina Cristea of the University of Pavia in Italy. Individual patient complaints are often the best tool for diagnosing the disorder, she says. “We can never let these elements of subjectivity go.”</p>



<p>In the middle of the 20th century, depression was diagnosed through subjective conversation and psychoanalysis, and considered by some to be an illness of the soul. In 1960, psychiatrist Max Hamilton attempted to course-correct toward objectivity. Working at the University of Leeds in England, he published a depression scale. Today, that scale, known by its acronyms HAM-D or HRSD, is one of the most widely used depression screening tools, often used in studies measuring depression and evaluating the promise of possible treatments.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3><strong>Who is depressed?</strong></h3>



<p>According to data from 2020, an estimated 21 million adults in the United States have had a major depressive episode in the last year, putting the overall prevalence at 8.4 percent. Rates are notably higher among females, people ages 18 to 25 and people who reported belonging to two or more races. But the widely varied scales used to diagnose depression may not accurately capture the true rates among some populations.</p>

<p>“It’s a great scheme for a scale that was made in 1960,” Fried says. Since the HRSD was published, “we have put a man on the moon, invented the internet and created powerful computers small enough to fit in people’s pockets,” Fried and his colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-022-00050-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in April in <em>Nature Reviews Psychology</em>. Yet this 60-year-old tool remains a gold standard.</p>



<p>Hamilton developed his scale by observing patients who had already been diagnosed with depression. They exhibited symptoms such as weight loss and slowed speech. But those mixtures of symptoms don’t apply to everyone with depression, nor do they capture nuance in symptoms.</p>



<p>To spot these nuances, Fried <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016503271631312X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked at 52 depression symptoms</a> across seven different scales for depression, including Hamilton’s scale. On average, each symptom appeared in three of the seven scales. A whopping 40 percent of the symptoms appeared in only one scale, Fried reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Affective Disorders</em>. The only specific symptom common to all seven scales? “Sad mood.”</p>



<p>In a study that examined depression symptoms reported by 3,703 people, Fried and Randolph Nesse, an evolutionary psychiatrist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4397113/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,030 unique symptom profiles</a>. Roughly 14 percent of participants had combinations of symptoms that were not shared with anyone else, the researchers reported in 2015 in the <em>Journal of Affective Disorders</em>.</p>



<p>Before reliable thermometers, the concept of temperature was murky. How do you understand the science of hot and cold without the tools to measure it? “You don’t,” Fried says. “You make a terrible measurement, and you have a terrible theory of what it is.” Depression presents a similar challenge, he says. Without good measurements, how can you possibly diagnose depression, determine whether symptoms get better with treatments or even prevent it in the first place?</p>



<h4>Depression differs by gender, race and culture</h4>



<p>The story gets murkier when considering who these depression scales were made for. Symptoms differ among groups of people, making the diagnosis even less relevant for certain groups.</p>

<h3>Depression symptoms measured by seven scales</h3>



<p>Seven common rating tools for depression measure a wide variety of symptoms. When researchers reviewed the 52 symptoms measured by these scales, only one specific symptom appeared in all seven — sad mood.</p>

<p>Behavioral researcher Leslie Adams of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health studies depression in Black men. “It’s clear that [depression] is negatively impacting their work lives, social lives and relationships. But they’re not being diagnosed at the same rate” as other groups, she says. For instance, white people have a lifetime risk of major depression disorder of almost 18 percent; Black people’s <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/482214" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifetime risk is 10.4 percent</a>, researchers reported in 2007 in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>. This discrepancy led Adams to ask: “Could there be a problem with diagnostic tools?”</p>



<p>Turns out, there is. Black men with depression have <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11137-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several characteristics that common scales miss</a>, such as feelings of internal conflict, not communicating with others and feeling the burdens of societal pressure, Adams and colleagues reported in 2021 in<em> BMC Public Health</em>. A lot of depression measurements are based on questions that don’t capture these symptoms, Adams says. “ ‘Are you very sad?’ ‘Are you crying?’ Some people do not emote in the same way,” she says. “You may be missing things.”</p>



<p>American Indian women living in the Southeast United States also experience symptoms that aren’t adequately caught by the scales, Adams and her team found in a separate study. These women also reported experiences that do not necessarily signal depression for them but generally do for wider populations.</p>



<p>On common scales, “there are some items that really do not capture the experience of depression for these groups,” Adams says. For instance, a common question asks how well someone agrees with the sentence: “I felt everything I did was an effort.” That “can mean a lot of things, and it’s not necessarily tied to depression,” Adams says. The same goes for items such as, “People dislike me.” A person of color faced with racism and marginalization might agree with that, regardless of depression, she says.</p>



<p>Our ways to measure depression capture only a tiny slice of the big picture. The same can be said about our understanding of what’s happening in the brain.</p>



<h4>The flawed serotonin hypothesis</h4>



<p>Serotonin came into the spotlight in part because of the serendipitous discovery of drugs that affected serotonin receptors, called selective serotonin re­uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. After getting its start in the late 1960s, the “serotonin hypothesis” flourished in the late ’90s, as advertisers ran commercials that told viewers that SSRIs fixed the serotonin deficit that can accompany depression. These messages changed the way people talked and thought about depression. Having a simple biological explanation helped some people and their doctors, in part by easing the shame some people felt for not being able to snap out of it on their own. It gave doctors ways to talk with people about the mood disorder.</p>



<p>But it was a simplified picture. A recent review of evidence, published in July in <em>Molecular Psychiatry</em>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finds no</a> consistent data supporting the idea that low serotonin causes depression. Some headlines declared that the study was a grand takedown of the serotonin hypothesis. To depression researchers, the findings weren’t a surprise. Many had already realized this simple description wasn’t helpful.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of data suggesting that serotonin, and other chemical messengers such as dopamine and norepinephrine, are somehow involved in depression, including a study by neuropharmacologist Gitte Moos Knudsen of the University of Copenhagen. She and colleagues recently found that 17 people who were in the midst of a depressive episode released, on average, <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(22)01704-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less serotonin</a> in certain brain areas than 20&nbsp;people who weren’t depressed. The study is small, but it’s one of the first to look at serotonin release in living human brains of people with depression.</p>



<p>But Knudsen cautions that those results, published in October in <em>Biological Psychiatry</em>, don’t mean that depression is fully caused by low serotonin levels. “It’s easy to defer to simple explanations,” she says.</p>



<p>SSRIs essentially form a molecular blockade, stopping serotonin from being reabsorbed into nerve cells and keeping the levels high between the cells. Those high levels are thought to influence nerve cell activity in ways that help people feel better.</p>



<p>Because the drugs can ease symptoms in about half of people with depression, it seemed to make sense that depression was caused by problems with serotonin. But just because a treatment works by doing something doesn’t mean the disease works in the opposite way. That’s <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mood-swings/202210/has-the-serotonin-hypothesis-been-debunked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backward logic</a>, psychiatrist Nassir Ghaemi of Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston wrote in October in a <em>Psychology Today</em> essay. Aspirin can ease a headache, but a headache isn’t caused by low aspirin.</p>



<p>“We think we have a much more nuanced picture of what depression is today,” Knudsen says. The trouble is figuring out the many details. “We need to be honest with patients, to say that we don’t know everything about this,” she says.</p>



<p>The brain contains seven distinct classes of receptors that sense serotonin. That’s not even accounting for sensors for other messengers such as dopamine and norepinephrine. And these receptors sit on a wide variety of nerve cells, some that send signals when they sense serotonin, some that dampen signals. And serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine are just a few of dozens of chemicals that carry information throughout a multitude of interconnected brain circuits. This complexity is so great that it renders the phrase “chemical imbalance” meaningless.</p>



<p>Overly simple claims — low serotonin causes depression, or low serotonin isn’t involved — serve only to keep us stymied, Aftab says. “[It] just keeps up that unhelpful binary.”</p>

<h3>How treatment helps depression patients</h3>



<p>A large study called STAR*D enrolled more than 4,000 people with depression across the United States and offered a window into how well treatment works. In the study, volunteers who didn’t respond to one treatment were switched to a second and so on. At each step, the portion of people in remission increased, though gains were smaller for later steps.</p>

<h4>Depression research can’t ignore the world</h4>



<p>In the 1990s, Aftab says, depression researchers got intensely focused on the brain. “They were trying to find the broken part of the brain that causes depression.” That limited view “really hurt depression research,” Aftab says. In the last 10&nbsp;years or so, “there’s a general recognition that that sort of mind-set is not going to give us the answers.”</p>



<p>Reducing depression to specific problems of biology in the brain didn’t work, Cristea says. “If you were a doctor 10 years ago, the dream was that the neuroscience would give us the markers. We would look at the markers and say, ‘OK. You [get] this drug. You, this kind of therapy.’ But it hasn’t happened.” Part of that, she says, is because depression is an “existentially complicated disorder” that’s tough to simplify, quantify and study in a lab.</p>



<p>Our friendships, our loves, our setbacks and our stress can all influence our health. Take a recent study of first-year doctors in the United States. The more these doctors worked, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2210365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the higher the rate of depression</a>, scientists reported in October in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Similar trends exist <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8866969/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for caregivers of people with dementia</a> and health care workers who kept emergency departments open during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their high-stress experiences may have prompted depression in some way.</p>



<p>“Depression is linked to the state of the world — and there is no denying it,” Aftab says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>What depression scales don’t ask</h3>



<p>In a concept mapping study, <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11137-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">descriptions of depression symptoms</a> provided by Black men and key individuals supporting Black men’s health, including Black women and doctors, were clustered into six categories: physical states, emotional states, diminished drive, communication with others, internal conflict and social pressures. Communication with others and internal conflict were each asked about in only one of three commonly used depression assessments studied. Social pressures weren’t reflected in any of the three assessments.</p>



<h5>Reflected in three assessments</h5>



<p><strong>Physical states:</strong> Descriptions in this category included high blood pressure, self-harm or suicidal behavior, binge eating, insomnia, heart palpitations and weight loss and/or gain.</p>



<p><strong>Emotional states:</strong> Descriptions in this category included not being able to “get up and go,” a lack of motivation, anger, fatigue, hopelessness, frustration, worry, bursts of crying, low self-esteem, feeling stuck and feeling out of control.</p>



<p><strong>Diminished drive:</strong> This category included descriptions of an untidy appearance, the inability to complete tasks and life goals, not being able to provide for family and excessive substance use, such as marijuana, cigarettes and alcohol.</p>



<h5>Reflected in one assessment</h5>



<p><strong>Communication with others:</strong> Descriptions in this category included not being able to communicate properly, including ignoring emails and phone calls, isolation from others, withdrawal from everyday activities, volatile behavior toward others, blunted emotional expression and difficulty maintaining romantic relationships.</p>



<p><strong>Internal conflict:</strong> This category included having a pessimistic outlook, feeling guilty, feeling unqualified, feeling attacked or defensive, feeling helpless in the face of aging, and a heightened sense of fear or dread.</p>



<h5>Not reflected in the assessments</h5>



<p><strong>Social pressures:</strong> Descriptions in this category included not being able to keep up appearances, fear of unknown consequences of today’s political environment, adherence to cultural norms of success and power, a lack of work/life balance, seeking happiness through accumulated materials and increased attendance at religious institutions.</p>
</div>



<p>Today’s research on depression ought to be more pluralistic, Adams says. “There are so many factors at play that we can’t just rest on one solution,” she says. Research from neuroscience and genetics has helped identify brain circuits, chemical messengers, cell types, molecules and genes that all may be involved in the disorder. But researchers aren’t satisfied with that. “There is other evidence that remains unexplored,” Adams says. “With our neuro­science advances, there should be similar advances in public health and psychiatric work.”</p>



<p>That’s happening. For her part, Adams and colleagues have just begun a study looking at moment-to-moment stressors in the lives of Black adolescents, ages 12 to 18, as measured by cell phone questionnaires. Responses, she hopes, will yield clues about depression and risk of suicide.</p>



<p>Other researchers are trying to fit together all of these different ways of seeing the problem. Fried, for example, is developing new concepts of depression that acknowledge the interacting systems. You tug on one aspect of it — using an antidepressant for instance, or changing sleep patterns — and see how the rest of the system reacts.</p>



<p>Approaches like these recognize the complexity of the problem and aim to figure out ways to handle it. We will never have a simple explanation for depression; we are now learning that one cannot possibly exist. That may sound like cold comfort to people in depression’s grip. But seeing the challenge with clear eyes may be the thing that moves us forward.</p>

<h2>What you think you know about depression is probably wrong</h2>

<p>The U.S. Office of Research Integrity, the agency that oversees research misconduct investigations for work funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a new permanent director after a year and a half without one.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://researchintegrity.gwu.edu/about">Sheila Garrity</a>, currently associate vice president for research integrity and research integrity officer at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., will start as ORI’s next permanent director the week of March 26, according to an internal memo from Rachel Levine, the Biden Administration’s Assistant Secretary for Health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garrity previously was director of the division of research integrity at Johns Hopkins University, where she worked for more than 20 years. She also was a founding member and the first president of the Association for Research Integrity Officers (ARIO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Levine’s memo described Garrity as “a leader in the fields of research integrity and the responsible conduct of research education,” and asked staff to “join me in welcoming Sheila to the OASH family and in thanking Wanda Jones for the incredible job she has done in running ORI while we conducted our candidate search.”</p>



<span id="more-126531"></span>



<p>The ORI has often been without a permanent director in its 30-plus year history, and <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/meet-directors">Jones</a>, deputy director and associate director of research and scientific integrity for the agency, has served multiple stints as its acting director in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s last permanent director, Elisabeth (Lis) Handley, filled the role <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/11/us-government-watchdog-gets-new-director/">from 2019</a> until <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/07/us-federal-watchdog-loses-director-to-another-government-role/">June 2021</a>, when she became principal deputy assistant secretary for health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Handley’s tenure, ORI had been without a permanent director since 2017, when Kathy Partin <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/20/director-u-s-hhs-office-research-integrity-temporarily-removed-post/">left the role</a> she had filled since 2015. Partin <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/01/former-director-of-u-s-research-watchdog-agency-moves-to-nih/">now serves</a> as the NIH’s intramural research integrity officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s heartening to see ORI move in the direction of a permanent director,” said <a href="https://csl.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/gunsalus">C.K. Gunsalus</a>, director of the National Center for Principled Leadership &amp; Research Ethics (NCPRE) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and a longtime member of the research integrity community. (Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit, The Center for Scientific Integrity, has partnered with NCPRE, and our cofounders have co-authored <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2675025">an editorial in <em>JAMA</em></a> with Gunsalus.) She told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It’s been so long since there was one that the agency seems to have lost its momentum and lost its way. I wish her all the best and hope with all her connections and experience she can revitalize an office that has an important role to play. The office needs revitalization in terms of refocusing its mission and restaffing and rebuilding its relationships of trust in the community.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last year, ORI <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/24/us-federal-research-watchdog-wants-your-input/">asked for input</a> on potential revisions to its regulations. Two major organizations, one of them the ARIO which Garrity helped to found, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/report-on-research-compliance-volume-19-2745472/">submitted a letter</a> that recommended, among other things, that ORI refine “the scope of inquiries/investigations and the circumstances under which an inquiry or investigation may be closed,” which the organizations said had become “overly broad.”</p>

<p>Some Goffin’s cockatoos (<em>Cacatua goffiniana</em>)<a href="#_msocom_2"> </a><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00057-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know whether they need to have more than one tool in claw</a> to topple&nbsp;an out-of-reach cashew, researchers report February 10 in <em>Current Biology</em>. By recognizing that two items are necessary to access the snack, the birds join chimpanzees as the only nonhuman animals known to use tools as a set.</p>



<p>The study is a fascinating example of what cockatoos are capable of, says Anne Clark, a behavioral ecologist at Binghamton University in New York, who was not involved in the study. A mental awareness that people often attribute to our close primate relatives can also pop up elsewhere in the animal kingdom.</p>





<p>A variety of animals including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/hawaiian-crows-ace-tool-user-test">crows</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/sea-otters-use-rocks-tools-arent-related">otters</a> use tools but don’t deploy multiple objects together as a kit (<em>SN: 9/14/16</em>; <em>SN: 3/21/17</em>). Chimpanzees from the Republic of Congo’s Noubalé-Ndoki National Park, on the other hand, recognize the need for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chimps-show-skill-termite-fishing">both a sharp stick to break into termite mounds and a fishing stick</a> to scoop up an insect feast (<em>SN: 10/19/04</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers knew wild cockatoos could use <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01111-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three different sticks to break open fruit</a> in their native range of Indonesia. But it was unclear whether the birds might recognize the sticks as a set or instead as a chain of single tools that became necessary as new problems arose, says evolutionary biologist Antonio Osuna Mascaró of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna.</p>



<p>Osuna Mascaró and colleagues first tested whether the cockatoos could learn to smack loose a cashew placed inside a clear box and behind a thin paper barrier, akin to a chimpanzee’s hunt for termites. Six out of 10 cockatoos reliably knocked the nut out of the box using a pointy stick to poke through the membrane and a plastic straw to fish for the cashew.</p>



<p>Two birds managed the task in less than 35 seconds on their first try. Both — a male named Figaro and a female named Fini — are experienced tool users, Osuna Mascaró says. </p>



<p>Figaro, Fini and three&nbsp;fellow cockatoos were more likely to use both stick and straw only when the box had a paper barrier inside. If the team removed the barrier, the birds selected the straw instead of the stick as their tool. </p>



<p>Even when the birds had to walk or fly to reach the box, the birds brought along both tools every time the box had a barrier. If there was no paper, the cockatoos usually brought only one,&nbsp;a sign the cockatoos recognized when they needed their entire tool kit to swipe a snack.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some captive Goffin’s cockatoos, including this one named Figaro, learned to use a sharp stick to poke through a thin piece of paper, allowing them to then insert a longer straw to knock free a cashew. Here, Figaro grabs both tools needed before flying up to the box — a sign that he recognized both tools as part of a set needed to complete the job. Chimpanzees, which use a pair of sticks to fish for termites, are the only other nonhuman animal known to use tools as a set.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Three of the birds even learned to put the stick inside the straw to carry both at the same time. That made for more efficient transport, meaning the birds didn’t have to make two trips and waste energy. Two birds, Kiwi and Pippin, transported both tools together every time the box had a barrier. Kiwi rarely brought along both tools if there wasn’t paper, and Pippin did so half as often.</p>





<p>Trading off which tools to bring may have to do with strength. After Figaro learned to combine transport, he grabbed both tools in 16 out of 18 trials. That may be because he’s one of the stronger birds in the group, Osuna Mascaró says. For him, grabbing both tools at once isn’t a big deal. Kiwi and Pippin, on the other hand, are weaker than Figaro.</p>



<p>Cockatoos raised in the lab probably display more abilities than a wild bird might use on an average day, Clark says. “Nevertheless, this means they can do it,” she says. “That doesn’t mean that the wild adult male … can do the same thing as Figaro. But he would have probably been capable of doing that had he been raised like Figaro.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-microraptor-hawk-fossil-foot">This dinosaur might have used its feet to snag prey in midair like modern hawks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modern birds evolved from dinosaurs, but it’s not clear <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-birds-could-achieve-liftoff">how well birds’ ancient dino ancestors could fly</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/16</em>). Now, a look at the fossilized feet of one nonavian dinosaur suggests that it may have hunted on the wing, like some hawks today.</p>



<p>The crow-sized <em>Microraptor</em> had toe pads <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35039-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very similar to those of modern raptors</a> that can hunt in the air, researchers report December 20 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. That means the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microraptor-dinosaur-fossil-molting-feathers-songbirds">feathered, four-winged dinosaur</a> probably used its feet to catch flying prey too, paleobiologist Michael Pittman of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and colleagues say (<em>SN: 7/16/20</em>).</p>





<p>Other researchers caution that toe pads alone aren’t enough to declare <em>Microraptor</em> an aerial hunter. But if the claim holds up, such a hunting style would reinforce <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221004310#bib1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a debated hypothesis</a> that powered flight evolved <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220309994#fig4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple times</a> among dinosaurs, a feat once attributed solely to birds.</p>



<p>Toe pads are bundles of scale-covered flesh on the undersides of dinosaur feet, similar to “toe beans” on dogs and cats. Because the pads are points where the living animal interacted with surfaces, toe pads give paleontologists a “sense of where the rubber meets the road,” says Alexander Dececchi, a paleontologist at Mount Marty University in Yankton, S.D., who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>These contact points can paint a clearer picture of an animal’s behavior by providing “details that the skeleton itself wouldn’t show,” says Thomas Holtz Jr., a dinosaur paleobiologist at the University of Maryland in College Park, who was also not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To investigate dinosaur toe pads, Pittman and colleagues turned to the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature in Linyi, China. It “has arguably the largest collection of feathered dinosaurs in the world, and, importantly, they haven’t been prepared extensively,” Pittman says. Many of these dinosaur skeletons are still surrounded by rock, which is where soft tissues can be preserved. Such a specimen “gives us the best chance of finding this wonderful soft tissue information,” he says.</p>

<p>Using special lasers that cause the otherwise <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/under-lasers-feathered-dino-shows-some-skin">nearly invisible soft tissue in the fossils to fluoresce</a>, the team found 12 specimens with exceptionally well-preserved toe pads among the thousands examined (<em>SN: 3/20/17</em>).</p>



<p>The team compared the fossil toe pads with those of 36 types of modern birds, whose toe pads vary with their lifestyle. Predatory birds, for example, have protruding toe pads with spiky scales for grasping prey, while ground birds that spend their time walking and running have flatter toe pads. The analysis showed that <em>Microraptor</em>’s toe pads and other aspects of the feet, like the shape of the toe joints and claws, are most like those of modern hawks. That similarity suggests that the dinosaur could hunt prey midair and on the ground like hawks do, the team says.</p>



<p>Other dinosaurs, like the feathered <em>Anchiornis,</em> had flatter toe pads and straighter claws, suggesting a terrestrial lifestyle. That&#8217;s in line with ideas about this dinosaur being a poor flier, Pittman says. </p>

Pittman <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Communications</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The idea that <em>Microraptor</em> hunted like a hawk is consistent with other fossil evidence. One <em>Microraptor </em>fossil has been found with a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1117727108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bird in its stomach</a>, and <em>Microraptor</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/2159/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skeletal</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2205476119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soft tissue</a> anatomy suggest some powered flight capability.</p>



<p>There’s still more work to do to figure out how well the dinosaur may have flown. “<em>Microraptor</em> is not a bird, but a close relative. Just because it has feet like a predatory bird doesn’t necessarily mean it must be catching prey in the exact same way,” Pittman says. But <em>Microraptor</em>’s hawklike lifestyle “is a strong possibility,” he adds.</p>





<p>Flight could have been useful to <em>Microraptor</em> when hunting, even if it couldn’t stack up to today&#8217;s fliers. Dececchi speculates that <em>Microraptor</em>’s <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2205476119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anatomy</a> probably prevented it from outflying birds, but may have helped it surprise otherwise out-of-reach prey, including flying and gliding animals.</p>



<p>“You only have to be fast or aerobatic enough to catch other things in your environment,” Holtz says. “So, it’s not improbable that [<em>Microraptor</em> was] catching things in the air on occasion.”</p>



<p>Other paleontologists are more skeptical that <em>Microraptor</em> hunted on the wing. “It would be a bit of a stretch to me to suggest that <em>Microraptor</em> was pursuing prey in an aerial context,” says Albert Chen, a paleobiologist at the University of Cambridge. The new findings inform only “what the foot was used for.”</p>



<p>Alternative hypotheses, such as a completely or partially terrestrial hunting style, could fit the data too, Holtz says, but the “feet are definitely playing a major role in their prey capture,” whether on the ground or in the air.</p>



<p>For now, the picture of <em>Microraptor</em>’s ecology remains fuzzy, but as lasers continue to increase the picture&#8217;s resolution, our understanding of dinosaur flight may reach new heights.</p>
