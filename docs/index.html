<p>The Pennsylvania State University in May blocked a prominent professor at the school from doing research and making presentations on its behalf, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The professor, <a href="https://www.bme.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=dfk5267">Deborah Kelly</a>, has faced mounting scrutiny over her work since <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/thomasmccorvie.html">a researcher in the United Kingdom</a> noticed apparent data manipulation in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads9451">a now-retracted article</a> she published in 2017. Kelly earned her third retraction last week following a university probe that found “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/11/penn-state-prof-earns-second-retraction-faces-third-following-university-probe/">serious data integrity concerns</a>” in another paper, as we reported at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dr.-Deborah-Kelly-Statement9413593.1.pdf">comments she made via her legal counsel</a> for that story, Kelly, a biomedical engineer and an expert in electron microscopy, told us:</p>



<span id="more-130058"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>To date, I am under no restrictions imposed upon my research and no such restrictions are anticipated. I remain dedicated to ethical research, will cooperate with inquiries concerning my research, and will continue to uphold the highest ethical standards in all my future research endeavors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But Wednesday, in response to a follow-up request for comment, we heard from Andrew Read, Senior Vice President for Research: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It has come to my attention that Dr. Deborah Kelly submitted a statement published on&nbsp;<a href="https://retractionwatch.com">retractionwatch.com</a>&nbsp;in which she stated:&nbsp;‘To date, I am under no restrictions imposed upon my research and no such restrictions are anticipated.’ As of May 2024, Dr. Kelly is prohibited from conducting research, pursuing grants or contracts, submitting publications, or making presentations on behalf of the Pennsylvania State University.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Kelly for comments and received the following statement from her legal counsel:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Though I am still presently employed at The Pennsylvania State University, I am embarking on new opportunities. Through my academic freedom of expression, I am under no restrictions in my independent research efforts apart from Penn State.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is not clear which &#8220;independent research efforts&#8221; Kelly is referring to. As we reported previously, her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deb-kelly-51797110/">LinkedIn page</a> lists her as executive director of the new non-profit think tank Structural Oncology LLC.</p>

<p>An architecture journal’s “failure to act in a timely and proactive manner” in a case of plagiarism in a now-retracted review article has sparked the resignation of a member of its editorial board, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>“I am appalled that it took, essentially, from November 2022 until now, September 2024, to resolve what was a fairly straightforward matter,” <a href="https://science-health.csu.edu.au/schools/ag-environmental-vet/staff/profiles/professoriate/dirk-spennemann">Dirk H. R. Spennemann</a>, of Charles Sturt University in Albury, Australia, wrote in a Sept. 18, 2024, email to the editor-in-chief of <em>Buildings</em>, an MDPI title.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The offending paper, “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/14/9/2806">A Review on Building Design as a Biomedical System for Preventing COVID-19 Pandemic</a>,” was published in April 2022 in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/buildings/special_issues/Post_COVID_Architecture">a special issue</a> Spennemann had edited.</p>



<p>But in June of that year, <a href="https://www.uos.ac.uk/people/marco-spada/">Marco Spada</a>, a senior lecturer in architecture at the University of Suffolk in the United Kingdom, informed <em>Buildings</em> the work borrowed heavily from two previous publications without proper citation. Although many sentences had been reworded using synonyms, the plagiarism was extensive and obvious.</p>



<p>Spada had recognized the article, a version of which he had previously reviewed – and rejected – as a referee for <em>Sustainability</em>, a different MDPI journal. Elements such as the title, the order in which the authors appeared and some of the abstract had changed, Spada told us. But it was still the same paper.</p>



<p>“Clearly they managed to outsmart the system,” Spada said.</p>

<p>The review’s corresponding author, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=zP_KsHcAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Mugahed Amran</a>, an associate professor at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University in Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia, did not respond to an email seeking comment, nor did three of his coauthors whose email addresses were listed on the paper.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to Spennemann, the journal did not tell him about Spada’s allegations until Oct. 25, 2022. At that point, he was “deeply buried in end-of-semester marking,” he told us. On November 18, “based on a (very much regrettably) cursory examination,” Spennemann said, he determined that the plagiarism was “not serious.”</p>



<p>Two days later, however, Spada reached out to Spennemann, providing details of his allegations, which Spennemann said <em>Buildings</em> had not done.</p>



<p>Based on an in-depth examination of the plagiarized article and the source papers, Spennemann told us, he found plagiarism had indeed occurred. On Nov. 23, 2022, he recommended “the authors be asked to withdraw/retract their paper within a week or, failing that, that the paper be withdrawn by MDPI&nbsp;<em>Buildings</em>&nbsp;and deleted from the website.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spennemann also complained to the journal that, as guest editor of the special issue, he had not learned of Spada’s email in June.</p>



<p>An extended back-and-forth with journal staff ensued, according to Spennemann, during which he felt action was happening “behind the scenes.” He said the journal asked five other members of the editorial board for their assessment and on Feb. 20, 2023, informed him it had sent the case to the publisher’s ethics team.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Spennemann said he inquired several times over the following months about the case. On Oct. 24, 2023, the journal told him a retraction process had “been initiated but that authors need to concur and that authors are unresponsive.” Spennemann asked to be informed of further developments, he said, but was only formally notified of the retraction on Sept. 10, 2024 – four days after the retraction notice was published on the journal’s website.</p>



<p>In his resignation email to editor-in-chief <a href="https://www.iit.edu/directory/people/david-arditi">David Arditi</a>, which Retraction Watch has seen, Spennemann wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am taking this step because of your and the managing editors of MDPI Buildings failure to act in a timely and proactive manner when dealing with the plagiarism case related to manuscript buildings-1606920.</p>



<p>As the editor of the special issue “Post-COVID Architecture Research” I was not informed until 25 October 2022 of allegations made as early as 14 June 2022. I was provided with what I took to be the full details of the case. Following communication by an external party (Dr. Marco Spada) I was alerted to the fact that the original allegation was far more detailed than I was led to believe. I specifically requested the full set of information from the managing editor of MDPI Buildings which was provided on 20 November 2022. Throughout the ensuing process the managing editor of MDPI Buildings kept me in the dark about any progress unless I, often repeatedly, formally requested updates. Even then, any updates I received were sparse and not detailed. It would appear that MDPI Buildings did not pursue any concerns with the authors of the manuscript in question with the importance that the matter deserved and allowed the authors to reply at leisure rather than in a timely manner.</p>



<p>I am appalled that it took, essentially, from November 2022 until now, September 2024, to resolve what was a fairly straightforward matter and which could, and should have been resolved with due process in six months or less.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The review has been cited 15 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s sad because we spotted it when it still had something like two citations,” Spada told us. “It should have been a little bit quicker, the [retraction] process.”</p>



<p>Spennemann added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>What is not acceptable is the delay and lack of responsiveness. If I were to hazard a guess, it is not symptomatic of MDPI but of the journal Buildings and the lack of editorial rigour by the editor in chief and the managing editors. I have been working with the managing editor of MDPI Heritage (I am not on the board) and cannot but notice a very different attitude and proactiveness that is so lacking at Buildings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Replying to Spennemann’s resignation email, Claire Xiang, a managing editor of <em>Buildings</em>, wrote to him on September 19:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When we received your message about this manuscript for the first time, we took this issue seriously and asked for an investigation immediately, which is in line with the COPE&#8217;s suggestion. Unfortunately, the authors did not cooperate with our work at every step. They did not reply to our email or they replied to say one author was in a health problem.</p>



<p>MDPI has put considerable effort into speeding up the retraction process across all our journals and implemented a new process which has led to a significant improvement in this area. As a result of this case, all journal staff is receiving training on the management of post-publication case management and the retraction procedure, and specific staff members are being assigned to deal with ethics cases going forward.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We emailed MDPI and Arditi for comment. An MDPI public relations representative<em>&nbsp;</em>responded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics, we are obliged to closely adhere to their guidelines when it comes to removing an article (Retraction) from the scientific record. In situations of potential plagiarism COPE provides specific guidelines on how to handle such complaints.</p>



<p>While we cannot provide specific details about this case, a typical investigation requires significant coordination between the Editorial Office, authors, Editorial Board Members and at times external stakeholders. We always strive to retract articles as soon as possible, however, the necessity to coordinate between various stakeholders means that this process takes time, as each step is significant in order to satisfactorily complete this process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As to how an article that had already been rejected by one MDPI journal due to plagiarism could be accepted for publication in another, the publisher explained:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The MDPI’s submission system, SUSY, is equipped to link all prior submissions of one manuscript across various MDPI journals. Due to major changes performed by the authors to the original version submitted this paper was not identified as such.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="171" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130050"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kaikobad Irani</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The University of Iowa found a cardiology researcher violated multiple of its policies, including harassing his former mentees when they tried to leave his lab to establish labs of their own, according to an investigation report obtained by Retraction Watch. </p>



<p>The researcher, Kaikobad Irani, left the school last month with a six-figure settlement, and has a new job lined up, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Irani studies the molecular mechanisms of the function and dysfunction of blood vessels. He’s listed as an inventor on <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Kaikobad+Irani">four patents</a>, including an <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230322862A1/en?inventor=Kaikobad+Irani">active one</a> regarding a compound that could lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Irani’s active <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/yBLnj8XSvE2u4ZjBkZY1GQ/project-details/11137499">grants</a> names the Providence VA Medical Center as the awardee organization. A spokesperson for the VA Providence Healthcare System confirmed Irani “is in the process of onboarding and is expected to begin working around November.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130049"></span>



<p>The organization declined to comment on the University of Iowa’s findings without seeing the report, which we could not share with them based on the conditions under which we obtained it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Retraction-Watch-Statement-2024.09.17.pdf">statement</a>, Irani told Retraction Watch he “​​faced a campaign of retaliation” after reporting a faculty member working in his lab for “extensively falsifying and fabricating data.” He also reported other researchers to federal authorities for failing to report conflicts of interest on grant applications to the National Institutes of Health, he said. Through his attorneys, he declined to name the faculty member he reported for research misconduct.</p>



<p>“I was prepared to move forward with a lawsuit, but determined that it was in the best interests of both myself and the University to sever the employment relationship,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Iowa report, addressed to associate provost for faculty Lois Geist and dated March 24, 2022, describes an investigation by University Human Resources executive Jan Waterhouse and Steven Varga, an associate dean for the university’s Graduate College. Based on a “preponderance of evidence” standard, the investigation found Irani’s behavior violated the university’s policies on harassment, professional conduct and use of information technology resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The harassment described in the report included delaying giving a former mentee the specially-bred mice the scientist needed for over half a year. When Irani did provide the animals, they weren’t the right strain. The delay, followed by unsuccessful experiments and the need to redevelop the line of mice from scratch, set the young scientist back two years and made publishing papers and applying for grants complicated, according to the investigation report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another incident, the officials said Irani reported a different former mentee for research misconduct over a mislabeled image in a grant application, despite initially telling the young scientist the error was trivial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Irani also sent anonymous harassing emails, the university investigation found, got the university to revoke his mentees’ keycard access to his lab when they still had materials there, and appeared, uninvited, outside the home of one of the young scientists on at least two occasions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Irani declined to meet with the investigators, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The March 2022 investigative report was never discussed during the severance negotiations and had nothing to do with my voluntary resignation,” Irani said in his statement. “Its findings are largely based on false unsubstantiated allegations made by persons whom I had earlier reported in good faith.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the university <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/higher-education/university-of-iowa-settles-with-tenured-federally-funded-research-professor/">agreed to pay</a> Irani $350,000 in exchange for his resignation and agreement not to sue the institution, according to <a href="https://settlements.regents.iastate.edu/uploads/d/b/3/db3e65406066a177970e559957526d3d75fb4e3f/K.-Irani-Settlement-Agreement.pdf">settlement documents</a> posted online. The university also agreed to suspend any ongoing proceedings regarding Irani, and work to transfer his grant funding to his new institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement mentions an “oversight review” by the Office of Naval Research’s Inspector General and the possibility the university may have to repay grant money “in connection with research conducted by” Irani.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Iowa did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>

                A startup says shipping meltwater from Greenland’s glaciers internationally will boost the local economy and could help ease water pressures in arid regions—but what does that actually mean for the world?

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/does-it-hurt-more-being-a-woman-understanding-sex-differences-in-pain-perception">Does it hurt more being a woman? Understanding Sex Differences in Pain Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Pain is a complex and subjective experience that varies among individuals. However, there is increasing evidence that men and women differ in their response to pain, with an increased pain sensitivity and risk of clinical pain commonly being observed among women. The International Association for the Study of Pain has designated 2024 as the ‘Global Year About Sex and Gender Disparities in Pain’ (1). Throughout 2024, IASP aims to examine what is known about sex and gender differences in pain perception and modulation, and address sex- and gender-related disparities in both the research and treatment of pain. Understanding why the experience of pain varies between people is central to the development of more targeted, and personalised, treatments for pain. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women are more likely to experience chronic pain </span></span></strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_f7e44131cb664bbe9446f811683f1f3b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Studies have consistently highlighted that women are at greater risk of developing many chronic pain-causing conditions, compared to men. For example, fibromyalgia, a condition characterised by chronic widespread pain, is significantly more prevalent in women (80-90% of diagnosed cases) (2). Other conditions that disproportionately affect women include migraine headache, temporomandibular disorders (TMD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic pelvic pain. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Mood disorders, in particular anxiety, play an important role in the exacerbation of pain perception in all clinical settings, and women also demonstrate higher rates of these anxiety disorders. It is well established that anxiety is associated with a greater severity of pain and, in turn, the presence of chronic pain can cause higher levels of anxiety, creating a devastating positive feedback loop (3).</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women feel pain more intensely than men</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The female body has a more intense natural response to painful stimuli, indicating a sex difference in the way pain systems function. According to research by the American Society </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_2748e8c8a261495091c189bde0cbac3d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">of Plastic Surgeons, women possess a higher nerve density than men, with 35 nerve fibres per centimetre of skin, while men average 17 (4). These findings indicate that women’s lower pain tolerance and threshold may also be physical. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite this, The Gender Pain Gap Index Report, commissioned by Nurofen in 2023, revealed over half of UK women (56%) feel their pain is ignored or dismissed by healthcare professionals (5). When they are in pain, women wait longer in emergency departments (6) and are 25% less likely to have their pain adequately treated (7). It takes women longer to receive a diagnosis, healthcare professionals diagnose them with the least confidence and they are twice as likely to be alternatively diagnosed with a mental illness, relative to men reporting the same </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_b02c87b70b664cebab23e483e32da309~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_645,h_501,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">symptoms (8). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Nearly half (48%) of UK adults believe there is a ‘gap’ in the identification and treatment of pain between sexes, and this gap is widening (6). These reports highlight the urgent need to address the stark inequalities around women’s pain. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Effects of sex steroid hormones on pain</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Overwhelming evidence supports the multitude of sex-specific biological mechanisms that underlie pain at both a physiological and pathophysiological level. For example, hormones can exert an influence on pain in a variety of ways, including:</span></span></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Altering sensitivity</span></span></em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">to pain by influencing pain processing pathways (e.g., descending modulation)</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Altering biological processes</span></span></em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">associated with pain (e.g., inflammation)</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Driving hormonally dependent pathologies </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">(e.g., endometriosis)</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Impacting mood </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">to alter/exacerbate the pain experience</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Oestrogen, in particular, plays a significant role in modulating pain perception. At high concentrations, oestrogen has a pain-suppressing effect via activation of inhibitory pathways in the spinal cord (9). Increased oestrogen levels have also been found to protect against pain conditions like musculoskeletal (10) or posttraumatic pain (11). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Whilst it is commonly believed that women have a higher pain tolerance, because they can ‘endure childbirth’, it is, in fact, the opposite. Pregnancy (a time of very high oestrogen and progesterone) is associated with a marked reduction in pain sensitivity (12). This “pregnancy-induced analgesia” has been consistently demonstrated in animal models, even in male rats injected with pregnancy hormones. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Three well-studied findings relating to sex differences in pain hypersensitivity have been described in detail: </span></span></p>
<ol>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The male-specific role of spinal microglia.</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Microglia do not contribute to pain hypersensitivity in female mice. Instead, adaptive immune cells perform an analogous role in females (13). </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The female-specific role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">CGRP has a preferential pain-promoting effect in female rodents but has limited impact in males (14). </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The female-specific role of prolactin and its receptor. </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The Prolactin/Prolactin Receptor System sensitises nociceptors to promote pain selectively in females (15). </span></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gaps in the research </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Although most patients with chronic pain are women, the majority of our knowledge about pain mechanisms has been derived from preclinical studies on male rodents. Between 1996 and 2005, 79% of preclinical rodent studies published in the journal, </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Pain,</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> tested male rats or mice only, with an additional 3% of studies not stating the sex of their subjects (16). Pain is not an exception in this regard. Male animals dominate preclinical research subjects in neuroscience, with the percentage of published studies using male rodents increasing between 2010 and 2014. Decades of study of, primarily male, rodents have led to the pain literature being male-biased (17). Sex differences should be considered in the investigation of pain. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">Common misconceptions about including female animals in preclinical studies</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Could it not be argued that, by including female animals, it would make the research more clinically relevant, especially considering over half of the population is female? What are some of the common arguments against using females in preclinical research, and are these realistic or not?</span></span></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">‘Females are more variable because of their oestrous cycle’</span></span></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It has empirically been shown, both in pain research and in other fields, that this is not true. The oestrous cycles are short in these animals and even if the cycle does add to variability in female animals, researchers should acknowledge that male animals have dominance hierarchies in their cages, which adds a source of variability. </span></span></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">‘If I use both sexes, then I’m going to have to use double the animals’ </span></span></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Again, this is not true from an experimental design point of view. Researchers should use a factorial design (18), with sex being considered a factor.</span></span></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">‘You can’t blind for sex in your experiments’ </span></span></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It isn’t always possible to blind for everything. In this case, using both sexes, even without blinding, is worth it to improve the study. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">However, with major funding agencies around the world advocating for sex to be included as a biological variable in all aspects of research they fund, from study design to data analysis and dissemination, there is hope that we can better understand pain in women. </span></span></p>

<p>A scientific sleuth and a mother who nearly lost her daughter to a hormonal condition teamed up in January to flag a series of papers that misnamed a medication for pregnant women. They have recently started to see the fruits of their labors: one retraction and three corrections. </p>



<p>In 2014, <a href="https://jacksonlab.labsites.cshl.edu/people/">Tara Skopelitis</a>, a lab manager at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, was given weekly progesterone injections to prevent preterm birth for her daughter, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/22/progesterone-17p-makena-confused-in-scientific-papers-medical-practice/">as reported by STAT</a>. Six years later, after her daughter showed symptoms of an unknown hormonal condition which still hasn’t been formally diagnosed, Skopelitis discovered she should have received synthetic progesterone variant 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, often referred to as 17-OHPC, 17P, sold as <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-commissioner-and-chief-scientist-announce-decision-withdraw-approval-makena">Makena</a>. When the drug wasn’t available, her doctor had ordered the wrong replacement from a compounding pharmacy. Skopelitis suspects her daughter’s condition could be a result of the mixup.</p>



<p>The confusion lies within the literature, Skopelitis says: Many clinical trials and papers refer to 17P as intramuscular progesterone, as if they are interchangeable or even the same compound.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130045"></span>



<p>While 17P <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-commissioner-and-chief-scientist-announce-decision-withdraw-approval-makena">was FDA-approved</a> for a time and had been tested in several clinical trials, “intramuscular progesterone has never been tested for safety or recommended for use in preventing preterm labor,” Skopelitis told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skopelitis identified 69 papers that misname 17P as intramuscular progesterone. She enlisted the help of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/27/sholto-david-profile-dana-farber-retractions/">Sholto David</a>, a sleuth and scientist who has helped manage their correspondence with the journals that published the papers. “It&#8217;s a story that forces you to sound like a conspiracy theorist. I had a hard time listening to Tara at first,” David told us in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A recent retraction takes the duo a step closer to correcting the body of literature surrounding intramuscular progesterone. The <em>Journal of Maternal-Fetal &amp; Neonatal Medicine</em> in June retracted the 2012 paper, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14767058.2012.755165">Matched sample comparison of intramuscular versus vaginal micronized progesterone for prevention of preterm birth</a>.” This trial was a special case, however, since “the authors seem to have actually used intramuscular progesterone, under the impression that there simply is no difference to 17P,” David wrote in an email to a member of the editorial board in February.</p>



<p>Intramuscular progesterone at that dose “has never been tested for safety or even believed by anyone to be effective,” David wrote. “The entire premise of the study seems to have been based on a nomenclature misunderstanding.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also noted the authors compared their results to trials of intramuscular 17P, further evidence they believed the two compounds to be interchangeable, he said.</p>



<p>David forwarded the unanswered correspondence to the ethics department of the journal’s publisher, Taylor and Francis, in April. Julia Gunn, a research integrity manager at the company, responded in June that the paper had been retracted.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767058.2024.2360726">retraction notice</a>, when the journal reached out to the authors, they were informed that <a href="https://www.obstetricgynecoljournal.com/editors/mohamed-nabih-el-gharib">Mohamed Nabih EL-Gharib</a>, the lead and corresponding author of the study listed as a researcher at Tanta University in Egypt, had died. The second author, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1598-6039">T. M. EL-Hawary</a>, also a researcher at Tanta University, “did not provide responses to our queries about the study, the raw data for review, or evidence to confirm that the study complied with the journal’s policies,” the notice stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EL-Hawary did not respond to our request for comment. He also publishes research under the name “Tarek Elhawary.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As for whether the trial actually happened, it&#8217;s certainly quite probable that it was just made up,” David told Retraction Watch in an email. Indeed, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">sleuths</a> have identified many <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/05/02/a-study-of-c-section-scars-in-women-who-hadnt-undergone-the-surgery/">fabricated</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">clinical trials</a> in the obstetrics literature. If the drug was used as described in the study, “the consequences would be great,” David told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A slew of other articles that made the same nomenclature mistake have received corrections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper that seemed to be the origin of the confusion, “<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa035140">Prevention of Recurrent Preterm Delivery by 17 Alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate</a>,” was published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in 2003. The journal issued a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMx240004">correction</a> in June 2024, after David and Skopelitis’ prompting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology MFM</em> issued <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589933324002052">a correction</a> for a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2589933320300616">2020 paper</a> in September, stating that “intramuscular progesterone should be replaced with 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) in the title and throughout the body of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in September, a <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(24)00757-9/fulltext">multi-article correction</a> was issued by the <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (AJOG).</em> It applies to seven studies and controlled trials. The authors “regret that there have been instances where the terms progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) have been used interchangeably,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roberto Romero, an editor-in-chief of<em> AJOG,</em> told Skopelitis in an email seen by Retraction Watch he contacted Elsevier, and “The Publisher agrees there is a need for corrections of all instances for which there are inaccuracies.” Elsevier did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hundreds of doctors lazily misnamed a drug and it was allowed to cascade through the peer reviewed literature with serious implications for patient care,” David told us. “That can&#8217;t just be an ‘oops’ moment.”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="500" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129807" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3.png 400w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Richard Eckert</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In 2021, the provost of the University of Maryland, Baltimore sounded the alarm about a troubling batch of papers from the lab of Richard Eckert, the former chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the institution. </p>



<p>The provost sent letters to the editors of seven journals calling out a string of serious issues.&nbsp; Based on the university’s investigation, the papers contained duplicated, fabricated and falsified data, according to emails obtained by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But more than three years later, the results of those alerts are mixed: Of the 11 papers the university flagged in 2021, editors corrected three and retracted two. Six still await resolution, with no apparent action taken by the journals.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130038"></span>



<p>Maryland’s internal investigation into Eckert wrapped up in January 2020. Based on that investigation, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/13/former-maryland-dept-chair-with-19-million-in-grants-faked-data-in-13-papers-feds-say/">last month</a> found Eckert <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-eckert-richard-l">committed research misconduct</a> by faking data in 13 published papers and two grant applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a public records request, we obtained a redacted copy of the investigation report, as well as the university’s correspondence with the journal editors. The records show that two years after the university initially alerted the journals, they followed up with some journals that had yet to act. The university also sent emails recommending retraction or correction of five more problematic papers. </p>



<p>But the second attempt didn’t change much: Collectively, 10 of 17 suspect papers await action.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After receiving an anonymous allegation through a reporting hotline, Maryland began the process of investigating Eckert’s work in January 2019. According to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eOWRqDmWVcyaG5752jhevI7gEqHsubll/view">redacted version of the report</a>, dated Jan. 7, 2020, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uq2dLFQdvIi1iROqV3pvV68YvyXeYiWa/view">forensic evidence</a>, the university found Eckert had engaged in several deceptive practices, among them: fabricating data to purportedly show gene expression, splicing and duplicating Western blots while using a paint brush tool to mask the alterations, and using empty areas of film to fake control conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year after the investigation concluded, Roger Ward, the provost and executive vice president of the university, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H6eI13yv4WopaAwndU7MuaSq4z1cq_T6/view">wrote letters to seven journals</a> about the compromised papers. In response, two were retracted and three corrected:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p>The documents we obtained reveal a series of delays and inaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Letter-to-Molecular-carcinogenesis.pdf">reported deleted data</a> in a paper published in <em>Molecular Carcinogenesis</em>, ‘<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mc.22714">Combination cisplatin and sulforaphane treatment reduces proliferation, invasion, and tumor formation in epidermal squamous cell carcinoma</a>’, and recommended the journal retract the article. Independent experts recruited by Wiley, the journal’s publisher, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RE_-Article-in-Molecular-Carcinogenesis.pdf">couldn’t determine</a> whether the error was honest. They requested additional evidence that the university was unable to provide, citing confidentiality. The article does not yet have any published notice. When asked about the matter, the journal editor deferred to a representative from Wiley, who did not respond to our queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Letter-to-JBC.pdf">The university called out</a> three papers published in the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> for containing falsified Western blots.&nbsp; One of these was doctored using a paintbrush tool “in order to support the data presented in the article.”</p>



<p>For one article, the university’s investigators concluded “either the actual experiments have never been performed or the western blots never showed the results described in the article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Editor-responses.pdf">According to a log of email exchanges</a>, the then-editor of the journal responded the same day, promising to “follow up in terms of action” regarding the three problematic articles. None have yet been retracted or corrected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February 2023, Stephan Vigues, the university’s research integrity officer, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Re_-Retraction_correction-request.pdf">followed up with</a> the current editor-in-chief of JBC, Alex Toker. Toker wrote back, “Rest assured we take these cases with the utmost seriousness.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Vigues followed up again in April 2023, a data integrity manager at the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, which publishes the journal, said the investigation was still ongoing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vigues inquired again in January of this year, stressing his institution had “investigated the entire lab” and had “gathered enough information to ask for retraction because the published data was manipulated and does not represent accurately the raw data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A response from the director of publications, Isabel Casas, revealed the data manager handling the case had left, and the investigation was still unresolved. Neither Toker nor Casas has responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another instance, the <em>Journal of Investigative Dermatology</em> had corrected a paper, ‘<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X1537024X">Suppressing AP1 factor signaling in suprabasal epidermis produces a keratoderma phenotype</a>’, following <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Letter-to-Journal-of-Inv-Dermatology.pdf">a letter from the university</a> in 2021. In February 2023, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AW_-Journal-of-Investigative-Dermatology-Retraction_correction-request.pdf">Vigues notified editor-in-chief</a> Erwin Tschachler about <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2023-02-21-Letter-to-J.-Inv.-Dermat.pdf">another two problematic articles</a>. One figure contained a Western blot that had been replicated three times, using a paint brush tool to conceal the splices, and copy-and-pasted data modified to make the bands look slightly different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tschachler responded a few days later, saying the editorial team “will publish the respective retractions/corrections in one of the up-coming issues of our Journal.” While neither article appears to have any published notice, Tschachler told <em>Retraction Watch</em> he had also been contacted by the US National Institutes of Health Office of Research Integrity, and said the journal would pursue retractions for the articles “given the pattern of misconduct.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>These 10 articles are still awaiting action:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Editors for <em>Carcinogenesis, Oncogene and Oncotarget </em>do not appear to have responded to alerts from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The editor in chief at <em>Carcinogenesis </em>said the editorial team is still investigating the university’s claims.</p>



<p>The Office of Scientific Integrity at <em>Oncotarget</em> said they “do not have records that anyone from the University contacted us about the papers in 2021,” though we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Letter-to-Oncotarget.pdf">obtained a letter addressed</a> to the journal’s EIC, Andrei Gudkov, dated January of that year. <em>Oncotarget</em>’s scientific integrity office wrote that an image forensic team is checking the paper, and would contact the authors if they found anything.<em> </em>After we shared that letter with the office, they said they would take “immediate action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EIC at <em>Oncogene</em> referred us to the publisher, Springer Nature, who hasn’t yet responded. The <em>Cancer Research</em> article was included in ORI’s findings, but not in the documents we obtained. The editor there has not responded to our queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the ORI, Eckert is also required to request retractions himself. Eckert has not responded to requests for comment.</p>
