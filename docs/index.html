<p>The study of skeletal development in mammalian species is difficult due to the technical and ethical challenges of collecting embryonic material. Fortunately, natural history museums contain broad collections that often include prenatal specimens.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors took advantage of one such museum collection to study ossification (bone formation) in 15 specimens from six species of mammalian carnivores: sea lion, mongoose, lion, fox, bear, and civet. They used micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to non-invasively evaluate the extent of bone formation in each specimen and were able to determine the order of ossification in these species.</p>
<p>The authors found that most of the species conformed to known ossification sequences of either canine or feline clades of carnivores, but that the sequence for sea lions diverged. They suggest that sea lion&#8217;s aquatic environment has affected prenatal development to differ from land mammals&#8217;.</p>

<p>Prediction of future COVID-19 waves is crucial to support decision-making regarding vaccine allocation and public health policy. However, many of the models used do not take into account effects of both vaccination and prior infections.</p>
<p>To address these shortcomings, the authors of this paper created predictive models that consider how combinations of vaccination and prior Omicron infection will protect populations from near-future outbreaks of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. They also considered population age demographics and the context of public health measures to reduce infection (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>They found that a variety of factors, including demography, health systems capacity, and vaccine efficacy, had critical effects on the benefits of vaccination and past infection in outbreak prevention. Understanding the interplay between these factors will be useful for tailoring outbreak prevention efforts.</p>

Laws on assisted dying vary around the world, and devising a new law for the UK is a complex matter. Issues to be considered include patient autonomy and protection of the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Twycross presents three different models of assisted dying legal in different countries with different requirements for patient eligibility. He then presents a &#8216;least worse&#8217; model with minimal physician involvement. Importantly, palliative-hospice care should not be involved, as some patient may decline to use such care for fear of overuse of drugs.</p>

<p>Prolonged sitting is known to be associated with numerous negative health outcomes, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Coffee, on the other hand, has been shown to be associated with reduced mortality. How these two common factors interact and balance is not known.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors studied the joint associations of daily sitting time and coffee intake with mortality from all-cause and CVD in nationally representative sample from the United States of America. Data on daily sitting time and coffee consumption for over ten thousand adults were included.</p>
<p>As expected, the authors found that longer sitting time and higher coffee consumption had opposite associations with mortality. Interestingly, the joint analysis showed that the association between higher sitting time and increased mortality was only present among adults who didn&#8217;t drink coffee, indicating a possible protective effect of coffee consumption.</p>

<p>Male partner involvement in antenatal care (ANC) is known to improve maternal outcomes as well as provide opportunities for HIV testing and counselling for men who might not otherwise have healthcare system contact. Generally, pregnant women invite their partners to attend ANC and HIV testing, but uptake is low.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors report the results of a randomized controlled trial that used a mobile phone intervention and clinic staff invitations to partners of women who attended ANC alone. Outcomes included male partner attendance at later ANC visits and utilization of HIV testing of male partners after the invitation.</p>
<p>The results showed that mobile phone invitations from clinic staff had a positive effect on both male partner ANC attendance and male partner HIV testing. This is a promising strategy to enhance male partner involvement in maternal care and improve health outcomes.</p>

<p>A group of researchers is taking <em>Nature </em>to task for publishing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w">paper</a> earlier this month about Google DeepMind’s protein folding prediction program without requiring the authors publish the code behind the work.</p>



<p>Roland Dunbrack, of Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, peer-reviewed the paper but was “not given access to code during the review,” the authors of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6ioZPbxiDZy5h4qxo-bHa0XOTOxEYHObht0SX8EgwfPHY_g/viewform">letter submitted yesterday</a>, May 14, to <em>Nature</em> – including Dunbrack – write, “despite repeated requests.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01385-x"><em>Nature</em> podcast</a> said AlphaFold3 – unlike AlphaFold2 – “can accurately predict protein-molecule complexes containing DNA, RNA and more. Although the new version is restricted to non-commercial use, researchers are excited by its greater range of predictive abilities and the prospect of speedier drug discovery.”</p>



<span id="more-129223"></span>



<p>Not everyone was excited. The authors of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6ioZPbxiDZy5h4qxo-bHa0XOTOxEYHObht0SX8EgwfPHY_g/viewform">letter, which co-author Stephanie A. Wankowicz of the University of California, San Francisco told Retraction Watch was submitted today to Nature</a>, write they “were disappointed with the lack of code, or even executables accompanying the publication of AlphaFold3 in <em>Nature</em>.” They continue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Although AlphaFold3 expands AlphaFold2’s capacities to include small molecules, nucleic acids, and chemical modifications, it was released without the means to test and use the software in a high-throughput manner. This does not align with the principles of scientific progress, which rely on the ability of the community to evaluate, use, and build upon existing work. The high-profile publication advertises capabilities that remain locked behind the doors of the parent company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors, who are circulating the letter for additional signatures, write that “the model&#8217;s limited availability on a hosted web server, capped at ten predictions per day, restricts the scientific community&#8217;s capacity to verify the broad claims of the findings or apply the predictions on a large scale. Specifically, the inability to make predictions on novel organic molecules akin to chemical probes and drugs, one of the central claims of the paper, makes it impossible to test or use this method.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01383-z">May 8 news story</a> by the independent team of journalists at <em>Nature</em> noted the restrictions. <em>Nature</em> editor in chief Magdalena Skipper told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>Nature</em> has a long-standing <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards#availability-of-computer-code">policy</a> designed to facilitate the availability of data, materials and code upon reasonable request. While seeking to enhance transparency at every opportunity, <em>Nature</em> accepts that there may be circumstances under which research data or code are not openly available. When making a decision on data and code availability, we reflect on many different factors, including the potential implications for biosecurity and the ethical challenges this presents. In such cases we work with the authors to provide alternatives that will support reproducibility, for example through the provision of pseudocode, which is made available to the reviewers during peer review.</p>



<p>As noted in the code availability statement in the paper: AlphaFold 3 is available as a non-commercial usage only server at <a href="https://www.alphafoldserver.com/">https://www.alphafoldserver.com</a>, with restrictions on allowed ligands and covalent modifications. Pseudocode describing the algorithms is available in the Supplementary Information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pseudocode, however, “will require months of effort to turn into workable code that approximates the performance, wasting valuable time and resources,” the authors of the letter write. “Even if such a reimplementation is attempted, restricted access raises questions about whether the results could be fully validated.”</p>



<p>The authors of the letter continue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When journals fail to enforce their written policies about <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards">making code available to reviewers</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/initial-submission">alongside publications</a>, they demonstrate how these policies are applied inequitably and how editorial decisions do not align with the needs of the scientific community. While there is an ever-changing landscape of how science is performed and communicated, journals should uphold their role in the community by ensuring that science is reproducible upon dissemination, regardless of who the authors are.</p>

<p>A professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia who once served as a dean at the Stevens Institute of Technology in the United States, has received expressions of concern on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText=expression%20of%20concern&amp;highlight=true&amp;returnFacets=ALL&amp;returnType=SEARCH&amp;matchPubs=true&amp;refinements=Author:Yehia%20Massoud&amp;refinements=Author:Y.%20Massoud">93 of his conference proceedings</a> for what a publisher said were irrelevant self-citations and “artificially inflating the number of citations.”</p>



<p>The notes by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) on the work of Yehia Massoud, a professor of electrical and computer engineering,  take two forms. One reads:</p>



<span id="more-129216"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Expression of Concern: Concerns were raised regarding the high number of self-citations included by the authors in the reference section of this article. A subsequent review of the citations by a duly constituted committee found that many are irrelevant to the work presented in the article, and that the addition of these citations artificially increased the citation impact of one of the authors of the article, Yehia Massoud. The addition of irrelevant self-citations is a violation of IEEE’s Publication Principles and community standards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Notes: Expression of Concern: After careful consideration by a duly constituted committee, an author of this article, Yehia Massoud, was found to have acted in violation of the IEEE Publication Principles by artificially inflating the number of citations to the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The EOCs were posted in mid-March, IEEE told Retraction Watch. All of the papers were published more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Massoud, who according to his <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/itl/people/person/yehia-massoud">bio</a> remains a fellow of the IEEE, told Retraction Watch he disagrees with the EOCs and is “exploring various avenues to have these expressions reconsidered:”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I respectfully disagree with the IEEE’s expressions, which amount to a difference of opinion on a subjective matter. These expressions relate to papers that were peer reviewed and editorially accepted for publication more than a decade ago. The inclusion of self-references in these papers was appropriate and is a common practice in pioneering fields for completeness, research continuity and transparency. I am exploring options to have these expressions of concern reconsidered and removed, including by working collaboratively with IEEE on a mutually agreeable resolution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Massoud had an <em>IEEE </em>paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6144484">retracted</a> sometime around 2012 for similar reasons as part of a massive purge of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.362.6413.393">some 7,000 articles</a>. As his bio notes:</p>



<p>Prior to Stevens, he served as the head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) between 2012 and 2017. During that period, the ECE department saw a considerable growth in research expenditures, research output, industrial partnerships, undergraduate and graduate student enrollments, unrestricted funds and gifts, and recognition. The department also rose 26 positions in the U.S. News &amp; World Report department rankings.</p>



<p>Such rankings, as <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1887">we’ve noted</a>, rely heavily on citation metrics.</p>

<p>A study published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth </em>explored the experiences of mothers of infants with orofacial clefts in Uganda, with the occurrence of cleft in children known to lead to feeding difficulties and malnutrition. The authors assessed the breastfeeding history of children with a cleft between 0 to 24 months old, including the use of prelacteal feeds, breast milk alternatives and feeding devices used.</p>
<p>Mothers of children with a cleft were invited to complete a survey and attend focus group discussions to explore their experiences of breastfeeding and the support they received. The study involved 32 mother-child pairs, with 25 mothers participating in the qualitative focus group and interviews. Participants frequently expressed difficulties with breastfeeding, with the use of cow’s milk often reported as an alternative due to the high cost of formula milk. The use of feeding devices was also frequently reported. Whilst participants indicated that family members and the hospital could provide social and feeding support, they also reported experiencing negative attitudes and social stigmatization from the community and shared concerns about their risk of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>The authors conclude improved national breastfeeding guidelines and encouraging mothers to share experiences via support groups may help reduce difficulties and improve psycho-social outcomes.</p>

<p>An article published in <em>BMC Oral Health</em> describes the development of a questionnaire to evaluate the understanding of cleft lip and palate (CLP) amongst recent dental graduates. In this study, a questionnaire to assess knowledge of CLP, early interventions, interdisciplinary care, and management options was developed and validated using three groups of subject matter experts, including orthodontists, paediatric dentists, and surgeons. The questionnaire was distributed to a cohort of graduates between the ages of 23 and 30 who were enrolled in a dental internship in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The authors identified that whilst graduates demonstrated a strong understanding of how to treat and manage CLP from a dental perspective, knowledge gaps were identified in aspects of care relating to possible risk factors and post-surgical complications. Additionally, whilst graduates identified the importance of interprofessional collaboration when managing CLP, knowledge of the specific roles of specialised healthcare professionals was not expressed by participants.</p>
<p>The authors propose that these knowledge gaps may be addressable by developing bespoke training and practical sessions during undergraduate education.</p>

<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an increased shift towards online and hybrid learning by higher education institutions, facilitating distance learning in undergraduate medical education. Whilst this has led to benefits such as the increased accessibility and geographical dissemination of resources and flexibility in learning options for students, online learning may be a barrier to education in regions with disparities in adequate internet access.</p>
<p>This study explored the outcomes of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on cleft lip and palate developed for undergraduate students in Indonesia in collaboration with Smile Train.  414 out of 717 participants completed the MOOC, with course competing students providing positive feedback about the course’s content and the support they received from teachers when enrolled. Challenges identified by students included difficulties with internet access, course scheduling and that some of the topics were perceived as being too advanced, which provides feedback for further course re-assignments.</p>
<p>Continued development of e-learning resources for undergraduate curricula may enhance the geographical dissemination of medical education and future quality of care in low resource settings, particularly for topics with known knowledge gaps such as cleft lip and palate.</p>

<p>The ability to generate high-quality images is a crucial part of surgical planning, for example when performing alveolar bone grafting for unilateral cleft lip and palate. Whilst traditional two-dimensional X-rays can be used, they may lack the detail required for precise planning. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans provide a comprehensive view of facial structures for alveolar bone graft, enabling surgeons to plan the grafting procedure more accurately and assess post-surgery outcomes.</p>
<p>The authors of a study in <em>BMC Oral Health</em> describe the application of a machine learning model using 3D U-net to automatically detect morphometric changes in scans taken before and after secondary alveolar bone grafting to assess the impact on the growth and development of the maxilla post-surgery. The study involved the analysis of archived images from 32 patients who had not previously undergone surgery or orthodontic treatment. Using the improved efficiency and accuracy of the machine learning model, the authors observed differences in growth trends between the cleft and non-cleft sides of the maxilla following surgery, with secondary alveolar bone grafting appearing to have a positive effect on the length of the maxilla and alveolar ridge, but limited benefit to the height and width of the maxilla on the cleft side.</p>
<p>More in-depth image analysis with machine learning methods may help improve surgical outcomes and inform better treatment approaches.</p>

<p>An Elsevier chemistry journal has marked <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?qs=%22expression%20of%20concern%22&amp;pub=Chemosphere&amp;cid=271852&amp;sortBy=date">more than 60 papers</a> with expressions of concern amid an investigation involving potential undisclosed conflicts of interest among editors, authorship irregularities and manipulation of peer reviews and citations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524008816">One of the notices</a>, published online April 11 in <em>Chemosphere</em>, reads, for example:</p>



<span id="more-129212"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been brought to the attention of the journal regarding:</p>



<ul>
<li>unusual changes to the authorship of the article prior to publication.</li>



<li>potential undisclosed conflicts of interest by a reviewer.</li>



<li>potential undisclosed conflicts of interest by the editor who handled the peer-review process for the article.</li>
</ul>



<p>The journal editors are investigating the article, including contacting the authors, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and Elsevier&#8217;s policies.</p>



<p>The Expression of Concern will remain appended to the article until the investigation has been completed. If the editors can reach a conclusion, they will take any action that is deemed necessary. If the editors have determined that they cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion with the information available to them, a further notification will be published to update the community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher would not share further details about its efforts, telling us only:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics team is investigating a series of articles published in Chemosphere.&nbsp; In line with our Article Correction, Retraction &amp; Removal Policy, we have published temporary Expressions of Concern against a series of papers where investigations are ongoing and may take considerable time to conclude (<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/article-withdrawal#3-expressions-of-concern">https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/article-withdrawal#3-expressions-of-concern</a>).&nbsp;We will update the community on the outcome of the investigations in due course with further notices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sleuths have flagged dozens of publications in <em>Chemosphere</em>. In December, for instance, an anonymous PubPeer comment listed several papers that were “part of a potential breach in the publication ethics as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/87A4CAC90B526F773F36C93BC737B4">the editor is linked with the authors</a>.” In other cases, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/32B04AD9A0235DD21932848B9CF773">the handling editor was also an author</a> of the paper, another post pointed out.</p>



<p>The notices started to appear online in March. Papers in both special&nbsp; and regular issues of the journal seem to be affected.</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal last week retracted a paper by two senior economists who used <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/05/no-data-no-problem-undisclosed-tinkering-in-excel-behind-economics-paper/">questionable methods</a> to replace large chunks of missing observations in their dataset without disclosing the procedure.</p>



<p>The move follows a Retraction Watch story published in February that revealed the paper’s corresponding author, <a href="https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=hesalm&amp;lang=en">Almas Heshmati</a> of Jönköping University in Sweden, used Excel’s autofill function and other undisclosed operations to populate thousands of empty cells, or well over 10% of the dataset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a guest post on our blog, economist Gary Smith argued Heshmati and his coauthor had&nbsp; “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/21/how-not-to-deal-with-missing-data-an-economists-take-on-a-controversial-study/">no justification</a>” for not describing what they had done. Smith also commented in <a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2024/02/retracted-paper-is-a-compelling-case-for-reform/">an article</a> for <em>Mind Matters</em> that “<a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2024/02/retracted-paper-is-a-compelling-case-for-reform/">the solution to an absence of data is not to fabricate data</a>.”</p>



<p>Less than three weeks after our report, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/22/exclusive-elsevier-to-retract-paper-by-economist-who-failed-to-disclose-data-tinkering/">Elsevier told us</a> it would pull the study, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022503">Green innovations and patents in OECD countries</a>,” which appeared last year in the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>. On May 4, the publisher issued a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018560">retraction notice</a> stating:</p>



<span id="more-129194"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns were raised about the data in this paper post-publication. The first author confirmed to the Editors that the data contained many gaps across countries and over time. The majority of the missing unit values appeared in beginning and end year years (1990–1992 and 2017–2018). To represent country data over time, the first author imputed the missing unit values using forward and backward trends based on three consecutive values in Excel. The first author claims that this resulted in a balanced dataset inclusive of the sample countries and further states that the imputation of missing values based on variable—specific trend will not change the result and large number of observations will produce more stable estimated coefficients.</p>



<p>However, the first author agrees that he has not explained the imputation in the data section of the article and the effects that the imputed data has on the result has not been tested. Since a total of 36 variables had missing units, few observations would have remained.</p>



<p>The Editors and the authors have concluded that the findings of the paper may be biased.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heshmati did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His paper has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including once in February.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0B5019C56E0A6ADCC0E1A2E485FDB8#5">PubPeer comment on the retraction</a>, sleuth Alexander Magazinov said “the imputation as described in the note is way more benign than the one described in the Retraction Watch blog post. Which description is more accurate?”</p>



<p>Heshmati has used the same dataset in past research. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/22/exclusive-elsevier-to-retract-paper-by-economist-who-failed-to-disclose-data-tinkering/">we reported</a> in February:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In 2020, he and two colleagues published <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-020-01986-1">a paper</a> in Empirical Economics, a Springer Nature title, that bore strong resemblance to the 2023 article and relied on the same patched-up dataset. The article mentioned neither the data gaps nor the Excel operations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher told us at the time it was “looking into the matter carefully.” In a May 9 email, however, Deborah Kendall-Cheeseman, a communications manager at Springer Nature, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I’m afraid we don’t have an update we can share at the moment but we’ll let you know once we do.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/paul-mccrory.jpeg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="214" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/paul-mccrory.jpeg?resize=214%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-124354" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Paul McCrory</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>More than two years after retracting an article by one of its former editors in chief for plagiarism, the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> has retracted six more pieces by the editor, Paul McCrory, a noted concussion researcher in Australia.</p>



<p>The retractions join 11 more of McCrory’s works, including 10 from <em>BJSM </em>and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/JSR.0000000000001125">one from <em>Current Sports Medicine Reports</em></a>.The <em>BJSM</em>, published by The BMJ, is also correcting two additional articles by McCrory.</p>



<p>Troubles for McCrory – for decades “the world’s foremost doctor shaping the concussion protocols that are used by sports leagues and organizations globally,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/sports/football/paul-mccrory-plagiarism-concussions.html">according to the <em>New York Times</em></a> – began in 2021 when Steve Haake, a professor at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/28/this-is-frankly-insulting-an-author-plagiarized-by-a-journal-editor-speaks/">told the <em>BJSM</em></a> McCrory had plagiarized a 2000 article by Haake in <em>Physics World</em>. (It would <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/11/neri-oxman-accused-of-lifting-from-article-whose-plagiarism-led-to-downfall-of-concussion-expert/">not be the only time</a> the work was plagiarized.)</p>



<span id="more-129190"></span>



<p>The journal retracted the offending editorial in February 2022, with McCrory apologizing for the “isolated incident.” McCrory told us at the time that he was “sincerely sorry that this has happened and caused [Haake] and his team hurt.” He said he would be requesting another of his articles be retracted.</p>



<p>By then, however, sleuth Nick Brown had started looking into McCrory’s work, and he <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/02/was-leading-sports-medicine-researchers-plagiarism-an-isolated-and-unfortunate-incident/">found more problems</a>. In October of that year, the journal retracted <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/10/concussion-researcher-paul-mccrory-earns-nine-more-retractions-nearly-40-expressions-of-concern/">nine more of McCrory’s single-authored editorials</a>, and placed expressions of concern on nearly 40, the total they said they could find in their archives. They revised that number upward significantly after we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/16/bmj-says-its-an-ongoing-effort-to-find-articles-by-concussion-researcher-paul-mccrory/">pointed out that we found 78 such articles</a>, and told us the expressions of concern would remain unless they were replaced with retraction notices.</p>



<p>McCrory, whose University of Melbourne email address no longer seems to work, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/concussion-kingpin-resigns-global-post-over-plagiarism-scandal">resigned from key posts</a> in the wake of the scandal. The <em>BJSM </em>said he <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/23/1327.responses">agreed with the new retractions</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement today, the journal said the retractions and corrections “conclude BMJ’s investigation into research integrity issues concerning Paul McCrory.” The University of Melbourne had also requested an investigation, the journal said.</p>



<p>“As no further concerns have been raised with BMJ about Dr McCrory’s authorship in BMJ journals, no further action will be taken,” Helen Macdonald, the BMJ’s publication ethics and content integrity editor, said in the statement.</p>



<p>Macdonald left open the possibility the McCrory saga is not over: “But should any further allegations be made about Dr McCrory’s work published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine or in any of the other titles in BMJ’s journal portfolio, these will be investigated.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/diagnosis-of-early-dementia-blood-proteins-reveal-potential-risk">Diagnosis of early dementia: blood proteins reveal potential risk</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p>A recent study published in Nature has identified blood protein biomarkers that could be used to predict the risk of developing dementia, up to 15 years before diagnosis in clinic. Given that there is currently no cure, early preventative action could prove crucial in our fight against dementia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the time of presenting to the clinic, when a person is experiencing symptoms that impact on their daily life, the pathology in the brain is typically very advanced. Any potential treatment options or interventions may be being delivered too late. However, these potential treatments can have much more impact on slowing, stopping, or reversing decline if we can intervene earlier before significant damage is done. Dementia is very difficult to treat, but early detection affords new opportunities for early intervention.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Guo et al. analysed data from 52,645 adults (without a dementia diagnosis) who were followed up for up to 14.1 years, with their blood samples analysed repeatedly over this time. By the end of the study period, 1,417 of these participants had developed dementia. Using data from the UK Biobank, it was found that of 1,463 proteins in the blood plasma, changes in the levels of two proteins, GFAP and LTBP2, had high specificity for predicting cases of dementia. This study is a great example of how advances in proteomics and other scientific techniques can be used to provide new insights into large longitudinal datasets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A biomarker is an objective indication of disease that can be accurately and reproducibly measured.  Blood biomarkers are particularly promising, as they are minimally invasive to obtain and relatively cheap to process. This in turn means that they are also a scalable option, suitable to screen large numbers of the population for early signs of disease – in this case, dementia. The Guo et al. study concludes that people with high levels of a specific protein in their blood are more than twice as likely as people with normal levels to develop dementia, and nearly three times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nonetheless, whilst the findings are promising, we must be cautious. Further validation of the new potential blood-based biomarkers is needed and a better understanding of how these changes in protein differ between disease must be a focus for future research.</p>

As we grapple with pressing challenges such as climate change, food security, and biodiversity loss, the importance of innovative agricultural practices has never been more critical.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the journal&#8217;s heart is sustainability; sustainable agricultural practices can protect habitats and watersheds, improve soil health and water quality as well as enhance animal welfare and husbandry practices.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Agriculture is at the heart of human survival and prosperity, but it also faces immense pressures from environmental changes and the growing needs of a global population. <em>BMC Agriculture</em> aims to address these issues by advancing research in areas such as  crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry.  It joins our expanding portfolio of journals covering these topics, including <a href="https://bmcenvsci.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Environmental Science</em></a>, launched only last year and <a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Veterinary Research</em></a>, one of our earliest <em>BMC series</em> journals. At the journal&#8217;s heart is sustainability; sustainable agricultural practices can protect habitats and watersheds, improve soil health and water quality as well as enhance animal welfare and husbandry practices.</span></p>
<p>Aligned with the objectives of the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>, <em>BMC Agriculture</em> particularly encourages papers focused on zero hunger (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2">SDG2</a>), good health and well-being (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">SDG3</a>), clean water and sanitation (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">SDG6</a>), responsible consumption and production (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">SDG12</a>), climate action (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13">SDG13</a>), life below water (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14">SDG14</a>) and life on land (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15">SDG15</a>).

<br /><p>Much development has been directed toward improving the performance and automation of spike sorting. This continuous development, while essential, has contributed to an over-saturation of new, incompatible tools that hinders rigorous benchmarking and complicates reproducible analysis. To address these limitations, we developed SpikeInterface, a Python framework designed to unify preexisting spike sorting technologies into a single codebase and to facilitate straightforward comparison and adoption of different approaches. With a few lines of code, researchers can reproducibly run, compare, and benchmark most modern spike sorting algorithms; pre-process, post-process, and visualize extracellular datasets; validate, curate, and export sorting outputs; and more. In this paper, we provide an overview of SpikeInterface and, with applications to real and simulated datasets, demonstrate how it can be utilized to reduce the burden of manual curation and to more comprehensively benchmark automated spike&nbsp;sorters.</p>

<p>On March 1, 2022, Eric Ross, then a psychiatrist-in-training in Boston, alerted two major publishers to a pair of disturbingly similar papers he suspected had been “fabricated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The articles are written by the same corresponding author and contain much of the same unrealistic data,” Ross, now an assistant professor at the University of Vermont, in Burlington, wrote in an email whose recipients included the editors-in-chief of Wiley’s <em>CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics</em> and Springer Nature’s <em>Neurotherapeutics.</em></p>



<p>Ross listed several “red flags” he felt clearly pointed to “research misconduct” in the two papers, which reported on two separate clinical trials of new antidepressant add-on medications (metformin and cilostazol). He also emphasized that fake medical research could have real consequences:</p>



<span id="more-129183"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Research misconduct is damaging in any field, but I am particularly disturbed by these articles. Besides its harms to the research community, a fabricated clinical trial with clinically actionable conclusions has the potential to do real and immediate harm to patients. I have already seen one of these articles picked up for discussion on a popular psychiatry podcast; I would hate to see clinicians begin acting on this information in their practice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then he waited.</p>



<p>After six months, <em>Neurotherapeutics</em> pulled one of the studies, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-022-01291-y">stating</a> in a Sept. 7, 2022, notice, “there are serious issues with the ethical oversight, the reporting and the availability of audited data for this clinical trial.” Yet nearly a year after Ross’s email, the paper in <em>CNS Neuroscience &amp; Therapeutics </em>remained in place, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/08/i-was-fired-up-psychiatrist-effort-prompts-retraction-of-antidepressant-treatment-paper/">we reported</a> in February 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think this was [a case] where it took a lot of, you know, complex sleuthing, like doing statistical analysis or anything like that, to be very suspicious about these papers,” Ross told us at the time.</p>



<p>Now, after two years, the Wiley journal has finally issued a retraction. In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.14667">a March 11 notice</a>, the publisher stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, multiple concerns were raised by a third party about the integrity of the clinical trial. An investigation revealed significant issues regarding the reliability of the reported data. As a result, the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the validity of the results presented in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 11 times since Ross first contacted the journal, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science &#8212; including by a Hindawi/Wiley journal paper that was since <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2024/9860462/">retracted for likely paper mill activity</a>.</p>



<p>We contacted Wiley on Friday to learn what caused the long delay, particularly given Springer Nature’s previous retraction, but have yet to hear back from the publisher, which recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">trumpeted its efforts</a> to retract thousands of paper mill articles from its Hindawi subsidiary. An email seeking comment from the corresponding author of the two papers, Mahmoud S. Abdallah of the University of Sadat City, in Egypt, also went unanswered.</p>
