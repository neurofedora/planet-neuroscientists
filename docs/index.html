<p>When researchers with disabilities, such as blindness or dyslexia, cannot access the research papers in their field, can we really call it &#8220;open&#8221; science?</p>
<p>On April 17th, arXiv will be hosting a half-day online forum for everyone invested in making research outputs accessible to every researcher, regardless of disability. The forum will center the experiences of academic researchers who face barriers to accessing and reading papers, and will be useful for people across the authoring and publishing ecosystem. <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html">We hope you will join us</a>. Together, we can chart a path towards fully accessible research papers, and leave with practical next steps for our own organizations.</p>
<h2>Why a forum?</h2>
<p>In December, arXiv <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.07286">published our research results on the accessibility of research papers</a> in preparation for improving the accessibility of the arXiv corpus. What we heard from researchers is that not only are the vast majority of papers not fully accessible, but that efforts to improve those outcomes have largely stalled.</p>
<p>As we work on offering HTML versions of papers published on arXiv alongside the existing PDF and source files, we also discovered how intertwined our efforts are with those of authors, authoring tools, publishers, conferences, standards, and more. We are part of an ecosystem and hope others who are also committed to making accessible research papers a reality will join us for informative presentations, a panel discussion, and digging more deeply into specific challenges in breakout discussion groups. <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html">Learn more about the forum here</a>, and <a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_br1lFL94OVQB5nE">register for free</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beethoven-hair-dna-composer-death">DNA from Beethoven’s hair hints at what killed the composer</a></h4>

              
                <p>DNA from strands of Beethoven’s hair is helping to uncover what may have caused his death, researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The composer was plagued with health issues for most of his life. On March 26, 1827, he succumbed to what many historians suspect was liver failure while in his apartment in Vienna. Now, an analysis of several locks of hair passed down through families and gathered by collectors shows that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00181-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beethoven carried several genetic risk factors for liver disease</a>, the scientists report March 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>This elevated risk — paired with a potential liver infection and the composer’s alleged drinking habits — may have hastened Beethoven’s premature death at the age of 56, says Tristan Begg, a biological anthropologist at the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>It’s well-known that Beethoven’s storied career was cut short by progressive hearing loss that left the composer completely deaf by age 45. Beethoven also suffered from gastrointestinal issues and a deteriorating liver. That faulty organ is thought to be responsible for the composer’s skin reportedly turning yellow in the summer of 1821. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The root cause of Beethoven’s plethora of health issues has been a source of fascination to many. But working out what ailed a man that lived nearly two centuries ago is no easy task. Researchers have had to rely on notes from the composer’s two autopsies, preformed after he was exhumed in 1863 and 1888, and other historical documents.</p>

Genetic analyses are helping to uncover the source of some of his ailments.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123009">Beethoven-Haus Bonn</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Clues, however, could hide in Beethoven’s DNA. Only a few historical figures — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/genetic-tests-confirm-remains-are-those-king-richard-iii">such as Richard III</a> — have had their DNA analyzed (<em>SN: 12/2/14</em>). But these genetic treasure troves can provide information that “no anatomical examination, after two hundred years, could provide,” says Carles Lalueza-Fox, a paleogeneticist at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>In 2014, Begg and his colleagues decided to reconstruct Beethoven’s genetic instruction book, or genome. First, the team needed a piece of the composer himself. Luckily, around 30 separate locks of hair attributed to Beethoven had survived, in the possession of collectors and the descendants of people who first received the hair in the 19th century.</p>



<p>Begg partnered with Beethoven enthusiasts to ask the owners of these locks to part with a few strands. The team was able to gather samples from eight locks said to have been snipped from 1821 to 1827.</p>





<p>One lock didn’t yield enough DNA for analysis. Of the others, two locks could not have come from the composer; one belonged to a woman with an ancestry consistent with Ashkenazi Jews, the researchers found. But five of the locks, which came from various sources, clearly belong to a single individual with central European ancestry, which Beethoven would have had. The natural degradation of DNA over time in these locks was also consistent with the hair dating to the early 19th century.</p>



<p>Those common features — along with a clear record of who owned these separate locks of hair over the centuries — makes Begg “extremely confident” that these locks are Beethoven’s.</p>



<p>Lalueza-Fox agrees. “I think they provide compelling evidence of five samples being from the composer,” he says.</p>



<p>The researchers used some of the best-preserved locks to reconstruct the composer’s genome. This analysis didn’t uncover any genetic markers for deafness or intestinal issues. But the team did identify several risk factors for liver disease, including a variant of the gene <em>PNPLA3 </em>that would have tripled the composer’s risk of developing liver issues in his lifetime.</p>



<p>Those risk factors alone shouldn’t have doomed Beethoven. But the scientists also found traces of the hepatitis B virus, which damages livers, in one of the strands reportedly collected shortly after Beethoven’s death. The risk to the liver from a hepatitis B infection would have been further compounded by regular alcohol use, the researchers say. Some contemporaries claimed that the composer was drinking heavily by the end of his life.</p>



<p>While we don’t know exactly what combination of factors killed Beethoven, “this is a fascinating detective story,” says Ian Gilmore, a hepatologist at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in England, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>A fascinating story with a new twist: The Y chromosome in the five hair samples doesn’t match those of five people who share a 14th century ancestor with Beethoven. (The composer never had any known children.) This could be a sign that the hair is inauthentic. Or, more likely, one of Beethoven’s direct ancestors on his father’s side had a child outside of marriage, possibly sometime between the 14th and 16th centuries, Begg says.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780262047548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Off-Earth</a><br><em>Erika Nesvold<br>MIT Press, $27.95</em></p>



<p>Astrophysicist Erika Nesvold once asked an executive of a company aiming to mine the moon how he planned to address risks that mining equipment might carry <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manned-mission-mars-humans-microbes-life">microbes from Earth and contaminate the moon</a> (<em>SN: 1/10/18</em>). His response: “We’ll worry about that later.”</p>



<p>That’s a reckless mind-set when it comes to preparing for people to live and work in space, Nesvold argues in her new book, <em>Off-Earth</em>. It means making decisions with your eyes closed. History is full of cautionary tales of mutinies, exploitation, and humanitarian and ecological disasters that would be all too easy to reproduce in space.</p>





<p>“Space settlement advocates often advertise space as a blank slate where we can build utopian societies free from the crowded territory and bloodied history of our terrestrial home,” Nesvold writes. “But adopting a ‘worry about it later’ attitude toward human rights and ethics strikes me as a path to repeating the tragedies of that history through ignorance.”</p>



<p>Nesvold is a developer for the education software/video game <a href="https://universesandbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Universe Sandbox</em></a>. In the last several years, she has shifted her focus to how to build a fair and just future in space, cofounding the <a href="https://justspacealliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JustSpace Alliance</a>, a nonprofit working to do just that. <em>Off-Earth</em> is an extension of her 2017 podcast, <a href="https://makingnewworlds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Making New Worlds</em></a>, which asked ethical questions about space settlement. The book takes some of the same questions and expands on them. Each chapter title is a question: “Why are we going?” “Who gets to go?” “Who’s in charge?” “What if I get sick?” “Which way is Mecca?”</p>



<p>Most chapters start with three vignettes, usually from different time periods. A chapter outlining debates over whether to settle space at all starts by asking the reader to imagine being in the 1600s and deciding to uproot your family and head to the New World. A chapter on how land usage and ownership rights might work in space imagines a person recently freed from slavery in the U.S. South in 1865 and worrying that the new president will take back the land they finally own. A chapter on the ethical questions that will arise when people get sick in space conjures a hospital worker in 2020 making gut-wrenching triage decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The third vignette is usually set in the year 2100, on a space settlement.</p>



<p>Then Nesvold examines how various ethical scenarios related to the chapter’s theme might play out in space. She quotes experts in fields that don’t often come up in space science: ethics, philosophy, Indigenous history, law.</p>



<p>This approach is a departure from many books about the future of life on the final frontier, forcing readers to confront hard realities and possible points of friction. A lot of arguments for moving humankind off Earth assume space is a land of infinite resources. But at least at first, settlers will have much more limited resources than they did on Earth. And situations where humans are isolated with limited resources, like on ships or in colonial settlements, have often been recipes for disaster.</p>





<p>So how will space settlers share what little they have? How will they decide who lives and dies, and what quality of life and death they’ll have? Will living in the harsh conditions of an early space settlement nurture innovation and creative progress, or encourage humankind’s worst tendencies toward exploitation and tyranny?</p>



<p>Most of these questions don’t have clear answers. That’s partly because ethical questions rarely do. The book “has undoubtedly revealed much about my own political opinions and priorities, not to mention the influence of my personal background and the culture in which I was raised,” Nesvold writes. “In the same way, your position on these issues is likely deeply connected with your own values and beliefs.”</p>



<p>Finding answers is also challenging because it requires anticipating what our descendants, who will live in the space communities we are already creating, will want, need and believe. To have the best chance of avoiding disaster, the time to consider these questions is now, not later, even though space settlement may be decades or centuries away, Nesvold argues.</p>



<p><em>Off-Earth</em> should be required reading for anyone who dreams about living in space. Space is not a blank slate, but imagining a better world there can help us build one — and can help make our earthbound civilizations better too.</p>

<p>The move comes seven years after the journal <em>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</em> (<em>BBA</em>) was first made aware of potential problems with a figure in Demasi&#8217;s paper that showed Western blots. It marks the third time one of the former researcher&#8217;s scientific publications has been officially <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/26/controversial-australian-journalists-paper-flagged-journal/">flagged as concerning</a> or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/29/journal-retracts-paper-by-controversial-australian-journalist/">retracted</a>.</p>



<p>Demasi, who <a href="https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/22067">earned her PhD</a> from the University of Adelaide in 2004, has been in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/opinion/do-mask-mandates-work.html">news</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/03/face-masks-work-study/">recently</a> after she did a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/opinion/masks-work-cochrane-study.html">controversial interview</a> with the <a href="https://drtomjefferson.com/">lead author</a> of a <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full">Cochrane review</a> that cast doubt on face masks. She has drawn <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/catalyst-challenges-the-mainstream/9980708">frequent</a> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/catalyst-cops-criticism-over-wi-fried/9973056">rebuke</a> over the past decade, beginning with a 2013 program in which her reporting questioned statins. She and her co-authors <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/29/journal-retracts-paper-by-controversial-australian-journalist/">told us</a> in 2018 that they believe her work as a journalist made her research a target of criticism.</p>



<span id="more-126749"></span>



<p>Following a yearslong probe by the university into allegations of image manipulation in Demasi’s PhD thesis, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/09/controversial-australian-science-journalist-admits-to-duplication-in-her-phd-thesis/">she admitted</a> she had &#8220;duplicated or probably duplicated&#8221; some images. However, as we reported earlier, this practice was felt to have been acceptable at the time and Demasi was not found guilty of research misconduct.</p>



<p>In its new notice, published March 11, <em>BBA</em> referred to another probe:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following an investigation by the Central Adelaide Local Health Networks (CALHN) panel, concerns have been raised relating to the veracity of the data presented in Fig. 6. These concerns cannot be resolved since the original data are no longer available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The problematic images were first spotted in 2016 by <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/david-vaux">David Vaux</a> of the Walter &amp; Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne (Vaux is a member of the board of directors of The Center for Scientific Integrity, our parent non-profit organization). He shared his misgivings with <em>BBA</em> and the University of Adelaide that same year, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/21/paper-co-authored-by-australian-journalist-maryanne-demasi-to-be-marked-with-expression-of-concern/">we reported earlier</a>. The journal told him the paper would receive an expression of concern in October, but the notice did not appear until this month&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaux welcomed the new development, but told us in an email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While having the original data might have helped them determine which of the authors was responsible for making the figure, the availability of the original images is not necessary to show, on balance of probabilities, that parts of the image had been duplicated and altered.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Judging by <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0C11C249612DEB7B759439A8676A7D#3">a comment she left</a> on PubPeer in 2021, sleuth Elisabeth Bik seems to agree:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Not only appear the four lanes to be showing the same blot strip, the molecular weights and aspect ratios appear to have changed as well, suggesting this is not a simple mistake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Vaux also pointed out that an earlier comment on PubPeer had also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0C11C249612DEB7B759439A8676A7D#2">raised concerns</a> about other images in the paper that were not addressed in the journal&#8217;s statement. According to that comment:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All points are same in Fig. 2A and Demasi [PhD] thesis Fig. 7.5 except 18 hr hypoxia point, which has different mean and SEMs. Could the authors please explain?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed Demasi as well as the corresponding and first authors, but have not heard back.</p>



<p>Their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388198106002721">paper</a>, titled &#8220;Endothelial cell COX-2 expression and activity in hypoxia,&#8221; was published in 2006. It has been cited 31 times, including twice this year, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The authors &#8220;would like us to believe the [paper&#8217;s] conclusions are not affected, as concerns have not been raised about Figs. 3, 4, and 5,&#8221; Vaux told us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hormone-shot-drunk-mice-sober-quickly">A hormone shot helped drunk mice sober up quickly</a></h4>

              
                <p>The only cure to being drunk is to wait it out. But that might not always be the case: Injecting drunk mice with a naturally occurring hormone helped them sober up more quickly than they otherwise would have, a new study shows.</p>



<p>Mice that received a shot of FGF21 — a hormone made by the liver — <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00041-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woke up from a drunken stupor roughly twice as fast </a>as those that didn’t, researchers report in the March 7 <em>Cell Metabolism</em>.</p>





<p>The find could one day be used to help treat alcohol poisoning, a sometimes-deadly side effect of heavy drinking that lands millions of people in the emergency room every year, says molecular endocrinologist David Mangelsdorf.</p>



<p>The sobering effect of FGF21 isn’t the first time the hormone has been linked to drinking. Scientists have previously shown that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877817305525?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livers ramp up production of this hormone</a> when alcohol floods the bloodstream. And while FGF21 doesn’t help break down alcohol, researchers have found that the hormone can help protect livers from the toxic effects of liquor while dampening the desire to continue drinking in mice and monkeys.</p>



<p>Those findings made Mangelsdorf, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and his colleagues curious whether FGF21 also plays a role in recovering from too much alcohol. So the team fed mice enough alcohol to knock them out and waited to see how long it took for them to wake up.</p>



<p>Mice that were genetically altered to be unable to produce their own FGF21 took around an hour and a half longer to wake up than normal mice. But regular mice given an extra dose of FGF21 woke up twice as fast than those that hadn’t received a shot. Drunk mice that were injected with FGF21 were also able to keep their balance for longer than their peers while placed on a slowly rotating platform.</p>



<p>FGF21 probably helps mice sober up by activating nerve cells in a part of the brain involved with stimulating wakefulness, the researchers say. If the hormone works in similar ways in people, it could be used to nudge people suffering from alcohol poisoning back into wakefulness, Mangelsdorf says.</p>



<p>That ability could be useful because — aside from the hazard of choking while unconscious — doctors sometimes must wait for people with alcohol poisoning to wake up before being able to address their symptoms.</p>



<p>“There is no drug for treating alcohol poisoning,” Mangelsdorf says. A drug that could help people wake up — much in the same way that the medication <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/opioid-crisis-overdose-death&#039;">Narcan prods consciousness along in opioid overdoses</a> — would be a “phenomenal” improvement for treating people rushed to the emergency room, he says (<em>SN: 3/29/18</em>).</p>





<p>Researchers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-cure-intoxication-sober">found ways to sober up mice before</a>, but these treatments didn’t work well in people (<em>SN: 11/29/22</em>). FGF21 might be a different story, Mangelsdorf thinks, because of the previous research on the hormone in monkeys, which are more like humans than mice.</p>



<p>Any drugs derived from FGF21 wouldn’t have to stick to treating alcohol poisoning. Researchers are also looking to use the hormone to address liver disease and alcohol addiction, says Lorenzo Leggio, a physician scientist with the National Institutes of Health who is based in Baltimore and was not involved with the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Leggio says, this study adds “an important piece to the puzzle” for understanding the role of FGF21 and developing new treatments for alcohol addiction and other ailments.</p>

<p>Nineteen journals from the open-access publisher Hindawi were removed from Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science Monday when the indexer refreshed its Master Journal List. </p>



<p>The delistings follow a disclosure by Wiley, which bought Hindawi in 2021, that the company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">suspended publishing special issues</a> for three months because of “compromised articles.” That lost the company $9 million in revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate updates its Master Journal List of titles included in Web of Science on a monthly basis. It dropped more than 50 journals from its indexes in March, according to a <a href="https://clarivate.com/blog/supporting-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record-our-commitment-to-curation-and-selectivity-in-the-web-of-science/">blog post</a> by Nandita Quaderi, editor in chief and vice president of Web of Science, for failing to meet <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">24 quality criteria</a> such as adequate peer review, appropriate citations, and content that’s relevant to the stated scope of the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delisting 50 journals at once is more than usual for Clarivate, and may be the beginning of a larger culling. Quaderi wrote that the company developed an AI tool “to help us identify outlier characteristics that indicate that a journal may no longer meet our quality criteria.” The tool flagged more than 500 journals at the beginning of this year, according to her blog post, and Web of Science’s editors continue to investigate them.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126734"></span>



<p>Removing a journal from Web of Science means Clarivate will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor, which can have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">negative effects for authors</a>, as universities rely on such metrics to judge researchers’ work for tenure and promotion decisions. The company also suppresses journals from its yearly Journal Citation Report that publishes impact factors, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">we’ve reported</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">in the past</a>.</p>



<p>The data company does <s>has a new policy</s> not to publish a list of journals removed from Web of Science, a Clarivate spokesperson told us, though it does say which journals it suppresses from its Journal Citation Report. We compared the <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/collection-list-downloads">new lists of journals</a> included in the four indices of the Web of Science Core Collection with the lists from last month to identify journals that were delisted. We identified <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><s>83 </s>82 delisted titles</a>, which a Clarivate spokesperson told us included journals removed for “not meeting production requirements.” [See update at the end of this post.]</p>



<p>Hindawi confirmed to Retraction Watch that the following 19 journals were delisted from Web of Science:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em></li>



<li><em>Biomed Research International</em></li>



<li><em>Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine</em></li>



<li><em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em></li>



<li><em>Contrast Media &amp; Molecular Imaging</em></li>



<li><em>Disease Markers</em></li>



<li><em>Education Research International</em></li>



<li><em>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</em></li>



<li><em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em></li>



<li><em>Journal of Healthcare Engineering</em></li>



<li><em>Journal of Nanomaterials</em></li>



<li><em>Journal of Oncology</em></li>



<li><em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em></li>



<li><em>Mobile Information Systems</em></li>



<li><em>Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</em></li>



<li><em>Scanning</em></li>



<li><em>Scientific Programming</em></li>



<li><em>Security and Communication Networks</em></li>



<li><em>Wireless Communications &amp; Mobile Computing</em></li>
</ol>



<p>We’ve previously reported on issues with the content of several of the journals on the list: A special issue of <em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em> hosted the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">Twitter-famous paper</a> with capital Ts standing in for error bars, and an investigation by Hong Kong Polytechnic University found that one of its PhD students let a former professor “borrow” his email account to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">edit two special issues</a> of the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em> and <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Hindawi and Wiley said last year that they were retracting more than <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">500 papers linked to peer review rings</a>.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv">analysis of papermill activity</a> in Hindawi journals, sleuth Dorothy Bishop looked at special issues from ten journals, nine of which were among those delisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was pleased to see that these journals have been delisted,” Bishop told us, “because their inclusion in Clarivate’s Web of Science seemed inappropriate because they were publishing many articles from paper mills, where the editorial and/or review process appeared to be compromised.”</p>



<p>Paper mills targeted the journals, Bishop said, “precisely because they are included in Web of Science, which gives them kudos and means that any citations count towards indicators such as H-index, which is used by many institutions in hiring and promotion.”</p>



<p>“I feel sorry for the honest authors who have published in these journals,” she said, “as they will find their publications tainted by association with these journals.”</p>



<p>Separately, the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> recently delisted 10 Hindawi journals, all of which were also delisted from Web of Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wiley has taken important actions to address research integrity challenges impacting Hindawi’s Special Issues,” Jay Flynn, executive vice president and general manager of Wiley’s research division told us in a statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Once we identified misconduct in the external peer review process, we immediately paused the publication of special issues, purged bad actors and implemented rigorous new checks throughout our publishing workflows. Additionally, we added expert staffing, increased editorial controls, introduced AI-based screening tools, and accelerated the retraction process to ensure the integrity of the scholarly record. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though integrity challenges are an issue across the industry, we are confident in the value and demand for research publishing and steadfast in our commitment to research integrity as we serve researchers around the globe who deliver life-changing findings every day. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We take full responsibility for the quality of the content we publish at Wiley. We also must work together as an industry to strengthen the lines of defense against those attempting to subvert the scholarly record. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 2200 UTC, 3/22/23: After this post was published, the Clarivate spokesperson identified the journals from our list that were dropped for editorial reasons–which the company had previously declined to do–and we have <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AiUI0qf4SqXzn8OXy6HZtma3Z8sLgJIBtgAcv6D5mK0/edit#gid=0">updated it accordingly</a>. The spokesperson said: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We do think it is important that misinformation is corrected and in this case we are happy to clarify which journals have been dropped for failing to meet quality criteria. We continue to listen to the scholarly community and keep our policies under constant review in order to protect research integrity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/building-block-life-asteroid-ryugu">A crucial building block of life exists on the asteroid Ryugu</a></h4>

              
                <p>Uracil, a building block of life, has been found on the asteroid Ryugu.</p>



<p>Yasuhiro Oba and colleagues discovered the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36904-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precursor to life in samples collected from the asteroid</a> and returned to Earth by Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft, the team reports March 21 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>“The detection of uracil in the Ryugu sample is very important to clearly demonstrate that it is really present in extraterrestrial environments,” says Oba, an astrochemist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan.</p>





<p>Uracil had been previously detected in samples from meteorites, including a rare class called CI-chondrites, which are abundant in organic compounds. But those meteorites landed on Earth, leaving open the possibility they had been contaminated by humans or Earth’s atmosphere. Because the Ryugu samples were collected in space, they are the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">purest bits of the solar system scientists have studied to date</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/22</em>). That means the team could rule out the influence of terrestrial biology.</p>



<p>Oba’s team was given only about 10 milligrams of the Ryugu sample for its analysis. As a result, the researchers were not confident they would be able to detect any building blocks, even though they’d been able to previously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">detect uracil and other nucleobases in</a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">meteorites</a> (<em>SN: 4/26/22).</em></p>



<p>Nucleobases are biological building blocks that form the structure of RNA, which is essential to protein creation in all living cells. One origin-of-life theory suggests RNA predated DNA and proteins and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quite-switch">that ancient organisms relied on RNA for the chemical reactions associated with life</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/04</em>).</p>

Oba <em>et a</em>l/<em>Nature Communications</em> 2023, JAXA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team used hot water to extract organic material from the Ryugu samples, followed by acid to further break chemical bonds and separate out uracil and other smaller molecules.</p>



<p>Laura Rodriguez, a prebiotic chemist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, who was not involved in the study, says this method leaves the possibility that the uracil was separated from a longer chain of molecules in the process. “I think it’d be interesting in future work to look at more complex molecules rather than just the nucleobases,” Rodriguez says.</p>





<p>She says she’s seen in her research that the nucleobases can form bonds to create more complex structures, such as a possible precursor to the nucleic acid which may lead to RNA formation. “My question is, are those more complex structures also forming in the asteroids?”</p>



<p>Oba says his team plans to analyze samples from NASA’s OSIRIS-REX mission, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">grabbed a bit of asteroid Bennu in 2020</a> and will return it to Earth this fall (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-sickness-elimination-experimental-drug-africa">Sleeping sickness is nearing elimination. An experimental drug could help</a></h4>

              
                <p>The patient arrived at the hospital one hot night in Masi-Manimba, an agricultural town unfurled along the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Lukula River.</p>



<p>He couldn’t speak, he couldn’t walk, he was conscious but “barely could make … gestures,” says Béatrice Kasita, a nurse who was there when he came in. She remembers his deformed posture, how his body curved into a fetal position.</p>



<p>He was also unusually drowsy — a telltale sign of his illness. The patient, a 27-year-old man, had been brought in by a medical team screening villagers for sleeping sickness, a deadly parasitic disease spread via the bite of a blood-feeding fly.</p>





<p>Since the first case report in the late 14th century, the illness has ebbed and flowed in sub-Saharan Africa. Across the continent, the predominant form of sleeping sickness shows up in about two dozen countries, most cases now occurring in the DRC. The disease is a nightmarish scourge that can maim the brain and ultimately kill. But today, cases hover near an all-time low. In 2021, the World Health Organization <a href="https://apps.who.int/neglected_diseases/ntddata/hat/hat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported just 747 cases</a> of the predominant form, down from more than 37,000 in 1998.</p>



<p>That precipitous plunge came out of decades of work, millions of screenings, spinal taps upon spinal taps, toxic treatments and the rapid rise of safer though often burdensome ones, countless IV infusions, long hospital days and nights, medicine lugged to remote villages, and communities on constant alert for sleeping sickness’s insidious symptoms.</p>



<p>Now, a promising drug has fanned hope for halting transmission of the disease. Called acoziborole, the drug is taken by mouth in just a single dose. Kasita’s patient, who arrived at the hospital in June 2017, was among the first to try it.</p>



<p>Her hospital is one of 10 clinical trial sites in the DRC and Guinea working to test the drug with the <a href="https://dndi.org/diseases/sleeping-sickness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative</a>, or DNDi, a nonprofit organization based in Geneva. In a small trial reported last year, the drug appeared to be safe and effective. A larger trial is ongoing, with results expected by the end of this year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="449" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev.jpg" alt="photo of nurse Béatrice Kasita holding some papers seated at a table outside a clinic surrounded by other healthcare workers" class="wp-image-3122753" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev-580x383.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-1_rev-282x186.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122753">Béatrice Kasita (center) is a nurse at a hospital in Masi-Manimba, one of 10 clinical trial sites in the DRC and Guinea for a new sleeping sickness drug. She has been caring for people with the disease for 10 years.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122753">PAUL SHEMISI/DNDI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If the findings hold up, the drug would be “a game changer,” says Emmanuel Bottieau, an infectious disease specialist at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who is not involved with the clinical trial. A single-dose medication is “really a dream for us, coming from such a long history of very difficult or toxic or cumbersome treatments.”</p>



<p>But he and others know that even a game-changing drug doesn’t guarantee a win. The dominant form of sleeping sickness is on a short list of neglected tropical diseases the WHO is targeting for elimination by 2030. That means bringing cases in certain areas down to zero knowing that some control efforts may still be required. Vastly harder to achieve is disease eradication, where cases worldwide stay parked at zero permanently. (To date, just a single human infectious disease — smallpox — has been eradicated.)</p>





<p>Even elimination is no easy task — and can get harder as you approach the finish line. “We are advancing very well,” says José Ramón Franco, a WHO medical officer based in Geneva, “but we [haven’t] reached the last mile.”</p>



<p>Still, tiptoeing along the edges of optimism, some, like Kasita, are finding moments to cheer. For the severely ill patient, her team initially wondered if acoziborole would work. “Are we really going to help him with this single-dose treatment?”</p>



<p>Two weeks later, he could stand, with some support, and had started speaking again, a radical recovery. Kasita smiles widely as she remembers it. Watching him heal “was a great pleasure,” she says.</p>



<h4>The symptoms of sleeping sickness</h4>



<p>About 400 kilometers to the west of Masi-Manimba, physician Wilfried Mutombo Kalonji is preparing to visit Kasita’s hospital. Afterward, he’ll hit up hospitals in Idiofa, Bagata and then Bandundu, three other acoziborole clinical trial sites in the DRC. To reach the sites, Mutombo will travel by boat, plane, car and motorbike. He’ll stay in both modern hotels and hotels without running water or electricity. Then, he’ll return home to Kinshasa, the DRC’s bustling capital. It’s a great and noisy city, he grins, with people playing music in the streets and “many, many, many traffic jams.”</p>



<p>In Kinshasa, Roi Baudouin hospital is one of the DNDi’s acoziborole trial sites. Mutombo has been organizing logistics and ensuring that each site has what it needs to treat and monitor patients. That includes generators for electricity, an internet connection, medical equipment and trained clinical trial staff.</p>



<p>Mutombo has worked with sleeping sickness patients since 2004. Two weeks after finishing his medical training in Kasaï province, he shipped out to Kasansa, becoming the only medical doctor in a village of about 11,000 people. In Kasansa, which lies in western DRC, north of the Angola border, sleeping sickness was then, and still remains, endemic.</p>



<p>The disease, also called human African trypanosomiasis, is caused by a single-celled, ruffle-edged parasite that worms its way into the brain. One subspecies, <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em>, causes the vast majority of cases and tends to plague western and central Africa. Another, <em>T.b. rhodesiense</em> occurs in the eastern and southern parts of the continent and causes a more rapid, acute illness with far fewer cases in people.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="455" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4.jpg" alt="microscopic image of Trypanosoma brucei parasites amid blood cells" class="wp-image-3122738" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4-572x383.jpg 572w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4-673x450.jpg 673w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-4-278x186.jpg 278w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122738">Sleeping sickness is caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> parasites, which appear in dark purple in this 1,000-fold magnification of a blood sample.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122738">DR. MAE MELVIN/CDC</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Both subspecies can ride in the guts and glands of tsetse flies, which often buzz near bodies of water; many of Mutombo’s patients in Kasansa were fishers or farmers. When the fly bites, the parasite enters the bloodstream. From there, it can get picked up again when other flies feed, shuttling from insects to humans in a disease-spreading cycle.</p>



<p>In the blood, <em>T.b. gambiense</em> sparks a slow-burning illness that can begin with a fever and, if left untreated, end with death. As the parasite multiplies, lymph nodes enlarge and the head, muscles and joints ache. Patients can also become intensely itchy, scratching hard enough to damage the skin, Kasita says.</p>



<p>When the parasite slips past the blood-brain barrier, patients enter the second stage of the disease. No one knows exactly where the parasite lodges in the brain, but neurological symptoms can vary. Doctors and nurses describe a range of distressing and bizarre behaviors. One common behavior gives the illness its name. Somehow, the parasite reverses people’s sleep/wake cycle. “They will sleep a lot during the day, and at night, they will be up, watching,” Kasita says.</p>



<p>Patients can also feel depressed and confused, neglect to care for themselves, hallucinate or experience logorrhea, words cascading from lips in nonsensical streams. In some infected people, personalities can swing like a wrecking ball. Jacques Pépin, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada, worked with sleeping sickness patients in the 1980s and remembers one who suddenly threw a large rock at his head.</p>



<p>Such outbursts can be scary for patients and families, says Antoine Tarral, a pharmacologist and infectious disease physician who works with Mutombo and led the DNDi’s sleeping sickness program for 10 years. Fear of the disease can prompt villages to reject infected individuals, he says.</p>



<p>Sleeping sickness carries a social stigma that makes people feel like outcasts, Mutombo agrees. “This disease is terrible.” When he first began treating patients, he says, “I was doing my best to make them feel like human beings.”</p>



<p>But for decades, available treatments were terrible, too.</p>

<h4>Sleeping sickness has a history of terrible treatments</h4>



<p>For most of treatment history, injected or intravenous drugs were the only option for sleeping sickness. They could cure patients, but only if doctors administered them in time. And when cases advanced to the second stage, medical staff had to switch tactics. For patients, that meant a spinal tap to confirm diagnosis followed by different drugs.</p>



<p>Until the late 2000s, the most-used treatment for advanced gambiense sleeping sickness was the highly toxic melarsoprol. The drug is derived from arsenic (and it’s still the leading treatment for advanced rhodesiense cases). Medical staff administered the drug for 10 days via daily intravenous infusions that burned entering patients’ veins, Mutombo says. The treatment could also be lethal, killing some 5 percent of patients.</p>



<p>Mutombo grows somber remembering two of his patients who died, young men he tried to cure in Kasansa. “That was a very bad experience,” he says. “When patients come to the hospital, they come to receive a treatment, not to die … [from] the drug we gave them.”</p>



<p>But doctors didn’t have a lot of options. Without melarsoprol, patients with serious cases faced near-certain death.</p>



<p>Not long after his patients died, Mutombo heard that the DNDi was launching a project on a new, less toxic treatment for advanced cases. He jumped at the chance, applied to be an investigator and joined the project in 2006. The new treatment, called NECT, combined eflornithine, an IV drug developed for cancer, with the oral drug nifurtimox. Eflornithine was already being used to treat sleeping sickness, but required dozens of infusions, and nifurtimox was a treatment for Chagas disease.</p>



<p>In 2009, after a clinical trial and the WHO’s endorsement, NECT took off, rocketing past melarsoprol or eflornithine alone as the first-line treatment for advanced sleeping sickness. But NECT had some logistical snafus, Mutombo says. It wasn’t easy to transport, for one. Treatment for four patients came in 40-kilogram packages that had to be trucked over bad roads into rural areas that lacked medical workers. “That was a problem with NECT,” Mutombo says. “It was effective, but it was heavy and needed trained staff.”</p>



<p>Less than a decade later, Mutombo, Tarral and their DNDi colleagues debuted an easier alternative. Fexinidazole, at long last, was a drug doctors could deliver exclusively via pills rather than an IV. It’s not perfect — it’s administered by a nurse, patients need to take it for 10 days and it’s not best for the most severe cases (for these, the WHO still recommends NECT). But easy-to-use oral drugs lower the burden on health systems, Mutombo says. Medical staff could more easily bring treatments to remote patients. And that brought scientists one step closer to sleeping sickness’s elimination.</p>

<h3>Sleeping sickness efforts pay off</h3>



<p>The number of reported sleeping sickness cases caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em> (yellow) and <em>T.b. rhodesiense</em> (orange) has dropped steadily since the late 1990s. The World Health Organization hopes to eliminate transmission of gambiense sleeping sickness by 2030. </p>

<h4><strong>A new drug could help bring cases to zero</strong></h4>



<p>Acoziborole, the drug now being tested in clinical trials, may be another big step in the right direction. Just one dose cured some <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00660-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95 percent of patients with late-stage infections</a>, Mutombo, Tarral and colleagues reported November 29 in the <em>Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>. That’s comparable to treatment with NECT. “Acoziborole is one solution to manage this disease,” Tarral says.</p>



<p>Not only does the drug seem to be effective, but “it’s given orally … and it needs to be given only once,” says the University of Sherbrooke’s Pépin, who was not involved with the trial but <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00686-7/fulltext?rss=yes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote an opinion piece</a> that appeared alongside the new report.</p>



<p>Yet, as Pépin points out, the acoziborole study has some limitations. The scientists tested the drug in just 208 patients, so no one knows if serious adverse effects might occur in larger populations. And the study wasn’t performed like the classic gold-standard clinical trial, with patients randomly assigned into different groups receiving different interventions.</p>



<p>Tarral acknowledges these drawbacks, which he says were due to low participant numbers. The researchers included only people with video-confirmed parasitic infections, which required years of searching for patients across 10 hospitals in two different countries.</p>



<p>“It’s not the standard approach, but that was the only possible approach,” Pépin says. “They did what could be done with the number of cases that are occurring now.”</p>



<p>The study’s promising results spurred a new, larger trial that will include 1,200 participants. This time, the team is enrolling people with positive antibody blood tests even if the parasite’s presence hasn’t been confirmed. Many of these participants may not actually be sick, says Veerle Lejon, a scientist at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development in Montpellier who was not involved in developing the drug but is collaborating with the DNDi on evaluating sleeping sickness diagnostics.</p>



<p>What this trial will offer, she says, is a raft of new data that will help determine the drug’s safety.</p>

<h4>The challenges of eliminating an infectious disease</h4>



<p>Even if acoziborole gets the green light, stamping out sleeping sickness isn’t a sure bet.</p>



<p>Eliminating an infectious disease is a slippery task. Success can, paradoxically, churn out new challenges. When case numbers dip low enough, for instance, interest in the disease can wane. Donors move money to other public health priorities, and once-robust control programs wither.</p>



<p>That happened for sleeping sickness in the 1960s, the last time cases dropped. Over the next few decades, cases ratcheted up, and epidemics broke out in Angola, the DRC and South Sudan. “Control of the disease was neglected, and then slowly, the disease came back,” says WHO medical officer Franco.</p>



<p>A doubled-down effort to find cases and treat them with ever-improving drugs got sleeping sickness under control again, with case numbers cratering to their low point today. But that level of surveillance is not sustainable, Franco says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="674" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-674x450.jpg" alt="photo in which Felix Akwaso Massa appears in the foreground holding a notebook with his back to the camera as he speaks to Charnelle Mafuta and her four children who are seated in front of a building" class="wp-image-3122739" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-674x450.jpg 674w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-573x383.jpg 573w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-278x186.jpg 278w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5-868x580.jpg 868w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031123_sleeping-sickness_inline-5.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122739">Physician Felix Akwaso Massa (far left), an investigator with the DNDi’s sleeping sickness clinical trials, speaks with Charnelle Mafuta (pictured with her family), a woman who was treated for sleeping sickness with the oral drug fexinidazole.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122739">XAVIER VAHED/DNDI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Health care workers can also lose knowledge of how to recognize the disease as they encounter fewer and fewer infected individuals, says Jennifer Palmer, a medical anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “The challenge is really in making sure that people are aware that sleeping sickness is still a problem,” she says. In a small study in South Sudan, reported in 2020, Palmer and colleagues found that lay people encouraging people in the community to get tested <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2414-6366/5/2/52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accounted for more than half of detected cases</a>.</p>



<p>Still, getting patients tested and treated can depend on whether they’re able to safely travel to health facilities. With the threat of violence in South Sudan and armed conflict in eastern DRC, the fate of sleeping sickness may also be shaped by the whims of war.</p>



<p>Even if every infected person was promptly found and treated, the disease-causing parasite would likely linger in wild and domestic animals. Scientists have found <em>T.b. gambiense</em>, for instance, in dogs, pigs, goats and sheep. No one knows the role infected animals play in reigniting outbreaks in humans.</p>



<p>Though the road to elimination may still be rocky, the patients Kasita and others are treating in Masi-Manimba and beyond offer a lesson for those working on disease elimination: Don’t give up too soon. Maybe the world won’t reach zero sleeping sickness cases by 2030, Lejon says, “but I think we should really give it a try,” she says. “We have momentum at this moment to do it.”</p>



<p>Mutombo echoes her enthusiasm. In less than 20 years, new drugs have completely overhauled patient care, he says. “We’ve made a great change in less than one generation…. Now, we expect that elimination is within reach.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-deadly-fungus-drug-resistance">U.S. cases of a deadly fungus nearly doubled in recent years</a></h4>

              
                <p>A fungus that recently evolved to infect humans is spreading rapidly in health care facilities in the United States and becoming harder to treat, a study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Candida auris</em></a> infections were first detected in the United States in 2013. Each year since, the number of people infected — though still small — has increased dramatically. In 2016, the fungus sickened 53 people. In 2021, the deadly fungus <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-3469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infected 1,471 people, nearly twice the 756 cases from the year before,</a> researchers report March 21 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. What’s more, the team found, the fungus is becoming resistant to antifungal drugs.</p>





<p>The rise of cases and antifungal resistance is “concerning,” says microbiologist and immunologist Arturo Casadevall, who studies fungal infections. “You worry because [the study] is telling you what could be a harbinger of things to come.” Casadevall, of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  was not involved in the CDC study.</p>



<p>In tests of people at high risk of infection, researchers also found 4,041 individuals who carried the fungus in 2021 but were not sick at the time. A small percentage of carriers may later get sick from the fungus, says Meghan Lyman, a medical epidemiologist in the CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch in Atlanta, possibly developing bloodstream infections that carry a high risk of death.</p>



<p>Starting in 2012, <em>C. auris</em> infections popped up suddenly in hospitals on three continents, probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans">evolving to grow at human body temperature</a> as a result of climate change (<em>SN: 7/26/19</em>). The fungus, typically detected through blood or urine tests, usually infects people in health care settings such as hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and long-term care homes. Because people who get infected are often already sick, it can be hard to tell whether symptoms such as fevers are from the existing illness or an infection.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Upward trajectory</h3>



<p>The number of cases of <em>Candida auris</em> recorded each year has been increasing. Clinical cases (dark blue) are among people who had positive urine or blood tests for infections. Screening cases (light blue) are people who carry the fungus, but are not ill at the time of testing. Some screening cases may develop into clinical cases, but others will clear the fungus and have no symptoms. Both carriers and cases may transmit the fungus to others through direct contact with contaminated items.</p>

<p>Those most at risk of infection include people who are ill; those who have catheters, breathing or feeding tubes or other invasive medical devices; and those who have repeated or long stays in health care facilities. Healthy people are usually not infected but can spread the fungus to others by contact with contaminated surfaces, including gowns and gloves worn by health care workers, Lyman says.</p>



<h4>Growing drug resistance</h4>



<p>Infections can be treated with antifungal drugs. But Lyman and colleagues found that the fungus is becoming resistant to an important class of such medications called echinocandins. These drugs are used as both the first line and the last line of defense against <em>C. auris</em>, says Casadevall.</p>



<p>Before 2020, six people were known to have echinocandin-resistant infections and four other people had infections resistant to all three class of existing antifungal drugs. That resistance developed during treatment using echinocandin. None of those cases passed the resistant strain to others. But in 2021, 19 people were diagnosed with echinocandin-resistant infections and seven with infections resistant to multiple drugs.</p>



<p>More concerning, one outbreak in Washington, D.C., and another in Texas suggested people could transmit the drug-resistant infections to each other. “Patients who had never been on echinocandins were getting these resistant strains,” Lyman says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some health care facilities have been able to identify cases early and prevent outbreaks. “We’re obviously very concerned,” Lyman says, “but we are encouraged by these facilities that have had success at containing it.” Using those facilities’ infection control measures may help limit cases of <em>C. auris</em>, she says, as well as reducing spread other fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-christiaan-huygens-flawed-telescopes-solved">The mystery of Christiaan Huygens’ flawed telescopes may have been solved</a></h4>

              
                <p>17th century scientist Christiaan Huygens set his sights on faraway Saturn, but he may have been nearsighted.</p>



<p>Huygens is known, in part, for discovering Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, and deducing the shape of the planet’s rings. But by some accounts, the Dutch scientist’s telescopes produced fuzzier views than others of the time despite having well-crafted lenses.</p>



<p>That may be because Huygens needed glasses, astronomer Alexander Pietrow proposes March 1 in <em>Notes and Records: the Royal Society Journal of the History of Science</em>.</p>





<p>To make his telescopes, Huygens combined two lenses, an objective and an eyepiece, positioned at either end of the telescope. Huygens experimented with different lenses to find combinations that, to his eye, created a sharp image, eventually creating a table to keep track of which combinations to use to obtain a given magnification. But when compared with modern-day knowledge of optics, Huygens’ calculations were a bit off, says Pietrow, of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam in Germany.</p>



<p>One possible explanation: Huygens selected lenses based on his flawed vision. Historical records indicate that Huygens’ father was nearsighted, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Christiaan Huygens also suffered from the often-hereditary affliction.</p>



<p>Assuming that’s the reason for the mismatch, Pietrow calculates that Huygens had 20/70 vision: What someone with normal vision could read from 70 feet away, Huygens could read only from 20 feet. If so, that could be why Huygens’ telescopes never quite reached their potential.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/310-million-year-old-fossil-jellyfish-anemone">310-million-year-old fossil blobs might not be jellyfish after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>What do you get when you flip a fossilized “jellyfish” upside down? The answer, it turns out, might be an anemone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fossil blobs once thought to be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spp2.1479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ancient jellyfish were actually a type of burrowing sea anemone</a>, scientists propose March 8 in <em>Papers in Palaeontology</em>.</p>



<p>From a certain angle, the fossils’ features include what appears to be a smooth bell shape, perhaps with tentacles hanging beneath — like a jellyfish. And for more than 50 years, that’s what many scientists thought the animals were.</p>





<p>But for paleontologist Roy Plotnick, something about the fossils’ supposed identity seemed fishy. “It’s always kind of bothered me,” says Plotnick, of the University of Illinois Chicago. Previous scientists had interpreted one fossil feature as a curtain that hung around the jellies’ tentacles. But that didn’t make much sense, Plotnick says. “No jellyfish has that,” he says. “How would it swim?”</p>



<p>One day, looking over specimens at the Field Museum in Chicago, something in Plotnick’s mind clicked. What if the bell belonged on the bottom, not the top? He turned to a colleague and said, “I think this is an anemone.”</p>



<p>Rotated 180 degrees, Plotnick realized, the fossils’ shape — which looks kind of like an elongated pineapple with a stumpy crown — resembles some modern anemones. “It was one of those aha moments,” he says. The “jellyfish” bell might be the anemone’s lower body. And the purported tentacles? Perhaps the anemone’s upper section, a tough, textured barrel protruding from the seafloor.</p>



<p>Plotnick and his colleagues examined thousands of the fossilized animals, dubbed <em>Essexella asherae, </em>unearthing more clues. Bands running through the fossils match the shape of some modern anemones’ musculature. And some specimens’ pointy protrusions resemble an anemone’s contracted tentacles.</p>

In this stylized reconstruction (right), <em>Essexella</em> has a textured upper body, smooth lower body and fingerlike tentacles.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122783"><em>Papers in Palaeontology</em></span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s totally possible that these are anemones,” says Estefanía Rodríguez, an anemone expert at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City who was not involved with the work. The shape of the fossils, the comparison with modern-day anemones — it all lines up, she says, though it’s not easy to know for sure.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Thomas Clements agrees. Specimens like <em>Essexella</em> “are some of the most notoriously difficult fossils to identify,” he says. “Jellyfish and anemones are like bags of water. There’s hardly any tissue to them,” meaning there’s little left to fossilize.</p>





<p>Still, it’s plausible that the blobs are indeed fossilized anemones, says Clements, of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany. He was not part of the new study but has spent several field seasons at Mazon Creek, the Illinois site where <em>Essexella </em>lived some 310 million years ago. Back then, the area was near the shoreline, Clements says, with nearby rivers dumping sediment into the environment – just the kind of place ancient burrowing anemones may have once called home.</p>

<p>A journal editor&nbsp; who disdains anonymous concerns about research integrity has just seen an article in his journal retracted, thanks to the work of a pseudonymous sleuth.</p>



<p>The paper at issue, “<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.3139/146.111245/html">An experimental investigation into the effects of Cr2O3 and ZnO2 nanoparticles on the mechanical properties and durability of self-compacting mortar</a>,” was published in 2015 in International Journal of Materials Research (IJMR). It has been cited 23 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>

Editors and the journal’s publisher De Gruyter did not investigate the case for two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During that time, Guido Schmitz <a href="https://www.imw.uni-stuttgart.de/en/team/Schmitz-00001/">of the University of Stuttgart</a> became the journal’s editor in chief. When Artemisia followed up on their report, Schmitz said that he would not investigate the potential misconduct until Artemisia revealed their identity:</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Schmitz also<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/28/why-editors-should-stop-ignoring-anonymous-whistleblowers-a-decade-later/"> told us</a> that authors were free to try to publish “bullshit and fiction,” and that “acting as policemen watching whether other people behave ethically” was not his top priority.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Only following the involvement of Retraction Watch and a letter to the entire editorial board did the journal finally agree to investigate (and later retract) the paper.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atmospheric-river-forecast-storm">By flying over atmospheric rivers, scientists aim to improve forecasts</a></h4>

              
                <p>The term “atmospheric river” may sound airy and ethereal, but these massive, fast-moving, drenching storms can hit as hard as a freight train. Since December, the U.S. West has been slammed with back-to-back-to-back atmospheric rivers, the most recent one deluging the state March 15 and another forecast to hit the state in the coming week. These powerful streams of water vapor arrive with strong winds, heavy rains and thick snow, spawning flooding, landslides and avalanches.</p>



<p>Big as they are, these storms are surprisingly tough to see coming. A week’s warning is about the best forecasters can do now.</p>





<p>A team of scientists is trying to change that. In just the past few months, they’ve flown more than three dozen reconnaissance missions into the storms. They’ve launched dozens of weather balloons high into the stratosphere, each carrying instruments to measure temperature, moisture, air pressure and wind. And the scientists have crunched reams of data and run hundreds of computer simulations, all to forecast when the next atmospheric river is going to arrive and how intense it’s likely to be.</p>



<p>The goal of this effort, the team says, is to improve predictions, to give the people in the storms’ path more time to prepare for flooding, and ultimately to find ways to manage the water for the region’s drier months.</p>



<p>It’s a big task, particularly during this year’s seemingly relentless barrage of storms. “We have been hammered here: December, January, February, March,” says meteorologist Marty Ralph. “It has been a long and active season.”</p>



<p>In just December and January, nine atmospheric rivers hammered western United States and Canada relentlessly, dumping record rain and snow across the region. Over 121 billion metric tons of water fell on California alone, according to the U.S. National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service.</p>



<p>And this task is likely to become even more challenging, given lingering uncertainty over how atmospheric rivers will shift in intensity and frequency as the planet continues to warm.</p>



<h4>Rivers in the sky</h4>



<p>Atmospheric rivers are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rivers-sky">long, narrow bands of condensed water vapor</a>, typically around 1,500 kilometers long and 500 kilometers across (<em>SN: 2/11/11</em>). The streams form over warm ocean waters, often in the tropics, and snake through the sky, transporting huge amounts of water. One atmospheric river, on average, can transport up to 15 times the volume of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River. When these storms arrive over land, they can release that water as rain or snow.</p>





<p>While atmospheric rivers can bring welcome water to a parched region, they also are “the primary, almost the exclusive” cause of floods on the U.S. West Coast, says Ralph.</p>



<p>In 2013, he and colleagues created the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, or CW3E, at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. The group then created the first weather model tailored to predicting atmospheric rivers on the U.S. West Coast. This year, the team also created an <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JD037180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atmospheric river intensity scale</a>, ranking the events based on size and how much water they’re carrying.</p>



<p>To improve their forecasts of landfall and intensity, the team collects data from drifting ocean buoys, weather balloons and airplanes. The group even enlisted the aid of the U.S. Air Force’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/storm-front">hurricane hunters</a> — most famous for flying into the eyes of tropical cyclones from June to November — to do aerial reconnaissance (<em>SN: 5/18/12</em>).</p>



<p>The data collected by the planes fill an important information gap, says Anna Wilson. She’s a Scripps atmospheric scientist who also manages field research for CW3E. Weather balloons are the workhorses of weather prediction, but they’re launched over land, and “it’s important to see what happens before [an atmospheric river] makes landfall,” Wilson says.</p>



<p>Satellites can provide valuable atmospheric data over the ocean, but they generally can’t see through clouds and heavy precipitation, both characteristic features of atmospheric rivers. And atmospheric rivers hang low in the troposphere, the lowest part of Earth’s atmosphere, making it even harder for satellites to spy on them.</p>



<p>During each flight mission, the planes drop instruments called dropsondes that collect temperature, moisture, wind and other data as they fall. Since November 1, the hunters have flown 39 missions into the atmospheric rivers, Wilson says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h2>How to study atmospheric rivers</h2>



<p>Before atmospheric rivers make landfall, temperature, moisture, pressure and wind data are collected by satellites, drifting buoys in the ocean and by airplanes that fly over the top of the atmospheric river (orange and yellow), releasing dropsondes, instruments that gather data as they sink through the air. The planes are also using an innovative technique called airborne radio occultation that uses GPS satellites and the slant of the horizon to measure atmospheric moisture to the sides of the flight paths.</p>

<p>In the U.S. West, atmospheric rivers tend to arrive from January through March. But that’s not really the start of atmospheric river season in this region: Atmospheric rivers make landfall in the Pacific Northwest earlier in the year, in the late fall. One such storm devastated that region in November 2021, spawning a deadly series of floods and landslides.</p>



<p>“That storm not only hurt people, it hurt the economy,” Ralph says, causing “thousand-year flooding that destroyed rail lines right in the middle of a serious supply chain issue.”</p>



<p>In the aftermath of that event, CW3E and their partners received funding to begin the airplane reconnaissance flights on November 1, two months earlier than these missions have begun in the past.</p>



<h4>How will climate change affect atmospheric rivers?</h4>



<p>Aside from the data-gathering challenges in predicting these storms, it’s also hard to disentangle the many factors that feed into them, from warm tropical waters to large-scale weather patterns such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation. How a warming world will influence on these storms is uncertain too, Ralph says.</p>



<p>“One thing to keep in mind is that the fuel of an atmospheric river is water vapor. It’s pushed along by the wind, formed by the temperature gradient between the poles and the equator,” he says.</p>



<p>Atmospheric rivers are also often associated with extratropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms formed by the collision of cold and warm water masses. Such cyclones can interact with an atmospheric river, perhaps pulling it along. One such fast-forming “bomb cyclone” helped spur on an atmospheric river that drenched California in January.</p>

<p>Global warming may be having two possibly offsetting effects on atmospheric rivers: Warmer air can hold more water vapor, which means more fuel for the storms. But the poles are also warming faster than the equatorial regions, which reduces the temperature difference between the regions, and that can weaken the winds.</p>



<p>“But what we’re finding is that even with that reduced gradient, there are still times when cyclones can form,” Ralph says. And those storms are feeding off the increase in water vapor. That, he says, could mean bigger and longer-lasting atmospheric rivers in the future.</p>



<p>Some studies suggest climate change won’t necessarily increase the number of atmospheric rivers, but it might increase their variability, Wilson says. “We may have more frequent shifts between very, very, very wet seasons and very, very, very dry seasons.” A warmer climate in general can mean that water is sucked up out of the soil more quickly.</p>



<p>That seesaw scenario is likely to make water management even more of a challenge in the U.S. West, where atmospheric rivers are already both a blessing and a curse. Still, “we’re very hopeful,” Wilson says, that the data will ultimately aid in the region’s complicated water management, such as by giving planners enough time to safely let water out of reservoirs before they’re flooded.</p>



<p>The events also provide as much as half of the region’s annual precipitation, bringing much-needed water to parched lands and topping off the snowpack in the high mountains, another reservoir of freshwater. This year’s storms “have done a lot to restore the landscape drought,” Ralph says, “greening up” the landscape and refilling many smaller reservoirs.</p>



<p>But “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-made-southwestern-u-s-drought-worst-1200-years">drought</a> is a complicated thing,” Ralph says (<em>SN: 4/16/20</em>). The historically low water levels in larger reservoirs in the West, such as Lake Powell and Lake Mead, isn’t so quickly replaced. “It will take more wet years like this one to recover.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-soil-nutrients-rice-farming">Martian soil may have all the nutrients rice needs</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS</strong> — Martian dirt may have all the necessary <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/pdf/2990.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nutrients for growing rice</a>, one of humankind’s most important foods, planetary scientist Abhilash Ramachandran reported March 13 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. However, the plant may need a bit of help to survive amid perchlorate, a chemical that can be toxic to plants and has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-farming-harder-martian-regolith-soil">detected on Mars’ surface</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>“We want to send humans to Mars … but we cannot take everything there. It&#8217;s going to be expensive,” says Ramachandran, of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. Growing rice there would be ideal, because it’s easy to prepare, he says. “You just peel off the husk and start boiling.”</p>





<p>Ramachandran and his colleagues grew rice plants in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103508002017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martian soil simulant</a> made of Mojave Desert basalt. They also grew rice in pure potting mix as well as several mixtures of the potting mix and soil simulant. All pots were watered once or twice a day.</p>



<p>Rice plants did grow in the synthetic Mars dirt, the team found. However, the plants developed slighter shoots and wispier roots than the plants that sprouted from the potting mix and hybrid soils. Even replacing just 25 percent of the simulant with potting mix helped heaps, they found.</p>



<p>The researchers also tried growing rice in soil with added perchlorate. They sourced one wild rice variety and two cultivars with a genetic mutation — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">modified for resilience</a> against environmental stressors like drought — and grew them in Mars-like dirt with and without perchlorate (<em>SN: 9/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>No rice plants grew amid a concentration of 3 grams of perchlorate per kilogram of soil. But when the concentration was just 1 gram per kilogram, one of the mutant lines grew both a shoot and a root, while the wild variety managed to grow a root.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that by tinkering with the successful mutant’s modified gene, <em>SnRK1a</em>, humans might eventually be able to develop a rice cultivar suitable for Mars.</p>

<p><strong>Oceans may be shrinking </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/earth-sciences-142"><em>Science News</em></a>, March 10, 1973</p>



<p>The oceans of the world may be gradually shrinking, leaking slowly away into the Earth’s mantle…. Although the oceans are constantly being slowly augmented by water carried up from Earth’s interior by volcanic activity … some process such as sea-floor spreading seems to be letting the water seep away more rapidly than it is replaced.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists traced the ocean’s leak to subduction zones, areas where tectonic plates collide and the heavier of the two sinks into the mantle. It’s still unclear how much water has cycled between the deep ocean and mantle through the ages. A 2019 analysis suggests that sea levels have <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GC008232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped by an average of up to 130 meters</a> over the last 230 million years, in part due to Pangea’s breakup creating new subduction zones. Meanwhile, molten rock that bubbles up from the mantle as continents drift apart may <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031920121001734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“rain” water back into the ocean</a>, scientists reported in 2022. But since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earths-deep-interior-holds-vast-reservoir-water">Earth’s mantle can hold more water</a> as it cools (<em>SN: 6/13/14</em>), the oceans&#8217; mass might shrink by 20 percent every billion years.</p>

<p>Public attention to the use of animals in research is on the rise, and with good reason. As scientists, we have a responsibility to avoid using animals in our work whenever possible. Not only does this prevent needless suffering and waste of resources, it also leads to better science, because findings from animal experiments often fail to hold up in humans. If studies can be conducted ethically with human subjects, tissues, or organs, they should not use animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On paper, some journals appear to clear this bar. In reality, however, they fall short of carrying out their ethical responsibility: We see many examples, especially in journals in the nutrition field, of published research that was conducted in animals but could have been carried out in humans or using human-relevant methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/14/2852/htm">recent study</a> fed monkeys Western- and Mediterranean-style diets to produce information about the diets’ effects on human mood and behavior. Another <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/12/4350/htm">experiment</a> used pigs to evaluate how diets rich in fruits and vegetables can improve human microbiome health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should give pause to the National Library of Medicine (NLM). When deciding if a journal merits inclusion in MEDLINE, the leading bibliographic database for life sciences, NLM may <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_journal_selection.html">look at</a> whether the journal’s ethical policies align with best practices and how well individual articles adhere to those policies.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126716"></span>



<p>Consider the journal <em>Nutrients</em>, which published the studies cited above. In our view, it has a particularly bad record of accepting studies with egregious violations of ethical norms when it comes to experiments on animals. <em>Nutrients</em>’<em> </em>own<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients/instructions#ethics"> guidelines</a> require the “replacement of animals by alternatives wherever possible.” However, the journal, and others like it, continuously publishes research using animals to study human nutrition when alternatives exist – and better ones at that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is onene more example: The manufacturer of a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/904">saffron-based nutrition supplement</a> explored the spice&#8217;s purported mood-boosting properties. But rather than administering the supplement to volunteers and tracking their depressive symptoms with validated instruments, as other researchers have done, the manufacturer force-fed it to mice via gavage and dropped the animals in water tanks to conduct forced swim tests as a measure of their mood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study was approved by an institutional ethics committee, but we believe the journal’s ethics guidelines should still have blocked the article from being accepted. Ethics-committee approval is irrelevant to the question of whether such an experiment met the journal’s explicit guidelines for the use of animals in research.</p>



<p>In 2022, <em>Nutrients</em> published more than 4,000 research papers, and just under 800 of those (roughly 20%) used live animals. After spending more than a year investigating the journal, we find that most, if not all, of these studies could have been conducted with humans or human-relevant alternatives. This would not only have spared tens of thousands of animal lives, but would also have provided clinically meaningful data rather than results of uncertain relevance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Nutrients</em>, which is published by MDPI and indexed for MEDLINE, has a history of editorial problems. In 2018, the journal saw <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/open-access-editors-resign-after-alleged-pressure-publish-mediocre-papers">10 of its senior editors resign</a>, including the editor-in-chief, over alleged pressure to accept &#8220;mediocre&#8221; papers. The change in leadership and the ethical failings we have identified both warrant a fresh look at the journal&#8217;s participation in MEDLINE per the database&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_policies.html#reeval">policy for reexamination</a>.</p>



<p>The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, along with the support of more than 700 physicians and health care professionals, brought these issues to the <a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/wxbqpxpmfk/letter-to-nutrients-from-physicians-committee_9.12.22-1">journal</a>, publisher, MEDLINE staff, the <a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/zffv527vcn/letter-to-nlm-medline-from-physicians-committee_9.12.22-1">National Library of Medicine</a>, and the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee (the federal advisory committee that recommends journals for inclusion in MEDLINE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, insufficient action has been taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Time after time, <em>Nutrients</em> claims its editorial office and ethics committee “checked the articles themselves to confirm that they contained ethics statements that are in accordance with the journal policies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, MEDLINE “has independently verified that all articles you have brought to its attention include statements indicating that the studies were reviewed and approved by institutional animal care and use committees.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But ethics-committee approval is not sufficient to meet the journal’s stated ethical guidelines. We believe journals should take their ethical guidelines seriously, just as NLM should live up to its vetting function.</p>



<p>The continued retort by the National Institutes of Health is that we should direct our concerns to the publisher, which we have already done repeatedly to little apparent effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As open-access, pay-to-publish journals become increasingly prevalent, we need to consider the financial motives of these publishers. MDPI, which publishes <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/journals">420 journals</a>, charges thousands of dollars for each published article, creating a deterrent to meticulously screen submissions for evidence of ethical misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to sustain research integrity, MEDLINE should make its reevaluation process transparent. Setting up a system for scientists to see why and how often journals are reevaluated and creating a platform where journals can be submitted for reevaluation could help boost confidence in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As scientists, we are often left leaning on the trust of bibliographic databases to know if a publication is trustworthy. If MEDLINE fails to enforce its rules, it is not only the journals that lose their credibility; MEDLINE’s credibility suffers in the process as does that of the body of scientific literature upon which we depend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If editors, publishers, and the NLM are not willing to take corrective action, we are left wondering whom the scientific community can depend on to uphold scientific accountability. Failing to abide by ethical standards in the literature is, in our opinion, leading to a research-integrity crisis.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Harpreet Singh will talk about his recent work on &quot;Survey of Sentiment Analysis models leveraging transformers along with other NLP techniques to enrich word vectors for classification&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In recent years, the development of large language models (LLMs) such as the
GPT series has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) research,
rendering many specialized models obsolete. Rather than focusing on individual
tasks, researchers are now prioritizing the creation of general-purpose
language understanding systems capable of performing multiple tasks.
Competitive evaluation criteria, such as the Glue score, are being used to
evaluate these models. However, due to the limited resources of many
universities, they are unable to undertake such research and instead continue
to work on text classification tasks. Sentiment analysis is a popular text
classification task, and researchers are now incorporating transformers and
other techniques to improve performance on sentiment analysis datasets. In this
journal club meeting, we will discuss various models that leverage transformers
and other techniques to enhance sentiment analysis performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">Earth’s inner core may be more complex than researchers thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s heart may have a secret chamber. The planet’s inner core isn’t just a solid ball of nickel and iron, researchers say, but contains two layers of its own: a distinct central region nestled within an outer shell.</p>



<p>Scientists say they have confirmed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36074-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the existence of this innermost inner core</a> using a type of previously undescribed seismic wave that not only travels through Earth’s core but also bounces back and forth through the interior, collecting invaluable data about the core’s structure along the way.</p>





<p>Focusing on earthquakes of magnitude 6 or larger that struck in the last decade, the researchers combined data on these quakes that were collected at seismic stations around the world. Combining these signals made it possible to detect even very faint reflections of the seismic waves. Of the 200 or so quakes analyzed, 16 events spawned seismic waves that detectably bounced through the inner core multiple times.</p>



<p>The origin, structure and fate of Earth’s core is of intense interest because the core generates the planet’s magnetic field, which shields the Earth from charged particles ejected by the sun and helps keep the planet’s denizens safe from too much radiation.</p>



<p>“Understanding how the magnetic field evolves is extremely important for the life on Earth’s surface,” says Hrvoje Tkalčić, a seismologist at the Australian National University in Canberra.</p>



<p>The entire core, about 6,600 kilometers across, consists of two main parts: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-reverse-rotation">a liquid outer core and a solid inner core</a> (<em>SN: 1/23/23</em>). As iron-rich fluid circulates in the outer core, some of the material cools and crystallizes, sinking to form a solid center. That interplay generates Earth’s magnetic field.</p>



<p>When this swirling dance first began isn’t certain, but some studies suggest it was as recent as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-core-solidified-just-time-save-magnetic-field">565 million years ago</a>, just a fraction of Earth’s 4.6-billion-year-long life span (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>). That dance has faltered from time to time, its stuttering steps preserved in tiny magnetic grains in rocks. These data suggest the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-magnetic-field-reversal-mass-extinctions-environment-crisis">planet’s magnetic poles have flip-flopped</a> many times over the years, temporarily weakening the magnetic field (<em>SN: 2/18/21</em>). As more and more crystals cool, the dance will eventually slow and stop, shutting off the planet’s magnetic field millions or billions of years from now.</p>



<p>Different types and structures of minerals, as well as different amounts of liquid in the subsurface, can change the speed of seismic waves traveling through Earth, offering clues to the makeup of the interior. In 2002, researchers noted that seismic waves traveling through the innermost part of Earth <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.172508499" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move slightly slower in one direction</a> relative to the planet’s poles than in other directions. That suggests there’s some oddity there — a difference in crystal structure, perhaps. That hidden heart, the team suggested, might be a kind of fossil: a long-preserved remnant of the core’s early formation.</p>



<p>Since that observation, Tkalčić and others have pored over seismic data, finding independent lines of evidence that help support the idea of an innermost inner core. The reverberating seismic waves, described February 21 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, also show a slowdown, and are the strongest evidence yet that this hidden heart exists.</p>





<p>Using that seismic data, Tkalčić and seismologist Thanh-Son Phạm, also of the Australian National University, estimate that this inner heart is roughly 600 kilometers across, or about half the diameter of the full inner core. And the pair was able to assess the direction of the slowest waves at about 50 degrees relative to the Earth’s rotation axis, providing more insight into the region.</p>



<p>The exact source of the wave slowdown isn’t clear, Tkalčić says. The phenomenon might be related to the structure of the iron crystals, which may be packed together differently farther into the center. Or it could be from a different crystal alignment caused by some long-ago global event that changed how inner core crystals solidified out of the outer core.</p>



<p>The inner core holds many other mysteries too. Lighter elements present in small amounts in the core — hydrogen, carbon, oxygen — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid">may flow around the solid iron in a liquidlike “superionic” state</a>, further complicating the seismic picture (<em>SN: 2/9/22</em>).</p>



<p>By identifying and reporting seismic waves that bounced back and forth through the planet’s interior multiple times, the researchers have made an invaluable contribution that will help researchers study the core in new ways, says seismologist Paul Richards of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y.</p>



<p>Still, the team’s interpretation of the inner core’s structure from those waves “is probably more iffy,” says Richards, who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>



<p>One reason for this uncertainty is that as the waves bounce back and forth, they can become weaker and more difficult to see in the data, he says. “Many further observations will help decide” what these new data can reveal about the heart of the planet.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/static-electricity-parasite-nematodes">Static electricity helps parasitic nematodes glom onto victims</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>LAS VEGAS</strong> — Some species of parasitic roundworms can catapult themselves high into the air to latch onto fruit flies and other insects. Experiments now reveal that leaping <em>Steinernema carpocapsae</em> nematodes take advantage of a secret weapon that makes them particularly effective in their pursuit of victims: static electricity.</p>



<p>Flying insects <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-swarms-electric-charge-static-electricity-storm-clouds-honeybees">build up electric charge</a> as they move through the air (<em>SN: 10/31/22</em>). It’s the same effect that causes electricity to collect on droplets of mist in clouds, and ultimately leads to lightning.</p>



<p>Individual insects can accumulate charges of 100 volts or so, biomechanics researcher Víctor Ortega Jiménez of the University of Maine in Orono reported March 6 at the American Physical Society meeting. When nematodes leap, the <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/B08.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charge on a passing insect attracts the parasites</a> like lint to a staticky sweater.</p>

Those charges create static electricity that pulls parasitic nematodes toward the insect, new research reveals. The arrows show the direction the nematodes move; colors indicate relative speed with blue for slower and red for faster.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122797">Víctor M. Ortega Jiménez</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To test the effect of electric charge, Ortega Jiménez and colleagues mounted dead fruit flies on wires and placed them near a surface covered in nematodes. With no charge on a fly, only nematodes that happened to jump in the direction of the insect landed on target, as expected. When researchers applied an electric charge to a suspended fruit fly, even nematodes that initially headed in the wrong direction were caught up in the electric field and pulled onto the fly.</p>



<p>Ortega Jiménez has also studied electric force effects on spider webs. When charged insects neared a web, “the silk is attracted directly to the insects,” he says. That made him wonder whether leaping nematodes rely on those forces as well.</p>





<p>Researchers have long considered the effect of fluids and air flow on insects and other tiny creatures. But only recently have they added electricity to the mix, Ortega Jiménez says. “We need to know how animals actually are dealing with these forces at this scale.”</p>

It turns out that the prey unwittingly give the nematodes a hand, new research shows. By simply moving, a fly builds up an electric charge. Like static electric cling, that charge can pull a nematode in. In this experiment, researchers applied an electric charge to a pinned-in-place fly. A speck of a nematode (left) cartwheeled into the air and then headed straight for the fly.</figcaption></figure>

<p>In June of 2020, officials from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center of San Francisco and the University of California, San Francisco, sent a letter to the journal <em>Oncogene</em> with the findings of an investigation of scientific misconduct: A paper the journal had published in 2007 contained “falsified data,” and the officials recommended the journal “assess this paper for retraction.”</p>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UCSF-PRA-023-024-3.3.23.pdf">2020 letter</a> – which we obtained through a public records request – was the second time the institutions had alerted the journal. As the officials stated, a previous&nbsp; investigation had found issues in the 2007 paper, and UCSF-VA had communicated “earlier evidence that this same paper had data fabrication and/or falsification constituting research misconduct” to the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/25/ucsf-va-letters-journals-offer-insight-misconduct-investigations/">in 2017</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even though the journal has been notified after the last investigation and not taken action,” the 2020 letter stated, “they should be notified again because additional research misconduct has been found.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, a journal staffer was in the midst of discussing the issues in the article with Rajivir Dahiya, the corresponding author and then director of UCSF’s Urology Research Center with an appointment at the San Francisco VA Medical Center, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126713"></span>



<p>As we’ve reported previously, Dahiya, who retired in 2020 and is now a professor emeritus of urology, has had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/08/professor-emeritus-loses-fourth-paper-after-ucsf-va-investigation-five-years-after-other-retractions/">four papers retracted</a> after UCSF and the VA <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/25/ucsf-va-letters-journals-offer-insight-misconduct-investigations/">sent letters</a> to journal editors saying that an investigation had found “fabrication or falsification of data” in the articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2020 letter from UCSF-VA officials confirms that the institutions conducted two investigations that found research misconduct, although neither inquiry could determine who was responsible for the faked data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judging from Dahiya’s correspondence with <em>Oncogene</em>, the letter also appears to have been a decisive factor for the journal’s editors. After receiving it, they moved forward with retracting the paper in question, despite the researcher’s objections. The emails also indicate the journal has been investigating another paper of Dahiya’s since at least 2019, with no resolution yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The retracted paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1210572">Knockdown of astrocyte-elevated gene-1 inhibits prostate cancer progression through upregulation of FOXO3a activity</a>,” was pulled last October, and has been cited nearly 200 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The major problem was that this paper is about 16 years old and the investigation started in 2016,” Dahiya told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the investigation committee asked for the original data, the authors couldn’t provide them. The first author who did the experiments had left for another institution, and Dahiya’s lab had moved. The lab’s notebooks had been stored in a centralized location, he said, and the VA/UCSF discarded the materials after the National Institutes of Health’s mandated five year data retention period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya blamed the retractions on the VA/UCSF not keeping the old notebooks:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All the journals that published our papers did not have any problems with the data. But the VA/UCSF committee members forced these journals to retract our papers. It is strange that on one hand VA/UCSF discarded our original research data notebooks and on the other hand they blamed us that we did not have original data and thus we falsified the data.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems <em>Oncogene</em>’s editors did have questions about the data, according to Dahiya’s emails with the journal that he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dahiya-Fwd_-Two-Oncogene-articles-under-investigation-Rajvir-Dahiya-UCSF-_-VAMC-san-Francisco.pdf">shared with Retraction Watch</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November 2019, Dahiya sent a journal staffer new data from experiments he and his coauthors had repeated in response to questions about the 2007 paper. “The results are consistent with the results given in Paper and thus does not change the results or the conclusion of the paper,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months later, in May 2020, the staffer responded with “sincere apologies for not getting back to you sooner” and several detailed questions from the editors about the new data compared to the original.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some of the new figures, the editors pointed out that the result “goes against what is written in the original paper.” Other figures were “not that convincing and as clear as the original ones.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya sent a point-by-point response 10 days later. He concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We believe that your editorial members will find our responses satisfactory and resolve these issues.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next email from the journal, which came a week later, indicated the editor still had some questions:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unless sufficient responses can be made to the editors questions, it is likely that the next course of action will be to retract this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After a few weeks, during which Dahiya wrote that he could not go into the lab “due to COVID-19 lockdown and protests,” he sent additional data and responses to the editors’ comments. On July 20, 2020, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are highly grateful to the editorial board members for giving us a chance to address the concerns. We have really worked very hard and sincerely put all efforts to address each and every comment and generated new data using all appropriate controls. We hope that these responses are satisfactory to the reviewers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nearly a year later, Dahiya heard back from the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sincere apologies for the time taken to get back to you regarding the below response you sent to the latest round of comments from the editors.</p>



<p>Just prior to receipt of your last email, we received a report from the Investigation Committee on Scientific Misconduct of the Veterans Affair Medical Center, San Francisco, and the University of California San Francisco, which concludes that that [sic] several figures are the result of fabrication or falsification. Following receipt of this report the Editors propose that your paper be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email included a draft of the retraction note that was later published.&nbsp; It stated that each author would need to communicate whether or not they agreed with the retraction. Dahiya responded on July 8, 2021:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have carried out a series of experiments during the last two years to address all the concerns raised by the UCSF / VA investigation committee. All the original data was submitted to your journal and all concerns were addressed. Now under the pressure of UCSF/VA committee, the Editor has decided to retract our paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We (all authors) do not agree with the decision to retract our article by the Editors-in-Chief.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-022-02501-9">retraction notice</a> appeared online more than a year later, in October 2022, and referenced the committee’s findings “that Figures 2b, 4b, 4c, 5a and 5c are the results of fabrication or falsification of data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenters on PubPeer had drawn attention to those figures in the paper as far back as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B690D4F3DBFD14CC77EEB2BADEB615#1">December 2013</a>, but none of the authors responded on the site.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The recent letter from the VA/UCSF to <em>Oncogene</em>, dated June 30, 2020, stated that the investigation committee had found falsified data in figures 4b, 4c, 5a, and 5c. The committee concluded “that falsification occurred because the same bands were used to represent different experimental conditions,” and that the “nature of this manipulation makes it unlikely to have occurred by error.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter also noted that the committee “could not determine who was responsible for the falsification of data,” and that none of the original data was available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a passage that echoed the investigation report, the letter detailed Dahiya’s defense of the paper, which the committee did not find convincing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The senior author, Dr. Rajvir Dahiya, “provided line scans of the analysis given to him by the first author of the published figures” Dr. Noboyuki Kikuno. The Committee reported that “Dr. Dahiya has corresponded with first author, Dr. Kikuno, and claims he has forwarded the densitometry readings of the published blots, not the original data and is convinced that the bands are different.” However, the “Investigation Committee does not accept the densitometry as valid but rather finds the forensic analyses (Exhibit 1, pp. 2, 3) more compelling.” Therefore, the Committee did not make a definitive determination of who was responsible for the falsification of data that constitutes Research Misconduct.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The VA/UCSF officials concluded with their recommendation to retract the paper, and reiterated the findings sent to the journal in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the 2020 letter’s statement that the journal had “not taken action” after the 2017 letter, a spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes <em>Oncogene</em>, told us that the editors of the journal and the research integrity group had launched an investigation in response:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Unfortunately, the investigation took somewhat longer than anticipated to complete. For context, while we appreciate that delays can be frustrating, there are a variety of reasons why our investigations can sometimes take longer to complete. When looking into issues, we may need to consult external experts, liaise with author institutions or COPE, or wait for authors to confer with their colleagues, prepare responses and, where appropriate, provide additional materials. Analysing raw data or assessing other evidence, which may require technical translations, can also be a lengthy process.</p>



<p>While we endeavour to proceed with investigations as swiftly and efficiently as possible, these factors, among others, can mean that it is not possible to update our readers as quickly as we would prefer.</p>



<p>Once we had completed our investigation and considered all options, we concluded that retracting the paper was the appropriate course of action to take.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The investigation into another of Dahiya’s papers at <em>Oncogene</em>, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1208811">Promoter CpG hypomethylation and transcription factor EGR1 hyperactivate heparanase expression in bladder cancer</a>,” is taking even longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article was published in 2005, and has been cited 74 times. <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B389C0A0760C29F0AAE17063A168C7#1">In 2013</a>, a PubPeer commenter pointed out “many similarities” between two panels of figure 6a in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahiya’s emails with the journal included one with new data and a response to the observation that bands in the 2005 paper’s figure 6 “are similar with different exposures,” which he sent on Sept. 18, 2019. He later sent the new data and responses to comments on the 2007 paper in the same thread, with the subject line “Two Oncogene articles under investigation.” None of the journal’s responses we saw seem to address the 2005 paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Springer Nature spokesperson confirmed that the investigation into the 2005 paper, which remains intact without an editor’s note of any kind, “is still ongoing.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/pic-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h4>Does high-risk pregnancy impact fathers/partners as well?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The transition to fatherhood significantly impacts men&#8217;s mental health and well-being. This is further compounded in the context of fatherhood and high-risk pregnancy (HRP), which remains a significantly under-researched area. The experience of impending parenthood is usually met with some angst but typically more excitement and joy. This joy can be shattered in the context of HRP for both mother and father. This impact is felt in similar but different ways and while research in the area of HRP more broadly remains limited, research specifically on fathers and HRP is rare. Thus, our study addressed the need to explore fathers&#8217; experiences as it relates to HRP by specifically using a scoping review methodology.</span></p>
<h4>What led you to study the impact of high-risk pregnancy on fathers?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">HRP has a negative psychological impact on both parents. For men, this period is also associated with severe stress-related symptoms, including being at an increased risk for the onset of mental health problems including, but not limited to, anxiety and depression. This means that fathers are also in need of support, particularly in the context of their role being perceived as only carer and supporter to their partners. This research is also linked to a larger study focusing on the experiences of fathers and HRP using an ethnographic, grounded theory approach. </span></p>
<h4>How does a high-risk pregnancy affect fathers?</h4>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, this research provides a greater understanding of the needs of fathers and what structures, interventions, and policies should be put in place to ensure that fathers feel both part of and supported throughout the pregnancy journey, especially a high-risk one.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through our research, we found that fathers are negatively impacted by a HRP through the way in which they are treated by healthcare professionals. This impact is felt in the lack of information that fathers are provided as well as a lack of figurative and literal spaces in the hospital environments for fathers to occupy. Fathers often reported that healthcare professionals tended to only inform mothers of the various treatment plans, prognosis of the treatment and conditions experienced by both mother and baby, thereby excluding fathers from the treatment process altogether and invalidating his presence, experience and contribution towards the family unit as a whole. Additionally, we noted that fathers tended to undergo a process of redefining their identity and the roles they envisioned in terms of what it means to be a “father.” This was experienced in fulfilling both a supportive function in the hospital and a single parent role at home, ensuring that older children were seen to and the household continued to function. All of these changes and uncertainties ultimately led to fathers experiencing a range of mental health challenges.</span></p>
<h4>How would a focus on fathers improve outcomes for mother, father, and baby?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05422-x">Our study</a> demonstrated that providing fathers with greater emotional and practical support has a direct impact on the aid they are able to provide for their child(ren) and partner. A lack of felt support increases mental health challenges which precipitates long-term effects on fathers. This in turn is felt by the mother and child(ren). A key finding from our study in this regard is the need for a family-centered approach by hospitals and healthcare providers in treating the family as a complete and functional unit. </span></p>
<h4>Why is it important?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This research is important because it acknowledges and highlights the alienation experienced by fathers and the difficulties that they encounter as a result of this alienation by healthcare professionals through a lack of information provided to them. Ultimately, this research provides a greater understanding of the needs of fathers and what structures, interventions, and policies should be put in place to ensure that fathers feel both part of and supported throughout the pregnancy journey, especially a high-risk one.</span></p>
<h4>What most surprised or excited you?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was surprising to see how little research has focused on fatherhood in the context of HRP. This is notwithstanding the limited research that has focused on mothers’ experiences as it relates to HRP. The more significant finding was that fathers experienced a range of mental health-related challenges that remain unstated or out of focus. In essence, the focus on the involved father is a pertinent debate currently, while fathers are navigating the disjunction between the involved father, traditional constructs of masculinity and the medical spaces where they are not always welcomed or supported.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maternal-death-us-climb-covid-racial-disparity">Maternal deaths in the U.S. keep climbing</a></h4>

              
                <p>An increasing number of U.S. women are dying during pregnancy or soon after giving birth, according to the latest data on the maternal mortality rate.</p>



<p>In 2021, there were <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124678" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births</a>, compared with 23.8 per 100,000 in 2020 and 20.1 in 2019, the National Center for Health Statistics reports March 16. The <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/us-maternal-mortality-crisis-continues-worsen-international-comparison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. rate greatly exceeds</a> those of other high-income countries. The total number of U.S. maternal deaths rose from 861 in 2020 to 1,205 in 2021.</p>





<p>There remains a wide disparity in the maternal mortality rate for Black women, at 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with white women, at 26.6 per 100,000. Many social determinants of health underlie this gap, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915910/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differences in the quality of care</a> that Black women receive before, during and after pregnancy.</p>



<p>The NCHS report doesn’t discuss the reasons behind the increase for 2021. But <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths</a> in 2020 and 2021, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in October. The pandemic also contributed to the mortality disparity between Black and white women, the GAO found, worsening existing structural inequities that lead to such issues as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">barriers to getting health care</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Growing rates</h3>



<p>The U.S. maternal mortality rate has risen overall since 2018. The highest rate is among non-Hispanic Black women compared with Hispanic women and non-Hispanic white women.</p>

<p>The maternal deaths captured by the NCHS report are those that occur during pregnancy or within 42 days of the end of the pregnancy, “from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management.” These causes include hemorrhaging, infections and high blood pressure disorders such as eclampsia.</p>



<p>The report excludes deaths after 42 days and up to the first year after birth. But <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/erase-mm/data-mmrc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 percent of pregnancy-related deaths</a> occur during this period, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in September, from an analysis of the years 2017 to 2019.</p>





<p>“We really do need to be able to care for our new moms beyond that six-week period,” says maternal fetal medicine specialist Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman, Chair of the Obstetrics, Gynecology &amp; Reproductive Sciences Department at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine.</p>



<p>One effort to expand coverage in the year after birth is through Medicaid insurance, which paid for 42 percent of U.S. births in 2020. States have the option to extend coverage from up to 60 days after birth to a full year through a provision of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.</p>



<p>The maternal mortality rate also excludes maternal deaths due to homicide. In 2018 and 2019, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9134264/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homicide was the leading cause of death</a> during pregnancy or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy, responsible for more than twice as many deaths as causes like hemorrhaging, researchers reported in <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em> in 2021. Studies have found that in the majority of these homicide cases, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8961681/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an intimate partner is the killer</a>, most often using a gun. Pregnant women are at higher risk of homicide than nonpregnant women of reproductive age.</p>



<p>Suicide is also a leading cause of death during pregnancy and one year after birth, but isn&#8217;t captured in the maternal mortality rate.</p>



<p>There have been improvements in managing pregnancy complications like hemorrhaging and blood pressure disorders, Gyamfi-Bannerman says. Implementing care bundles, which are akin to medical checklists, for these and other complications <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020520/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can reduce maternal mortality</a>.</p>



<p>But since gun violence and poor maternal mental health “are also leading to maternal mortality,” Gyamfi-Bannerman says, addressing these issues is crucial too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-venus-erupting-decades-old-nasa">A volcano on Venus was spotted erupting in decades-old images</a></h4>

              
                <p>Venus has active volcanism. A new analysis of decades-old images reveals the first definitive sign of a volcano erupting on the hellish planet next door.</p>



<p>NASA’s Magellan spacecraft observed the volcano Maat Mons twice between 1990 and 1992. Sometime in the 243 Earth days between each observation, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm7735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the volcanic vent appears to have morphed</a> from a 2.2-square-kilometer circle to a 4-square-kilometer blob. That change indicates that <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/pdf/1061.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an eruption had occurred</a>, researchers report online March 15 in <em>Science </em>and at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas.</p>





<p>“This world is not quiet, not quiescent, not dead,” says planetary scientist Paul Byrne of Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the new work.</p>



<p>Venus is about the same size and mass as Earth so it should have a similar amount of internal heat. And that heat must escape somehow. Scientists have long thought that Venus should be volcanically active. “We’ve just never had something we can point to. And now we do,” Byrne says. He’s also confident that volcanoes on Venus can still erupt now.</p>



<p>“There’s no way you have a planet that big that was doing something 30 years ago and stopped,” he says. “It’s definitely still active today.”</p>



<p>Planetary scientist Robert Herrick spotted the change after painstakingly poring through images of the Venusian regions considered most likely to be volcanically active. “This was a needle-in-a-haystack search with no guarantee that the needle exists,” says Herrick, of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.</p>

Another one (Expanded Vent) was due to real changes on Venus’ surface — probably a volcanic eruption.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122820">R.R. Herrick and S.

<p>Much circumstantial evidence for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-erupting">eruptions</a> on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/evidence-mounts-active-volcanoes-venus">Venus</a> has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lava-may-be-flowing-venus-volcano">been reported</a> over the decades (<em>SN: 10/22/10; SN: 6/19/15; SN: 10/18/16)</em>. But it has been difficult to tell whether any particular change was due to real geology on the ground, or just a mirage. Many reported differences have turned out just to be due to Magellan’s differing viewing angles over successive orbits around Venus.</p>



<p>“Fundamentally, looking at these images is very hard,” says radar scientist Scott Hensley of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “It’s not like people have not looked [for active volcanism]. People have been looking over the years.”</p>





<p>Still, the vent’s change in the images alone was not enough to convince Hensley and Herrick that they were seeing evidence for active volcanism. So, Hensley ran more than 100 computer simulations of what Maat Mons would have looked like to Magellan under different imaging conditions. “None of them ever looked like [the 4-square-kilometer blob] on the second cycle,” Hensley says. The change must be real, he concluded.</p>



<p>The volcano’s change in shape suggests that it probably didn’t explosively explode like Washington’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mount-st-helens-cold-hearted-volcano">Mount St. Helens</a> did in 1980, Byrne says (<em>SN: 11/1/16</em>). Instead, the eruption was probably more like the long, slow lava drainage from Hawaii’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-explosive-things-2018-eruption-taught-us-about-kilauea">Kilauea volcano in 2018</a>, only bigger, he says (<em>SN: 1/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>The finding gives scientists an idea of what to expect — and some new ideas for research — when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">upcoming missions return to Venus</a> (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). In the late 2020s or early 2030s, NASA plans to launch VERITAS, a satellite that will map the whole planet from space, and EnVision, which will take high-resolution satellite images of targeted regions.</p>



<p>“The cool part is it means that Venus is volcanically active now. In these upcoming missions, we are going to see things happening,” Herrick said in his March 15 talk. “We already had plans to try and look for new things and changes with time in both of those missions … we now know that that’s a valuable thing to do.”</p>



<p>This work is awe-inspiring, said planetary scientist Darby Dyar of Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Ma., who was not involved in the new work. “Everybody in this room should be salivating over the features we’re going to see” in images from future missions.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a> with applications and nominations for this year&rsquo;s awards open until <strong>April 30th, 2023</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>.&nbsp; The awards program honors researchers who&nbsp;reflect&nbsp;<strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong>&nbsp;in their work. To get a flavor of what the Einstein Foundation is looking for we have asked last year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their work. Last week we featured <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/the-open-science-atlas/">Open Science Atlas</a>. Today we hear about the Ape Research Index from Elisa Bandini and Sofia Forss from the University of Zurich. You can watch a video <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/recipients-and-finalists/recipients-2022/ape-research-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and/or read more below.</p>



<p>Our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, are the primary comparative models for researchers working on a variety of human evolutionary questions. If you try typing in the keywords &lsquo;chimpanzee&rsquo;, &lsquo;model&rsquo; and &lsquo;human&rsquo; into google scholar, you will get 27,200,200 pages of results in less than a second (Rolian &amp; Carvalho, 2018), demonstrating the importance of chimpanzees as models across scientific disciplines. Our research lies at the intersection of various fields, including primatology, archaeology, and cultural evolution. To generate insight into the evolution of human and non-human primate cognition and behaviour, we often extrapolate findings from experimental studies with captive apes (in particular, chimpanzees), using these extant primates also as comparative models for early hominins. Generalizing findings from one or two populations of captive chimpanzees to the whole species, and then using these data as basis for a range of questions on human and non-human primate evolution is common practice in the field. However, it was whilst running some of our studies with captive chimpanzees that we realized that this approach is very problematic, for several reasons.</p>



<p>Firstly, we started noticing that despite our best attempts to match the environmental conditions during testing (one of the important benefits of testing in captivity is being able to control the environment more than when testing wild individuals), we were observing a huge amount of inter-individual variation in performance in the problem-solving tasks we provided to the chimpanzees, both within and across populations. We are not the only ones to have noticed variations in performance in captive chimpanzees, yet these differences are often treated more as &acute;noise&acute; in the data, and only reported anecdotally. Although easily ignored, these differences in performance in research tasks most likely provide key information on chimpanzee cognition and may jeopardize the generalizability of studies from certain populations of captive chimpanzees. Whilst the role of the environment, genetics and developmental processes in chimpanzee cognition and behaviour is relatively well-understood, one factor that is rarely taken into account is the effect of previous experience. Yet, how previous experience shapes our own behaviour and cognition is a well-researched area in the field of human psychology. As chimpanzees are so closely related to us, we hypothesize that previous experience also influences chimpanzee performance in research tasks. In particular, we argue that the more experience a chimpanzee has in experiments, the better they will perform in subsequent tasks.</p>



<p>If our hypothesis is found to be true, this would have huge repercussions across disciplines that generalize findings from captive chimpanzee populations to generate hypotheses on both non-human and human primate cognition. The current approach in the field is problematic also because of the centralization of captive chimpanzee research, as the majority of studies with captive chimpanzees are carried-out at a handful of institutions around the world. These zoos and sanctuaries have a long-standing reputation for research and attract a steady stream of funding and researchers to test the chimpanzees they house. This has resulted in some populations of captive chimpanzees building up a lifetime of almost daily testing sessions and a huge body of experience in research tasks. Therefore, if we find that previous experience does have an effect on current chimpanzee cognition and behaviour, then we would have to completely reconsider studies that extrapolate data from these intensively studied chimpanzee populations to the whole species, as they might not be reliable representative of the abilities of the species.</p>



<p>Our project, The Ape Research Index (ARI), will investigate this open question by carrying out a meta-analysis of the existing literature to identify the levels of research experience of chimpanzees currently living at institutions around the globe, and correlate their experience levels with their performance in these tasks. Our second objective will be to identify the groups with the highest levels of experience and the ones with the lowest, and directly test both groups with the same test batteries (with tasks novel to both groups), to examine whether previous experience has an effect on their ability to solve new tasks across cognitive domains. Lastly, we will place all this data into a completely open-access database (ARI), which will allow researchers to check the level of previous experience of different captive chimpanzee populations in order to identify the most appropriate sample for their particular research question. This approach will greatly increase the reliability and robustness of comparative cognition studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-planet-collision-earth-plate-tectonics">A moon-forming cataclysm could have also triggered Earth’s plate tectonics</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS</strong> — Vestiges of a moon-forming cataclysm could have kick-started plate tectonics on Earth.</p>



<p>The leading explanation for the origin of the moon proposes that a Mars-sized planet, dubbed Theia, struck the nascent Earth, ejecting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-moon-formation-space-doughnut">a cloud of debris</a> into space that later coalesced into a satellite (<em>SN: 3/2/18</em>). New computer simulations suggest that purported remains of Theia deep inside the planet <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/pdf/2723.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have also triggered the onset of subduction</a>, a hallmark of modern plate tectonics, geodynamicist Qian Yuan of Caltech reported March 13 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.</p>





<p>The story offers a cohesive explanation for how Earth gained both its moon and its moving tectonic plates, and it could aid in the search for other Earthlike worlds. But others caution that it’s much too early to say that this is, in fact, what happened.</p>



<p>Of all the worlds yet discovered, ours is the only one confirmed to have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">plate tectonics</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). For <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-may-have-started-earlier-than-we-thought">billions of years</a>, Earth’s creeping plates have spread, collided and plunged beneath one another, birthing and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">splitting continents</a>, uplifting mountain ranges and widening oceans (<em>SN: 4/22/20, SN: 1/11/17</em>). But all this reshaping has also erased most of the clues to the planet’s early history, including how and when plate tectonics first began.</p>



<p>Many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">hypotheses</a> have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-eroded-glaciers-may-have-kick-started-plate-tectonics">proposed</a> to explain the initiation of subduction, a tectonic process in which one plate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sinking-melting-ancient-tectonic-plate-may-fuel-yellowstones-supervolcano">slides under another</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/22; SN: 6/5/19; SN: 1/2/18</em>). Yuan and his colleagues chose to focus on two continent-sized blobs of material in Earth’s lower mantle known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/remnants-earth-birth-linger-45-billion-years-later">large low-shear velocity provinces</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/16</em>). These are regions through which seismic waves are known to move anomalously slow. Researchers had previously proposed these regions could have formed from old, subducted plates<em>.</em> But in 2021, Yuan and colleagues alternatively proposed that the mysterious masses could be the dense, sunken <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/1980.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remnants of Theia</a>.</p>



<p>Building off that previous work, the researchers used computers to simulate how Theia’s impact, and its lingering remains, would impact the flow of rock inside the Earth.</p>



<p>They found that once these hot alien blobs had sunk to the bottom of the mantle, they could have compelled large plumes of warm rock to upwell and wedge into Earth’s rigid outer layer. As upwelling continued to feed into the risen plumes, they would have ballooned and pushed slabs of Earth’s surface beneath them, triggering subduction about 200 million years after the moon formed.</p>



<p>While the simulations suggest the large low-shear velocity provinces could have had a hand in starting subduction, it’s not yet clear whether these masses came from Theia. “The features … are a fairly recent discovery,” says geodynamicist Laurent Montési of the University of Maryland in College Park. “They’re very fascinating structures, with a very unknown origin.” As such, he says, it’s too early to say that Theia triggered plate tectonics.</p>



<p>“It’s provoking. This material down there is something special,” Montési says of the large low-shear velocity provinces. “But whether it has to be originally extraterrestrial, I don’t think the case is made.”</p>





<p>However, if confirmed, the explanation could have implications that reach beyond our solar system. “If you have a large moon, you likely have a large impactor,” Yuan said. Scientists have yet to confirm the discovery of such an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skepticism-whether-first-known-exomoon-exists-kepler">exomoon</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>). But keeping an eye out, Yuan said, could help us uncover another world as tectonically active as our own.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-wolf-fish-unusual-deep-sea-ecosystem">A ‘fire wolf’ fish could expand what we know about one unusual deep-sea ecosystem</a></h4>

              
                <p>Off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica sits a deep-sea chimera of an ecosystem. Jacó Scar is a methane seep, where the gas escapes from sediment into the seawater, but the seep isn’t cold like the others found before it. Instead, geochemical activity gives the Scar lukewarm water that enables organisms from both traditionally colder seeps and scalding hot hydrothermal vents to call it home.</p>



<p>One resident of the Scar is a <a href="https://www.mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5230.1.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly identified species of small, purplish fish called an eelpout</a>, described for the first time on January 19 in <em>Zootaxa</em>. This fish is the first vertebrate species found at the Scar and could help scientists understand how the unique ecosystem developed.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Jacó Scar was discovered during exploration of a known field of methane seeps off the Costa Rican coast and named for the nearby town of Jacó. It is “a really diverse place” with many different organisms living in various microhabitats, says Lisa Levin, a marine ecologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.</p>



<p>Levin was on one of the first expeditions to the Scar but wasn’t involved in the new study. She recalls the team finding and collecting one of the fish during this early excursion, but the researchers didn’t recognize it as a new species.</p>



<p>Several more specimens were snagged during later submersible dives. Charlotte Seid, an invertebrate biologist at Scripps who is working on a checklist of organisms found at the Costa Rican seeps, brought the fishy finds to ichthyologist Ben Frable, also of Scripps, for formal identification.</p>



<p>Frable says he knew the fish was an eelpout. They look exactly as one would expect based on their name: like frowning eels, though they aren’t true eels. But he was having trouble determining what type. Eelpouts are a diverse family of fish comprised of nearly 300 species that can be found all over the world at various ocean depths.</p>



<p>Because the physical differences between species can be subtle, they are “kind of a tricky group” to identify, Frable says. “I just was not really getting anywhere.” So the team turned to eelpout expert Peter Rask Møller of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, sending him X-rays, pictures and eventually one of the fish specimens.</p>



<p>Møller narrowed the enigmatic eelpout to the genus <em>Pyrolycus</em>, meaning “fire wolf.” Turns out, the tool, called a dichotomous key, that Frable had been using to identify the specimens was outdated, made before <em>Pyrolycus </em>was described in 2002. “I did not know that genus existed,” Frable says.</p>



<p>Because the other two known <em>Pyrolycus </em>species live far away in the western Pacific and have different physical features, the team dubbed the mystery fish <em>P. jaco </em>— a new species.</p>



<p>The first eelpouts most likely evolved in cold waters, Frable says, but many have since made their home in the scalding waters of hydrothermal vents. Of the 24 known fish species that live only at hydrothermal vents, “13 of them are eelpouts,” Frable says.</p>

Frable and C. Seid/Scripps Institution of Oceanography</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new finding raises questions about how the known <em>Pyrolycus </em>species came to live so far apart. It may have to do with the fact that methane seeps are more common than previously thought on the ocean floor, and if some are lukewarm like Jacó Scar, the new species could have used them as refuges while moving east.</p>



<p>And by comparing <em>P. jaco</em> to its vent-living relatives, researchers may be able to figure out how it adapted to live in the tepid waters of the Scar — which may provide clues to how other species living there did too.</p>





<p>The eelpout is part of a medley of other species that form Jacó Scar’s composite ecosystem, along with, for example, clams typically found at cold seeps and bacteria found at hydrothermal vents. Jacó Scar is a “mixing bowl” of species found in other parts of the world, Seid says. Figuring out how this eclectic bunch interacts “is part of the fun.”</p>

                "Many of us probably share the following intuitions: to keep up with the ever-growing amount of literature, researchers have to specialize more and more; this reduces the potentially fruitful exchange between specialist bubbles. And: a growing number of political, economic, and societal decisions are made based on science. However, science gives guidance only; it does not make decisions for us. Given the participatory nature of democratic societies, we all need to understand what science generally – not only science from one’s own field of expertise – actually tells us about climate change, future energy systems, COVID-19, multiresistant bacteria, loss of biodiversity, etc.

But would researchers or stakeholders read the original papers in fields beyond their own expertise? Many wouldn’t – and they’d miss the information. The value of press releases, newspapers, and popular science magazines, on the other hand, is limited . These aim at being comprehensible to broader audiences and, to this end, refrain from presenting the full complexity and limitations of the actual findings.

The conceptual gap between these types of document is usually large. An article that falls within that gap, however, might offer an appropriate balance of simplicity and complexity for researchers with different specializations, policymakers, decision-makers, funders, early career scientists, journalists, educated generalists – in short, for those less likely to read the original research but who have an in-depth interest in the science presented.

I’d therefore like to suggest that this gap is a place in its own right that deserves additional coverage...."
