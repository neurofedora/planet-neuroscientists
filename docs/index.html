              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-asteroid-bennu-first-look-sample">NASA’s first look at a sample from asteroid Bennu reveals life’s building blocks</a></h4>

              
                <p>NASA scientists are just beginning to reveal details about roughly 250 grams of dust and rocks brought back to Earth from the asteroid Bennu. The samples are the result of the first U.S. mission to return a sample from an asteroid, and the largest cache of material ever collected beyond the orbit of the moon.</p>



<p>This mission is the beginning of “a new era of exploration, and this is the era of sample science,” said Makenzie Lystrup, director of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFvIuSpACQA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live streaming event</a> on October 11. “This is when sample science really begins.”</p>





<p>The mission began seven years ago when the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft left Earth to rendezvous with Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid that may hold clues to the formation of the solar system and the origin of life on Earth. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">OSIRIS-REx lightly touched down on Bennu</a> in 2020, scooped up a coffee cup–sized sample and sealed it away for the long trip back home (<em>SN</em>: 10/21/20) .</p>



<p>OSIRIS-REx<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth"> jettisoned its sample return capsule</a> back to Earth on September 24 (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>). The spacecraft continued on its way, under the new name OSIRIS-APEX, as it headed out on its next mission — going into orbit around the near-Earth asteroid Apophis.</p>



<p>The capsule containing the Bennu samples parachuted down to a desert landing site in Utah, where it was picked up and helicoptered to NASA’s Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston. NASA scientists carefully opened the capsule in a dedicated clean room designed to ensure that the pristine asteroid material wouldn’t be contaminated by any terrestrial material.</p>



<p>The material in the capsule was collected by blowing dust and rocks into a container with blasts of nitrogen gas. The sample consists primarily of asteroid material from as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-has-picked-osiris-rex-landing-site-asteroid-bennu">deep as 50 centimeters below the surface</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/19</em>). Additional dust and grit that adhered to the spacecraft landing pads when OSIRIS-REx touched down on Bennu will offer a look at the composition of the surface of the asteroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mission returned some bonus material as well, in the form of loose debris that was inadvertently kicked up into the capsule in the area around the collection container, prior to the capsule sealing up for the trip home. The science team has delayed opening the main sample canister, instead taking time to collect and analyze the bonus sample.</p>



<p>Much of that material is made up of water-bearing clay minerals. “The reason that Earth is the habitable world that we have, with oceans and lakes and rivers and rain,” said planetary scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who leads the OSIRIS-REx mission, “is because these clay minerals, like the ones we&#8217;re seeing from Bennu landed on Earth 4 billion years ago to 4.5 billion years ago, making our world habitable.”</p>



<p>Other grains contain elements common on Earth, including carbon and iron, Lauretta said, as well as platelike sulfur structures that may have been crucial for jump-starting life.</p>



<p>A quarter of the Bennu sample will go to scientists on the OSIRIS-REx mission for analysis. The rest will be divvied up among scientists around the globe, with a portion set aside for future study.</p>



<p>“This stuff is an astrobiologist&#8217;s dream,” said Daniel Glavin, a senior scientist for sample return at Goddard. “I just can&#8217;t wait to get at it. And this material will be around for generations and generations.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pig-kidney-monkey-survival-organ-transplant">A monkey survived two years with a miniature pig’s kidney</a></h4>

              
                <p>Little pigs with big genome edits could be the future of organ donation.</p>



<p>A monkey that received a kidney from a genetically engineered miniature pig <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06594-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lived for more than two years after the transplant</a>, scientists report October 11 in <em>Nature</em>. The team took a molecular red pen to donor pigs’ genomes, editing the animals’ organs to be more of a match for humans. Such an editing strategy could one day make it more likely for people’s bodies to accept organs from different species.</p>





<p>The work, funded by biotechnology company eGenesis, is the latest in a string of efforts seeking to use other species to address global organ shortages. The new study is “promising work and a step in the right direction,” says Parsia Vagefi, a transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>In the United States, the demand for new organs to replace damaged or diseased ones far outpaces supply. As of October 11, nearly <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">104,000 Americans sit on the national transplant waiting list</a>. Some 89,000 of these people are seeking kidneys. “There just simply aren’t enough kidneys to go around,” said eGenesis president and CEO Mike Curtis in a news conference on October 10. Most people waiting will never get the offer, he says. “They will die on dialysis.”</p>



<p>That’s where cross-species transplantation — giving people organs from other animals — comes in, Curtis said. It’s “the only near-term viable solution to solving this huge shortfall in organ availability.”</p>



<p>But the path forward is studded with scientific stumbling blocks. Pig organs aren’t a molecular match for human bodies, for one. Porcine cells display suspicious-looking sugars that spell “stranger” to our immune systems. This can prompt rejection of a transplanted organ.</p>



<p>If the body sees those sugars, “It’s like, ‘whoa, you’re not supposed to be here,’ and the immune system attacks,” says Jayme Locke, a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Scientists tweak donor animals’ genomes to “make the pig kidney as human as possible so that our body recognizes it and doesn’t immediately attack it,” she says.</p>



<p>Locke and others have already made progress in this field. In 2021, a team at NYU Langone Health <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">tested how well a kidney from a genetically modified pig</a> functioned by attaching it to a brain-dead woman (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>). In 2022, Locke’s group upped the ante, <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/campus/item/12566-uab-announces-first-clinical-grade-transplant-of-gene-edited-pig-kidneys-into-brain-dead-human" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publishing the first peer-reviewed study on a gene-edited pig kidney transplanted into a brain-dead person</a>.</p>



<p>That year, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pig-heart-organ-transplant-brain-dead-people">doctors also transplanted modified pig hearts into two brain-dead people</a> — and even a living man (<em>SN: 7/12/22</em>). The man, 57-year-old David Bennett from Maryland, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">survived for two months with the transplanted organ</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/22</em>). This September, another patient, Lawrence Faucette, became the second living person to receive a genetically modified pig heart.</p>



<p>In August, Locke’s team reported that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2808483?guestAccessKey=b0ebd45b-dbfd-4566-bcda-0411f989ae23&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=081623" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pig kidneys transplanted into a brain-dead man can function normally</a>, producing urine over the course of a seven-day study. Her team worked with a different kind of genetically modified pig than the ones Curtis and his colleagues created — one with 10 genomic edits rather than up to 69.</p>



<p>The edits, which strip away some pig aspects and add in human ones, fall into three main categories designed to make the animals’ organs safer for human use. They lop off stranger-danger sugars from pigs’ cells, insert human genes to help prevent organ rejection and knock out potentially harmful retroviruses embedded in the pigs’ genomes. “This is probably the most genetically modified pig that I&#8217;ve seen described in the literature,” Locke says.</p>



<p>Curtis’ team mixed and matched edits in different pigs and transplanted their kidneys into monkeys. Because these are pig kidneys genetically tailored for humans, scientists have to dose the monkeys with powerful immunosuppressive drugs, so the animals don’t reject the new organs. But these types of animal studies are important, Locke says, because they can demonstrate long-term organ function, which is difficult to show in people with brain death.</p>





<p>Eight out of 15 monkeys that received pig kidneys lacking the sugars and carrying the human genes survived 176 days or longer, Curtis&#8217; team showed. One monkey lasted much longer, living 758 days after the kidney transplant. Monkeys with pig kidneys missing the human genes didn’t fare nearly as well, surviving a median of 24 days.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s encouraging when you see a pig kidney being able to function for two years,” Vagefi says. “But I think it’s even more encouraging when you see it done consistently.” Like any good study, he says, the work opens a chasm of questions. He wonders, for example, how many more genetic edits pig organs may need to succeed long-term in monkeys regularly.</p>



<p>Even then, there might not be a single kind of pig donor that’s right for every person, Locke points out. She thinks it’s important to have options. Doctors may “need more than one type of genetically edited pig in order to serve all the people in need.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-collision-first-afterglow-infrared-light">In a first, astronomers spot the afterglow of an exoplanet collision</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a solar system about 1,800 light-years from Earth, two planets smacked into one another in an impact that vaporized them both. And astronomers caught them in the act.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06573-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incandescent blob of leftover planet</a>, lingering after an impact, could explain a surge of infrared light from a remote star, researchers report October 11 in <em>Nature</em>. And the ensuing debris field could also explain a subsequent dimming of the star, the team says. While scientists have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-asteroids-fomalhaut-star">glimpsed planetary debris in other solar systems</a> before, no one has seen the smoldering remains of a collision between exoplanets until now (<em>SN: 5/8/23</em>).</p>





<p>“The possible detection of a post-impact body is really exciting,” says astrophysicist Philip Carter of the University of Bristol in England, who was not involved in the new study. “As far as I’m aware, no one&#8217;s claimed this before.”</p>



<p>As is often the case for exciting astronomical discoveries, detecting the aftermath of this cosmic smackdown involved more than a little luck.</p>



<p>Astronomer Matthew Kenworthy wasn’t hunting for giant impacts. “I was looking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-rings-encircle-young-exoplanet">for rings</a>” around exoplanets, he says (<em>SN: 2/1/15</em>). So he was scouring telescope survey data for stars that flicker or dim in unusual ways. And when the ASAS-SN survey — an ongoing project to monitor the entire sky for exploding stars — captured the sunlike star ASASSN-21qj repeatedly dimming in visible light, “I immediately jumped on it,” says Kenworthy, of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>As he was analyzing the fading star, Kenworthy stumbled upon another clue — on social media. One of his posts on Twitter (now called X) about ASASSN-21qj’s unusual behavior caught the eye of citizen scientist Arttu Sainio. “I tweeted out saying: ‘Oh, this is amazing, this star is fading!’” Kenworthy says. “Then he said: ‘Oh, by the way, did you realize the star had brightened up [in infrared]?’”</p>



<p>Sainio pointed out that infrared data from NASA’s orbiting WISE telescope showed a strong uptick in infrared radiation from the star about 900 days before the dimming started. Kenworthy’s hopes for rings were dashed. But maybe he and his colleagues had found something else just as fascinating.</p>



<p>“It just totally changed the story,” Kenworthy says.</p>



<p>The researchers realized that a giant impact could neatly tie together the spontaneous infrared glow and the visible light dimming that followed more than two years later. Their calculations suggest that two Neptune-sized planets collided, vaporizing each other and forming a hot, donut-shaped body of vaporized rock —&nbsp;the source of the infrared glow. ASASSN-21qj later dimmed when impact debris smeared out around the star and blocked some of its light.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Two exoplanets collided in a smashup that left behind a glob of hot, vaporized rock and a debris cloud. Astronomers first observed the afterglow of the collision in infrared light. Then, 900 days later, they saw the pulverized planets’ star dim as impact debris drifted in front of it, between the star and Earth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Alternatively, it’s possible that astronomers observed two separate events: an infrared glow from dust warmed by starlight, perhaps left behind by a collision between close-orbiting protoplanets, followed by dimming as a big disk of unrelated material passed in front of the star. But two rare events happening in close succession is “really, really, really unlikely,” Kenworthy says.</p>



<p>The putative post-impact blob could one day coalesce into a planet. And as the remaining debris shears out into a disk orbiting the star, it too might eventually collect onto the new planet or form moons around it.</p>





<p>How long all that might take isn’t clear, Carter says. It could happen within a few years or perhaps several thousand. “The models of these impact remnants are still in the very early stages,” he says. Either way, continuing to observe the post-impact material over the coming years will give scientists a rare chance to witness, not just simulate, what happens after a planetary collision.</p>



<p>“You expect astronomical processes to take astronomical amounts of time. And it&#8217;s like: Nope! This was very fast. This happened over just a few years,” Kenworthy says. “It&#8217;ll just be fascinating to see how it evolves over time, in the next 10 or 20 years.”</p>

                <p>Authors and readers on arXiv may have noticed some interruptions to arXiv service over the weekend and Monday night. We have recently been running tests related to shifting the infrastructure arXiv uses to serve articles. These tests resulted in unexpected glitches that caused some newly announced PDFs to be temporarily unavailable. We have terminated the testing for now and interruptions to service should be restored.</p>
<p>These tests are important as they are in service of finding a new infrastructure that will best support arXiv’s increasing traffic more robustly; however, we will not resume testing until we can ensure a higher degree of reliability for our users.</p>
<p>We apologize for any issues – if you are still having difficulty accessing PDFs, contact our User Support team via the <a href="https://arxiv-org.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1">arXiv user support portal</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-editing-chicken-resistant-bird-flu">Gene editing can make chickens resistant to bird flu</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chickens genetically modified to be impervious to bird flu may one day prevent the spread of the disease on farms, a study suggests.</p>



<p>Just small tweaks to a single gene made<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41476-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> chickens resistant to an avian influenza infection</a>, researchers report October 10 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>The gene, known as <em>ANP32A</em>, provides the instructions that tell chicken cells how to make a protein that flu viruses rely on to successfully hijack cells. Disrupting the avian virus’s ability to commandeer the protein stopped most genetically edited birds from getting infected.</p>





<p>Testing the gene editing in such a ubiquitous agricultural animal that&#8217;s susceptible to bird flu makes the new study “especially impactful and important,” says Jacob Yount, a viral immunologist at Ohio State University in Columbus who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>The virus can rapidly spread among birds on poultry farms, sometimes with devastating consequences. Beginning in 2022, an outbreak hit the global poultry industry hard, pushing farmers to cull millions of birds in the United States alone. After a summer lull, on October 4, a turkey farm in South Dakota confirmed the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first case on a U.S. poultry farm since April</a>, affecting around 47,300 birds. </p>



<p>While many avian flu strains cause only mild illness in birds, such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">deadly strains like the one behind the global outbreak can kill domesticated and wild birds</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). Chickens also occasionally transmit flu to farm animals like pigs or, less often, people. </p>



<p>Ideally genetic editing would completely stop the virus from replicating inside the animals, so it can’t pose a risk to birds, or people, at all. But in the new study, some edited chickens still got infected, meaning the technique isn’t yet 100 percent effective.</p>



<p>The new research “isn’t all the way there yet, but I think it’s an amazing first step and an amazing proof of concept,” Yount says.</p>



<p>Vaccines to defend poultry from flu exist, but the tactic is expensive, and the virus swiftly adapts to evade that protection, developmental biologist Mike McGrew of the University of Edinburgh said in an October 5 news conference. Gene editing, on the other hand, offers a way to make permanent changes that leave an animal resistant to a particular disease.</p>



<p><em>ANP32A</em> is a good gene to tweak in chickens because it’s “absolutely essential” for the virus’s replication, virologist Wendy Barclay of Imperial College London said at the news conference.</p>



<p>In the study, Barclay, McGrew and colleagues made two changes to <em>ANP32A</em> using the molecular scissors CRISPR/Cas9, so that the gene’s protein could no longer interact with avian flu viruses. After monitoring the birds for two years, the edited chickens were healthy, and hens laid eggs normally just like unedited birds, genetic engineer Alewo Idoko-Akoh of the University of Bristol in England said at the news conference. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team then placed 10 normal and 10 gene-edited chicks in separate incubators and exposed them to a dose of around 1,000 infectious particles of avian influenza directly in the nasal cavity. The strain was one that could infect the birds but not make them severely ill. A day later, the two groups of 2-week-old chicks were then each joined by 10 unexposed peers, called sentinels. The unedited birds were paired with unedited sentinels, and gene-edited birds were paired with gene-edited sentinels.</p>



<p>All 10 unedited chickens got infected and had high levels of virus in their bodies, and so did seven of their sentinels. Only one of the gene-edited birds contracted the virus.</p>





<p>That infected modified bird had low levels of virus, and it didn’t transmit the virus to any of the edited sentinels. But “we felt that it would be the responsible thing to be more rigorous, to stress test this and ask, are these chickens truly resistant?” Barclay said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So the researchers repeated the experiment, exposing chickens to 1,000 times as much virus as before, about 1 million infectious particles — an abnormally high dose that contains more virus than the birds would likely be exposed to on poultry farms. The team also mixed in both unedited and edited sentinels with exposed chickens.</p>



<p>In one incubator, all the normal chickens got infected and transmitted the virus to every unedited sentinel. No edited sentinel birds in that incubator caught the flu. In the other incubator, five of 10 modified chickens became infected after exposure, transmitting the virus to one unedited sentinel but no edited ones. That suggests that even though the virus could infect chicks at high doses, the animals weren’t very contagious.</p>



<p>Viruses from the gene-edited chickens that got infected had adapted in ways that allowed the viruses to ditch their reliance on the ANP32A protein and instead co-opt two other proteins in the same family to replicate. That means editing more than one gene may be necessary to make chickens fully resistant to flu.</p>



<p>“If this was a disease that only infected chickens, then the resistance that we created would be better than what we would get with a vaccine,” McGrew said. “But because this is a zoonotic disease and can be spread potentially to humans, we really need to aim for complete resistance.”</p>



<p>Eliminating all three <em>ANP32</em> genes from chicken cells grown in a lab dish stopped the virus from replicating at all. But because having at least some ANP32 proteins may be important for developing chick brains, bones and hearts, that strategy might cause problems for live chickens. More work is needed to figure out if that is true, Yount says, and whether other genes outside of the <em>ANP32 </em>family might also be good candidates for editing.</p>



<p>The use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gmos-havent-delivered-their-promises-or-risks">not without controversy</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/16</em>). But it’s important to continue such work in chickens, Idoko-Akoh said, “so that then when maybe it becomes widely or more culturally accepted, we can take advantage of the technology.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mobius-strip-mystery-solved-math">An enduring Möbius strip mystery has finally been solved</a></h4>

              
                <p>Any attempt to better understand Möbius strips is bound to run into some kinks.</p>



<p>The twisted loops are so strange that mathematicians have struggled to answer some basic questions about them. For example: “What’s the shortest Möbius strip you can make for a paper band of a given width?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question hooked mathematician Richard Evan Schwartz. A mistake in a computer program almost prevented him from finding the answer. Simply messing around with strips of paper finally helped him solve the mystery.</p>





<p>A Möbius strip is a mathematical oddity that anyone can make. Cut a strip of paper, twist one end halfway around, and tape the two ends together to form a loop with a twist in it. The result is a one-sided surface. The strips have inspired mathematicians, artists and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mobius-strip-carbon-atoms-chemistry">scientists</a> in a variety of fields (<em>SN: 5/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>A long, skinny Möbius strip is easier to make than a stumpy one. With a very short strip, the paper has to contort so much that it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twist-m%C3%B6bius-band">flattens into an equilateral triangle</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/07</em>). (You can see this shape form if you slowly pull one end of an untaped Möbius strip to shorten it.) The triangular Möbius strip is made from a piece of paper that has a length that’s √3, or about 1.73, times its width.</p>



<p>In 1977, mathematicians hypothesized that the triangular Möbius strip was as short as you can go. Specifically, it’s the limit for an idealized mathematical version of paper that is infinitely thin, smooth and nonstretchy, and which, like real-world paper, can’t pass through itself. But in the nearly 50 years that followed, no one had been able to prove it. Mathematicians could show only that the ratio between a Möbius strip’s length and width must be greater than π/2, or about 1.57.</p>



<p>The stumper piqued Schwartz’s interest. He is fond of simple problems that befuddle mathematicians. “I like it when no one has any idea what to do,” he says. A bonus: “If I bomb out on this, there’s no shame in it. I’m just like everybody else.”</p>



<p>Schwartz focused on a key property of Möbius strips: While the paper curves this way and that to form the loop, at every point on the band there’s a direction in which the paper follows a straight line from edge to edge, with no curvature at all. (That’s not true of all surfaces. Think of a bowl: There are no straight lines to be found.) He realized that, in any Möbius strip, there must always be two such lines that are perpendicular and in the same plane, as in the letter T.</p>



<p>Based on how the paper contorts to form this T shape, Schwartz found a new minimum length-to-width ratio. To his disappointment, it was not √3 but <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10711-021-00648-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number achingly close to it</a>, about 1.69, he reported in <em>Geometriae Dedicata</em> in 2021.</p>

<p>Schwartz moved on to other topics but couldn’t stop thinking about the problem. One day, on a whim, he began playing with strips of paper. In a head-smacking jolt, he realized he’d made an error.</p>



<p>Schwartz had assumed that slicing open a Möbius strip along a diagonal and flattening it forms a parallelogram. But when Schwartz cut open one of his paper Möbius strips, he saw in front of him not a parallelogram, but a trapezoid. “I instantly said, ‘uh oh,’” he says.</p>



<p>It was a simple mistake. But Schwartz had been investigating Möbius strips primarily on the computer. He’d flubbed the setup of his computer program, which led to the parallelogram whoopsie. “Once I’d made the mistake,” he says, “it’s like it got locked into my brain.”</p>





<p>Schwartz says he hardly ever used paper Möbius strips in his research. But that’s what it took to jolt him out of his stagnant thought pattern. It’s a bit curious that Schwartz didn’t turn to paper earlier. He fiddles with paper as a hobby, designing elaborate masks of dangling paper.</p>



<p>Once Schwartz redid the calculation with the trapezoid fix, √3 popped out. He’d <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally proved</a>, that the length of a Möbius strip must be greater than √3 times its width, Schwartz reported August 24 at arXiv.org. The triangular Möbius strip is truly the limit for paper Möbius strips.</p>



<p>Now, Schwartz is interested in taking this work further. What, he wonders, is the minimum length for a loop with two twists, or three twists, instead of one? This time, perhaps, he’ll spend more time playing with paper.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a child prodigy – famously writing music at an age when other children need lullabies to help them to fall asleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite how prolific he was, however, Mozart did not write an album called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B006LWWRDO">Bedtime Mozart</a>.” That has now created a headache for the authors of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-023-02746-4">study</a> published in <em>Pediatric Research</em> in August that found the particular set of melodies helped soothe babies during a particular blood test.</p>



<p>Like many “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/06/28/128104580/mozart-effect-was-just-what-we-wanted-to-hear">Mozart Effect</a>” studies before it, the new research prompted a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/999373">press release</a> referring to Mozart in its headline, and plenty of <a href="https://nature.altmetric.com/details/153406696/news">press coverage</a>. But Hinnerk Feldwisch-Drentrup, a correspondent for <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine</em>, thought something was off-key: </p>



<span id="more-128018"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The question arises as to whether the newborns actually listened to Wolfgang Amadeus: The YouTube video linked in the press release, which is supposed to contain a piece from an album “Bedtime Mozart: Classical Lullabies for Babies”, sounds tinny and is difficult for adults to bear &#8211; that Gedudel, published under the song title “Deep Sleep”, could hardly have been written by Mozart.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Feldwisch-Drentrup <a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/medizin-ernaehrung/mozart-effekt-angebliche-wunderwirkung-auf-babys-mit-schmerzen-19134866.html">reported in August</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After this newspaper inquired about these discrepancies, the Springer Nature press office deleted the word “Mozart” from the press release; the authorship of the song could not be clarified &#8211; now there is only talk of a lullaby. It initially remained unclear whether the study would be revised accordingly. According to a spokeswoman, the publisher contacted media that reported on Mozart&#8217;s effects on babies and apologized for the inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The press release lost the word “Mozart,” and the paper has now indeed been revised. A correction, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-023-02834-5">ran on September 29</a>, reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The original online version of this article was revised: the music used for this study is from an album called ‘Bedtime Mozart’ and not necessarily music composed by Mozart. Any references to Mozart music have been corrected accordingly. The original article has been corrected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saminathan-anbalagan/">Saminathan Anbalagan</a>, the corresponding author of the paper, told Feldwisch-Drentrup in August his team used the recording “because it had previously been used for research on ‘Mozart’ effects.” Anbalagan did not respond to a request for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Good news for composers not named Mozart, though: Your music, too, can soothe babies undergoing minor medical procedures.</p>

OUP journals provide several avenues of support including:</p><ul><li><strong>Mentoring and guidance:</strong> Some journals provide mentorship programs or editorial support to help young researchers navigate the publishing process.</li></ul><div><div> <div aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ub-content-toggle-panel-0-a5ce758d-a8a5-4163-b5c8-1d43f3ec3997" tabindex="0"> <h4>Featuring <em>Oxford Open Immunology</em> and <em>Oxford Open Energy</em>:</h4><div> </div></div><div role="region"><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="350" height="228" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/OO-Immunology-Energy-Covers.jpg" /></figure></div><p>Two of our Oxford Open series journals, <em>Oxford Open Immunology</em> and <em>Oxford Open Energy</em> run dedicated ECR boards, which provide a key channel for direct engagement between ECR participants and our high profile academic senior editorial teams. Activities are planned throughout the year and may include assisting with facilitating journal webinars, joining ECR board meetings to discuss journal strategy and direction, suggesting and coordinating special collections or commissioned pieces on highly topical areas of research.</p></div></div></div><ul><li><strong>Open access initiatives:</strong> 120 of the journals we publish are fully open access and the vast majority of the remaining journals offer authors open access options, making research freely available for a global audience to read, share, cite, and reuse. This helps early career researchers, and researchers of all stages in their career, gain visibility of their work and reach a wider readership.</li></ul><div><div> <div aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ub-content-toggle-panel-0-a2b76026-fc14-4f86-a089-8b8a3c855e5c" tabindex="0"> <h4>Featuring our Oxford Open series:</h4><div> </div></div><div role="region"><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="650" height="112" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Oxford-Open-Series-Covers.jpg" /></figure></div><p>The Oxford Open series is underpinned by a set of guiding principles, which include an emphasis on open research, with each journal having been developed in a bespoke way to best serve the needs of its own research community.</p><blockquote><p>Hear more about OUP’s approach to OA published and the Oxford Open series in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://soundcloud.com/oupacademic/open-access-episode-58-the-oxford-comment">The Oxford Comment podcast</a>. </p></blockquote><p>Many of our Oxford Open journals offer article types that are specifically developed for ECRs to start their publication journey, these may take the form of a Rapid Report, Short Communication, or Perspective article, for example. We regularly invite ECRs to submit their work to the journal, often in collaboration with their mentors or supervisors as appropriate.</p></div></div></div><div aria-hidden="true"></div><h3>Mid-career researchers: advancing expertise</h3><p>As researchers progress in their careers, they require journals that can help them deepen their expertise and broaden their impact. OUP journals provide several avenues of support including:</p><ul><li><strong>Cutting-edge research:</strong> OUP journals prioritise publishing high-impact, innovative research, allowing mid-career researchers to stay updated with the latest advancements in their fields.</li></ul><div><div> <div aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ub-content-toggle-panel-0-c8054167-ea51-481a-83fb-d258d2b7e0c7" tabindex="0"> <h4>Featuring <em>Exposome</em>:</h4><div> </div></div><div role="region"><div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="183" height="237" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m_exposome_3_1cover.jpg" /></figure></div><p><em>Exposome</em> is the home of cutting-edge research from the emerging field of exposomics.

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/10/measuring-protocol-sharing/">Measuring protocol sharing: are we on the right track?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Marcel LaFlamme</em></p>



<p>For almost a year, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-science-indicators">Open Science Indicators</a> have offered the ability to measure three Open Science practices: data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting. Now, PLOS and <a href="https://dataseer.ai/">DataSeer</a> are adding a fourth indicator for protocol sharing. As we expand the tool&rsquo;s capabilities, we invite your feedback on the approach we&rsquo;ve taken in this <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">preliminary data release</a>.</p>



<h2>What is a protocol?</h2>



<p>The word <em>protocol </em>means different things in different fields, so first we want to clearly signal what types of research output are in scope for this indicator. In line with the community-developed definition used in <a href="https://osf.io/x85gh/">the PRO-MaP recommendations</a>, we are defining protocol as &ldquo;detailed and/or step-by-step instructions for carrying out a research procedure.&rdquo; Clinical study protocols, review protocols, registered report protocols, and other protocols describing a study that will take place in the future generally do not meet this definition, although we&rsquo;re currently scoping work on a fifth indicator that is likely to include these outputs.</p>



<h2>How we got here</h2>



<p>In 2022, PLOS <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/7jxav">conducted a study</a> of researcher practices and priorities around sharing detailed methods information including protocols. The study found that, while methods sections of research articles are regarded as adequate for evaluating study findings, they are not widely perceived as adequate for reproducing results or reusing a method in a different context. To ensure that methods information is usable for a range of research tasks, study participants reported publicly sharing protocols through channels including peer-reviewed publications, supplementary information, dedicated repositories, and other websites.</p>



<p>With these results in mind, we drafted a set of requirements built on our <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889">OSI measurement framework</a> and consulted on them with stakeholders including tool providers, meta-researchers, and other methods experts. We then worked with DataSeer to operationalize the requirements. Our current approach detects links to or citations of outputs from an allowlist of publications and repositories known to focus on protocols. In keeping with our approach to measuring data and code sharing, we also detect relevant metadata from supplementary information where available. Please consult our <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=42508123">methods documentation</a> for more detail.</p>



<h2>What the data say</h2>



<p>From 2019 through mid-2023, the rate of protocol sharing for research articles published in PLOS journals hovered around 8%. In contrast to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/10/open-science-indicators-q2-2023">trends in other Open Science practices</a> over the same period, adoption of protocol sharing by PLOS authors did not appear to change appreciably &ndash; according to these preliminary results. We assume that not all articles generate protocols, but the rate of protocol generation was not calculated for this release.</p>

<p>Among a comparator set of about 18,000 Open Access research articles from PubMed Central, the rate of protocol sharing did appear to increase from 10% in 2019 to 15% in the first half of 2023. Additional qualitative research may help to explain why these trendlines diverge, whether because of limitations in our data sources or actual differences in author behavior.</p>

<p>Preliminary analysis of the locations of protocols associated with PLOS articles indicates that a clear majority (84%) appear as peer-reviewed publications, with <em>Nature Protocols</em> and the Springer Protocols collection as the most cited sources. Sharing in dedicated repositories like protocols.io and Protocol Exchange became less common over the reporting period, falling from 11% in 2019 to 2% in the first half of 2023, while sharing via supplementary information became more common. The use of repositories is often viewed as a <a href="https://osf.io/x85gh/">best practice</a> for protocol sharing because these protocols can be updated as they evolve over time.</p>



<h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>



<p>Our roadmap for further developing the protocols indicator includes adding detection of protocols on lab websites and other online locations. We plan to look more deeply at citations of published protocols, so that we can understand the extent to which authors are pointing to procedures actually used in their study as opposed to referencing protocols for some other reason. We also want to be able to assess how often researchers share their own protocols versus protocols created by others.</p>



<p>Just as importantly, we&rsquo;d like to hear from you: are there publications or repositories missing from <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=42508123">our allowlist</a>? How should we address the limitations of an allowlist-based approach? And are there other ways of communicating detailed methods information that we should consider? We&rsquo;d be grateful for your input by <strong>November 15</strong>; you can comment below or write to mlaflamme [at] plos.org to share your perspective.</p>

<p>In 2022, Guillaume Cabanac noticed something unusual: a study had attracted more than 100 citations in a short span of less than two months of being published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac, a computer scientist at the University of Toulouse in France, initially <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A172115FC8D0A5F44B31A18B08BB26">flagged the study on PubPeer</a> after it was highlighted by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04895">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, which automatically identifies research papers with certain issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The screener flagged this particular paper &#8212; which has <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2022/3685419/">since been retracted</a> &#8212; for containing so-called <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">tortured phrases</a>, strange twists on established terms that were probably introduced by translation software or humans looking to circumvent plagiarism checkers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Cabanac noticed something weird: The study had been cited 107 times according to the ‘Altmetrics donut,’ an indicator of an article’s potential impact, yet it had been downloaded just 62 times.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128012"></span>



<p>What’s more, according to Google Scholar, this paper had been cited only once. “There was a clear discrepancy between the counts on Google Scholar and the counts on Altmetrics/Dimensions,” Cabanac says. That gap is especially significant since “we know that usually Google Scholar overestimates the number of citations,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a little probing,&nbsp; Cabanac and his sleuthing colleagues figured out where the extra citations were coming from: the metadata files submitted to Crossref, a repository for unique identifiers for scholarly metadata, as the group report in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192">preprint</a> posted to the arXiv server October 4. Google Scholar doesn’t use metadata files submitted to Crossref; instead it text-mines PDF versions of studies, Cabanac says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We believe we found an undocumented way of cheating with citation counts,” Cabanac tells Retraction Watch. “It’s original because it doesn’t require fraudsters to alter the version of record, meaning the PDF or HTML version of the paper.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">&nbsp;The metadata files of the papers in question seem to contain more references than are in the HTML or PDF versions, Cabanac says. According to Cabanac, the references are sneaked in at some point into metadata files that are submitted to Crossref and automatically ingested. Since metadata files can be resubmitted as many times as one likes, updated metadata files can also be submitted anytime after an article is published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These extra undue citations ultimately inflate the Altmetrics score represented by the donut, which depicts how often an article is being cited and mentioned on social media. That’s problematic because these inflated citation scores are ultimately reflected on bibliographic platforms like Dimensions. Citation counts are frequently used as a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1887">way to judge researchers</a> and apportion funding so boosting such indicators could falsely amplify a researcher’s perceived impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the study, the introduced references seem to be coming largely from journals published by Technoscience Academy, an open access publisher run out of Gujarat, India, and a Crossref member. Technoscience Academy did not reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It isn’t clear who is manipulating the metadata files or whether the issue is due to a technical glitch, is unclear. But Cabanac says the phenomenon is a result of lack of gatekeeping. One way of addressing the issue would be by building tools and systems to regularly compare the references within PDFs, HTMLs and metadata files of the whole scholarly literature, he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac says if it becomes clear a publisher’s output includes cooked references, its Crossref membership should be scrutinized. Being the signatory on the agreement with Crossref, “the publisher is responsible for their actions,” Cabanac says. “They can run an audit in their own premises to see who the malevolent person is.”</p>



<p>“It looks really dodgy,” says Ginny Hendricks, director of member and community outreach at Crossref, who notes the case is the first time her organization has heard of sneaked references. “It definitely seems like a side effect of the community’s obsession with citation as a metric [and] a measure of impact or importance, which is unfortunate.”</p>



<p>She adds that Crossref will look into the issue, noting that the organization rarely ever revokes membership for cause. The only member it has excluded for cause in the past is Omics International, Henricks says: “They were causing harm to the whole community.”</p>



<p>Hendricks says Crossref has so far not considered introducing extensive gatekeeping but she encourages third parties to use Crossref’s open data to develop systems to do just that. “We’re not the people that decide scientific legitimacy,” she says.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The study analyzed the content of three journals published by Technoscience Academy, each of which have minted more than 1,000 digital object identifiers at Crossref. It found that around 9% of references included in metadata files of the papers published by these three journals — 5,978 references out of a total of 65,836 — benefitted just two researchers who had co-authored the studies being cited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the researchers in question is J. Nageswara Rao of the Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology in Visakhapatnam, India, who benefitted from 3,103 extra citations, the study found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch contacted Rao for a comment but has yet to hear back. The <a href="https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2023/9767064.pdf">retraction notice</a> for the paper Cabanac found reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted by Hindawi following an investigation undertaken by the publisher [1]. This investigation has uncovered evidence of one or more of the following indicators of systematic manipulation of the publication process:&nbsp;</p>



<p>(1) Discrepancies in scope&nbsp;</p>



<p>(2) Discrepancies in the description of the research reported&nbsp;</p>



<p>(3) Discrepancies between the availability of data and the research described&nbsp;</p>



<p>(4) Inappropriate citations&nbsp;</p>



<p>(5) Incoherent, meaningless and/or irrelevant content included in the article&nbsp;</p>



<p>(6) Peer-review manipulation</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The second author that the study namechecks as benefiting from the sneaked references is <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nBXNb5YAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Bhavesh Kataria</a> of the LDRP Institute of Technology and Research in Gandhinagar, India, who has benefitted from 1,564 extra citations, according to the study. Retraction Watch could not find contact details for Kataria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three journals also profited from the sneaked citations, the study found. The<em> International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology</em> gained an extra 826 citations followed by the <em>International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology </em>and the <em>Turkish Journal of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation</em> with 537 and 428, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to sneaked references, the study also reports on instances of ‘lost references,’ which are references that are in the HTML/PDF but not in Crossref metadata files. “Users of the Crossref metadata (e.g., Dimensions) disregard some references because they are not in their database or because they failed to properly textmine the text of the references provided in the metadata,” Cabanac says. The study found that to be the case for 56% (36,939 out of 65,836) references in HTML versions of papers. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watch-microbial-life-earth">Watch: Recent microbial discoveries are changing our view of life on Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gumdrop with an earring.</p>



<p>That’s what pops to mind when I look at Sebastian Hess’ photos of a kind of plump, violent, single-celled creature he collected from a pond rich in sphagnum moss in southern Germany. The shape-shifting amoebozoan cell, prowling for algal cells to attack, curls its long strand of a flagellum into an earringlike loop. Holding the loop steady, the cell somehow glides. Yet the loop doesn’t flick, lash or wave. “They look basically like tiny flying saucers,” Hess says.</p>





<p>He first collected the creatures, with no species name and a baffling form of locomotion, in 2010 and wondered for years how the locomotion worked. Hess has been seeking and tending such single-celled wonders since he was a teenager with a windowsill microzoo. As a grown-up, now at Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany, he specializes in the microscopic group his zoo featured: the protists.</p>



<p>This big, varied group of single cells are among the closest microbial cousins to multicellular life, and they wrap their genetic material inside a cell nucleus just as animals, plants and fungi do. Schoolroom trees of life for much of the 20th century and sometimes afterward often relegated the protist kingdom to some lower branch beneath the glorious crown of mostly multicellular kingdoms. Biologists think a little differently now, and bigger than mere kingdoms.</p>



<p>Today’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-life-gets-makeover">more modern schemes</a> feature at least two vast hoops of microbial creatures, called the domains of Bacteria and Archaea (<em>SN: 7/29/15</em>). A third hoop, the Eukaryota, sweeps together the protists and the formerly proud treetop kingdoms: the animals, plants and fungi. Another sweep may be imminent, as the whole domain of eukaryotes, including the protists and the people who classify them, appear to be a branch of Archaea.</p>



<p>As for the flying saucers, Hess and colleagues worked off and on for almost 10 years to understand how such a cell moves so strangely. It’s a form of locomotion never found before in a living being, Hess says. This toroidal, or “doughnut,” swimming inspired Hess and colleagues in 2019 to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0478-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put the newfound species in its own new genus</a> — <em>Idionectes</em>, roughly meaning “peculiar swimmer.”</p>



<p>More in a bit on how to swim like a doughnut, but the species, <em>Idionectes vortex</em>, makes a fine example of how high-tech biology plus old-fashioned boots-in-mud exploration are creating a rush of discovery for a charismatic group of tiny lives on Earth. These single-celled organisms are far from boring little dots. Plus, they’re adding some unexpected twigs and branches to the evolutionary tree of life.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">We live on a non-animal planet</h4>



<p>To pick just a few examples of 2023’s new protists, a species named in June has the one-celled equivalent of a rotating head. In this roughly globe-shaped cell discovered in a South American termite’s gut, the top spins steadily around without ripping or self-strangling. Discoverers picked <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeu.12987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a demon-themed name, <em>Daimonympha friedkini</em></a>, inspired by the spinning head of the demonically possessed child in director William Friedkin’s 1973 film <em>The Exorcist</em>.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The recently discovered protist <em>Daimonympha friedkini </em>has the one-celled equivalent of a rotating head.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some other new species belong to the odd-looking but ecologically important coccolithophores. This branch as a whole may do as much as 10 percent of the oceans’ photosynthesis, turning sunlight into stuff other creatures eat. Each coccolithophore cell covers itself in what look like tiny hubcaps. Among the distinctive features of the newly named <em>Calciopappus curvus</em> is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1434461023000457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a pair of thumblike stubs on some of those hubcaps</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers in China named a notably small species in the <em>Euplotes </em>genus, <em>E. mazeii</em>. <em>Euplotes</em> cells grow several sets of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11802-023-5506-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skinny projections called cirri</a> that look like stick-drawing legs. Even with no brain or nervous system, the various kinds of <em>Euplotes</em> can move their legs with enough coordination to walk on an underwater surface. Engineers seeking inspiration for microscale robots have been analyzing such gaits.</p>

<p>Even long-known protists have allure as a form of micro­wildlife. Like big cats and polar bears, many of these charismatic microfauna deserve their own nature documentaries. Hess has helped film one of his longtime favorite protists, a kind of <em>Lacrymaria</em>. This mildly pretty teardrop-shaped cell chases prey by shooting out a cartoonishly long swan neck that can stretch more than seven times the organism’s original body length. The neck, with a headlike bump at the end, swerves this way and that lithe as a snake, until a sudden pounce finally snags dinner.</p>





<p>“Stunning” is Hess’ word for protists. “They really behave like entire organisms. But they are just cells.”</p>



<p>Or consider five new species of tiny, voracious cells nicknamed nibblerids. Only about 3 micrometers across in their sickle-shaped hungry form, these protists bite (sort of) their typically larger victims by closing down on them with a special body groove armored with hardened toothlike bits called denticles.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This teardrop-shaped single cell, a kind of <em>Lacrymaria</em>, hunts by shooting out a long necklike projection. The neck can follow fleeing prey until the enlarged end gets a grip.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The nibblerids and their closest known relatives, called nebulids, represent such a distinct and ancient lineage that they deserve their own big branch on the eukaryote family tree, evolutionary biologist Patrick Keeling of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and colleagues reported last year. Keeling speaks passionately about the importance of predators as more than nature-watching fun. “If you took all the lions and cheetahs and killed them all,” he says, “the whole ecosystem would go wacky.” That’s likely the case with protists, too.</p>



<p>Today’s protists are sorted into supergroups, which are branches bigger than the classic eukaryote kingdoms and give a broad and deep view of evolution. The Amorphea supergroup, for example, spans all animals and fungi plus some one-celled relatives including many amoebas. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05511-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new supergroup named for the nibblerids and nebulids, Provora</a>, alludes to “devouring voracious protists,” Keeling and his colleagues wrote.</p>



<p><em>Idionectes</em> too, for all its serene UFO-like travel, is a fierce predator. When it finds algae to feed on, the gliding spaceship becomes an attack amoeba. It dissolves a hole through the algal cell wall but doesn’t feed tiger-style, flesh-ripping from outside the kill. Instead, <em>Idionectes</em> slides through the hole in the wall, decanting itself into the doomed prey cell. Then this hunter devours its prey from the inside.</p>



<p>Watching protists could be terrifying, if they were bigger. Or if humans were smaller.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The microbial environment is totally different</h4>



<p>“We spend so much time trying to imagine alien worlds,” says Keeling. “There’s one right under our noses, more weird than anything we can think of.”</p>



<p>He’s not being theatrical. Consider the way specks of protist bodies experience water, for example. It’s radically different from the way giant lumbering humans and other macroscopic swimmers do. Lone cells are so tiny, the properties of plain water push them down evolutionary paths barely recognizable to us.</p>



<p>Dive into a swimming pool and, “if you’re not kicking, you still go forwards for quite a while until you stop, right?” Keeling says. A single cell, though, is so small that even the viscosity of water means the tiny <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microswimmers-make-splash">swimmer barely glides at all</a> (<em>SN: 6/19/09</em>). If it stops swimming, it just … stops. “It’s more like you’re in corn syrup,” Keeling says.</p>



<p>Besides slowing locomotion to a creep, the Syrup World no longer allows for certain swimming strokes. A scallop normally jets around by opening its shell slowly and closing it fast. But if magically miniaturized, the scallop would be stuck in place, flapping, physicists have predicted. It would make progress by shutting its shell but unmake that progress opening it again.</p>



<p>On the upside, though, motions that are useless for full-size people or scallops could propel a tiny swimmer. In 1952, physicist Geoffrey Ingram Taylor theorized that a microbial swimmer shaped like a doughnut <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1951.0218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could move itself</a> with a sort of inward rotation. (The idea gets credited to a charming talk in 1976 by U.S.&nbsp;Nobel laureate and physicist Edward Mills Purcell, but Taylor came before Purcell.)</p>



<p>That rotation is basically how the loop <em>Idionectes</em> cell turned out to swim, Hess and colleagues announced nearly 70 years after Taylor’s suggestion. The cell’s long, stringy flagellum curls into the scrawniest, skinniest thing ever likely to be described as a doughnut. It’s far more hole than dough, but it still approximates Taylor’s notion.</p>



<p>In a diagram developed by Taylor, the sides of a doughnut rise through the hole, over the rim and wrap around the other side for another slide into the middle. At first, Hess could tell that his gumdrop cell clearly spun, but looking at the flagellum’s skimpy doughnut-shape with plain microscopy, “you cannot see any movement,” he says. But when he and colleagues made underwater blizzards of latex microparticles in syrupy fluid (a technique that gave the researchers a breakthrough eight years into their efforts), Hess saw telltale particle movements showing the flagellum was rotating.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How one protist spins and swims</h4>



<p>The protist <em>Idionectes vortex</em> was discovered in 2010, but only recently did scientists show that it moves via toroidal swimming. Its flagellum loops like a doughnut. The flagellum and the dome-shaped part both rotate (purple arrows).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How protists are discovered</h4>



<p>Vittorio Boscaro, in Keeling’s lab at the University of British Columbia, has another rotation mystery. “We have no idea why they’re doing this,” he says. We’re on a video call, and he’s sharing his screen to show the new protist species with a rotating head, <em>D. friedkini</em>. In the ghostly grays of light microscopy video, a chunky cell swims as its top, like a large knobby polar ice cap, steadily rotates. It’s mesmerizing.</p>



<p>The 2023 paper announcing the discovery of <em>D. friedkini </em>calls rotating wheel structures “famously rare” in biology. Bacteria can freely spin their flagella without twisting themselves into pieces, but cells with more built-in structures rarely manage.</p>



<p>Still, this wasn’t the first spin-top among complex cells. Analyzing genetic material, researchers worked out a probable family tree of near and far relatives. Oddly, this beast doesn’t seem that closely related to another species with a rotating head informally called rubberneckia, which researchers have sporadically written about since 1974. To study protists is to live in weirdness.</p>



<p>That the new species came from a termite gut was no big deal, Boscaro gently tells me, because protistologists have been gutting termites in search of new species of rotating protists (rubberneckia and <em>D. friedkini</em> both belong to a group called Parabasalia) for more than a century.</p>



<p>Protists are everywhere. Kiran More, then an undergraduate at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, picked up a bunch when he added a little bit of species prospecting to a family trip in 2016.</p>



<p>As summer waned before More’s senior year, his family went driving through the eastern countryside of Nova Scotia. They stopped at a village on Cape Breton Island to admire a replica of the beloved 1920s schooner pictured on the Canadian dime, and More scooped up some shore sand. It took only a matter of minutes; he had packed a set of sampling tubes just in case. “I just carried it from hotel room to hotel room and stuck it in the minifridge, when there was a minifridge,” he says.</p>



<p>When he returned to school, the sludge became part of his undergraduate project looking for unknown species of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-microbes-sucked-some-ancient-life-dry">marine amoebas called vampyrellids</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/15</em>). The name may conjure nightmares, but <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jeu.12698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even two of More’s ferocious finds</a> look less jaw-and-claw and more bed-and-breakfast. They resemble a fried egg.</p>

MORE <em>ET AL</em>/<em>J. OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY</em> 2018</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Though vampyrellid body plans vary, in this case, the egg’s “white” is the structure that breaks through the outer covering of prey to harvest the nutritious insides. Watching a small algal cell caught by the vampyrellid reveals the predator pressing against the algal cell until the victim stops moving, draining the dying cell’s innards in five to 10 minutes.</p>



<p>More’s single sample of collected sand ended up providing at least seven visibly different kinds of vampyrellid amoebas. <em>Placopus melkoniani</em> and <em>P. pusillus</em>, fried-egg vampyrellids now named as new species, hunt by rolling forward. Their outer membranes move “like a conveyor belt,” More says, or the treads on a tank. “You can see all their cell contents inside also rotating as the outer membrane rotates, which is almost beautiful,” he says.</p>



<p>In 2021, that same vacation sample delivered a third new species. More, by then a graduate student in systematics and evolution at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and colleagues named that new species <em>Sericomyxa perlucida</em>, meaning “transparent silken slime.” It looks like a road-killed badminton shuttlecock but with exquisitely delicate tufts. And it was <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeu.12864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not just a new species in a new genus</a> but also represented a whole new family.</p>



<p>Any ornithologist or mammalogist would have been thrilled with the results. But in the giddy frontier of protist discovery, “I was disappointed,” More says. “I was so determined that I was going to find an environmental lineage where no one had seen anything before.”</p>



<p>When Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, the 18th century founder of Western science’s biological naming system, studied single-celled organisms, he was limited to looking. He named relatively few single-celled organisms and put most in a genus he eventually called <em>Chaos</em>. Today’s biologists have many more high-tech tools at their disposal, but the evolution of life on Earth still looks chaotic. One cell of a type of protist called a cryptomonad has seven separate sets of genes, according to research reported this year. Three of the extra sets come from little organs descended from long-ago free-living cells, two from symbiotic bacteria that had apparently become essential and another from a virus hitchhiking in one of the bacteria.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Microbes dominate Earth</h4>



<p>“We’re an aberration,” says Maureen O’Malley, a philosopher of microbiology at the University of Sydney, as one multicellular earthling talking to another. In the modern view of life, single-celled microbes — protists among them — dominate the planet. Big multicellular life-forms now look like the rare, outlier freaks. A 2018 comparison estimates that Earth’s protists account for twice the gigatons of carbon as all the animals put together. Add in other microbes, and together they hold 40 times the biomass.</p>

<p>Earth was entirely a microbe’s world for some 2.5 billion years or more, the majority of life’s history, O’Malley points out. We big multicellulars evolved on the backs of microbe innovations. Just a few examples: The oxygenated atmosphere came from cyanobacteria photosynthesizing 2.7 billion years ago. Even today an estimated half of the oxygen we breathe comes from microbial sources, not from plants. And plants’ ability to generate oxygen came from engulfing the microbial technology we know as chloroplasts.</p>



<p>Termites “eat” wood thanks to the protists packed into their guts. Tomato plants grow better with more of the predatory protists in the soil around their roots. Bobtail squid get the glow in their light organs from engulfed bacteria. Tsetse flies can’t sustain milk-feeding for their bizarre live-birthed young without specialized live-in bacteria to provide B vitamins. The list goes on and on for influential microbes. They shaped the world and keep us alive in it.</p>



<p>O’Malley sums up microbes as “the dominant life-forms not only in today’s world, but also in all past eras of the living Earth.” For bird watchers, wildflower lovers and nature enthusiasts of all stripes, truly seeing these invisibly small creatures for the first time can be like realizing dark matter exists. And not only that it exists, but that it makes up so much more of the universe than the supposed ordinary stuff.</p>



<p>New discoveries of protists and other microbial species and their ways of living are creating a very different view and appreciation for life in all its forms. With a few quirky exceptions — including us — to be an earthling is to be microscopic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/10/06/interesting-papers-on-behavioral-timescale-synaptic-plasticity-theory/">Interesting papers on behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (theory)</a></h4>

              
                <p>Behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) is a form of single-shot learning observed in hippocampal place cells in mice (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4062">Bittner et al., 2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan3846">2017</a>). This finding is both interesting and inspiring for computational neuroscience for several reasons. In the first place, synaptic plasticity is the basis for learning, and any neuronal theory on the organizing principles of the brain must consider synaptic plasticity. In addition, previous findings on plasticity were usually based on artificial stimulation protocols in slices (LTP, LTD, STDP), often requiring unphysiological stimulation intensities, careful selection of stimulation protocols and many repetitions, while BTSP is a single-shot learning paradigm. Here are a some quite recent interesting theory papers on BTSP, complementing a previous blog post about <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/18/interesting-papers-on-behavioral-timescale-synaptic-plasticity-experiments/">experimental studies</a> on BTSP:</p>



<p><strong>Nonlinear slow-timescale mechanisms in synaptic plasticity</strong></p>



<p>This review by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07801">O’Donnell (2023)</a> nicely covers both experimental results and modeling work about the potential mechanisms of synaptic plasticity on a slow timescale. O&#8217;Donnell attempts to reconcile seeming discrepancies between experimental results on LTP from a theory perspective, and he stresses the importance of non-linearities to induce plasticity specifically during bursts but not regular spiking.  A quick and interesting read!</p>



<p>One aspect I found particularly interesting is when he points out the relevance of long timescales and non-linear processes for classic slice LTP/LTD or STDP protocols (pages 2-3 of the PDF). Typically, one forgets about the long timescale and only focuses e.g. on the millisecond timing difference for the STDP protocol.</p>



<p><strong>How BTSP affects subthreshold representations of place</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73046">Milstein et al. (2021)</a> perform some really nice experiments and analyses to show that BTSP does not only induce new place fields but can alter existing synaptic weights in both ways, potentiation and depression.</p>



<p>If you read the abstract of the Milstein et al. study and have no idea what this is about: worry not, the rest of the paper is much easier to digest and actually super interesting. After reading the abstract myself, I was rather confused. One of the problems is that the &#8220;bidirectional plasticity&#8221; mentioned in the title can be misread as plasticity among bidirectionally connected cell pairs, while here the &#8220;bidirectional&#8221; only refers to &#8220;depression&#8221; (down-direction) and &#8220;potentiation&#8221; (up-direction) of synpases.</p>



<p>Two things I like in particular about this paper: <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73046#fig3">Fig. 3L</a>, which summarizes the main finding in a very nice visualization. And the experiments reported in <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73046#fig4">Fig. 4A-K</a>, where the authors try to disentangle the contributions of cellular depolarizations vs. initial synaptic weights for plasticity &#8211; a beautiful perturbation experiment.</p>



<p>P.S. This is not exactly a very &#8220;recent&#8221; paper, but I found it useful as context to better understand the subsequent paper by Moldwin et al. (2023).</p>



<p><strong>A calcium level-based, general framework for plasticity</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.13.548837">Moldwin et al. (2023)</a> describe a framework for synaptic plasticity focused on calcium levels. It is based on the well-established finding that (a) synaptic depression occurs for low calcium levels and (b) synaptic potentiation occurs for high calcium levels, while (c) synapses remain approximately stable for the lowest (baseline) calcium levels. With their modeling work, the authors extend on existing models and make them more flexible and more easily parameter-adjustable.</p>



<p>In general, I think it is interesting to generate such a more general and flexible framework. At some points, however, I had the feeling that adding more model features to fit all use cases does not necessarily make the model better (more powerful yes, but not always more useful). For example, the authors write that some experimental edge cases were “incorporated into [their model] by adding additional thresholds into the step function”. Adding parameters to account for special cases does not seem the most elegant way if this additional complexity does not make any further predictions about model behavior. Despite these concerns, however, I believe that their general model based on calcium as a single actor is interesting, and their attempt to apply the model to diverse plasticity protocols is useful. It also helps to understand which assumptions are necessary to make the calcium-based plasticity model work for a particular experiment.</p>



<p>In the title, the authors claim that this framework could also be used to describe BTSP. Their take on BTSP is similar to the one described by <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73046">Milstein et al. (2021)</a> (see above).  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.13.548837">Moldwin et al. (2023)</a> assume that there is a summation of synaptic calcium induced by pre-synaptic stimulation and calcium induced by the plateau potential. The summed calcium signal would then induce LTP or LTD at this synapse. The main difference compared to <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73046">Milstein et al. (2021)</a> is therefore the idea that both slow signals, the eligibility trace and the instructive signal, are encoded in the local calcium concentration; apart from that, the mathematical shape of their model seems to be pretty similar compared to <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73046">Milstein et al. (2021)</a> as far as I can judge.</p>



<p>The main problem of this application to BTSP is the decay time of calcium at synaptic locations. The authors make the following assumption: “The synaptic calcium decayed with a time constant of ~2 seconds”. This seems really unrealistic &#8211; calcium levels after synaptic activation typically decay faster by an order of magnitude. Most experimentalists would assume that this long timescale is taken care of by a slow turnover of more stable mediators like CaMKII (for potentiation) or Calcineurin (for depression); see also the review by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07801">O&#8217;Donnell (2023)</a>. Overall, I have the impression that this framework is a nice and generalizable model for LTP, LTD and STPD, but maybe less so for BTSP. It is unclear to me why they advertise their model to cover BTSP so prominently in the title – this aspect may not represent the best part of their work.</p>



<p><strong>A review on normative models on synaptic plasticity</strong></p>



<p>In their review paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.04988">Bredenberg and Savin (2023)</a> discuss the criteria that should be used to judge normative models on synaptic plasticity. What do they mean with “normative models”? The authors nicely describe a very clear distinction between phenomenological and mechanistic models on the one side, which use fitting or equations to describe experimental observations; and normative models on the other side, which try to understand the importance of the modeled process for the organism. These normative models therefore ask: how should synaptic plasticity be like in order to serve the organism well? That’s an interesting perspective, not driven bottom-up by experimental observations but top-down from “desiderata”, as the title of this review indicates.</p>



<p>The review is interesting and establishes &#8211; not surprisingly given its focus on the practical usefulness of plasticity models &#8211; many connections to deep learning-based approaches. I was, however, slightly disappointed by the apparent lack of discussion of behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). For example, they describe how to choose an objective function for synaptic plasticity to improve performance and how to linearize it for small weight changes, which I found a very interesting point of view. It would be instructive to investigate BTSP and single-shot learning in such a model. In particular, it seems to me that BTSP &#8211; due to its single-shot learning behavior &#8211; cannot be a learning rule based on small and linear weight changes. It would therefore be interesting to describe BTSP in a normative model and, for example, to investigate how a loss function can be used to derive or describe BTSP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/non-western-art-design-alternate-math">Non-Western art and design can reveal alternate ways of thinking about math</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Help me and let me help you.” Or in Ghana’s Twi language: “Boa me na me mmoa wo.”</p>



<p>The aphorism signifies cooperation and interdependence. And like many Twi expressions, it can be communicated with a symbol, or adinkra. This adinkra has two triangular halves that are almost, but not quite, symmetrical. One triangle has a circle sitting atop it and is missing a square from its interior, while the other triangle has a square attached to it and is missing a circle. Each half completes the other.</p>





<p>The symbol intrigues ethno-computing expert Ron Eglash. “There is no math concept in Europe for ‘complete me,’” says Eglash, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>



<p>Contemporary math has mostly Western origins, so ideas from non-Western cultures are often missing from the field, say Eglash and others who study ethno-mathematics, or the relationship between math and culture.</p>



<p>“It is useful to think of mathematics as a language,” says physicist Richard Taylor of the University of Oregon in Eugene. Some words and concepts will overlap across cultures but look different, while others will remain unique.</p>



<p>Efforts to identify those convergent and divergent math concepts — and add them to school curricula — can make math more culturally relevant, researchers say. Such research can also expand mathematical knowledge.</p>



<p>One way to detect math languages is through a given culture’s art, architecture and design. Eglash and his wife, graphic designer Audrey Bennett, have spent years teasing out the math hidden in these artefacts. That work has resulted in math models for cornrows, Native American bead work, henna designs, adinkras and others.</p>

The not-quite-symmetric adinkra “Boa me na me mmoa wo” (left) conveys cooperation and interdependence, where trades are mutually beneficial though unequal. The Atoma Ntosa, or linked hearts, adinkra (right) uses rotational symmetry to communicate that in any relationship, all partners should play their part.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131843">adinkra.org</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Over time, those models have transformed into <a href="https://csdt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free online coding tools</a>. Users can learn about cultural concepts and math principles and then use that knowledge to generate their own designs, says Bennett, also of the University of Michigan.</p>



<p>The tools can increase math scores among students <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-technology-math-race-ethnicity-gender-diversity-gap">not traditionally represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields</a>, such as minority students in the United States or students in the Global South, Eglash’s research suggests (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>). One study for example, showed that the adinkra model can help middle school students in Ghana understand logarithmic spirals.</p>



<p>Unlike linear spirals, where the space between each spiral revolution stays the same, log spirals grow as they extend outward. Snail shells follow this pattern. Many adinkra curves also derive from nature, such as those depicting a ram’s horns, chicken’s foot, bird’s neck and even a human fist. Ghanian artisans alter the tightness or looseness of a spiral to change the look of their adinkra designs. Students using the adinkra computing software can likewise change coil “strength” in their own designs.</p>



<p>In Eglash’s Ghana study, nine students in one class used the adinkra model to learn about log spirals while 10 students in another class learned the concept through conventional models. On a test of the material, the adinkra students <a href="https://hipatiapress.com/hpjournals/index.php/remie/article/view/1399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scored higher</a>, with an average test score of 45 percent, than the other students, who scored 14 percent on average, Eglash and colleagues reported in 2015 in the <em>Multidisciplinary Journal of Education Research.</em></p>





<p>The experiment needs scaling up, but the team’s casual observations were striking. Students in the control group typically left immediately once class ended, while students in the adinkra group often stayed late to work on their computational designs.</p>



<p>Mavis Okyere, a math education researcher at the Catholic University of Ghana in Sunyani, has observed a similar phenomenon among middle and high school students in the Kumasi metro area who were learning about proportion, symmetry and other basic math concepts.</p>



<p>For instance, Ghanian students typically learn about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forms-symmetry">rotational symmetry</a> — the idea that a shape can maintain its form as it spins in space — by rotating triangles or squares (<em>SN: 4/12/07</em>). Okyere developed a curriculum that taught the concept through adinkras, such as <em>Akoma Ntoasa, </em>or “joining of the hearts.” This adinkra, a square connected to semicircles via four lines, can rotate 90 degrees in any direction and look the same.</p>



<p>Teaching math with adinkras proved immensely popular. The class was optional to join and initially only a handful of students showed up, Okyere says. “By the end of the fourth lesson, the class was full.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Math education should give students both a window to a new world and a mirror reflecting their own world, says Rochelle Guttiérez, a mathematics education researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who was not involved in any of the research. “Too many times in math classrooms, people just look out and see lots of windows. They never get mirrors.” These tools provide that mirror, she says.</p>



<p>Besides adding cultural relevance to established concepts, learning new math languages has the potential to unearth previously unidentified patterns. That’s the case for the “complete me” adinkra. Eglash refers to this almost symmetry as “mutuality.”</p>



<p>Such discoveries can help students think through the math process from the ground up. Eglash’s thoughts on mutuality inspired seven U.S. geometry professors to develop a lesson around helping students define the concept. Students <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2021/05/06/best-laid-co-plans-for-a-lesson-on-creating-a-mathematical-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively debated key theoretical questions</a>, the professors wrote in a 2021 blog post for the American Mathematical Society. One student wondered if an exchange could be considered mutual if the corresponding shapes were of unequal size.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to the student, that query captured the adinkra’s true significance, which Okyere, a native Twi speaker, describes as such: “We need each other, and we help each other in various ways even though … they are not the same. But I need you, and you also need me.”</p>



<p>Finding these sorts of links between math and cultural beliefs is at the root of ethno-mathematics, Eglash says. “There is a relationship between the geometric meaning and the social meaning.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vela-exploded-star-highest-energy-pulsar">Vela’s exploded star is the highest-energy pulsar ever seen</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sweeping beams of cosmic lighthouses called pulsars are much more energetic than previously thought, calling into question the bulbs that power them.</p>



<p>A new analysis, from the High Energy Stereoscopic System array in Namibia, reveals a pulsar that radiates at 20 trillion electron volts —&nbsp;making it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02052-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most energetic pulsar ever seen</a>. The finding, described October 5 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>, is challenging scientists’ understanding of how pulsars can emit such extreme radiation.</p>



<p>The observation is “spectacular,” says Hayk Hakobyan, an astrophysicist at Columbia University who was not part of the study. “This is basically a stress test for our theories.”</p>





<p>Pulsars are the dense remnants of exploded stars, emitting beams of light as they twirl up to hundreds of times a second. Pulsars <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-pulsars-burst-scene">were first discovered in the late 1960s</a>, from a throb of radio waves so consistent that some suggested it was an alien broadcast (<em>SN: 3/8/18</em>).</p>



<p>As a pulsar rotates, its massive magnetic field rips charged particles from the surface, ejecting them along magnetic field lines and spitting radiation out the pulsar’s poles. Over the decades, scientists have found pulsars that beam radiation at higher energies, topping off at about a trillion electron volts, as observed in the <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2016/01/aa26853-15/aa26853-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crab pulsar in 2016</a>.</p>



<p>In the new study, scientists analyzed 80 hours of data from the Namibian array, which looks for a wake of light given off when high-energy light emitted elsewhere in the universe crashes into molecules in Earth’s atmosphere. The researchers identified 78 super-energetic particles of light that they traced to a pulsar about 1,000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Vela. That light, the team determined, had at least 20 times higher energy than the Crab pulsar observation.</p>



<p>The team first spotted hints of the mighty radiation a few years ago and struggled to interpret the data. “This discovery was so unexpected …&nbsp;that it somehow was difficult to understand,” says Arache Djannati-Ataï, an astrophysicist at CNRS in Paris, who led the analysis.</p>



<p>To reach such high energies, the light is probably boosted by collisions with other speedy, energetic particles such as electrons. But how it becomes so energetic is still up for debate.</p>



<p>The new finding lends support to the growing idea that, thousands of kilometers from a pulsar’s surface, its magnetic field lines can collide and snap, launching particles to extreme speeds in a process called magnetic reconnection. But the observed radiation is pushing the limit of how much energy the reconnection process can release, and scientists will have to scramble for new explanations if higher-energy pulsar radiation keeps turning up.</p>



<p>The possibility of extreme pulsar radiation had been looming over theorists, Hakobyan says. “But now, it’s definite. So now, you have to go do something about it.”</p>

<p>Last week, an environmental journal published a paper on the use of renewable energy in cleaning up contaminated land. To read it, you would have to pay 40 euros. But you still wouldn’t know for sure who wrote it.</p>



<p>Ostensibly authored by researchers in China, &#8220;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-29672-6">Revitalizing our earth: unleashing the power of green energy in soil remediation for a sustainable future</a>&#8221; includes the extraneous phrase &#8220;Regenerate response&#8221; at the end of a methods section. For those unfamiliar, &#8220;Regenerate response&#8221; is a button in OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> that prompts the chatbot to rework an unsatisfactory answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did the authors copy-paste the output of ChatGPT and include the button&#8217;s label by mistake?&#8221; wondered <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a>, a professor of computer science at the University of Toulouse, in France, in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83DCF77815DC61C4ED6DCD88847EC4#1">a comment on PubPeer</a>.</p>



<p>And, he added, &#8220;How come this meaningless wording survived proofreading by the coauthors, editors, referees, copy editors, and typesetters?&#8221;</p>



<span id="more-128009"></span>



<p>The case is the latest example of a growing trend of sloppy, undeclared use of ChatGPT in research. So far, Cabanac, whose work was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02477-w">covered in <em>Nature</em></a> last month, has posted <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Regenerate+Response%22+AND+ChatGPT">more than 30 papers</a> on PubPeer that contain those two telltale, free-floating words. And that&#8217;s not including articles that appear in predatory journals, the scientific sleuth told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Computer software has been used for decades to support the authors,&#8221; Cabanac told us. &#8220;Just think about Grammarly or DeepL for people like me. I&#8217;m not a native English speaker, so I go to WordReference, I go sometimes to DeepL. But what I do, I look at the result and I correct the mistakes.&#8221;</p>



<p>ChatGPT and other tools relying on AI systems known as large language models <a href="https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-hallucination-chatbots-chatgpt-falsehoods-ac4672c5b06e6f91050aa46ee731bcf4">tend to make things up</a>. As we reported earlier this year, that freelancing can <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/01/withdrawn-ai-written-preprint-on-millipedes-resurfaces-causing-alarm/">be a problem for researchers</a> looking for help to find references.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sometimes it elaborates things that were not in the head of the researchers,&#8221; Cabanac said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s the tipping point to me. When people use the system to generate something that they hadn&#8217;t in mind, like fabricating data, generating some text with references to works they didn&#8217;t even read, this is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to some publishers,&nbsp; chatbots do have legitimate uses when writing papers. The key is to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00191-1">let readers know what was done</a>.</p>



<p>The corresponding author on the environmental paper, Kangyan Li of <a href="https://www.inogenalliance.com/associate/esd-china">ESD China Ltd</a>., did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did a contact person listed on his company&#8217;s website.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes the journal <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em> in which the article appeared, said the publisher was &#8220;carefully investigating the issue in line with COPE best practice&#8221; but could not share further details at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">How the authors, let alone the journal, could have missed the strange phrase is unclear. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s not about the authors, maybe it involves a paper mill,&#8221; Cabanac said, referring to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/">dodgy organizations selling author slots</a> on scientific papers that may contain fabricated data.</p>



<p>He added that he and his frequent collaborator <a href="https://thebulletin.org/biography/alexander-magazinov/">Alexander Magazinov</a>, another sleuth, have <a href="https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1671646001340227585?s=20">found dozens of suspicious papers</a> in <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>. They notified the journal’s editor-in-chief, Philippe Garrigues, a CNRS researcher based in Bordeaux, France, of the problems last year. </p>



<p>In an email seen by Retraction Watch, Garrigues told Cabanac that he had already taken action and that “this is not over.” Garrigues added (translated from the French):&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Believe me, I am well aware of all the problems that can arise in the world of scientific publishing and new ones arise every day. I could write entire books about my experience as an editor of several journals and the cases I encountered. Vigilance and attention must be the rule at all times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Garrigues did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">&#8220;Regenerate response&#8221; is not the only sign of undeclared chatbot involvement Cabanac has seen. An even more egregious example is the phrase &#8220;<a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22As+an+AI+language+model%2C+I%22">As an AI language model, I</a> …,&#8221; which he has found in nine papers until now.</p>



<p>Cabanac worries about how such flagrant sloppiness, arguably the tip of the iceberg, can slip past editorial staff and peer reviewers alike.</p>



<p>&#8220;These are supposed to be the gatekeepers of science – the editors, the reviewers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a computer scientist. I&#8217;m not in the business of these journals. Still, I get the red flag, &#8216;Regenerate response.&#8217; That&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;</p>

                <p>In a new <em>PLOS ONE</em> study researchers found that participants tended to judge faces appearing against backgrounds featuring houseplants or bookcases as more trustworthy and competent than faces with a living space or a novelty image behind them.

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Prior research has demonstrated that first impressions can make a real difference in people&rsquo;s lives; for example, they can influence criminal sentencing decisions or choices of romantic partners. In recent years, a major increase in video conferencing has resulted in many first impressions of others now occurring virtually. Popular video conferencing platforms let users customize their background image. However, few studies have explored how background choice might influence first impressions.</p>

<p><strong>Study Design and Findings</strong></p>



<p>Researchers Paddy Ross, Abi Cook, and Meg Thompson at Durham University, UK asked 167 adults to view still images that appeared to have been captured during a videoconference. Each image showed the face of a man or woman, either smiling or with a neutral expression, against a background featuring a living space, a blurred living space, houseplants, a bookcase, a blank wall, or a novelty image of a walrus on an iceberg. Participants reported how competent and trustworthy they perceived each face to be </p>



<p>Statistical analysis showed that participants rated faces against the houseplant and bookcase backgrounds as being more trustworthy and competent than faces with other backgrounds. Faces against a living space or novelty image were rated as the least competent or trustworthy.</p>



<p>Participants tended to perceive happy faces as more trustworthy and competent than neutral faces. They also perceived female faces as more trustworthy and competent overall. However, among female faces, those with the living-space background were perceived as no less trustworthy than those with houseplants or a bookcase, suggesting that the lower trustworthiness associated with the living-space background were primarily driven by male faces.</p>



<p><strong>Further Insights</strong></p>



<p>More research is needed to confirm these findings and examine whether they apply across cultural contexts&mdash;for instance, the image database used in the study primarily featured white individuals. Nonetheless, they suggest that videoconference users concerned with making a good impression, especially men, might smile and choose a background with houseplants or a bookcase.</p>



<p>The authors add: &ldquo;This research shows how our Zoom backgrounds can affect the first impressions we make. If you want to come across as trustworthy and competent there are some backgrounds you should use and some you should definitely avoid.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-footprints-new-mexico-ancient-dating">Human footprints in New Mexico really may be surprisingly ancient, new dating shows</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human footprints in White Sands National Park in New Mexico sparked controversy two years ago when scientists found the prints to be surprisingly old, dating to about 22,000 years ago. Now, two other ways of dating the fossilized tracks <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh5007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converge at similar ages as the first estimate</a>, potentially resolving the dispute, researchers report in the Oct. 6 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The finding adds to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/texas-toolmakers-add-debate-over-who-first-americans-were">mounting evidence</a> that humans arrived in North America thousands of years earlier than previously thought (<em>SN: 7/11/18</em>).</p>





<p>“The answer to how old the footprints really are is critical,” says archaeologist Loren Davis of Oregon State University in Corvallis, who wasn’t involved with the new study. “We need to be able to understand how early we should be looking for archaeological evidence in the Americas.”</p>



<p>In 2021, researchers described <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg7586" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 60 footprints</a> embedded in what was once mud alongside an ancient lake in what’s now New Mexico. Radiocarbon dating of an aquatic plant’s seeds in and around the footprints — which span several rock layers — suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">people roamed there for two millennia between roughly 23,000 and 21,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/21</em>). The result added to other evidence pushing back on a long-held theory that the first humans in North America came from Siberia via a land bridge sometime around 16,000 to 14,000 years ago.</p>



<p>But some scientists noted that the aquatic plants used to date the footprints could have absorbed ancient carbon in groundwater, a well-known phenomenon. “There’s a potential then for the plant to give exaggerated perspectives on its age,” says Davis, who cowrote a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm4678" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critique</a> of the 2021 paper.</p>



<p>The criticism wasn’t surprising, says geologist Jeff Pigati of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center in Denver. “We knew from the very beginning that we were going to have to independently evaluate the ages with different dating techniques.”</p>



<p>To add to their past work, Pigati and colleagues radiocarbon-dated pollen stuck in the same layers as some of the footprints. The pollen came from land plants, primarily pine, spruce and fir trees, avoiding the groundwater carbon issue. The researchers also collected quartz grains above the lowest footprints and used a dating method that estimates how long the quartz had been buried.</p>



<p>The pollen yielded an age range of roughly 23,400 to 22,600 years old, and the quartz gave an age minimum of about 21,500 years old. Both results echo the previous age estimate.</p>



<p>“This triumvirate is really, really robust and difficult to argue against because they’re just fundamentally different approaches for dating,” Pigati says.</p>

<p>Still, Davis wants the researchers to find quartz ages from more rock layers with footprints. If completed, he says, “we would very likely have a resolution.”</p>



<p>But the authors say many of the other layers are too thin for sampling. Collecting a sediment sample there would mix multiple layers of different silts, sands and clays, which would complicate results.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Despite possible errors in the individual dating methods, “the data overall from the [new] study strongly indicate human presence in the Americas” around 22,000 years ago, Bente Philippsen, a physicist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, wrote in a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk3075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentary</a> in the same issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>One thing is certain: There’s still plenty to uncover about the footprints, says coauthor Kathleen Springer, a geologist also at USGS’s Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center.</p>



<p>“We are learning more every time we go out there,” she says. “This paper is literally the latest chapter in the White Sands story.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dormant-hiv-human-body-immune-system">‘Dormant’ HIV has ongoing skirmishes with the body’s immune system</a></h4>

              
                <p>For two decades, the dominant idea in HIV research has been that antiretroviral therapy effectively wipes out active viruses that cause devastating infections but leaves behind a reservoir of infected cells seemingly invisible to the immune system — until treatment is stopped. Then the virus comes roaring back.</p>



<p>Now two new studies reveal that the virus continues to put the immune system through a workout. Some infected cells <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(23)00331-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312823003311%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">churn out bits of viral RNA and protein</a> that <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(23)00337-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312823003372%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elicit an immune response</a>, researchers report in the Sept. 13 <em>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</em>.</p>





<p>While not infectious, those damaged viral particles appear to weaken the immune system. The discovery provides a possible explanation for what allows the virus to reemerge with such vigor when people stop taking antiretroviral drugs.</p>



<p>The two new papers “cement — or should cement — that paradigm shift,” says immunologist R. Brad Jones of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, who coauthored an <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(23)00338-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312823003384%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accompanying perspective</a> in the same journal. Notes Steven Deeks, an HIV expert at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine: “No one actively questioned the presence of an active reservoir, but here [the researchers] find evidence that it might in fact matter.”</p>



<p>The studies are sobering news in the larger effort to cure HIV because the results show that the immune system is seeing but failing to successfully respond to the viral proteins, even when the virus’s replication is stopped with medication. It makes “our job much harder,” says immunologist Lydie Trautmann of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine in Bethesda, Md. But it also offers a glimmer of hope: The new findings suggest a path toward figuring out how to make the immune response to HIV more effective, she says.</p>



<p>Both studies took blood cells from people on HIV antiretroviral therapy and looked for evidence of viral activity. Virologist Mathieu Dubé and colleagues used fluorescent RNA probes to look for viral genes in immune cells called helper T cells, a primary target for the virus. “We run 10 million cells, and the machine will detect which one is positive for HIV and which one is negative,” says Dubé, of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center. The researchers then analyzed the infected cells, searching for viral RNA and protein production.</p>

<p>One surprise, Dubé says, was the large number of cells that were producing viral proteins. “We expected to see some spontaneous expression in a couple of cells, but not in so many.” The cells weren’t actually making new intact and infectious viruses; instead “most of what we found was defective — what we call junk,” he says. Another surprise was that even T cells that contained defective HIV genes, such as those with big chunks of DNA missing, were still able to produce viral proteins.</p>



<p>The key finding is that these junky viral proteins are a big biological problem. “Even though they are defective and do not trigger infection, they can still drive immune responses,” Dubé explains. And not in a good way.</p>



<p>In a healthy immune system, certain T cells would respond to the viral proteins by turning into specialized killer T cells capable of pouncing on and eradicating any HIV-infected cells. But in people with HIV, the immune cells fail to become potent killers, Trautmann’s team’s research shows.</p>



<p>Her interpretation: There are enough viral bits floating around to keep the immune system running ragged. Immune cells that should lead the attack on the virus are being asked to run marathon after marathon without ever stopping, she says. “They can’t keep up.”</p>



<p>The new results do suggest two possible strategies for better treating people infected with HIV. One is redoubling efforts to dramatically shrink the reservoir of infected cells, which could reduce the production of the problematic viral particles. The other is to figure out ways to reinvigorate T cells, perhaps by applying lessons from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-prod-patient-immune-system-fight-cancer-wins-nobel-prize">successes in boosting the immune response to cancer</a> (<em>SN: 10/1/18</em>). If the T cells are more capable, then the bits of viral protein floating around could have a vaccinelike effect, keeping the immune system primed to control any new viral production more effectively, says Deeks, who was not involved in the research.</p>





<p>But both strategies are challenging. “We’ve come a long way, but the problem we have left is a tough one,” says Jones.</p>

<p>A paper that found smoking rates in the United States fell faster than expected as more people started using e-cigarettes has been retracted over the objections of its authors, who have filed a complaint with the journal’s publisher. </p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/27/exclusive-public-health-journal-says-it-will-retract-vaping-paper-for-questions-authors-say-were-addressed-in-peer-review/">reported in July</a>, <em>BMC Public Health</em> informed the authors of “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z">Population-level counterfactual trend modelling to examine the relationship between smoking prevalence and e-cigarette use among US adults</a>” that the editors had decided to retract the article after receiving a critical letter. We reported:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The letter did not request retraction of the paper, but argued that its analyses “were flawed and therefore potentially produced misleading findings that would benefit tobacco industry profits and interests.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors of the retracted paper are employees of Pinney Associates, a consulting firm that they disclosed “provide[s] consulting services on tobacco harm reduction on an exclusive basis to Juul Labs Inc.” The article also disclosed that Juul Labs funded the research and reviewed and provided comments on a draft manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we published our story about the pending retraction, 23 researchers wrote a <a href="https://clivebates.com/documents/ExpertLetterFoxonRetractionAugust2023.pdf">letter</a> to the journal expressing concern about the decision. They wrote: </p>



<span id="more-128004"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors appear to have addressed the various concerns raised in their responses to the prepublication peer reviews and their sensitivity analysis, which shows that the findings are robust under a range of initial assumptions.</p>



<p>We are aware of the authors’ role as consultants for Juul Labs Inc., not least because it has been transparently disclosed by the authors throughout the editorial review process. The reported conflicts justify due skepticism and scrutiny. They do not justify unfair or unequal treatment. The proper way to respond is through the open science concept of <em>replication</em> to confirm, refute, or challenge the findings using the same publicly available datasets.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction notice does not refer to any conflict of interest, but stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors have retracted this article after readers raised concerns around the methodology. A post-publication review highlighted concerns about the assumption of ‘0’ prevalence of e-cigarette use in 2010 which contradicts available data; this assumption is not fully supported by the sensitivity analyses performed by the authors. Therefore, the Editors have lost confidence in the results reported by the article. None of the authors agree to this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors of the paper “believe that a retraction is not warranted, and we stand by our results,” they said in a statement shared by Floe Foxon, a data analyst at Pinney Associates and the corresponding author of the article. They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We believe the process was wrong, and their interpretation of the data and science is demonstrably wrong. Consistent with open science principles, we believe the journal should have published the Letter it received and our response. Since the journal has not done so, we invite readers and interested parties to read the article and subsequent correspondence with the journal, which we have made available in full on OSF at <a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FZTNK">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FZTNK</a>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The correspondence the authors posted contains their detailed refutations of the concerns mentioned in the retraction notice, and conviction that the decision “is based on fundamental misconceptions regarding basic elements of our article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also sent a formal complaint about the “process followed, and scientific judgment” of the journal’s editors to SpringerNature, its publisher, on September 22, and said they have not received a reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complaint, available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BMC-Public-Health-complaint-letter.pdf">here</a>, argued the authors addressed the concerns raised about the paper during the peer review process and in post-publication correspondence with the journal editors, and that the retraction was “inappropriate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than a retraction, the authors said that the journal should publish the original complaint letter it received, as well as the subsequent assessment by an editorial board member and the authors’ reply, “so that interested readers can decide for themselves which conclusion best fits the available data.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By retracting the paper, the journal denies readers this opportunity, and credits one side of a discussion while suppressing the other in a way that is incongruous with the pursuit of scientific knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A SpringerNature spokesperson confirmed receipt of the complaint and said the publisher was “currently in the process of providing a detailed response.” The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Although the journal followed COPE guidelines throughout the retraction and the editors were fully transparent with the authors during the investigation, we hope this response will provide further clarity on the process undertaken.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hippos-ferocious-fighters-teeth">Hippos might be ferocious fighters, but their big teeth make them terrible chewers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippos are horrible at chewing, and their giant tusks and front teeth are to blame.</p>



<p>These intimidating dental features are used by hippos, in part, to protect themselves and their territory. But <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0291825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the gnarly teeth interlock</a> or hinder jaw movements, preventing hippos from efficiently chewing with the side-to-side grinding technique that other herbivores use, researchers report October 4 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plant-eating mammals typically use the broad teeth near the sides of their mouths to grind and shred fibrous vegetation before swallowing it. Since their digestion process barely reduces food particle size, you can gauge chewing efficiency by looking at their feces.</p>





<p>In 2009, veterinarian Marcus Clauss of the University of Zurich and his colleagues compared the sizes of fecal particles across nearly 200 mammal species. They found that hippos were the least effective chewers among herbivores.&nbsp;Years later, he and his colleague Annika Avedik wondered whether hippos’ enormous front teeth were the cause of their meager munching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some herbivores, such as deer and cattle, have lost some of their front incisors during evolution, possibly because they impeded chewing. African rhinos have lost theirs entirely. “Hippos are a case example of a taxon that did not lose them,” Clauss says.</p>



<p>The researchers <a href="https://youtu.be/HMSJX8CatEY?si=gNZrGuCMBsPkwGaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nFa6TyQYZdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a> of common (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>) and pygmy hippopotamuses (<em>Choeropsis liberiensis</em>) eating, closely tracking how the teeth interacted as the jaws moved. The team also measured physical features of 86 common hippo and 21 pygmy hippo skulls in museum collections, including the spacing and arrangement of the teeth, and tested the side-to-side jaw range of these skulls and measured places where the teeth wore on each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clauss had originally thought that common hippos’ huge tusks, which are modified canine teeth, would be what stopped the animals from proper side-to-side chewing. “Boy, was I wrong,” he says.</p>



<p>Instead, the team found that common hippos’ upper and lower sets of long, spearlike incisors cross and interlock as the lower jaw closes, restricting the back teeth to up-and-down mashing.&nbsp;The herbivores still try some side-to-side movement of the jaw, Clauss says, evidenced by wear marks on the sides of the incisors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of a hippo skull on a black background." class="wp-image-3132111" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_JB_hungry-hippoes_skull_inline-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132111">Skulls of common hippos (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>) like this one showed researchers that the top and bottom incisors interlocked during chewing, keeping the jaw from moving side to side.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132111">Michelle Aimée Oesch (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC-BY 4.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Pygmy hippos’ incisors don’t interlock, but their tusks bump up against the snout, allowing only a limited amount of side sliding. Wear patterns show that the incisors glide past each other when chewing.</p>



<p>Because pygmy hippos show some side-to-side jaw movement when chewing, it hints that “lateral grinding chewing is something [hippos] once did, and that it got lost along the way,” Clauss says.</p>



<p>Hippos now use their rigid jaws, wide gapes and sharp, sturdy tusks and incisors, in part, to combat other hippos over territory and access to mates, and to defend against predators.&nbsp;But the potential shift to less efficient chewing could have come with consequences. Because hippos can’t mulch food into very small pieces, it takes longer for it to be digested, Clauss says.</p>



<p>“If food has to stay longer in the gut, it means one cannot eat more, quickly. Hence hippos are, among mammalian herbivores, characterized by relatively low food intakes,” he explains.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Their comparatively low food intake may put hippos at a competitive disadvantage against other, more efficiently chewing ruminant herbivores such as antelope. An inability to compete with fully land-dwelling species for sufficient food may keep hippos wedded to the African waterways the semiaquatic animals call home.</p>



<p>The study is “a really good reminder of the complexity of organisms, and that when anatomical parts, such as teeth, are viewed in isolation, they may not explain the whole picture,” says comparative biomechanist Susan Williams of Ohio University in Athens.</p>



<p>Studying fossil hippo ancestors could reveal if, and when, hippos’ side-to-side motion during chewing stopped, rounding out understanding of the animals’ evolutionary story. Juvenile hippos also don’t yet have incisors large enough to interlock, so Clauss is curious to see if these youngsters temporarily use side-to-side chewing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-dots-nanoparticles-bawendi-brus-ekimov">The development of quantum dots wins the 2023 Nobel prize in chemistry</a></h4>

              
                <p>Work on tiny dots that light up TV screens and help doctors see the blood vessels that feed tumors has earned three scientists the 2023 Nobel Prize in chemistry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chemist Moungi Bawendi, chemist Louis Brus and physicist Alexei Ekimov split the prize for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 4.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="314" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_cg_ts_nobel_chemistry_headshots_inline.jpg" alt="Composite image of three headshots: chemist Moungi Bawendi (left), chemist Louis Brus (middle) and physicist Alexei Ekimov (right) who together won the 2023 Nobel Prize in chemistry for “the discovery and development of quantum dots, nanoparticles so tiny that their size determines their properties.”" class="wp-image-3132077" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_cg_ts_nobel_chemistry_headshots_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100423_cg_ts_nobel_chemistry_headshots_inline-330x152.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3132077"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chemist Moungi Bawendi (left), chemist Louis Brus (middle) and physicist Alexei Ekimov (right) have split the 2023 Nobel Prize in chemistry for “the discovery and development of quantum dots, nanoparticles so tiny that their size determines their properties.”</span></span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132077">MIT, Columbia University, Nexdot</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Quantum dots are a new class of materials, different from molecules,” said Heiner Linke, a member of the Nobel committee. Just adjusting the size of these nanoparticles, roughly a few billionths of a meter across, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-dots-get-second-chance-shine">can change their properties</a> — optical, electric, magnetic, even melting points — thanks to quantum mechanics (<em>SN: 6/29/15</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s also true of color. “If you want to make different colors with molecules, you would choose a new molecule, a new set of atoms” arranged in a different structure, Linke said. But quantum dots of different colors have the exact same arrangement of atoms. The only difference is particle size.</p>





<p>When quantum dots are irradiated by light, electrons within get energized, eventually releasing that energy as fluorescent light. The smaller the dots are, the more they compress the wave function of an electron, increasing its energy so that the dot appears blue. Larger dots appear red.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dots of the same size made from different materials may also emit slightly different wavelengths of light, says Jean-Marc Pecourt, a chemist at CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society. Quantum dots are usually made from semiconductor materials, such as graphene, selenite or metal sulfides, Pecourt says. So by adjusting materials or the size of quantum dots, chemists can alter their properties for a wide variety of uses.</p>



<p>The idea that the size of these nanoparticles could alter their properties was predicted nearly a century ago, but at the time it seemed impossible to reproduce that effect in the real world. To do that, researchers would need a perfectly crystalline material, and would need to control the size of the nanomaterial very precisely, sculpting it atom layer by atom layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in the early 1980s, Ekimov and Brus independently showed that it could be done. Ekimov, now at Nanocrystals Technology, Inc., in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., demonstrated this in glass, adding copper chloride to produce tiny crystals and revealing that the color of the glass was linked to the size of those crystals. Brus, of Columbia University, made a similar discovery, but in a different context: He demonstrated the link between size and color for nanoparticles floating freely in a solution <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/creating-crystals-study-quantum-effects">and in gaseous compounds</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/92</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those discoveries triggered intense interest in how to harness these little dots for a variety of applications. But manufacturing them would require being able to control the size of the particles to precise specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade later, Bawendi, of MIT, developed a method to precisely control the speed of the crystals’ growth in a solution, figuring out how to stop them right when they reach a desired size. He did this by first injecting chemical reagents into the solution that instantaneously formed the tiny crystals and then promptly adjusting the temperature of the solution, halting their growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m deeply honored and surprised and shocked by the announcement this morning,” Bawendi said October 4 during an MIT news conference. “I&#8217;m especially honored to share this with Lou Brus, who was my postdoctoral mentor [from] whom I learned so much. I tried to emulate his scholarship and his mentoring style as a professor myself when I came to MIT.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bawendi started working on quantum dots after he met Brus at Nokia Bell Labs, headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J. The researchers needed high quality quantum dots to study the physics of the nanoparticles, Bawendi said. “It wasn&#8217;t because I wanted to make the best quantum dots possible for application, it was because we needed to make the best possible quantum dots to study them.” It took years of trial and error to work out the method, he said.</p>



<p>By making it possible to manufacture quantum dots, Bawendi’s method opened up a world of possible uses for the nanoparticles. Quantum dots make it possible to very precisely change the color of LED lights and dramatically improve their efficiency. Dots that glow with fluorescent light, injected into the body and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-dots-light-cancer-cells-mice">attached to immune cells that swarm to cancerous tissues</a>, can help surgeons distinguish even hard-to-see tumors (<em>SN: 8/3/04</em>).&nbsp;The ability to be tuned to absorb different wavelengths of light could also allow the manufacture of customized solar cells that are highly efficient in different light conditions. The dots might also be used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">to build quantum computers</a>, Pecourt says (<em>SN: 2/14/18</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biomedical engineer and chemist Warren Chan says the prize is well deserved. “They&#8217;re the ones who built the foundation,” says Chan, of&nbsp;the University of Toronto. “I&#8217;m really happy that the field is getting credit for really changing the world, not just in quantum dots, but in a lot of different areas.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>One of the first applications came in the late 1990s when Chan and colleagues used quantum dots to tag cells in the lab, he says. “The surface modifications that were used for integrating quantum dots for applications were then also adapted for other types of nanoparticles.”</p>



<p>The Nobel committee looks not only at past contributions, but also the effect a discovery may have on the future, Chan says. The ability to tune nanoparticles by changing their size or surface properties could open a wide variety of possibilities that have not yet been explored. Chan and colleagues are now using quantum dots to detect infectious diseases, including HIV, influenza and hepatitis B.</p>



<p>“I was absolutely thrilled to see this,” says Judith Giordan, president of the American Chemical Society. “We have three people recognized who brought this technology from a dream, a hope, a theoretical construct … all the way through synthesis and manufacture.”</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-2023-mrna-vaccine-covid">the development of mRNA vaccines</a> — widely speculated as a candidate for the 2023 chemistry Nobel Prize — received the Nobel in medicine or physiology instead (<em>SN: 10/2/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sometimes chemistry gets a bad rap,” Giordan says. “But here are two magnificent examples of how chemistry has solved problems in the world.”</p>



<p>The three winners will share the prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or about $1 million.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amphibian-frog-extinction-risk-climate-global-report">A global report finds amphibians are still in peril. But it’s not all bad news</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly 20 years ago, the first global assessment of amphibians found the animals facing widespread declines. Now, a second, updated report shows that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06578-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many amphibians are still in trouble</a>, but with some silver linings, researchers report October 4 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“We are realistic and hopeful at the same time,” says Jennifer Luedtke, a conservationist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which tracks extinction risk trends for species around the world.</p>



<p>In particular, the wealth of data in the new report, which includes about 8,000 amphibian species, could help focus conservation efforts for years to come, says Luedtke, who also works from Washington, D.C., for Re:wild, a conservation organization based in Austin, Texas. That’s what happened after the <a href="https://www.iucn-amphibians.org/red-listing/global-amphibian-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Global Amphibian Assessment</a> in 2004, which brought awareness to the amphibian crisis and galvanized researchers to coordinate efforts.</p>





<p>Having two assessments that can be compared is a big deal, experts say. “It’s important not just to have a picture, but actually to have a sequence of pictures … where you can see what’s happening over time,” says conservation ecologist Ana Rodrigues of CNRS in Montpelier, France, who worked on the first assessment but was not involved in the second. “I’m really happy to see this done.”</p>



<p>Here are five big takeaways from the new report.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Amphibians remain more threatened with extinction than any other vertebrate group.</h4>



<p>About 41 percent of amphibian species, which include frogs, toads and salamanders, are threatened with extinction, Luedtke and her colleagues found. That’s more than any other group of vertebrates, beating out sharks and rays (37 percent), mammals (27 percent), reptiles (21 percent) and birds (13 percent).</p>



<p>Amphibians held this title in 2004 too, when 39 percent of species were threatened. As part of the 2022 update, researchers also used data to reconstruct the situation in 1980. They found that even in 1980, that number was already high, at 38 percent. Basically, amphibians have been really threatened for a really long time, Luedtke says.</p>



<p>The most common threat that affects amphibians is habitat loss and degradation, with agriculture affecting as many as 77 percent of the studied species. Other threats include climate change and disease, each affecting 29 percent of species. Of course, “these things are never completely isolated,” says Rodrigues, and each threat may increase the likelihood of other threats.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Many of the worst amphibian declines are being caused by climate change now, instead of disease.</h4>



<p>Luedtke and colleagues also wanted to know which threats were most responsible for driving the worst declines. So they looked at a subset of 788 species that, between 1980 and 2022, moved down an <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/#:~:text=It%20divides%20species%20into%20nine,in%20the%20Wild%20and%20Extinct." target="_blank" rel="noopener">IUCN Red List status</a> level — for instance, from vulnerable to endangered. They found that, in 2004, disease was the primary driver behind the drop in conservation status for 58 percent of that species subset. At the time, the fungal pathogen<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-frog-killing-disease-may-not-be-so-new"> chytrid was devastating frog populations</a> around the world (<em>SN: 8/23/02</em>). Climate change, on the other hand, was a significant contributor to declines in only 1 percent of species.</p>



<p>Now, less than 20 years later, climate change is behind a status drop for 39 percent of species. That makes it the most common primary driver of declines across the amphibian group, the researchers found. And still the finding is probably an underestimate, Luedtke says, as studies continue to emerge detailing how climate change–related temperature increases, changes in precipitation, extreme weather events and wildfires impact amphibians.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s very worrying,” Rodrigues says. “We’re at the beginning of climate change.… What’s ahead of us?”</p>

ROJAS-RUNJAIC</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. It’s bad around the world. But amphibians are doing worse in some regions than others.</h4>



<p>Each region faces its own set of threats. The chytrid outbreak, for example, has affected much of the world, but it hit Central and South America especially hard from the 1970s to the 2000s. That likely explains why that region contains the largest proportion of species in the IUCN Red List categories of highest concern, the researchers say. New Guinea and Africa were spared much of the devastation, though the pathogen has recently started to emerge in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>





<p>Across Europe and East Asia, habitat loss is the leading cause of decline, followed by a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fungus-species-found-killing-salamanders">newly emerging fungal pathogen</a> in Europe called <em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, this time that affects salamanders (<em>SN: 9/3/13</em>). It hasn’t yet spread to North America, which would be disastrous, Rodrigues says. The continent is home to more than 200 types of salamanders, over a quarter of the world’s salamander species.</p>



<p>For now, North America’s amphibian declines are most associated with climate change, the report found. South and Southeast Asia are seeing an improving trend among their species’ extinction risk, probably due to better management of protected areas.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Scientists know a lot more about amphibians now than they did in 2004.</h4>



<p>One of the assessment’s few bright spots is its sheer amount of data. The update includes more than 2,000 additional species — all newly described since 2004. There was also a decrease in species labeled as “data deficient” by the IUCN, from 23 percent in 2004 to only 11 percent in 2022. By comparison, though, less than 1 percent of bird species are listed as data deficient.</p>



<p>While there’s still a long way to go for amphibians, researchers are thrilled by the new amount of information. “It’s like, wow, all the knowledge!” Rodrigues says. “So that’s absolutely good news.” With more data, she says, conservation efforts can be better focused.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Some amphibian species have improved since 2004.</h4>



<p>The new report didn’t just find declines — 120 species saw their IUCN conservation status improve.</p>



<p>About half of those species recovered unaided. Many of those had suffered declines due to chytrid and are now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-frogs-may-be-bouncing-back-after-killer-chytrid-fungus">bouncing back</a>, possibly as frogs become resistant to the pathogen (<em>SN: 3/29/18</em>). It’s a source of hope that “we have these little frogs evolving, in front of our eyes, resistance to chytridiomycosis,” Luedtke says.</p>



<p>The other half improved thanks to conservation efforts, the report found. One of those species is India’s indigo bush frog (<em>Raorchestes indigo</em>), which was classified as critically endangered in 2004. A couple years later, a legal battle led to the end of all mining in the Kudremukh Massif mountain range, and the species’ IUCN status has since improved to vulnerable.</p>



<p>Stories like that are evidence that effective habitat protection can make a noticeable difference, the researchers say, and yet, with most amphibians still facing declines, it’s clear that current efforts are not enough. The assessment’s accompanying State of the World’s Amphibians Report focuses on action steps based on the new findings. Among other things, it identifies 50 target conservation areas around the world — including Jamaica, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest and the Central Annamite Highlands in Vietnam — that feature a high density of threatened species.</p>



<p>“Yes, the number of threatened amphibians continues to increase, but our understanding is improving,” Luedtke says. “And because we understand them better, we can act in a more accurate and effective way.”</p>

<p><em>We are pleased to present an excerpt from Trust in Medical Research, a </em><a href="https://doi.org/10.26180/23827920.v2"><em>freely available</em></a><em> new book by </em><a href="https://www.monash.edu/alumni/alumni-events/graduation/speaker-profiles/may-2023/professor-warwick-anderson-ao"><em>Warwick P. Anderson</em></a><em>, emeritus professor of physiology and biomedical sciences at Monash University in Victoria, Australia.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>It has always been difficult for me to admit that we have a genuine and substantial problem of fraud and rubbish science in medical research. I suspect this is true for most scientists. We want to think of science as being free from half-truths and fake news. We hope that the high moral purpose of medical research will guard against wrongdoing, that it will weigh on our minds so heavily that we all take care to work and publish honestly and competently.</p>



<p>We know that scientists sometimes make unintentional mistakes due to ignorance, but we also know in our hearts that some people are so ambitious that they push the envelope, stretch the truth and take shortcuts. We know, too, that a few others go further and get carried away by the prospects of scientific and financial rewards and so cheat, commit fraud and lie in publications. This is what some humans do in all walks of life.</p>



<p>We know all this, but it is fair to say that we generally do not want to face up to it. Jennifer Byrne at the University of Sydney put it well when <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00439-9">she wrote</a> that we tend to overlook the research fraud issue “because the scientific community has been unwilling to have frank and open discussions about it”:</p>



<span id="more-127991"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Fraud departs from community norms, so scientists do not want to think about it, let alone talk about it … This becomes a vicious cycle: because fraud is not discussed, people don’t learn about it, so they don’t consider it, or they think it’s so rare that it’s unlikely to affect them, and so papers are less likely to come under scrutiny. Thinking and talking about systematic fraud is essential to solving this problem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When challenged about the incidence of fraud in medical research, many scientists tend to take defensive positions. We might contend that the usual self-correcting methods of science, replication of experiments and peer review will solve the problem. But we know that peer review is not honed to detect fraud reliably (though it can do), that replication of experiments is something that most of us are not very interested in doing (and it rarely gets supported by funders anyhow) and that a negative result from replication research will struggle to get published. All medical researchers should talk more about research misconduct because it is we who have most at stake: our reputations, the reputation of medical research itself, and our time and resources when we spend months or years on a project based on what turns out to have been fraudulent research.</p>



<p>So, what should we do as scientists to better own the problem and guard medical research? One way, I contend, is for medical research to become a true profession.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Medical research is not a profession, even though it demands a high level of professionalism. Anyone can call themselves a medical researcher. There are no processes that affirm an individual has reached some agreed level of expertise, proficiency and reliability. There is no specific training and no accreditation program. There is no requirement to learn a designated set of skills and knowledge, such as the proper use of statistics, what good research practices are or what the ethical obligations are. There is no equivalent of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and the national- and state-based medical boards. There is no need for registration and demonstration of training. There is not even a set of stated principles that we expect every medical researcher to share.</p>



<p>Other groups of people who train to be expert, whose jobs involve individual responsibilities and can be hazardous to others, have professional bodies that manage accreditation or are accredited by government. Such fields have training and competency entry requirements, and they usually require ongoing training and education. They have formal ways to withdraw recognition and accreditation when their members act in ways that harm their customers or patients and tarnish the reputation of the profession itself. Why should medical research be different to doctors, dentists, physiotherapists and vets? Why don’t we have a professional certification system in medical research that requires achievement and maintenance of competency and ethical standards and could remove accreditation when misconduct is proven?</p>



<p>I have written this chapter with some trepidation. Some of my colleagues fear that any internal criticism of the methods and procedures of medical research will be seized upon by critics, especially politicians, to attack scientists and medical research itself and potentially even take control of funding.</p>



<p>I understand this concern, but the bigger risk in the medium to long term is to not address the problems ourselves. After all, if scientific training teaches us anything, it is how to critically examine everything – methodology, results, applications for funding, proposed publications, PhD theses, seminars and conference presentations – and then to find solutions.</p>



<p>The danger signs are already flashing. Richard Smith, a previous editor of <em>The BMJ</em>, <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/07/05/time-to-assume-that-health-research-is-fraudulent-until-proved-otherwise/">wrote recently</a> about clinical trials: “We have now reached a point where those doing systematic reviews must start by assuming that a study is fraudulent until they can have some evidence to the contrary.” When someone as experienced as Smith makes such a statement, it is past time for us to put our house in order.</p>

                <p>Glimpses of the ultrafast world of electrons are changing scientists’ vision of the inner workings of atoms and molecules. The 2023 Nobel Prize in physics goes to three physicists who illuminated this realm with ultrashort pulses of light, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 3.</p>



<p>Physicists Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier will split the 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million) prize, awarded &#8220;for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within atoms and molecules, electrons zip around at extreme speeds. Capturing their to-and-fro is possible only with pulses of light that are extremely short. It’s akin to a camera flash that lasts mere attoseconds, or billionths of a billionth of a second.</p>



<p>Humans have long strived to measure processes with increasing precision, says Peter Armitage, a physicist at Johns Hopkins University. “With the advent of lasers, the timescales that you could measure became shorter and shorter [because] you&#8217;re doing it with ultrafast light pulses.”</p>





<p>Over decades, researchers have honed the ability to create such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pursuit-briefest-beat">near-instantaneous bursts of light</a> (<em>SN: 3/12/10</em>). In the 1980s, L’Huillier, now at Lund University in Sweden, noticed that infrared laser light sent through a gas would <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/21/3/001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create light of a variety of wavelengths</a>, what’s known as high-harmonic generation. The effect is a result of how that light interacts with the electrons in the gas, by a process which L’Huillier’s research helped clarify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These other wavelengths, known as overtones or harmonics, are similar to the overtones that help give musical instruments their distinctive sounds. Adding together the right combinations of overtones results in very short pulses of light. With this method, researchers led by Agostini, now at Ohio State University in Columbus, in 2001 produced <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1059413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of light pulses</a>, each of which lasted just 250 attoseconds. The same year, Krausz, now at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany, and colleagues created single pulses lasting just <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35107000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">650 attoseconds</a>. Today, scientists can make much shorter pulses tens of attoseconds long.</p>



<p>“I was personally fascinated by this field from the start, and this is why I continued with it during many, many years,” L’Huillier said in a phone call during the announcement. &nbsp;L’Huillier is only the fifth woman to receive the physics Nobel. “There are not so many women that get this prize, so it’s very, very special,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have used this technique to explore the behavior of electrons inside atoms and molecules. For example, the technique has revealed the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1189401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timescale for the photoelectric effect</a>, in which light knocks an electron out of an atom, and details of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-tunneling-takes-time-new-study-shows">quantum tunneling</a>, in which electrons pass through barriers that seem insurmountable (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>The technique also reveals the behavior of molecules. “You can watch the motions of molecules themselves, essentially to make movies of molecular motion,” Armitage says. “And this is of vast interest for all kinds of things: for [everything from] understanding why some materials are superconductors at high temperatures to photovoltaic applications, harvesting energy from light…. I think it&#8217;s really just right at the beginning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert Rosner, a theoretical physicist at the University of Chicago, says one application involves designing materials from scratch.“Chemistry is all about how electrons … interact with one another,” he says. “It&#8217;s like building a house, and you need to know what goes first and what&#8217;s the next step.” But in this case, you want to follow what the electrons do during chemical synthesis — which is something ultrashort light pulses can do. “It really opens up an entirely new way of thinking about how we actually make stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/noisy-environs-pied-tamarins-smell-communicate">In noisy environs, pied tamarins are using smell more often to communicate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Native to the Brazilian Amazon, pied tamarins have always used vocal calls to communicate. But noise pollution from car traffic and other human activity are forcing some tamarins to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03949370.2023.2248591?src=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complement those voice calls with smell markings</a> to alert others to dangers, researchers report September 20 in <em>Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Most pied tamarins (<em>Saguinus bicolor</em>) live in Manaus, Brazil, inhabiting fragmented patches of forest scattered around urban environments. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, this small, black and whitish-yellow primate <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/fr/species/40644/192551696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is </a><a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/fr/species/40644/192551696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critically endangered</a>.</p>





<p>Vocal communication is crucial for pied tamarins’ survival; they use it to alert other individuals to danger — an important feat considering the urban environment surrounding them. &#8220;Pied tamarins have 12 different types of vocalization with several uses, from pointing to food and cuddling each other to calling out for some danger,&#8221; says Tainara Sobroza, a biologist at the Federal University of Amazonas in Manaus.</p>



<p>The &#8220;danger&#8221; vocalization is particularly important for these animals, Sobroza says, as many are hit by cars and killed when they cross streets to move between forest patches. &#8220;We wanted to understand if this type of vocalization is being affected by the noise of urban environments,&#8221; she says.</p>



<p>Sobroza and colleagues spent about a year observing pied tamarins, which normally wander in groups of less than 10 individuals. Using radio collars, the team tracked nine groups in Manaus for 10 days each from November 2018 to December 2019. While physically following the groups, the researchers measured the loudness of the alpha female’s alert call and visually counted how often individuals rubbed their chest and lower parts on the ground and trees, spreading an odorous, waxy substance to signal which direction they were heading.</p>



<p>The team thought the tamarins would use fewer vocal callings and more smell-spreading to communicate effectively between groups — but that is not what happened. Estimates of the behaviors suggest tamarins complemented one with the other: They maintained the loudness and quantity of their vocal calls while also marking the terrain with their scents.</p>



<p>“It is just like being at a noisy party, and you want to call a friend that can&#8217;t hear you from the other side of the room,” Sobroza says. “Added to calling him or her, you also usually wave and do arm gestures to call the attention of that person.”</p>



<p>The new observations bring extra knowledge about the ecology and behavior of this species, says Luciane Lopes de Souza, a biologist at the University of the State of Amazonas in Manaus who did not take part in the study. &#8220;It is very interesting to see that pied tamarins can adapt to use [a scent-marking] form of communication, which we see much more frequently in other species such as the squirrel monkey.&#8221;</p>



<p>Human activity is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cities-create-accidental-experiments-plant-animal-evolution">changing the behavior of several species</a> such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/city-song-birds-sing-higher-near-urban-traffic">birds</a>, spiders and crabs (<em>SN: 6/26/16, SN: 7/16/03</em>). Understanding these changes is crucial if humans want to mitigate their impacts through conservation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do hope this study goes on, as it is of extreme importance we have research like this running for longer periods,” Souza says. “This way, we can understand annual or seasonal changes in animal behavior and think of evolutionary changes they might be facing.&#8221;</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, David Haydock will talk about the paper entitled &quot;EEG microstates as a tool for studying the temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks: A review&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state
activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method
involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as
successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field
remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-
scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across
time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these
microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious
mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of
mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes
associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the
temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source
imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-
state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of
EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time
scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available
methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these
microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.</p>

<p>The latest Open Science Indicators (OSI) dataset has arrived! And with it, a brand new indicator. Read on for details, and be sure to explore the data for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>About Open Science Indicators</h2>



<p>Open Science Indicators identify and quantify instances of specific Open Science practices in published scientific literature using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques applied and developed in partnership with <a href="https://dataseer.ai/">DataSeer</a>. At PLOS, we use indicators as a tool to support our mission to advance Open Science. Other members of the scholarly community use them to <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2023/02/16/preparing-for-open-science-indicators/">understand trends in their institution</a>; to <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/8117154">explore markers of research integrity</a>, and to <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04121339v2">benchmark new tools for monitoring Open Science</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The latest Open Science Indicators dataset</h2>



<p>This is the fourth quarterly update to Open Science Indicators since we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">introduced the dataset</a> in December 2022. It covers January 1 2019 to June 30 2023 (four full years, plus the first half of 2023). Like the previous installments, this update measures data-generation and -sharing, code-generation and -sharing, and preprint posting. <strong>It also includes a preliminary version of our first new indicator: protocol sharing</strong>. Watch this space for more on how we developed the protocol sharing indicator in a future post.</p>



<p>OSI Version 4 (Sept 23) also includes an expanded comparator corpus, which has doubled the number of articles from other publishers included in the dataset from 8,176 in version 3 (June 23) to 16,023 today.</p>



<p>See the <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686?file=41362998">README</a> for a full list of updates related to version 4.</p>



<h2>Observations</h2>



<p>For the first half of 2023, all four indicators remain stable overall, consistent with patterns observed in 2022. In keeping with previous results, PLOS articles were more likely to link to public research data or code than non-PLOS articles, and equally likely to link to a preprint.</p>
