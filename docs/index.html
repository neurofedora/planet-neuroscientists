<p>An article estimating how many people might have died during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitals was retracted in August after advocates for the drug launched a campaign criticizing the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.leprogres.fr/sante/2024/09/03/hydroxychloroquine-et-covid-pourquoi-l-etude-lyonnaise-a-t-elle-ete-depubliee">French</a> media have reported <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/sciences-sante/sante/retraction-dune-etude-sur-lhydroxychloroquine-intimidations-reseau-pro-raoult-et-proces-en-heresie-EGAAO4OQUFGOFGJIKSEQMR27VQ/">criticism</a> of the retraction as <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2024/09/10/covid-19-the-controversy-over-deaths-linked-to-hydroxychloroquine-reignites_6725428_10.html#">inappropriate</a>, and <a href="https://www.msn.com/fr-fr/sante/other/d%C3%A9c%C3%A8s-li%C3%A9s-%C3%A0-l-hydroxychloroquine-un-article-retir%C3%A9-sous-la-pression/ar-AA1qc1Mj">speculation</a> the journal caved to pressure from hydroxychloroquine advocates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement to Retraction Watch, the journal stood by its decision to retract the article due to “some clear fatal flaws” identified in letters to the editor, which it said it declined to publish due to their tone it deemed “not suitable for publication in a scientific journal.”</p>



<span id="more-130306"></span>



<p>The editor in chief’s decision “was based solely on scientific considerations, and the process was in line with Committee on Publication Ethics best practices,” a spokesperson for the publisher said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Correspondence between the journal and authors of the paper obtained by Retraction Watch, including the critical letters to the editor and authors’ responses, shed some light on the specific arguments the editor considered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075333222301853X">Deaths induced by compassionate use of hydroxychloroquine during the first COVID-19 wave: An estimate</a>,” appeared online January 2 in the journal <em>Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy</em>, an Elsevier title. It has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors, led by Jean-Christophe Lega of Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud in France, estimated 17,000 deaths related to hydroxychloroquine may have occurred in Belgium, Turkey, France, Italy, Spain, and the US, with a range from about 6,300 to 19,300.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Although our estimates are limited by their imprecision, these findings illustrate the hazard of drug repurposing with low-level evidence,” the authors concluded.</p>



<p>As has been the case with hydroxychloroquine, the findings made international headlines. Then, the criticism began, in online articles, videos and blog posts, letters to the journal editor, and emails to Lega and the president of the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, where he is a professor. The university got so many emails, many of which accused Lega of fraud and questioned his integrity, the institution formally reported them to the public prosecutor.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On January 15, an Elsevier employee named Adam Fraser emailed Lega on behalf of the journal editor, Danyelle Townsend of the University of South Carolina in Charleston. The email acknowledged receiving a request from Lega to correct the article, and mentioned a “readers’ debate” about the paper. The letter continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Journal has received a number of Letters to the Editor which are being assessed and, if they are accepted, you will be given a right to reply, prior to publication, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines and journal policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal on January 28 published an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332224000647">editor’s note</a>, which has since been updated, about the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 1, Fraser, whose title is executive publisher for pharmacology, sent another email on behalf of Townsend with eight letters to the editor for Lega and his colleagues to consider for a response. But by that time, Townsend had decided to handle the matter differently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“After assessing all the information, and the extent and depth of the criticism, I have made the decision to change approach and handle this matter through the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) process for corrections to the scientific record,” she wrote. The substance of the complaints in the letters, “if true, would violate our publishing policies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>An update to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332224000647">editor’s note</a> on the article echoed Townsend’s email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Townsend for comment on the change of tack and received the following statement from an Elsevier spokesperson:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Journal assessed the letters to the editor received and had them independently peer reviewed by an expert reviewer, who submitted their opinion to the journal.</p>



<p>The initial plan, as published in an earlier version of the Editor’s Note, was to publish these Letters to the editor, after the Authors of the above article had been given the right to reply and submit a response (which would also be published, after review). After assessing all letters to the editor (which came from a wide range of geographies and persons) and the review of the letters to the editor, the editor decided to change approach. The criticisms were too extensive to be addressed by a corrigendum, and some clear fatal flaws/ key errors were identified by some of the letters and the review.&nbsp; The tone of some of the letters was not suitable for publication in a scientific journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On July 4, Lega sent the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00222.pdf">responses</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00276.pdf">to</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00452.pdf">each</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00544.pdf">of</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00627.pdf">the</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00681-1.pdf">letters</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00681.pdf">on</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_00992.pdf">behalf</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/answer_general_comment.pdf">of</a> all the authors. In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cover_Letter.pdf">cover letter</a>, Lega wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The only letter that holds our attention is that of Viera et al. (BIOPHA-D-24-00992), which presents well-constructed and factual arguments (use of risk ratio, adjusted mortality rate) for a better estimation of the excess mortality related to the prescription of HCQ. The calculations lead to estimates of the same order of magnitude as those produced by our study.</p>



<p>However, this does not qualitatively challenge our results, as written by the authors of the letter. The authors mistakenly used a treatment effect combining hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from a network meta-analysis for their estimates, which is not the purpose of our study.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One group of authors engaged a lawyer to pressure <em>Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy</em> to publish their letter, according to a <a href="https://bonsens.info/mise-en-demeure-par-voie-davocat-a-leditrice-en-chef-du-journal-ayant-publie-letude-estimant-des-milliers-de-deces-dus-a-lhydroxychloroquine/">copy</a> posted to the website of BonSens.org, a French organization that has since <a href="https://bonsens.info/bonsens-soutient-la-science-et-la-medecine/">taken partial credit</a> for the retraction. The authors <a href="https://www.fortunejournals.com/articles/erroneous-assessment-of-the-effect-of-hospital-treatment-ndash-the-misleading-creation-of-17000-deaths-and-its-consequences-for-go.html">published</a> their letter July 30 in the <em>Archives of Microbiology &amp; Immunology</em>, a title of Fortune Journals<em>.</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Fraser emailed Lega and his coauthors August 9 with Townsend’s decision to retract the article, and asked them to respond within five days. The email included a proposed retraction notice with the reasons for the decision:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, the Journal was made aware of readers’ debate about this article. The Journal received a number of Letters to the Editor and correspondence from readers. The plan, as published in an early version of an Editor’s Note, was initially to publish these Letters to the Editor, after the Authors of the above article had been given the right to reply and submit a response (which would also be published, after review).</p>



<p>After assessing all the information at this stage, and the extent and depth of the criticism, the Editor-in-Chief made the decision to change approach and handle this matter through the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) process for corrections to the scientific record: <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">https://publicationethics.org/</a></p>



<p>Upon completion of this process, and following careful consideration of all available information, this article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief.</p>



<p>The decision to retract was made due to two major issues:</p>



<p>Reliability of the data and choice of the data. The Belgian dataset in particular was found to be unreliable, based on estimates.</p>



<p>The assumption that all patients that entered the clinic were being treated the same pharmacologically was incorrect.</p>



<p>The above two issues meant that the Editor-in-Chief found the conclusions of the article to be unreliable, and needed to be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lega responded on behalf of the authors on August 19, disputing the retraction and asserting the value of their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We transparently emphasized throughout the manuscript that these were approximations with large confidence intervals given the significant uncertainties surrounding several parameters,” he wrote. The authors were aware of the limited data for Belgium, but “addressed and fully acknowledged” the limitation in the article. “We also specifically varied the parameters to generate uncertainty by taking the minimum and maximum values of exposure to hydroxychloroquine.”</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We understand that science can bring controversies, especially in the context of COVID-19, which has generated polarized debate. However, as provided in our point-by-point response, we truly believe that the validity of the arguments raised by the few readers who questioned the validity of the results were largely unfounded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lega proposed publishing a correction or “response from the authors” to address the issues in the retraction notice. He also sent an email to Sarah Jenkins, senior director for the Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics Centre of Expertise at Elsevier, asking for “your input on the ongoing retraction process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jenkins’ reply, dated August 22, restated Townsend’s decision. “Within the Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics Centre of Expertise, we uphold the independence of our Editors-in-Chief in these matters,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332224012381">notice</a>, dated August 26, largely matched the proposed language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After seeing the notice, Lega wrote to Jenkins:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am saddened that our responses are not commented on more by the editorial board. The comments we received were from non-experts in the field of pharmacology and modelling, with activity on social networks aggressively questioning the scientific basis and the scientists. I would therefore have liked to understand better how they were assessed by the journal.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in order to prevent the resumption of the campaign of harassment, I would appreciate it if the journal would indicate that the accusations of fraud and falsification have not been sustained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On August 29, after some back-and-forth, Fraser emailed the authors on behalf of Townsend, stating:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[She] has considered your response to the retraction notice, but does not feel this changes her decision to retract the article, and thus does not require any changes to the existing text. </p>



<p>She does not also believe it would be advantageous to publish letters to the editor and responses as the key information for the community is contained within the retraction notice, particularly once the drafted update is published. As noted this update will make it clear that you disagree with the retraction and dispute the grounds for it, and make it clear that there was no evidence of fraud.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The update, dated September 2024, stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Journal wishes to clarify that at no point did the investigation find evidence of fraud in the article, and instead believe it was honest error on the part of the authors.</p>



<p>The authors were responsive to the Journal’s correspondence and engaged with the process throughout. The authors do not agree with the retraction and dispute the grounds for it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lega and his colleagues are working to revise the article and resubmit it to another journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I deeply regret, as do the co-authors, the lack of transparency for the scientific community in the process that led to the retraction, despite the respect I have for the Editor,” Lega told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As he wrote in an email to Townsend regarding the update to the retraction notice:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We deeply regret the lack of communication from the Journal about the reasons and the context for the retraction. Scientists and the media are once again under pressure from French conspiracy groups, who support the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. In view of the public health issues at stake, we would have welcomed more appropriate communication from the Journal.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>This month, and as part of International Brain Tumour Awareness Week, we interviewed Dr Hannah K Jackson, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham. Hannah discusses balancing the many aspects of research, the importance of surrounding yourself with a supportive network and her hopes and dreams for her future in academia.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">Can you tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I started my scientific journey at the University of Nottingham, focusing on extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are membrane-surrounded ‘packets’ that are released by cells, carrying molecules to be delivered to recipient cells. I initially studied their role in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour. My research was centred on understanding how EVs contribute to metastasis and exploring their potential as biomarkers to better characterise disease progression. After that, I moved to bioengineering EVs for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development during my postdoc at Cambridge University, collaborating with Exosis Inc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my current position at The University of Nottingham, I’m working on how cancer and its treatments affect pain and sensitisation, with a focus on how EVs transfer biologically active compounds that alter neurodevelopment. My fascination with neuroscience stems from the complexity of the brain&apos;s interactions with diseases, particularly in cancer and pain.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">What made you pursue the position you are currently in?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I pursued my current role because I was drawn to the potential of EVs to bridge various fields-from cancer research to neurodevelopment-and make a tangible difference in understanding diseases. The opportunity to explore how EVs can influence pain and sensitisation after cancer treatment, combined with my passion for translational research, drove me toward this position. Additionally, moving back to the University of Nottingham was an important decision for both personal and professional reasons. Nottingham offers a welcoming environment and a supportive research community that aligns with my scientific goals. It also allowed me to be closer to my husband, which has made the transition even more rewarding, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The best part of my job has to be the feeling that I’m contributing to something that could really make a difference in patients’ lives one day. I love the challenge of answering complex questions that have the potential to lead to practical applications, whether that’s in diagnostics, therapeutics, or just better understanding disease mechanisms. Plus, I’m lucky enough to be surrounded by fantastic scientists and I have a lovely, friendly network. Their support and enthusiasm make every challenge feel a bit more manageable and every success that much better!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">What are some of the challenging aspects of your current job?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the trickiest parts of my job is juggling all the different aspects of research. Between lab work, teaching, admin tasks, writing grant proposals, and publishing papers, it can feel like there’s a lot to keep track of! It’s definitely a challenge to stay focused on meaningful research while managing all the competing priorities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then there’s the added stress of working on temporary contracts. Not having the security of a permanent position can really weigh on you! Contract work can be tough, especially when you’re trying to plan long-term research projects or secure consistent funding. On top of that, balancing life commitments with the demands of an academic career can be overwhelming. It’s a constant juggling act, and sometimes it feels like personal responsibilities and career aspirations are pulling me in different directions. That uncertainty can make it hard to see a clear path to my future career goals!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience job?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Science is always challenging, no matter the role or field you’re in! Working with primary cell cultures can be particularly demanding, as the cells are often very sensitive and require careful handling. After investing weeks or even months in a particular experiment, it can be really disheartening when the experiment fails, or something goes wrong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m learning not to let these setbacks define my day or affect my mood too much, reminding myself that I’m more than just a failed experiment. Building resilience and staying focused on the bigger picture is something I’m actively trying to get better at, knowing that challenges are part of the process but don’t define me as a scientist.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>During my PhD, I was incredibly fortunate to be part of a lab surrounded by fantastic, inspiring female scientists who quickly became, not just my closest friends, but also my biggest supporters. We were led by a wonderful PhD supervisor, Professor Beth Coyle, who gave us the freedom to take ownership of our research. She pushed and supported us to reach our full potential, allowing us to shape our projects and grow as independent scientists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve also been very lucky to work with exceptional female mentors throughout my academic journey, especially within the UK EV community. Their scientific achievements are inspiring, but what really stands out to me is their dedication to mentoring younger scientists and fostering a supportive, welcoming environment. I admire their ability to balance thriving careers with personal lives, which is something I aspire to achieve myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A key part of my postdoc journey has been the constant support and guidance from my postdoc mentor, Dr Lesley Young. Her mentorship has been invaluable, helping me navigate the complexities of research while always offering encouragement and advice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On a more personal level, my mum and sister are two of my biggest supporters. Their unwavering encouragement and belief in me drive me to work hard and make them proud. They’re always there for me, and I’m endlessly inspired by their strength and love.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I hope to continue working in the EV field with a focus on translational research that directly benefits patients. In the next few years, I’d love to secure more funding for innovative projects, potentially becoming a principal investigator leading my own team. Supporting and mentoring the next generation of early career researchers is something I’m particularly passionate about, and I hope to create a nurturing environment where they can thrive and develop their careers. Ultimately, I aspire to become a professor and contribute to impactful work in both cancer biology and neuroscience.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dive into your scientific community early! Networking and finding mentors can make a huge difference in your career path. Don’t hesitate to reach out for guidance and surround yourself with supportive colleagues who inspire you. Remember, research can be really tough, but it’s also incredibly rewarding-so make sure to celebrate the highs along the way! Stay curious and persistent because the journey is full of ups and downs, and resilience is key. Embrace the challenges, and know that having a solid support network will help you navigate whatever comes your way!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;">What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need improving/addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in academia, particularly in STEM, is the lack of representation and mentorship for minority groups, including women, BAME individuals, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. It’s really important to have role models who understand the unique obstacles these groups face. We need to actively promote initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion in hiring and funding-after all, a more diverse academic environment benefits everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the societal expectations that still persist in academia can be incredibly discouraging for talented women. Juggling academic pressures with parenting responsibilities adds an extra layer of difficulty. It’s a tough balancing act, and many women feel they have to choose between their careers and their families. We need to create a culture where women don’t have to compromise their aspirations, where they can thrive both as researchers and as parents. By addressing these issues, we can help cultivate an academic environment that is not only more inclusive but also richer and more innovative.</p>

<p><em>Retraction Watch readers may have noticed an uptick of items in the <a href="http://eepurl.com/bNRlUn">RW Daily</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/weekend-reads/">Weekend Reads</a> about scientific integrity issues in Vietnam over the past year. Many of those items had their genesis, and were circulated, on a Facebook group that now has close to 100,000 members &#8212; and was recently removed temporarily by Facebook. We asked Van Tu Duong, a researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA, who founded the group, to tell us more about the history of the effort. This email interview has been lightly edited for flow and clarity. </em></p>



<p><strong>Tell us about this history of the group. Why did you find it, and when?</strong></p>



<span id="more-130300"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LiemChinhKhoaHoc">The group</a> was founded on September 1, 2020, in response to a<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/chieu-tro-de-truong-dai-hoc-duoc-xep-hang-quoc-te-185985588.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> series</a> of investigative<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/thanh-tich-ao-trong-nghien-cuu-khoa-hoc-chat-luong-bai-bao-quoc-te-den-dau-185988084.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> articles</a> published by Thanh Nien, a leading Vietnamese newspaper. These articles revealed<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/thanh-tich-ao-trong-nghien-cuu-khoa-hoc-185987431.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> deceptive practices</a> at Ton Duc Thang University (TDTU) and Duy Tan University (DTU), where foreign authors were paid<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/mua-ban-bai-bao-khoa-hoc-thi-truong-ngay-cang-soi-dong-185985589.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> substantial sums</a> to falsely affiliate with these institutions in their scientific publications. This<a href="https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20230517141406377"> scheme</a>, which persisted for<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.334.6061.1344"> over a decade</a>, allowed TDTU and DTU to artificially boost their research output and rankings, often surpassing Vietnam&#8217;s most prestigious universities.</p>



<p>The revelations sparked<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/thanh-tich-ao-trong-nghien-cuu-khoa-hoc-khong-nen-tang-thu-hang-mot-cach-gia-tao-185992125.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> significant</a><a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/mua-ban-bai-bao-khoa-hoc-tao-ra-tien-le-xau-185987432.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> debate</a> among scientists, university leaders, and the public. However, Thanh Nien faced backlash for allegedly attempting to discredit institutions that many viewed as sources of national pride due to their high international rankings. As a scientist invested in the Vietnamese academic community, I felt compelled to seek the truth, as neither side presented well-substantiated arguments. By analyzing prolific authors affiliated with TDTU and DTU, I discovered a network of<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/thanh-tich-ao-trong-nghien-cuu-khoa-hoc-cac-truong-dai-hoc-viet-nam-co-the-dang-bi-an-thit-185990171.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> hyper-prolific foreign authors</a> publishing extensively with varying affiliations and topics, some of whom appeared on<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/"> The Retraction Watch Leaderboard</a>.</p>



<p>I contributed an article to Thanh Nien, sharing data that illustrated the<a href="https://tuoitre-vn.translate.goog/cong-bo-quoc-te-cua-truong-dh-ton-duc-thang-70-tu-nguoi-ngoai-truong-20221026115102732.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> extent</a> of this<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/truong-dh-ton-duc-thang-chi-10-14-tu-hoc-phi-cho-cong-bo-quoc-te-1851513054.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> fraudulent activity</a>. I referred to these authors as &#8220;foreign invaders in science,&#8221; highlighting their role in<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/benh-thanh-tich-di-can-185988416.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> undermining scientific integrity</a>.

The group was formed on the day my article was published, initially named “Fighting Foreign Invaders in Science.” However, we later renamed it to reflect our broader focus on scientific integrity.</p>



<p><strong>Who runs the site now? Do you have any funding?</strong></p>



<p>The group is currently managed by a small team of volunteers, including myself, and operates without any funding. Our primary costs are not financial; rather, they involve the time, effort, and opportunities we dedicate to maintaining the group&#8217;s activities. Over the past four years, we have invested significant resources to keep the group active. While this effort could have been directed toward more profitable consulting work, we find fulfillment in our mission and the positive changes we are effecting.</p>



<p><strong>How many members are there? What kind of posts typically appear on the group?</strong></p>



<p>Since its inception, the group has experienced remarkable growth, increasing from fewer than 5,000 members in 2020 to nearly 100,000 prior to its recent disappearance. It has become a vital platform for discussions on scientific integrity, attracting leading scientists, scholars, students, and<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/can-xu-ly-nghiem-ung-vien-gs-pgs-gui-bai-dang-o-tap-chi-mao-danh-1851430948.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> institutional leaders</a> throughout Vietnam.</p>



<p>The discussions encompass a wide array of topics related to scientific integrity. In the past 60 days, the<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-GEzU5UeS7jcu3uZVL5UmftXxeFQ8pJITeqYE8StfuU/edit?usp=sharing"> most active discussions</a> have included general publishing, retractions, predatory publishing, and misconduct.</p>



<p><strong>What has the response of the scientific community in Vietnam and around the world been?</strong></p>



<p>The group is widely regarded as a valuable resource for promoting research integrity. Many utilize it to guide their research practices, educate students and junior researchers, and inform policy-making. However, some individuals—especially those criticized within the group—have attempted to discredit it, arguing that anonymity should be revoked and that discussions should avoid identifying individuals. Such criticisms echo those faced by platforms like<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/05/judge-rules-most-of-pubpeers-commenters-can-remain-anonymous/"> PubPeer</a>. Given that scientific publications are part of the public domain, we believe open discussions about them are essential.</p>



<p><strong>Describe some specific cases of the group&#8217;s impact.</strong></p>



<p>The group&#8217;s most significant contributions have been in raising awareness, enhancing knowledge, and influencing policies surrounding scientific integrity in Vietnam. We actively share information and perspectives that elevate awareness among both the scientific community and the general public regarding key issues, including<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/ro-thong-tin-ung-vien-xet-gs-pgs-2021-dang-bai-tren-tap-chi-gia-mao-1851430453.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> publishing</a><a href="https://tuoitre-vn.translate.goog/bai-bao-khoa-hoc-dang-tren-tap-chi-dom-duoc-thuong-tien-that-20221020223305165.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> practices</a>, university<a href="https://tiasang-com-vn.translate.goog/tin-tuc/khcn-viet-nam-nam-diem-nhan-nam-2021-28733/?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> rankings</a>,<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/sieu-nhan-lam-dich-vu-dang-bai-bao-de-tinh-diem-xet-gs-pgs-1851432083.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> misconduct</a>,<a href="https://congdankhuyenhoc-vn.translate.goog/de-xuat-ung-vien-giao-su-phai-co-cong-trinh-ung-dung-thuc-te-cac-nha-khoa-hoc-noi-gi-179230530135835607.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> research assessment</a>, and<a href="https://congdankhuyenhoc-vn.translate.goog/hieu-dung-ve-liem-chinh-hoc-thuat-trong-viec-mua-ban-cong-trinh-khoa-hoc-179231113092938992.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> ethical conduct</a>.</p>



<p>Here are some major policy changes our group has helped promote:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li><strong>2022–Present:</strong> Various higher education institutions have implemented academic integrity guidelines, including<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/noi-dau-tien-yeu-cau-khong-mua-ban-ket-qua-nghien-cuu-khoa-hoc-185231229163210112.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> prohibiting the sale of authorship</a> and ensuring accurate institutional affiliations in publications.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What is your &#8220;day job?&#8221; How does the group relate to that work?</strong></p>



<p>I am a senior researcher at Purdue University, College of Pharmacy, where I focus on innovative formulation strategies to enhance the stability, bioperformance, and manufacturability of drug products.</p>



<p>As a scientist, I frequently encounter issues related to research integrity, ethics, publishing, and research assessment—topics that are often discussed within our group. To stay informed, I regularly read and review literature, investigate scientific integrity issues, and share insights with the community. In turn, I learn a great deal from other members. This engagement has enriched my understanding, and I feel I have gained substantial knowledge in scientific integrity over the past four years.</p>



<p><strong>Facebook recently took down the site for several days. Do you know why?</strong></p>



<p>On October 23, 2024, the group was unexpectedly removed from Facebook without prior notice. No explanations were provided, and it appears likely that the removal was due to mass reporting.</p>



<p>I attempted to appeal the decision, but according to the Facebook Help Center, certain violations may not be eligible for appeal. This sudden action is particularly puzzling, given the group&#8217;s four-year history with minimal violation warnings.</p>



<p>We have reached out to Facebook representatives to seek clarification and explore options for reinstatement, as the group plays a crucial role in the Vietnamese scientific community. However, we have yet to receive a response. Leading<a href="https://tuoitre-vn.translate.goog/nhom-liem-chinh-khoa-hoc-bat-ngo-bien-mat-tren-facebook-20241026150654988.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> newspapers</a> in Vietnam have also<a href="https://thanhnien-vn.translate.goog/vi-sao-nhom-liem-chinh-khoa-hoc-bien-mat-tren-facebook-185241026181410382.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> reported</a> on the group&#8217;s disappearance.</p>



<p>Fortunately, on the morning of October 27, 2024, the group was<a href="https://tuoitre-vn.translate.goog/nhom-liem-chinh-khoa-hoc-tren-facebook-da-hoat-dong-tro-lai-202410272058012.htm?_x_tr_sl=vi&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp"> restored</a> without any notification from Facebook. We will continue to communicate with the platform to understand what happened and to prevent such incidents in the future.</p>



<p><strong>Given that experience, are you considering other options?</strong></p>



<p>Now that the group has been restored, we remain cognizant of the potential for future removals without warning. To safeguard our content and reduce reliance on Facebook, we are in the process of building a dedicated website to archive contents and create our own discussion platform.</p>



<p>Even if the group were to disappear again, we believe that the increased awareness and policy shifts regarding scientific integrity in Vietnam—changes significantly influenced by our group—are both undeniable and irreversible.</p>



<p>We recognize the group&#8217;s growing influence, which necessitates greater community oversight and accountability among those involved in its administration, moderation and advisory roles. At the same time, we are committed to preserving the group&#8217;s independence and maintaining its dynamic spirit.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-11.png"><img decoding="async" width="94" height="128" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130293"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mahdi Shariati</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Last year, a researcher at a U.S. university received an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Email-from-Shariati-redacted.pdf">email</a> offering what the subject line described as a “great opportunity to publish an article.”</p>



<p>The author of the email, <a href="https://archive.fo/Ohy3t">Mahdi Shariati</a>, an <a href="https://science.tdtu.edu.vn/en/resource/Experts">adjunct professor</a> of civil engineering at Ton Duc Thang University, in Vietnam, said he had read one of the researcher’s papers and was impressed by its quality. “It would be an honor for me to collaborate with you and jointly present your remarkable work,” Shariati added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In exchange, Shariati promised:</p>



<span id="more-130292"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>1. Guaranteed Publication: I can assure you that our collaborative research papers will be published in prestigious journals with high impact factors. This will ensure that your research receives the recognition and visibility it deserves.</p>



<p>2. Lifetime Citations: By partnering with me, your published papers will continue to receive citations, contributing to their enduring impact within the academic community. Given the reach of my work and its visibility among researchers in this field, this collaboration offers an opportunity for your research to be seen and referenced by a wide audience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/C-9626-2019">more than 12,000 citations</a> to his name, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, Shariati ranks among the most highly cited researchers in his field. He is <a href="https://archive.fo/WGLmT">a frequent referee</a> for journals from major publishers and this year has been a guest editor for both <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/page/lfn/collections/special-collections/assessment-of-low-frequency-noise-and-vibration-generated-by-construction-activities-in-urban-areas">Sage</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/special_issues/green_building">MDPI</a>.</p>



<p>But the researcher who received the offer to collaborate felt Shariati’s profile was “very suspicious.” According to <a href="https://archive.fo/Ohy3t">Shariati’s Google Scholar page</a>, he is affiliated with Anhui University of Technology in China, topping the list of <a href="https://www.adscientificindex.com/university/Anhui+University+of+Technology/">the institution&#8217;s most-cited researchers</a>, in addition to Ton Duc Thang, where he also features among <a href="https://duytan.edu.vn/news/NewsDetail.aspx?id=5377&amp;pid=2068&amp;lang=en-US">the top-ranked scientists</a>. Citation manipulation and other problematic publishing behavior have lately <a href="https://images2.thanhnien.vn/528068263637045248/2024/8/23/why-scientist-rankings-should-be-ignored-17243956025321145788380.pdf">come under scrutiny in Vietnam</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in several recent papers, Shariati lists his institution as UTE University in Quito, Ecuador. His <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahdi-shariati-49b3a013/?trk=opento_nprofile_details">LinkedIn profile</a> says he is based in Australia and is open to hybrid and remote work as a visiting researcher or professor.</p>



<p>We emailed Shariati to ask how he was able to guarantee publication and citations even before seeing the manuscripts he suggested coauthoring. We have not heard back.</p>



<p>According to our database, Shariati has earned <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dShariati%252c%2bMahdi">three retractions</a> for issues including duplicate publication, plagiarism, authorship manipulation and image manipulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PubPeer posts offer some clues to the engineer’s impressive publication metrics. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00366-020-01228-z#Bib1">A paper</a> in Springer Nature’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/366"><em>Engineering with Computers</em></a>, for instance, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7E01C0EA93EB8E4C153542CDA01DEA/#1">cited 61 works</a> by Shariati, according to a comment left by scientific sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Nick Wise</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wise noted authorship of the paper had been advertised prior to publication on the messaging platform Telegram and that Shariati had been a reviewer for <em>Engineering with Computers</em>.</p>



<p>Two other papers flagged on PubPeer also included questionable citations of Shariati’s work. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17455030.2021.1998729">One</a>, on using neural networks to diagnose disease from CT scans, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2AE1FE161AE2BA8E230CF4BDFAE2B/#1">referenced six articles by him on construction materials</a>. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00366-021-01455-y">Another</a>, on stability analysis of laminated microsystems, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C6B90F4C97697990128F536A05F1D1/#1">used a somewhat generic phrase to cite eight works</a> by the researcher.</p>



<p>Wise told us if Shariati’s email “is able to deliver on what it offers then it is very concerning. The only way that publication can be guaranteed is with a corrupt editor. Likewise, the only way that continual citation of a work can be guaranteed is by some artificial arrangement to persuade authors to cite the work.”</p>



<p>He added: “There are many other similar papers to the one I noted [on PubPeer] with dozens of references to Shariati each.”</p>



<p>Shariati’s email came from a domain associated with <a href="https://archive.fo/J060t">Calut Consulting</a>, an <a href="https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/bySearchId.jspx?searchIdType=BUSN&amp;searchId=656449071">Australian company</a> held by <a href="https://abr.business.gov.au/ABN/View?id=49656444263">Kavir Group</a> and <a href="https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.kavir_group_pty_ltd.6828d0a765c14233862f1f3e0933ae13.html#contact-anchor">headed by</a> Mojtaba Shariati. According to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mojtaba-shariati-015156166/">LinkedIn profile</a>, Mojtaba Shariati is also the CEO of Shariati Corporation, a construction firm in Iran. It is not clear if the two Shariatis are related.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calut <a href="https://archive.fo/a94LB">states on its website</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We assist with every stage of your publication process, from preparing your manuscript to selecting the appropriate journal, submitting your paper, and helping with revisions until it is successfully published.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company’s team includes “highly skilled researchers and professionals with diverse expertise across multiple disciplines: including environmental science, civil and mechanical engineering, artificial intelligence, and health sciences,” <a href="https://archive.fo/W7XyT">according to the website</a>.</p>



<p>Mahdi Shariati has coauthored at least <a href="https://www.gjesm.net/article_707739.html">one paper</a> with a researcher, Emad Toghroli, who lists his affiliation as “Department of Civil Engineering, Calut Company Holding, Melbourne, 800, Australia.” Mahdi Shariati also coauthored <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/17/7544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paper</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morteza-s-92b137169/?originalSubdomain=au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morteza Shariati</a>, who listed Monash University Malaysia and Kavir Company Holding as affiliations.</p>



<p>We sought comment from Calut Consulting, but have not heard back.</p>



<p>The academic who shared Shariati’s email with us said the message “seems to be a template where he only changes [the recipients’] names and the” titles of the papers he said had impressed him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our source requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, explaining, “If a person X in a citation/peer review cartel finds out a given researcher Y has exposed him/her, then X will use the cartel to cancel all of us (my colleagues and I). The network of X, in this case, is massive.”</p>

<p>The Declaration of Helsinki on ethical principles for research involving human participants now includes a statement on scientific integrity and research misconduct. </p>



<p>Adopted in 1964 by the World Medical Association, the Declaration of Helsinki was conceived in response to the atrocities committed during World War 2 in the name of medical research on human subjects. The initial document – which has been updated many times over the last 60 years – included five key principles, including the primacy of informed consent, the need for a rigorous calculation of risks and benefits for a given study, and a consideration of the scientific value of a given study – that is, the experiment should be valuable to science <em>and</em> to the subjects involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the recent process of revising <a href="https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki/">the declaration</a>, the World Medical Association added the following two sentences to the “general principles” section of the document:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130286"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Scientiﬁc integrity is essential in the conduct of medical research involving human participants. Involved individuals, teams, and organizations must never engage in research misconduct.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The additions about scientific integrity and research misconduct were not in response to any particular event,” <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2825289">Jack Resneck</a>, chair of the revision workgroup and a dermatologist at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, told Retraction Watch, “but clearly these issues are at the core of ethical conduct of medical research.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the <a href="https://www.wma.net/news-post/revised-declaration-of-helsinki-adopted-by-the-global-medical-community-strengthening-ethical-standards-in-clinical-research-involving-humans/">revision process</a>, the World Medical Association received several public comments noting the previous version of the declaration didn’t mention scientific integrity or research misconduct, Resneck said. The workgroup agreed language on those issues should be added, and did so in paragraph 12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Including research integrity in the canonical version of the famous Declaration of Helsinki is a significant step forward,” Matthias Wjst, a former epidemiology professor at Technical University Munich and group leader at Helmholtz Center Munich, told us. The new language increases the responsibility of institutions for ensuring the integrity of research involving human participants, he said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>From my understanding, the new paragraph 12 emphasizes that proper management and reporting of research results are not just the responsibility of individual researchers, but also of their teams and organizations. Failing to do so could make them part of an organized system of research misconduct.</p>



<p>Rather than focusing solely on securing research funds and accumulating impact points, research organizations such as universities and clinics must invest much more in oversight and safeguards that can detect misconduct at an early stage. Currently, ethical committees review only research proposals and informed consent forms. I believe that under paragraph 12, they will need to take a more proactive role, offering additional supervision and training for clinical trials.</p>



<p>At present, the discovery of misconduct is mostly reliant on individuals with limited authority. There is no major funding initiative, no large-scale association, no formalized training, and only a few publishers even have designated contact persons. Frequently, clear cases of misconduct are overlooked. Science policy, therefore, has considerable work ahead.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2825286">commentary</a> on the revisions, Andreas Alois Reis, of the World Health Organization’s Health Ethics &amp; Governance unit, and two colleagues from Canada and South Africa called the new paragraph a “welcome addition.” They wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Declaration places new emphasis on the ethical responsibilities of researchers and institutions by focusing on research integrity and scientifically sound and rigorous design. In light of increasing concerns about retracted studies, plagiarism, generative artificial intelligence (AI), unreproducible results, and concerns with the quality of publishing venues, the new paragraph on scientific integrity and research misconduct is a welcome addition. These unfortunate trends reinforce the fragility of the research ecosystem and highlight the central importance of increasing attention to research integrity in the training of researchers. Because research is a largely unregulated and self-policing practice, academic institutions will need to ensure that all researchers are well prepared for the new realities of the contemporary scientific world and the significant pressures investigators face in a highly competitive landscape.</p>

<p>Citing <em>eLife</em>’s unusual practice of publishing articles without accepting or rejecting them, Clarivate says it is re-evaluating the inclusion of the open-access biology journal in Web of Science, its influential database of abstracts and citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">other journals</a> recently placed on hold from indexing, including Elsevier’s <em>Science of the Total Environment</em>, Clarivate has cited a <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/webofscience-platform/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-policies-category-change-requests-and-appeals-process/#coverageofjournals">specific policy</a> as the reason for re-evaluating <em>eLife</em>: “Coverage of journals/platforms in which publication is decoupled from validation by peer review.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Clarivate spokesperson described the policy as applying to “journals that do not make an editorial decision to accept or reject based on peer reviewers’ comments.”</p>



<span id="more-130273"></span>



<p><em>eLife</em> last year adopted a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/about/peer-review">new model</a> in which it publishes every manuscript its editors send out for review, along with the text of the reviews and an editor’s <a href="https://elifesciences.org/about/elife-assessments">assessment</a> of the significance of the findings in the paper and the strength of the evidence presented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Damian Pattinson, <em>eLife</em>’s executive director, described Clarivate’s decision to re-evaluate the journal due to its new model as “a real overreach,” and expressed concern about Web of Science’s “dominance” in the publishing industry. “It’s not for them to decide the rules of publishing,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The issue comes down to what they define as ‘validated,’” Pattinson told us. “We believe all papers we publish are validated by peer review,” he said, because they undergo a “very rigorous” review and evaluation process that is “deliberately transparent and open.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>eLife</em> sees its process as a “huge improvement” on a publishing system that’s otherwise a “black box” about the quality of review a paper has received, Pattinson said. “It is a bit disheartening they seem to be working to maintain this existing very opaque system,” he said of Clarivate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Clarivate spokesperson indicated Web of Science might index some <em>eLife</em> papers but not others:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In these cases, we will only evaluate and index – assuming our standard <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/webofscience-platform/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">quality criteria</a> are met – the subset of published content that peer reviewers have deemed to pass a ‘sound science’ threshold. We will exclude content where peer review indicates shortcomings in methodology or other reasons to doubt the validity of the published results or conclusions. In the case of eLife, we will consider content that has ‘strength of evidence’ described by the journal as ‘Solid’, ‘Convincing’, ‘Compelling’ or ‘Exceptional’ but exclude ‘Incomplete’ or ‘Inadequate’.</p>



<p>Continuing cover-to-cover indexing of eLife&nbsp; would mean indexing content that is ‘Incomplete’ or ‘Inadequate’ and risks allowing untrustworthy actors to benefit from publishing poor quality content, and conflicts with our <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/webofscience-platform/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-policies-category-change-requests-and-appeals-process/#removal">standard policy</a> to reject/remove journals that fail to put effective measures in place to prevent the publication of compromised content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our policy to allow only partial indexing of journals that de-couple publication from peer review reflects our commitment to support the integrity of the scholarly record through curation and selectivity in the Web of Science. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/16afe6ec/update-on-elife-s-indexing-status-at-web-of-science">statement</a> posted to its website, <em>eLife</em> said it “never wanted” an Impact Factor. The statement continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Publication alone is a poor signal and measure of validity. A journal name or its Impact Factor says little about the quality of any individual research article. Instead we created a model that reviews, assesses and directly engages with research without the need for proxies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pattinson acknowledged the value of indexing and its importance for authors. <em>eLife</em> has been discussing its model with Clarivate for a while, he said, and will talk with its partners and funders about how to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last month, Clarivate placed <em>Cureus</em> and <em>Heliyon</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">on hold</a> to re-evaluate whether they meet its <a href="https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/webofscience-platform/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/">quality criteria</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-the-total-environment"><em>Science of the Total Environment</em></a>, an Elsevier title, was also recently placed on hold. A pop-up message on its listing on <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/home">Clarivate’s website</a> states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been raised about the quality of the content published in this journal. The journal is being re-evaluated according to our selection criteria; new content will not be indexed during the course of the re-evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If Clarivate decides an “on hold” journal does meet its quality criteria after re-evaluation, it will index any missing content. Clarivate declined to provide a list of journals currently on hold, “as these are temporary statuses and do not represent a decision or conclusion by the editorial team on the coverage of the journal,” according to a spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There has been no shift in strategy,” the spokesperson said, in response to our question about Web of Science re-evaluating major journals. They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As with <em>Science of the Total Environment</em> and other journals recently placed On Hold, we continue to proactively monitor changes in journal behavior, consider community feedback and periodically re-evaluate journals to ensure they continue to meet our quality criteria. If valid concerns arise regarding an indexed journal – either through internal monitoring by our AI tools and/or in-house editors, and/or external feedback – the journal will be re-evaluated according to our quality criteria. During this period, new content will not be processed for indexing and an ‘On Hold’ notice will be placed on the <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/home">Master Journal List</a> for transparency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier confirmed Clarivate had placed <em>Science of the Total Environment</em> on hold for re-evaluation. The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics Centre of Expertise in STMJ is conducting in-depth investigations. These investigations are reviewing potential breaches of Science of the Total Environment’s publishing policies and are being carried out in accordance with Elsevier&#8217;s policies and the principles of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). </p>



<p>We are addressing the concerns raised during the investigation and, in parallel, we are working with Clarivate to aid in their re-evaluation. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides the journals placed on hold, this month’s update to Web of Science kicked off 11 titles, including Springer Nature’s <em>Multimedia Tools and Applications</em> and <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>. The latter journal has been retracting articles en masse this year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/22/sleuths-spur-cleanup-at-journal-with-nearly-140-retractions-and-counting/">as we previously reported</a>, and did not receive an Impact Factor when Clarivate <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">released new numbers</a> in June. Springer Nature did not respond to our request for comment by the time of publication.</p>



<p>Clarivate also delisted <em>Minerva Pediatrics</em>, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/25/a-proper-editor-would-be-horrified-why-did-a-pediatric-journal-publish-articles-on-the-elderly/">we reported in July</a> had published several out-of-scope articles about “elderly” patients. The publisher did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p>

                <p>A cancer researcher at the University of Cambridge in the UK has retracted a paper from <em>Cell</em> after commenters on PubPeer questioned aspects of 10 images in the article.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/steve-jackson.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="605" height="400" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/steve-jackson.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-90011" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/steve-jackson.jpg 605w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/steve-jackson-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Jackson</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Though an institutional investigation found the figures were “not reliable,” another of the authors objected to the retraction as “an overreaction.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.stevejacksonlab.org/steve-jackson">Steve Jackson</a>, the University of Cambridge biology professor and lab leader, previously <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dJackson%252c%2bStephen%2bP">retracted two papers</a> – including one in <em>Nature</em> and one in <em>Science</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/04/11/authors-have-papers-in-nature-and-science-retracted-on-the-same-day/">posted on the same day</a> – after a Cambridge investigation found a co-author, Abderrahmane Kaidi, had falsified data. </p>



<span id="more-130268"></span>



<p>Kaidi is not a co-author on the <em>Cell</em> paper, “<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)01038-X">hnRNP K: An HDM2 Target and Transcriptional Coactivator of p53 in Response to DNA Damage</a>,” which appeared in 2005. The article has been cited more than 300 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jackson requested the retraction, according to the <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01156-5">notice</a>, published October 9. It stated:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We, the authors, have become aware of various duplications and strong similarities between images in the following figure panels: 1E, 1F, 3A, 4A, 4B, 4D, 4E, 6B, 7A, and 7B. These issues occur in both control data and in experimental data. Unfortunately, we no longer have access to the original results from the 2005 study and are therefore unable to ascertain how these issues arose. As these issues impact confidence in the paper’s conclusions, we are retracting the paper. We sincerely apologize to the scientific community for any inconvenience and confusion that we have caused.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Commenters on PubPeer had identified similarities in all of the figure panels mentioned in the retraction notice as early as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/5E558FEF86ADED8E186DF6F71576D9#1">March 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the notice, the authors also wrote: “none of the issues that we have become aware of relate to experiments carried out at KuDOS Pharmaceuticals, Ltd,” one of a few startups Jackson has founded based on his research. AstraZeneca in 2006 acquired KuDOS, which developed the cancer drug Lynparza, approved for sales and marketing in the US and EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Cell Press said the publisher had no comment beyond the retraction notice. We reached out to Jackson for comment and received the following statement from a spokesperson for the University of Cambridge:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Professor Sir Steve Jackson was made aware of irregularities in figures in the Moumen et al. (2005) Cell paper, on which he is a co-author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Cambridge, with Professor Jackson’s full cooperation, investigated this matter and concluded that these figures are not reliable. The University found no evidence of wrongdoing by Professor Jackson.</p>



<p>Following this process, Professor Jackson contacted the Editor of Cell and has requested to retract the article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first author, Abdeladim Moumen, “declined to sign this retraction,” according to the notice. Moumen is a research director at the Moroccan Foundation for Advanced Science, Innovation and Research in Rabat, and founded a diagnostics startup of which he is chief scientific officer, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdeladim-moumen-49a41a60/?locale=en_US">his LinkedIn profile</a>.&nbsp; Images in some of Moumen’s other papers have been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22abdeladim+moumen%22">flagged on PubPeer</a>, as reported by <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2021/04/01/steve-jackson-and-the-moumen-troll/">For Better Science</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moumen provided a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moumen-Response-to-retraction-watch.docx.pdf">detailed defense</a> of the paper in response to our request for comment, and told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A thorough investigation conducted by the University of Cambridge concluded that no misconduct was established on my part or by any of the authors. The criticism leading to the retraction request was based solely on image comparison, alleging similarities between bands. However, these were most likely unintended errors during image assembly or paper editing. In fact, most of the criticized images involved tubulin controls, which could easily be redone without any fabrication. Thus, there was no incentive or need to manipulate these images.</p>



<p>It feels deeply unfair to retract a paper that presented original, reproducible findings over minor image issues that did not affect the scientific conclusions. In similar cases, when image concerns arise, authors are often asked to reproduce the experiments, which are then published online as corrections. In our case, the key findings have already been independently confirmed by other groups, which highlights the robustness and originality of our work.</p>



<p>I feel unfairly targeted by the retraction process and believe this situation has not been handled justly. Given the importance and impact of our work, I see this retraction as an overreaction to what are ultimately correctable mistakes.</p>

<p>The sudden death of a 27-year-old woman in the Romania offices of MDPI, a major open-access publisher with a worldwide presence, has grabbed national headlines and raised questions about the conditions under which the firm’s employees work.</p>



<p>Local <a href="https://observatornews.ro/fii-observator/o-tanara-de-27-de-ani-a-facut-infarct-si-a-murit-la-birou-lesinase-mai-devreme-dar-nu-a-fost-lasata-sa-plece-595469.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFuIeBleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHS6Qsypdkw_C_bmhiHRCqQX1n_C7lb01IRnhTInaj3Bmo_zpwU9gfM6qdw_aem_BUWWsD8nCHuAUw5VU_vlkw">news</a> <a href="https://www.stiripesurse.ro/caz-revoltator-in-bucuresti-o-tanara-de-27-de-ani-a-facut-infarct-la-serviciu-si-a-murit-i-s-a-facut-rau-dar-sefii-nu-au-lasat-o-sa-plece-acasa_3452867.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFuId1leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHYvO3U8JtS96sHgfqsMd88cBb1dEFFeJ1PYgodKsWZYyoRchEBiVwHj3Iw_aem_CwUkIVDlWhLHW9sXubx_sQ">reports</a> said the woman had initially fainted in MDPI’s Bucharest office on Friday, October 4, but that her superiors refused to call an ambulance or let her go home after she revived. She later collapsed again and died from a heart attack after efforts to resuscitate her failed, according to the reports.</p>



<p>A business consultant in Romania also wrote about the case in a blog post, quoting emails from anonymous MDPI employees describing <a href="https://dorusupeala.ro/infarct-la-birou-moartea-rapeste-din-nou-o-tanara-angajata-dezvaluirile-angajatilor-mdpi-acuza-grav-managerii/">a “toxic” work environment and “constant pressures” to perform</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in an interview with Retraction Watch, a colleague of the deceased woman, <a href="https://www.mediafax.ro/comunicate/comunicat-mdpi-pierderea-tragica-a-colegei-noastre-22508151">identified as Maria Alexandra Anghel</a>, contested the media’s account of events.</p>



<span id="more-130262"></span>



<p>According to the source, a member of MDPI’s editorial staff in Bucharest, only a few minutes passed between the first and second time Anghel fainted. To the source’s knowledge, no one had tried to prevent her from going home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The media reports, I think, are a bit exaggerated,” said the source, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation (their identity is known to us).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the editorial worker called the blog post’s description of the many workplace problems “spot on.” They highlighted an extreme culture of performance focused on quantity rather than quality, frequent culture clashes with managers in China and micromanagement “on another level.” (A day after we contacted the firm for comment about the workplace conditions, MDPI adjusted its performance targets for employees.)&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In a statement about Anghel’s death, MDPI offered condolences and said it was cooperating with authorities investigating the “circumstances surrounding this tragic incident.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Out of respect for Alexandra&#8217;s family and loved ones, we are not providing further details at this time,” the publisher said. ”We will share more information once the investigation is complete.“</p>



<p>MDPI CEO Stefan Tochev did not respond directly to the accusations in the media or the allegations our sources made. He told us in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Stefan-Tochev-email.pdf">an email</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Many colleagues in our Romania offices have expressed that the media and blog speculation surrounding this situation has been deeply traumatizing. As a priority, we have focused on providing grief counseling and immediate support to our teams, offering time away and work-from-home options to help them during this difficult time. We continuously review our processes and operations, and employee safety remains a top priority for us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tochev added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Linking this tragic event to working practices would be completely inappropriate without you having the facts or formal information. An independent investigation is ongoing, and our top priority remains supporting Alexandra’s family and our colleagues.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">MDPI <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/anniversary25/history">was founded</a> in 1996 in Basel, Switzerland, by the Chinese chemist Shu-Kun Lin, who remains <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shu-kun-lin-mdpi-9053542a/?originalSubdomain=ch">president of the company</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/board">chairman of its board</a>. A <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2020/08/10/guest-post-mdpis-remarkable-growth/">fast-growing</a> open-access publisher with <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2309/2309.15884.pdf">speedy review timelines</a> and a <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/03/30/guest-post-of-special-issues-and-journal-purges/">plethora of special issues</a>, the firm has faced questions about the quality of its papers. Some of its journals have been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/28/finland-group-downgrades-60-journals/">downgraded in influential rating systems</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/02/exclusive-mdpi-journal-undergoing-reevaluation-at-scopus-indexing-on-hold/">reevaluated</a> or <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fast-growing-open-access-journals-stripped-coveted-impact-factors">removed</a> from indexing services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Performance metrics for editorial staffers prioritize the quantity of published manuscripts over their quality, our source in Bucharest said. Editors get one performance point for every published manuscript they handle, but only half of a point for rejecting a manuscript. Staffers who reach a certain number of points get a monthly bonus. Assistant editors, for instance, had a target of 15 points per month until Oct. 22, 2024, the day after we emailed MDPI the allegations in this story, when the number was lowered to 12, according to our source.</p>



<p>“It kind of incentivizes us to push towards publication instead of rejection,” the source said. “They say they want quality. They never want quality, they just want quantity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For editors who manage special issues, the target is to send out 40 to 50 email invitations to potential guest editors every week, the employee added. “The way they operate the special issues is again quantity over quality.”</p>



<p>The source expressed concern for how the performance culture affects the scientific enterprise. “It&#8217;s not really scientific what we do,” they said. “It&#8217;s just money printing, pretty much.”</p>



<p>An employee at MDPI’s other Romania office, in the city of Cluj-Napoca, echoed this description.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In this company we are treated as a number,” said the employee in an email translated from Romanian. “Either you perform and bring profits to the company, or it&#8217;s more convenient to leave.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source described having been asked to work during time off because the local group leader worried about losing money. “The group leaders do not receive their bonus during our days off,” the source told us. (We confirmed the source works at MDPI’s office in Cluj-Napoca, but they would not share details allowing full identification given the potential legal repercussions of violating the non-disclosure agreement MDPI makes employees sign. The information this source provided was consistent with what the Bucharest source told us.)</p>



<p>Tochev told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While some individuals may use this opportunity to voice frustration, something we understand and respect, it’s important to note that their views may not reflect the reality or opinion of the majority of our staff, management, or operational practices.</p>



<p>At MDPI, employees are encouraged to maintain both quality and efficiency in their work. Decisions on which papers are accepted for publication are made solely by independent Academic Editors, scholars in the field, and not by MDPI staff.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Bucharest staffer acknowledged the decision to publish belonged to the academic editor, with support from reviewers, but said the in-house assistant editor at MDPI “is the one who chooses all of them.” The source added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When inviting reviewers you see that some are more prone to reject than others. We always get told to avoid reviewers that have a lot of reject decisions in the past.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The two MDPI employees both described “constant” micromanagement from managers based in China. At the very beginning of the workday in Romania, or even before it starts, managers in China send messages on the Microsoft Teams platform with specific tasks, or checking on the status of manuscripts, the sources said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If an employee doesn’t have time to do a task one day, the next day managers will ask why, the Bucharest staffer said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Managers in China also compile reports of “mistakes” employees have made over the past few months, according to the source in Cluj-Napoca. Then, they summon the employee to a meeting “where you have to explain to them why you made those mistakes 6 months ago with some manuscripts that you don&#8217;t even remember.”</p>



<p>The reports are one of a number of tactics MDPI allegedly uses to target low-performing employees. According to our sources, the publisher last year launched a system to monitor performance and put staffers with an unsatisfactory output under observation unless they agree to resign “by mutual consent.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Most employees get intimidated and put into observation period just to force them to resign,” the Bucharest staffer told us in an email, adding that “this comes with a lot of ‘sabotage’ from the Chinese colleagues.” Examples of sabotage include delayed response times from colleagues in China, leading targeted employees to miss important deadlines, and being assigned subpar manuscripts that are likely to get rejected, yielding fewer performance points and thus creating a vicious circle, the sources explained.</p>



<p>Both said they believed Anghel was under observation by her managers when she died, or had been previously. “As far as I know, Alexandra was put under observation multiple times,” the Bucharest staffer told us.</p>



<p>The Cluj-Napoca employee also described surprise visits from Chinese colleagues who would work 10-hour days, getting up from their chairs only for lunch or meetings and using the bathroom only during lunch breaks. The unannounced visitors would “often hide when they&#8217;re on social media or texting relatives,” according to the source, and would take pictures of their Romanian colleagues chatting to each other or relaxing on beanbag chairs provided by the company.</p>



<p>“I believe [MDPI’s] unethical practices and the publication of low-quality manuscripts for financial gain pose a significant threat to the academic community,” the Cluj-Napoca employee told us. “While I am certainly frustrated with their practices, my primary concern is the potential impact on academic progress. Additionally, the company has exhibited abusive and controlling behavior toward its employees, which needs to be addressed.”</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>At a time when scientists and scientific research are already being criticised by persons who identify science with technology and who deplore some of the consequences of technology, dishonesty among scientists causes unease among scientists themselves and regretful or gleeful misgivings among publicists who are critical of science.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p><em>Daryl Chubin wrote that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01099941">in 1985</a> &#8212; a time when institutions we now take for granted, like the U.S. Office of Research Integrity, did not yet exist. We asked him to reflect on what has happened in the intervening four decades.</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The phrase “misconduct in research” today is a quaint reminder of how much science has been captured by for-profit, politicized, international interests. As a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01099941">four-decades-removed</a> social researcher of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/690053">misconduct</a>, I marvel at how an investigation industry has emerged to monitor, analyze, report and decry the mischief around us. This “watcher community” represents an industry in an era of science most of us never envisioned.</p>



<p>In the days before the Office of Research Integrity, many accused researchers and their academic institutions were grasping for an accountability structure that was fair to all parties — adhering to due process – and swift in its resolutions. Good luck!&nbsp; Today, the headlines in <em>Retraction Watch </em>reflect a publishing industry seemingly under siege—awash in retractions, plagiarism, AI mischief, undeclared conflicts of interest, whistleblowing, and a subset of ills that are dizzying and disconcerting to degrees never seen before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch monitors an industry ever more self-conscious about misdeeds in research, from analysis to interpretation to reporting. By setting the threshold low, it focuses on misdeeds that may be rare in a particular field, but substantial when aggregated across fields. Yes, there is a risk of overgeneralizing from statistical anomalies, but readers care about violations that sully &#8220;their&#8221; field.</p>



<span id="more-130249"></span>



<p>Within this environment of deceit and suspicion, I worry about besieged editors and the effect on collegial relations between known and unknown authors and reviewers. I despair for a peer review system sagging under the weight of uncompensated labor, unrealistic deadlines, and the ever-higher stakes of publication-dependent outcomes such as sustained funding and tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the current AI-drenched landscape, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2023.2243814">some &#8212; such as Bruce Macfarlane &#8212; argue</a> the traditional meaning of originality and priority (enshrined in <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo28451565.html">Merton’s 1942 idealized norms of science</a>) has been displaced by a new ethos of institutional norms focused on egoism, capitalism and advocacy. Hence the elevation of findings deemed clinically-robust and bankable.</p>



<p>Within this rhetorical context, open-access publishing has traded originality for affordability. Such publication “opportunities” have disadvantaged many younger scientists/scholars and those at institutions without the wherewithal and infrastructure to contribute and compete. Then there are the now-exacerbated normal biases — unconscious and conscious — that can favor article rejection over acceptance while subordinating science content to assumed author attributes (gender, race, academic pedigree). The stakes have never been higher.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As a policy practitioner would say, the “unintended consequences” of publishing now haunt the scientific landscape. From the perspective of an observer, not the participant, I offer the watcher community some prescriptions (and a few questions) without solutions (or answers):&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Research should not be a policed activity. A policy that permutes practice can regulate or undermine it. Is the trust-based publication honor system–perhaps always a fiction–now eclipsed by extrinsic interests or actually subverted by profit motives?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Journals should be dissemination devices — depositing information, data and interpretation — that, in the process, bestow credit (and sometimes blame, issuing retractions stating malfeasance by authors). Journals were not created to be gamed or treated as a resource for trading, buying or selling. Owners, however, will often try to gain some form of advantage.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Publication metrics should capture quantitatively what a community values. Are citation counts and a 20+ h-index the best we can do? Can those numbers be evaluated without knowledge of individual and community contexts?&nbsp; What, then, is qualitatively valued: English-language articles, authors sponsored by Fortune 500 companies, sustainability of a field?</li>



<li>The frequency of scandals of fabrication and misappropriation should be statistically insignificant. But the magnitude of these relatively few misdeeds can have profound real-world consequences for careers, funding, perceptions and confidence in “scientific progress.”</li>



<li>Peer review should be recognized as service to the community. Reviewers who are specialists in the field soliciting their reviews serve as a proxy for community standards evolving, yet validating. Some of the best analysis is done in this behind-the-scenes role, yet it remains largely unrewarded. Without this specialized knowledge, reviewers lacking subject expertise are perpetrating fraud.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Anonymity protects the identity of both the innocent and the guilty. It can preserve or dilute candor — reinforce, distort or calcify prevailing community judgment. If participants in the publishing industry differ on the value of anonymity, what other values should be compromised or honored? More experiments are needed to examine the marriage of ethics to practice.</li>



<li>Policy encompasses at least a triad of stakeholders: the publishers who own the journals; the editors who steward the journals; the federal agencies whose funding both enables authors and regulates their misbehavior. The triad too often appears to compete against each other than to collaborate. Shared objectives for the enterprise are elusive. How can policymakers broker more constructive relationships?</li>



<li>The watcher community should be mindful of both “lab culture” and the individual aspirations of researchers. What motivates watchers’ behavior—documenting dimensions of misconduct, establishing accountability for those accused, and promulgating rules for adaptation by various research communities? Can watchers serve as honest brokers, or must they inevitably become partisan by virtue of investing in the publication industry?</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-drop-cap">These reflections derive from nearly a half-century of my own publishing, editing, and reviewing. I may be naive, unrealistic, and locked in an earlier era. Just as Merton’s norms afforded 20th century scientists with a rhetorical device to portray their research behavior as lofty and merit-based, Macfarlane’s formulation stresses the darker underbelly of scientists’ competition and avarice in the 21st. Both capture kernels of truth. Deceit and fallibility are&nbsp; manifested in publications as opportunities and situational pressures mount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, science needs a policy analysis that transcends any one research field or model of publication. My reflections here pose fundamental issues of purpose: what is publishing for, what do producers and consumers of knowledge hold to be sacrosanct, and what do they consider fundamental behavior for advancement of their field ? No doubt some of these questions are ongoing topics of debate in various communities, countries, and journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can the watcher community — which should include you and me — do more than better report the perversions of scientific publication? Indeed, how can watchers meet the moment and increase the promotion of better practices?</p>
