                The cerebellum is responsible for far more than coordinating movement. New techniques reveal that it is, in fact, a hub of sensory and emotional processing in the brain.

<p>An official journal of the Japanese government has retracted a 2021 paper over concerns about misconduct in the work, which was performed in a national research center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/foodsafetyfscj/12/1/12_D-24-00004/_article#article-overiew-abstract-wrap">retraction notice</a> for the paper, titled “Development and Evaluation of Fluorescence Immunochomatography for Rapid and Sensitive Detection of Thermophilic Campylobacter”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Food Safety decided to retract this article in which the primary author misconducted as reported from the primary author’s affiliation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Far more details are available in <a href="https://www.nihs.go.jp/oshirasejoho/Press-Release/20231226/index.html">materials published last December</a> by Japan’s National Institute of Health Sciences, where the first author of the article, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiroshi-asakura-84216350">Hiroshi Asakura</a>, is chief researcher. According to a <a href="https://www.nihs.go.jp/oshirasejoho/Press-Release/20231226/index.html">press release</a> dated Dec. 26, 2023: </p>



<span id="more-129027"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As a result of the investigation, it was found that the description of the specimen used in the Campylobacter quantitative test and the test results in the paper differed from the research content that was considered to be the original data of the paper. It was determined that the fabrication and falsification of papers (specified misconduct) occurred due to a gross neglect of the duty of care. …<br><em><br></em>An external investigation committee consisting of external experts was established to conduct an investigation. As a result of the investigation, it was determined that during the examination by the ISO/IEC 17025 accredited examination body, the department manager had fabricated, falsified and forged some examination materials, and had given false explanations based on these. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here are the Institute’s reports:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nihs.go.jp/oshirasejoho/Press-Release/20231226/20231226_02.pdf">Regarding responses to misconduct in research activities and inappropriate conduct in response to ISO/IEC 17025 certification review</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.nihs.go.jp/oshirasejoho/Press-Release/20231226/20231226_03.pdf">Investigation results report regarding misconduct in research activities</a></li>

<p>Neither Asakura nor the editor of the journal – which is  an official title of the Japanese government’s Food Safety Commission – responded to our requests for comments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/03/six-years-of-open-science-indicators-data/">Six years of Open Science Indicators data</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Q1 2024 (March) <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">PLOS Open Science Indicators (OSI) results</a> shows that rates of data repository use and code sharing in PLOS articles reached new highs in 2023, while preprint adoption has plateaued since the pandemic. This latest data release includes six years of OSI data.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">Download the data</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="958" height="556" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/6-years-of-OSI-data.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22308" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/6-years-of-OSI-data.png 958w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/6-years-of-OSI-data-300x174.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/6-years-of-OSI-data-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px"></figure>



<p><strong><em>Figure</em></strong><em>: Open Science Indicators for PLOS content (solid line) and comparator data (dotted line) by publication quarter 2018-2023.</em></p>



<p>The latest OSI dataset, produced in partnership with DataSeer, includes all 107,719 PLOS research articles published between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2023, and a smaller comparator corpus (21,991 of articles). For PLOS articles the latest results show:</p>



<ul><li>The rate of data repository use reached a new high of 31% in Q4 2024 (up from 30% in Q3), and an annual high of 29% in 2023 overall (28% in 2022)</li><li>The rate of code sharing was 16% (compared to 17% in Q3), and reached a yearly high of 16% overall (15% in 2022)</li><li>The rate of preprint sharing fell to 24% (compared to 25% in Q3), and was 24% for 2023 overall (24% in 2022)</li></ul>



<p>For comparator articles however, preprint adoption continued to rise in 2023, reaching 31% in Q4 2023. The difference between comparators and PLOS is mainly driven by the use of the Research Square platform by articles published in Springer Nature journals, and the use of Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) preprints by JMIR articles.</p>



<p><strong>Recent and up-coming OSI developments</strong></p>



<p>PLOS and DataSeer, and other &ldquo;solution providers&rdquo;, are collaborating with the UK Reproducibility Network on several Open Research Indicator pilots with UK institutions. See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1M-hAZEzAY">recent UKRN webinar</a> for an update on these pilots. We, also, recently <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/03/collaboratively-seeking-better-solutions-for-monitoring-open-science/">shared the results</a> of research involving research funders and institutions, where we sought to understand how they are, or are planning, to monitor Open Science (Research) practices in their contexts &ndash; and inform future OSI development.</p>



<p>The OSI dataset continues to be reused or cited by researchers and organizations outside of PLOS, including in a <a href="https://cca-reports.ca/reports/international-science-and-technology-partnerships/">report by the Council of Canadian Academies</a> in February 2024. Furthermore, an editorial in <em>PLOS Biology</em> that used OSI to understand the adoption of OS practices by its authors and set goals for 2024, has been included in the <a href="https://sfdora.org/resource/supporting-open-science-at-plos-biology/">Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) resource library</a> &ndash; a collection of materials to facilitate the development of responsible research and researcher assessment policies and practices.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the fifth OSI, for measuring the prevalence of study registration (preregistration), is being prepared for a preliminary release in the next &ndash; June 2024 &ndash; public data release.</p>



<p>Finally, watch this space for results of a new study that uses OSI to explore the effects, or impact, of Open Science practices on articles that exhibit one or more OSIs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2024/03/26/three-recent-interesting-papers-on-computational-neuroscience/">Three recent interesting papers on computational neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                <p>Here are a few recent papers from the field of computational and theoretical neuroscience that I think are worth the time to read them. All of them are close to what I have been working on or what I am planning to work on in the future, but there is not tight connection among them.</p>



<p><strong>The Neuron as a Direct Data-Driven Controller</strong></p>



<p>In their preprint, Moore et al. (2024) provide an interesting perspective on how to think about neurons: rather than input-output devices, neurons are described as control units. In their framework, these neuronal control units receive input as feedback about their own output in a feedback loop which may involve the environment. In turn, the neurons try to control this feedback loop by adapting their output according to a neuron-specific objective function. To use the authors’ words, this scheme is “enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their control via synaptic feedback”.</p>



<p>These are ideas that have been fascinating for me since quite some time. For example, I have described similar ideas about the single-neuron perspective and the objective function of single neurons <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/">in a previous blog post</a>. The work of Moore et al. (2024) is an interesting new perspective, not only because it clearly states the main ideas of their approach, but also because the ideas are shaped by a mathematical perspective of linear control theoretical approaches (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>). </p>



<p>To probe the framework, the paper shows how several disconnected observations in neurophysiology emerge in such a framework, like <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_plasticity">STDP</a> (spike time-dependent plasticity). STDP is a learning rule that has been found in slice work and had a huge impact on theoretical ideas about neuronal plasticity. STPD can be dissected into a “causal” part (postsynaptic activity comes after presynaptic activity) and an “a-causal” part (presynaptic after postsynaptic). The a-causal part of STDP makes a lot of sense in the framework of Moore et al. (2024) since the pre-synaptic activity could in this case be interpreted as a meaningful feedback signal for the neuron. These conceptual ideas that do not require a lot of math to understand them are – in my opinion – the main strength of the paper.</p>



<p>The proposed theoretical framework however also comes with limitations. It is based on a linear system; and I feel that the paper is too focused on mathematics and linear algebra, while the interesting aspects are rather conveyed in the non-mathematical part of the study. I found Figure 3 with a dissection of feedback and feedforward contributions in experimental data quite unclear and confusing. And the mathematical or algorithmic procedure how a neuron computes the ideal control signal given its objective function did not sound very biologically plausible to me (it included quite a lot complex linear algebra transformations), although .</p>



<p>Overall, I think it is a very interesting and inspiring paper. I highly recommend reading the Discussion. This discussion includes a nice sentence that summarizes this framework and distinguishes it from other frameworks like predictive coding: “[In this framework,] the controller neuron does not just predict the future input but aims to influence it through its output”. Check it out!</p>



<p><strong>A Learning Algorithm beyond Backpropagation</strong></p>



<p>This study by Song et al. (2024) includes several bold claims in the title and abstract. The promise is to provide a learning algorithm that is “more efficient and effective” than backpropagation. Backpropagation is the foundation of almost all “AI” systems, so this would be no small feat.</p>



<p>The main idea of the algorithm is to clamp the activity of input and output neurons with the teaching signals and wait until the activity of all layers in the middle converge (in a “relaxation” process), and then fix this configuration by weight changes. This is quite different conceptually from backpropagation, where the activity of output neurons is not clamped but compared to target activities, and differences are mathematically propagated back to middle layer neurons. Song et al. (2024) describe this relaxation process in their algorithm, which they term “prospective configuration” learning, as akin to relaxation of masses connected via springs. They also highlight a conceptual and mathematical relation to “energy-based networks” such as Hopfield networks (Hopfield, 1982). This is an aspect that I found surprising because such networks are well-known and less efficient than standard deep learning; so why is the proposed method here better than traditional energy-based methods? I did not find a satisfying answer to this question.</p>



<p>One aspect that I found particularly compelling about prospective configuration was that weights are updated not independently from each other but all together simultaneously, as opposed to backpropagation. Intuitively, this sounds like a very compelling idea. Thinking of it, it is surprising that backpropagation works so well although errors for each neuron are updated independently from each other. But as a consequence, learning rates need to be incremental to prevent a scenario where weight changes in input layers make the simultaneously applied weight changes in deeper layers meaningless, which is a limitation of backpropagation. It seems that prospective configuration does not have this limitation.</p>



<p>Is this algorithm biologically plausible? The authors seem to suggest this between the lines, but I found it hard to judge. The authors do not match the bits and pieces of their algorithm to biological entities, so I found it not easy to judge the potential correspondences. Given the physical analogies (“relaxation”, “springs”), I would expect that weights in these energy-based networks are symmetric (which is not biologically realistic). The energy function (Equation 6) seems to be almost symmetric, and I find it hard to imagine this algorithm to work properly without symmetric weights. The authors discuss this issue briefly in the Discussion, but I would have loved to hear the opinion of experts on this topic. One big disadvantage of the journal Nature Neuroscience is that it does not provide open reviews. Apparently, the paper was reviewed by Friedeman Zenke, Karl Friston, Walter Senn and Joel Zylberberg, all of whom are highly reputed theoreticians. It would have added <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> to read the opinions of these reviewers from relatively diverse backgrounds.</p>



<p>Putting these considerations aside, do these prospective configuration networks really deliver what they promise? It’s hard to say. In every single figure of this extensive paper, prospective configuration seems to outcompete standard deep learning in basically all aspects – catastrophic forgetting, faster target alignment, et cetera. In the end, however, the algorithm seems to be computationally too demanding to be an efficient competitor for backpropagation as of now (see last part of Discussion). The potential solutions to circumvent this difficulty do not sound too convincing at this stage yet. I would have been really glad to read a second opinion on these points that are rather difficult to judge just from reading the paper. Again, it would have been very helpful to have open reviews.</p>



<p>Overall, I found the paper interesting and worth the read. Without second opinions, I found it however difficult to properly judge novelty (in comparison to related algorithms such as “target propagation” mentioned briefly, by Bengio (2014)) and potential impact relative to standard deep learning (possibility to speed up the algorithm; ability to generalize). Let me know if you have an opinion on this paper!</p>



<p><strong>Continuous vs. Discrete Representations in a Recurrent Network&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In this study, Meissner-Bernard et al. (2024) investigate a specific biological circuit that has been thought of as a good model for attractor networks, the zebrafish homologue of the olfactory cortex. The concept of discrete attractors mediated by recurrent connections has been highly influential for more than 40 years (Hopfield, 1982) and has been early-on thought of as a good model for circuits like the olfactory cortex that exhibit strong recurrent connections (Hasselmo and Barkai, 1995). Here, Meissner-Bernard et al. (2024) investigate how such a recurrent network model is affected by the implementation of precise synaptic balance. What is precise balance?</p>



<p>Individual neurons receive both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. In a precisely balanced network, these inputs of opposite influence are balanced for each neuron and also precisely in time. To some surprise, Meissner-Bernard et al. (2024) find that a recurrent network that implements such a precise balance does not exhibit discrete attractor dynamics but locally constrained dynamics that result in continuous rather than discrete sensory representations. The authors include a nice control by showing that the same network without this precise balance and a globally tuned inhibition instead does indeed exhibit discrete attractor dynamics.</p>



<p>One interesting feature of this study is that the model is constrained by a lot of detailed results from neurophysiological experiments. For example, the experimental results of my PhD work on precise synaptic balance &#8211; (Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018) &#8211; have been one of the main starting points for this modeling approach. Not only this but also other experimental evidence specific used to constrain the model had been acquired in the same lab where also the theoretical study by Meissner-Bernard et al. (2024) was conducted. Moreover, the authors suggest in the outlook section of the Discussion to use EM-based connectomics to dissect the neuronal ensembles in this balanced recurrent circuit. The lab of Rainer Friedrich is working on EM-connectomics with synaptic resolution for longer than a decade (Wanner and Friedrich, 2020). It is interesting to see this line of research that spans not only several decades of work with various techniques such as calcium imaging (Frank et al., 2019), whole-cell patch clamp (Blumhagen et al., 2011; Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018) and EM-based connectomics, but also attempts to connect all perspectives using modeling approaches.</p>

                "The Forward has a storied history. Founded in 1897 as a Yiddish-language daily, it soon became a national publication — and the most widely read Jewish newspaper in the world. In 1990, the English version of the Forward launched as a weekly publication. In 2019, the Forward went fully digital.

And on December 5, 2023, the Forward marked its latest milestone: The publication removed the paywall for all of its coverage....

In the first three months since dropping the paywall, the newsroom welcomed 1,254 new donors who hadn’t previously paid to access their coverage. From December 5, 2023 to March 15, 2024, the Forward received nearly $583,000 in donations under $5,000 — a 37% increase over paid subscription revenue during the same time frame the previous year.

In December, the month the Forward removed the paywall, the nonprofit saw a 103% increase in reader revenue under $5,000, compared to the same time last year. That includes 176 new monthly recurring donors, averaging $16/month. Previously, an annual digital subscription brought in $51.21, just over $4/month.

 

And among the Forward’s 17,000 existing subscribers, who were currently paying to read stories behind the paywall, only three readers complained and asked for their money back. “Three! It’s amazing,” Ehrlich laughed...."

<p>Two BMC journals – part of the Springer Nature stable – have flagged studies a month after 10 editors at one of the journals resigned to protest the publications’ failure to respond quickly to allegations of data fabrication.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/06/editorial-board-members-resign-from-obstetrics-journal-to-protest-handling-of-allegations/">reported earlier this month</a>, obstetrician-gynecologist and sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">Ben Mol</a> sent allegations about papers published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> and <em>BMC Women’s Health</em> on Jan. 29, 2024. When BMC had not responded to Mol by February 28, 10 editors quit.</p>



<p>Mohamed Abdelmonem Kamel of Fayoum University in Egypt, the corresponding author of both articles, did not initially respond to a request for comment from Retraction Watch. However, he left a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/06/editorial-board-members-resign-from-obstetrics-journal-to-protest-handling-of-allegations/#comment-2217890">comment defending the work on our post</a> and said his team <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/06/editorial-board-members-resign-from-obstetrics-journal-to-protest-handling-of-allegations/#comment-2217894">could not share the data</a> behind one of the papers “before publishing it first as a paper to prevent stealing the data in another paper by different authors.” The study said that the data “are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.”</p>



<span id="more-129003"></span>



<p>Last week, the journals added editors’ notes to the two papers. <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05728-w">Both</a> <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-023-02549-z">notes</a> read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Readers are alerted that the reliability of data presented in this article is currently in question. Appropriate editorial action will be taken once this matter is resolved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It does not appear that the move has changed the editors’ minds quite yet. <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/alexander.heazell">Alexander Heazell</a>, of the University of Manchester in the UK, who sent the original letter to BMC on behalf of the group, told us his understanding based on communications he has seen “is that my colleagues and I are not planning to re-join the board until more decisive action is taken.”</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Susan-Schiffman.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="128" height="128" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Susan-Schiffman.jpg?resize=128%2C128&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-128987" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Susan Schiffman</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A journal has issued an expression of concern for a 2008 paper suggesting artificial sweetener Splenda could disrupt the gut microbiome and cause other havoc with the gastrointestinal system – and which is cited by a paper at the center of a lawsuit against one of its authors by the maker of the sugar substitute.</p>



<p>The article, “Splenda Alters Gut Microflora and Increases Intestinal P-Glycoprotein and Cytochrome P-450 in Male Rats,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A</em>, a Taylor &amp; Francis title. The journal has a <em>Part B</em>, too, which also is part of this story.</p>



<p>The paper, which has been cited more than 200 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, caught the attention of Elisabeth Bik, who last year <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A7318BB8B79BE174BCCF82C0EDD5CB">commented on the article on PubPeer</a>, noting potential problems with four of the figures, including Western blots and missing error bars. </p>



<span id="more-128986"></span>



<p>Susan Schiffman, the last author of the paper and a psychologist then at Duke University in Durham, N.C., but who has since moved to North Carolina State University in Raleigh, responded to Bik’s post. She said a researcher named in the acknowledgements of the paper had been asked to perform the Western blots “because she is highly skilled and very accurate,” and some of the others figures had included error bars but they made the figure “too busy.” She said she did not have access to the original data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15287394.2024.2321747">the expression of concern</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After publication of this article, questions about the scientific integrity of the article were brought to the Editor’s and Publisher’s attention. We contacted the authors, but have not yet received the required data or supporting materials necessary to complete the investigation. As this investigation may take some time to resolve, we advise readers to interpret the information presented in the article with due caution. The authors have been notified about this Expression of Concern.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last May, <em>Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B </em>published a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10937404.2023.2213903?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">review</a> by Schiffman and several of her colleagues that argued sucralose is “genotoxic” and its presence in the food supply should be the focus of “a regulatory status review.” It also cites the paper that is now subject to an expression of concern.</p>



<p>The May 2023 paper – which has been cited four times – did not please TC Heartland, the maker of Splenda, which <a href="https://www.splenda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-Complaint-Heartland-v-Schiffman.pdf">has sued </a>Schiffman for defamation. Heartland, which brought the case in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, claims Schiffman:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>chose to chase headlines rather than tell the truth. Dr. Schiffman spread falsehoods about Splenda, and in doing so she harmed Heartland and the millions of consumers who rely on Splenda as an important part of achieving their health goals. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper, the company claims, is “dishonest and deeply flawed for numerous reasons,” and “Schiffman’s subsequent claims about Splenda on her press tour were plainly false: Her paper expressly confirms that the sucralose Schiffman claimed to have studied for it was not the sucralose used in Splenda.”</p>



<p>Schiffman and Duke did not respond to requests for comment. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">One more note: The lead author of the article was Mohamed B Abou-Donia,&nbsp; of Duke. That name might be familiar to readers of Retraction Watch from this 2021 post about an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/06/pentagon-funded-duke-research-on-soldier-brain-damage-under-investigation/">investigation</a> at the institution involving three papers on which he was the second of two authors. Abou-Donia died in 2023 of complications of COVID-19, according to Schiffman’s comments on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those articles have all since been retracted with the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/187/11-12/e1501/6596490">same notice</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following an institutional investigation, the journal is retracting this article. The institution determined there is insufficient source documentation to verify either the reliability of the published results or the origins of the samples used. The institution also determined that the first co-author should not have been named as co-author of the article.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> </strong>&#8211; <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-024-06277-6">Effect of early vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of preeclampsia in primigravid women: a randomised clinical trial in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo</a></p>
<p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that affects around 5% of pregnant women globally and it can bring to preterm delivery, low birth weight and even to the death of the mothers and their newborns. The causes of preeclampsia are still largely unknown, however there has been progress in understanding the related pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors. A series of studies have revealed how low vitamin D levels are associated with preeclampsia, although only few studies have been conducted to determine the benefits of maternal–fetal vitamin D supplementation.</p>
<p>In this multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial, the authors evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation administered in early pregnancy on the incidence of PE in 1159 primigravidae in fourteen antenatal care health facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, along with the evaluation of adverse maternal-fetal-neonatal outcomes, such as preterm delivery, birth weight and height, mode of delivery, and APGAR score. The intervention group received a single monthly dose of cholecalciferol (60,000 IU) orally for 6 months, while the control group received no vitamin D supplementation or placebo.</p>
<p>The findings showed a significant reduction in the risk of preeclampsia, preterm and caesarean delivery in the intervention group, with newborns showing a higher APGAR score at the 5th minute in comparison to the control group. This study highlights the importance of monitoring the blood level of vitamins D throughout the pregnancy in the context of antenatal care, to reduce the maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality risks related to PE.</p>

<p>This study explored the cost-effectiveness of a universal early parenting intervention called the Parent and Infant (PIN) programme in an Irish setting when compared to the services as usual (SAU). The PIN was represented by 15 sessions consisting of 106 parent-infant dyads that participated in a series of workshops with the aim to enhance parent knowledge and skills. The SAU group was represented by 84 parent-infant dyads that receive the usual care provided by their local health service. The primary outcome measure for the economic evaluation was the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC).</p>
<p>The authors found that the parents in the PIN programme had positive outcomes in terms of parenting attitudes and that the PIN programme was cost-effective at a relatively low willingness-to-pay threshold when compared to SAU. The average cost of the PIN program was € 647 per dyad. This study provides important information for practitioners and policy makers and promote the debate on the importance of preventative parenting interventions.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Primary Care</em> </strong>&#8211; <a href="https://bmcprimcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-024-02297-5">Project nature: promoting outdoor physical activity in children via primary care</a></p>
<p>In children of all ages, time spent outdoor is associated with an increase of physical activity (PA) and an improvement of physical, mental, and cognitive health. Family circumstances, environmental constraints and behavioral factors, are some of the barriers that parents meet when they try to support their children’s outdoor play.</p>
<p>This study described a primary care-based family-centered behavioral intervention named Project Nature (PN), aimed to promote active outdoor play in children. The first phase, “adaptation needs assessment” was used to understand barriers and facilitators to outdoor play and it was based on qualitative interviews and focus groups with 14 parents with children ages 3-10, and 14 pediatric providers. The second phase, “usability testing”, was used to adapt the existing PN toolkits for children ages 0-3, for older children and it was based on qualitative interviews for 20 parents and 5 clinical staff. The third phase, “pilot evaluation”, evaluated the preliminary efficacy of the adapted PN for older children, using pre-post quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, and included 26 parents of children ages 4-10 years, and 4 pediatric providers.</p>
<p>Both providers and parents found that nature toys and brochure help children and parents to spend more time outdoors. This study highlighted the role of pediatric providers in encouraging outdoor play and the importance to have more policies to increase the number and the quality of the green spaces.</p>

<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the most common technique used to estimate SARS-CoV-2 re-infectious, however the use of this approach solely can bring to an undercount of cases mostly due to testing availability, undermining the confidence in the re-infection rates.</p>
<p>In this longitudinal study the authors used data from a cohort study of 736 individuals experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Canada, between June and September 2021. This population was characterized by a higher COVID-19 infection burden when compared to housed counterparts and was prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination. The participants provided saliva and blood samples every three months. The samples were used respectively for PCR testing or Rapid antigen test (RAT) to test for current SARS-CoV-2 infection and for a plate-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test past SARS-CoV-2 infection/vaccination.</p>
<p>The combined approach with serology and testing data, defined as the comprehensive method, allowed to identify 37.4 re-infection events per 100 person-years, more than four-fold higher than the rate from test-only methods. Considering the short- and long-term health effects of multiple infections, accurate monitoring of re-infection is crucial. The findings of the study showed how the used of comprehensive method is a valuable approach to conduct effective public health surveillance pertinent to SARS-CoV-2 re-infectious.</p>

<p><em><strong>BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making</strong></em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-024-02449-8">Characterizing the limitations of using diagnosis codes in the context of machine learning for healthcare</a></p>
<p>Machine-learning approach using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has been implemented into routine care and it is now broadly used for patient classification and laboratory measurements, for predicting future hospitalization and in general to build models for their use in research and clinical practice. Diagnostic codes are used to generate clinical prediction models, however there is variability among institutions as each of them use different coding processes and clinical diagnostic practices.</p>
<p>This study addressed the challenge to create a gold standard labeling process for diagnostic codes that can be used across institutions. The authors selected three cohorts, SickKids from The Hospital for Sick Children, and StanfordPeds and StanfordAdults from Stanford Medicine, and they considered seven clinical outcomes for which they created four lab-based labels based on test result and one diagnosis-based label. The five labels were evaluated in each patient admission, with a proportion of admissions with a positive diagnosis-based label significantly higher for StanfordPeds compared to SickKids across all outcomes.</p>
<p>The findings highlight how as results of different diagnostic codes, two children with the same test results can be considered differently at two pediatric institutions, based on the different categorization and labeling of the tests. Although machine learning has the potential to improve the quality of clinical research, clinical institutions should work together to implement uniformed machine learning models.</p>

                <p> <strong>Get to know who&rsquo;s helping lead complex systems research at PLOS. </strong> </p>



<p>We sat down with some of our recently appointed<em> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/">PLOS Complex Systems</a></em> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/s/section-editors">Section Editors</a> to share their thoughts and experiences, more about their current work and research projects, and what motivated them to get involved with our newest journal.</p>



<h3><strong>Matteo Convertino, Tsinghua University, China</strong></h3>



<h4>Section Editor, Climate and Natural Hazards&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong><em>Tell us a little bit about yourself and your current work</em></strong></p>



<p>I&rsquo;m currently involved in structural ecological engineering, centered on ecohydrological networks and flows for the assessment, forecasting and construction of future ecosystems considering climate change and development trajectories. We are largely focused on interfaces (or ecotones) that are essentially all water-dependent ecosystems at the interface between land and water &ndash; think about any coastline (blue carbon ecosystems), riparian areas along rivers, and other areas in between dramatically different habitats including built and natural systems.</p>



<p>I am also working with people in the School of Design to reshape the way we build in eco-symbiosis with natural habitats, in a way their complex structure triggers quantifiable positive hydroclimatic benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The core behind everything we do is for water to be linked to salient species and built environmental components, where the resulting pattern (systemic risk and value) is optimally shaped (plus minus uncertainty and adaptively for the unknown unknowns). So, we are combining engineering, eco-environmental sciences, and risk &amp; decision/design sciences in a complexity perspective to provide detailed plans for restoration and development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, I am involved in ecological information communication (to stakeholders and the wider public) to inform what people do not know and infer their needs and desires. This is important and really embraces a practical ecosystem science of complexity because any pattern/ecological state that arises cannot be defined without people.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why did you decide to get involved with the journal as a Section Editor?</em></strong></p>



<p>The first reason is that I follow opportunities that I feel close to. The combination of complex system methods and models and ecosystem science oriented toward water/climate disasters or ecosystem services, in general, has always been my core work. Therefore, topically the section is central to my activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for why being a Section Editor? I love to believe I can steer the science from the top-down, e.g. trying to promote a journal, journal topics/areas of science that are needed, and potentially also trying to change the world of publishing (for instance promoting the idea of creating shorter pieces to promote the science to the general public and addressing no-funding publications).</p>



<p>Lastly, it is also good to connect with people with similar visions and promote a similar agenda. This is a form of science lobbying that is useful and needed.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<h3><strong>Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci, Tsinghua University, China</strong></h3>



<h4>Section Editor, Concepts in Complexity</h4>



<p><strong><em>Tell us a little bit about yourself and your current work</em></strong></p>



<p>Recently, I have been working to develop new brain- and bio- inspired engineering theories for next-generation artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>More in general, the Center for Complex Network Intelligence (CCNI) &ndash; that I lead &ndash; works to create pioneering algorithms at the interface between information science, physics of complex systems, complex networks and machine intelligence, with a particular focus in brain/life-inspired computing for big data analysis. These computational methods are often applied to precision biomedicine, neuroscience, social, and economic science.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why did you decide to get involved with the journal as a Section Editor?</em></strong></p>



<p>Because I work to develop new complexity-inspired theories for computing and artificial intelligence. This journal is the perfect venue to promote and support such types of research.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Nata&scaron;a Przulj, Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies, Barcelona Supercomputer Center&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h3>Section Editor, Human Health</h3>



<p><strong><em>Tell us a little bit about yourself and your current work</em></strong> </p>



<p>My current roles include Professor of Biomedical Data Science at University College London, and a Research Professor at the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA) at Barcelona Supercomputing Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am a Fellow of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB), an elected member of Academia Europaea &ndash;The Academy of Europe, a Fellow of the British Computer Society (BCS), and a Scientific Advisor of the Mathematics Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU). In 2014, I was awarded the British Computer Society Roger Needham Award, and have also received three prestigious European Research Council (ERC) grants, with my research also having been supported by other large governmental and industrial grants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have worked on various projects at the intersection between human health and systems science, with my research primarily focusing on personalized medicine developing and utilizing network biology, and applied learning methods.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why did you decide to get involved with the journal as a Section Editor?</em></strong></p>



<p><br>A friend recommended it to me. I think <em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/">PLOS Complex Systems</a></em> will add valuable contributions to the multidisciplinary field it aims to serve, and I&rsquo;m excited to be a part of it.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/plos.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="277" height="182" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/plos.png?resize=277%2C182&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-122703" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></figure></div>


<p>The megajournal <em>PLOS ONE</em> will be correcting about 1,000 papers over the next few months, Retraction Watch has learned, and will add an author proof step – a first for the journal.</p>



<p>The corrections are for “errors in author names, affiliations, titles and references; to make minor updates to the acknowledgements, funding statements, and data availability statements, among other minor issues,” <em>PLOS ONE</em> head of communications David Knutson told us. He continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This batch of corrections does not reflect a recent change in the journal’s quality control standards or processes. Rather, we are clearing a backlog that accumulated during a 2-year period when minor corrections were deprioritized and resources were diverted to other areas. PLOS ONE is in the process of implementing an author proof step so that in the future such errors can be identified and addressed prior to publication.  </p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-128978"></span>



<p>Longtime Retraction Watch readers may recall that in 2016, a researcher noted <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s correction rate was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/08/05/plos-ones-correction-rate-is-higher-than-average-why/">much higher than that at other journals</a>. He and others chalked that up to the lack of an author proof stage, which is common at other journals. Knutson explained why the journal was reversing the policy:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are moving toward adding this service to authors because the correction request volumes in recent years have tipped the balance to where we have decided to prioritize the resources and time needed for this step in order to preempt minor corrections and ensure readers get correct information at the time of publication. For a megajournal like PLOS ONE, this is not a trivial decision given the publication volume, resources required to support this service, and the impacts of this extra step on time-to-publication which is a priority for the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> distinguishes “standard corrections” from “publication ethics corrections” such as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/09/26/plos-one-retracts-perfume-study-when-data-dont-pass-the-sniff-test/">this one</a> that led to a retraction, Knutson said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The standard corrections typically address reporting or typesetting errors such as typographical errors, broken links (e.g. to datasets with public repositories), or missing funding information. These are the types of corrections represented in the forthcoming large volume batches.</p>



<p>By contrast, publication ethics corrections (such as the one you referenced) address concerns raised about published articles, e.g. involving policy compliance, integrity, or scientific validity issues, which require a different editorial process and for which we may issue corrections, expressions of concern, or retractions depending on the nature, severity, and impact of the issues and the extent to which they can be addressed.</p>
