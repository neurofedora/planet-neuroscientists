<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mihaela-gadjeva.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="253" height="253" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mihaela-gadjeva.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-130512" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mihaela-gadjeva.jpg 253w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mihaela-gadjeva-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mihaela Gadjeva</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> has retracted a paper by a former group at Harvard following a postdoc’s allegations the work contained manipulated data.</p>



<p>The retracted paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1009557"><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>–induced nociceptor activation increases susceptibility to infection</a>,” appeared in 2021 from the lab of Mihaela Gadjeva, an immunologist previously based at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. It has been cited 22 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Gadjeva had been employed at Brigham and Women’s hospital for 16 years until her departure at some point in 2022. Since then, she has been an associate director of bacteriology at Moderna.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130511"></span>



<p>The retraction comes after a former postdoc in Gadjeva’s lab reported suspicions about possible data manipulation using photo editing software&nbsp; to the hospital and the journal. We spoke with the postdoc via email, where they shared evidence of their correspondence. They wished to remain anonymous for this story. We also reached out to Gadjeva for comment and got an email from her lawyers, Gelb &amp; Gelb LLP, based in Massachusetts, requesting that we direct any further communication through them. They have not responded to our queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The postdoc contacted the editor at <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> in August 2022 with concerns about the article. They alleged some data in figure 5 had been changed to support the claims in the paper.</p>



<p>The retraction notice doesn’t repeat the postdoc’s allegations of manipulation. Instead, it attributes the retraction to “concerns about the reliability of the reported results and conclusions” related to six figures, including figure 5. The authors acknowledged “some data underlying the figures of concern are no longer available,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice also stated the authors told editors they had combined multiple experiments during data preparation and analysis, and noted other factors that may have contributed to errors in the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After receiving the postdoc’s report, PLOS launched an investigation into the paper and reassessed the article, identifying additional duplications and errors, David Knutson, the head of communications at PLOS, told Retraction Watch. When we asked whether the journal’s own investigation into the paper addressed the allegations of data manipulation, Knutson responded, “Our publication ethics investigations do not investigate culpability or origin of error.”</p>



<p>To fix the problems, the authors offered updated figures, some original data and repeat data, but the journal’s editorial board concluded the materials&nbsp; “did not resolve the issues,” according to the retraction notice. After the two-year-long process, the paper was retracted this October.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The postdoc had reported the same issues to the hospital’s research integrity office in April 2022, several months before contacting the journal, but told Retraction Watch that they did not receive a response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked if Brigham and Women’s Hospital had looked into the postdoc’s concerns about the paper, a spokesperson for the hospital replied that Gadjeva “is not employed at BWH.” In a follow up email, she added, “We always undertake a robust and confidential process and respond to any claims that are brought to our attention in accordance with hospital policy and federal regulations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can not comment on the confidential process,” the email continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS contacted Brigham and Women’s Hospital to “discuss concerns,” Knutson said. Those discussions “are confidential,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our editorial decision was made independent from the information we received from the institute,” he told us. “PLOS retracted the article because we were unable to resolve the concerns raised in the absence of the underlying data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a separate incident in 2020, the attending veterinarian at Brigham and Women’s Hospital appeared to have suspended Gadjeva’s group from using an animal room — where lab rats are temporarily housed for experimentation — after an inspection found conditions that did not comply with regulations,&nbsp; according to an email describing the inspection report seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The room where the mice were housed was too cold, and the animals were kept in dirty cages, with little food and water supplies, according to the report. The inspector also found unsealed food, and no records for the animals.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Nada Yousif will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;Optimising burst based deep brain stimulation in a population model of Parkinson's disease and Tremor&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapy used to treat several neurological conditions
such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET), based on the implantation of
electrodes into specific brain targets. Despite its success, the electrical stimulus has
remained as a regular frequency square pulse for decades. Recently, there have been
proposals that phase-locking, coordinated reset or irregular stimulation patterns may be
more effective at desynchronising the pathological neural activity. Here we consider our
population level model of the thalamocortical-basal ganglia network, which generates
pathological oscillatory activity in the beta band (textasciitilde20 Hz) associated with
PD and the tremor band (textasciitilde4 Hz) associated with ET. We stimulate the model
with regular, irregular and phase-dependent bursts of DBS, and use an optimisation
technique to find the best stimulation parameters in each case. Our results show that
bursts can be as or more effective at suppressing pathological oscillations compared to
continuous DBS, allowing exploration of stimulation mechanisms to formulate testable
predictions regarding DBS.</p>

<p><em>Science </em>has issued expressions of concern for two articles from the <a href="https://durocherlab.org/">lab of Daniel Durocher</a>, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Toronto. </p>



<p>The notices, and two more editor’s notes on <em>Nature </em>articles, follow PubPeer comments on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=daniel+durocher">several of Durocher’s papers</a> pointing out potentially duplicated images, as <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/11/15/schneider-shorts-15-11-2024-not-a-clinical-research-article-with-new-data/#durocher">described by ForBetterScience</a>. Durocher has responded to many of the comments promising to look into the issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides his academic positions at <a href="https://moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/faculty/daniel-durocher">Toronto</a> and the <a href="https://www.lunenfeld.ca/?page=durocher-daniel">Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute</a> at Sinai Health, Durocher co-founded <a href="https://www.reparerx.com/">Repare Therapeutics</a>, a biotech company with five ongoing clinical trials of potential treatments for cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two <em>Science</em> articles, “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1248024">Mitosis inhibits DNA double-strand break repair to guard against telomere fusions</a>” from 2014, and “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1150034">Orchestration of the DNA-damage response by the RNF8 ubiquitin ligase</a>,” from 2007, together have been cited nearly 1,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130493"></span>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Jovana Drinjakovic, the science communications officer at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Sinai Health, confirmed the institution is investigating the 2014 paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We acknowledge that the journal <em>Science</em> is planning to publish the Editorial Expression of Concern regarding two studies that were published in 2007 and 2014. While the 2007 paper has a figure error that the authors are working to correct, the 2014 paper was noted to contain data irregularities. As soon as the senior author was made aware of the irregularities pertaining to the 2014 study, he promptly notified Sinai Health. This triggered an internal inquiry, in accordance with its policy on addressing research misconduct allegations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We received Drinjakovic’s email after reaching out to Durocher for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The senior author is currently in discussions with the journal about the next steps,” Drinjakovic said, referring to Durocher. “It would be inappropriate to comment further on this matter until the internal process has been completed.”</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9FD4EF09B9702618F5B1411AD25C3B#1">April 2021</a>, an anonymous user on PubPeer commented on the 2007 paper, identifying “more similar than expected” microscopy images in one figure. Durocher responded the same month, agreeing with the observation and stating he would “search for the original timelapse movie and will correct if needed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7744">expression of concern</a> for the article states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors informed the editors of a duplicate image in Fig. 3D. We are alerting readers to this concern while we work with the authors to determine an appropriate correction to the paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stephen P. Jackson, of the University of Cambridge, in England, and the penultimate author on the paper, has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/23/cambridge-researcher-pulls-cell-paper-five-years-after-nature-science-retractions/">previously retracted articles</a> from <em>Cell</em>, <em>Nature</em>, and <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, scientific sleuth Sholto David, who uses the PubPeer handle “Mycosphaerella arachidis,” pointed out potential duplications in six figures of the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0AF7C9EA1C32C958CE1A0E086CB846#1">2014 <em>Science</em> article</a>. Durocher <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0AF7C9EA1C32C958CE1A0E086CB846#8">responded</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for raising these issues. They are taken seriously. I have alerted my Institute director about the noted irregularities and they will be investigated.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7951">expression of concern</a> states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The editors and authors have been made aware of potential data integrity issues in several figures. We are alerting readers to this concern while we work with the institution and the authors to determine an appropriate course of action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>David told Retraction Watch the notice “should just be a retraction.” He called the paper “very muddled” and its data “extensively manipulated.”</p>



<p>Meagan Phelan, the communications director for the <em>Science</em> family of journals, confirmed PubPeer “was among the impetuses” for the notices. She added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors have been swift and thorough to respond to us and to address related issues. We’re seeing more and more authors work quickly and thoughtfully to correct the record in this way, and it continues to encourage us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On November 21, <em>Nature</em> added editor’s notes to two of Durocher’s papers, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16142">A mechanism for the suppression of homologous recombination in G1 cells</a>,” from 2015, and “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12318">53BP1 is a reader of the DNA-damage-induced H2A Lys 15 ubiquitin mark</a>,” from 2013. The articles have been cited nearly 900 times. Both notices state:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Readers are alerted that concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of data presented in this article. Further editorial action will be taken if appropriate once the investigation into the concerns is complete and all parties have been given an opportunity to respond in full.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>David also in November <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2AF6C463CAEDA36A79F940CF58BFD#1">commented</a> on the <em>Nature</em> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/52028782F1A67D6C14A75C58457908#1">studies</a> with questions about the data. Durocher and the first author of one of the articles responded, promising to look into the questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>International Wound Journal</em>, a Wiley title, has retracted 27 papers since June with notices mentioning “manipulated” or “compromised” peer review. </p>



<p>“A comprehensive investigation examining manipulated peer review in this journal is in progress,” a Wiley spokesperson told Retraction Watch. The publisher anticipates retracting more articles as the investigation continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first retraction of the batch, of the November 2023 article “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14502">Analysis of the Association Between Serum Levels of 25(OH)D, Retinol Binding Protein, and Cyclooxygenase-2 and the Disease Severity in Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers</a>,” appeared June 14. The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14947">notice</a> stated Wiley and the journal’s editor in chief “concluded that the peer review process of this article was manipulated” following an investigation by the publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130489"></span>



<p>The authors “did not respond to the notice of retraction,” according to the notice. Corresponding author Liwei Bai of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University in Weihui, China, did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the Wiley spokesperson told us the publisher’s investigation began “through our standard processes and channels prior to the receipt of inquiries from external parties,” 20 of the retractions in the batch credited “a third party.” These notices <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70022">stated</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It came to the publisher&#8217;s attention from a third party that a number of articles shared concerning similarities in format and structure. Following an investigation by the publisher, the retraction has been agreed on as the peer review and publishing process for this article were found to be manipulated</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five papers pulled November 12 have different notices, which stated the articles were accepted “solely on the basis of a compromised peer review process,” and therefore must be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>International Wound Journal</em> recently became open access, according to a September 2023 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14380">editorial</a> marking the journal’s 20th birthday. The journal had increased its number of editions from eight to 10 in 2023, and would add two more in 2024, the editors wrote, “as our submission volumes have increased exponentially.” The editors also shared plans to publish “several ‘special’ editions to supplement our annual editions.”</p>



<p>In an August <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70010?af=R">editorial</a>, the editors acknowledged some of the increase in submissions the journal had seen “is related to ‘papermill’ type activity.” They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This has challenged our submission and review process. To manage this, we are implementing significant back-end processes to identify and reject such content. We are also creating the largest single editorial board for any wound care journal, to strengthen our review process to enhance its effectiveness. This has become necessary to ensure the continued quality of our journal, especially considering the threat that “papermill type” activity may have on our overall subject area. This is a global challenge to the world of academic and clinical research. It is something that the IWJ does not take lightly and we are working diligently in playing our part to minimize its impact in the world of wound care.</p>

<p>Crossref, a nonprofit focused on metadata of scholarly publications, has suspended the membership of a company linked to websites which copied the appearance of journals belonging to Elsevier and Springer Nature, among others from major publishers, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move follows <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">Anna Abalkina’s reporting on Retraction Watch</a> about the activities of Springer Global Publications, which had used its membership in Crossref to assign Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to papers in 13 journals with similar names to those established by legitimate publishers. The DOIs linked to papers on webpages mimicking the appearance of the original journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Global Publications did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the suspension of its Crossref membership. The company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/26/company-linked-to-cloned-journals-of-major-publishers-denies-cloning-journals-of-major-publishers/">previously told us</a> it did not “create, review, or manage the content associated with the identifiers we issue,” and did not publish any journals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The website of the company has also been suspended by its hosting provider, and is no longer available online.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130485"></span>



<p>Ginny Hendricks of Crossref told us the organization had suspended Springer Global Publications for “misrepresenting information on their application form,” because the company told us they don’t publish the journals they provide DOIs for. “Sometimes these things take months, but this was clear cut,” Hendricks said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Editor’s note: Crossref <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/">acquired the Retraction Watch Database</a> last year and funds our efforts to maintain and update the repository.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Crossref’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/revocation/">policies</a> on suspending or revoking membership, the executive committee of the nonprofit’s board must review and ratify the decision to revoke membership. The board’s next meeting will likely take place in January, Hendricks said, but in the meantime Springer Global Publications “can’t access the system and are already suspended from membership.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/sheltering-from-time-a-review-of-time-shelter">Sheltering from Time: A Review of Time Shelter</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>In this review, Rebecca Pope discusses the International Booker Prize winning novel, &apos;Time Shelter&apos;. Georgi Gospodinov discusses transporting patients with Alzheimer&apos;s Disease back in time in a &apos;clinic for the past&apos;, as a promising treatment. But is this always a good idea?... </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Bulgarian author, Georgi Gospodinov, brings us his third novel, ‘Time Shelter’, which brings us into the world of Alzheimer’s Disease through the eyes of a fictional narrator, while discussing the utility of immersive therapies.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">‘Time Shelter’ was a fascinating read. Having completed a Neuroscience MSci degree, I had scientific knowledge of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) already, but this text was based on the patient experience - a new angle for me as a preclinical researcher. Fortunately, I have never had someone close to me develop AD, so have not personally experienced how awful it is for a friend or family member. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In the book, Gospodinov delves into the idea of immersive therapies, alongside a clinician, Gaustine, creating floors of a clinic focused on a specific year, or decade, of times past. By utilising seemingly fictional patient stories - their backgrounds, the time they are living in, their changing relationships, their response to the immersion - Gospodinov discusses his interactions with them and the emotions that are raised both for them, as well as within him, in-depth during every observation. In fact, the clinic is so successful that individuals with no memory loss are also keen to experience the past!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It is difficult to know how each person will experience their decline and loss of memory after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, or in which time they will be ‘living’ for the foreseeable future. Will they be ‘reliving’ a traumatic time of their life, or will it be a place of comfort? How can we support them and make them comfortable? This is yet another example of why personalised therapies are so important. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We are collections of our memories - if they are unwillingly stripped from us, who remains? </strong></span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Whilst creating these realistic and dystopian, frozen moments in time, Gospodinov highlighted the attention to detail that is required, including about things that in the moment do not seem particularly important (advertisements, trending colours, widespread opinions, major news stories, popular children’s toys). It gave me an appreciation for the things immediately around me as I was sitting reading the book in the park - the fashion, the language, the 2024 obsession with running!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We are collections of our memories - if they are unwillingly stripped from us, who remains? Do we instead become a collection of the memories that other people possess of us? It is incredible that something, be it a scent or a piece of music, can suddenly bring people back to themselves, reanimating them (and sometimes giving seemingly non-verbal people the power of speech). Knowing what these prompts are is the major difficulty, and a clinician must spend ample amounts of time with the patient or their friends and family to gather personal information to try to guess at these things. Unfortunately, it seems that in these cases, the brain is effectively locking away our memories and forgetting to label the key…</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Is it right to have somebody living in another time with the ‘real’ world passing them by outside?</strong></span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The novel also touches on the ethics of the treatments; is it right to have somebody living in another time with the ‘real’ world passing them by outside? Gospodinov also raises the question: is it always a good idea to feed their illusion? The example he uses is of a lady who has returned to living in a time of perpetual fear, as a prisoner of Auschwitz. Certainly, there are very real moral questions to be asked here, to be considered on a case by case basis. The latter half of the book focused on the dystopian introduction of a political voting system for European countries to select which decade they would like to live in. Gospodinov went into intricate detail about the politics, music, affluence, and other factors of each country in the decades chosen. This was an intriguing and terrifying concept, but was also a bit dry to read.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With our ageing society, AD is becoming more prevalent, and the likelihood that we will know someone affected by the disease is ever increasing. In 2019, more than 55.2 million people were experiencing dementia in old age and this number is predicted to increase to 78 million by 2030 (1). It is becoming more and more urgent to develop therapies that can provide immediate comfort for patients, with the long-term goal of developing preventative treatments. I think that immersive experiences would be a relief for people with AD who are distressed and confused, largely stuck in the past. The isolation and frustration that patients must feel to not be understood and to be alone in their experience is truly devastating and difficult for those around them.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Overall, ‘Time Shelter’ was an interesting read, with its title being a clever nod to ‘bomb shelter’, implying that the immersive therapies are providing a literal shelter from time. It</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">prompts the reader to reflect about the best, personalised care for people with AD and raises moral questions surrounding treatment.</span></span></p>
