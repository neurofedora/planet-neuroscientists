<p>After we reported on a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">new scam</a> to publish papers on webpages remarkably similar to those of Elsevier, Springer, the American Medical Association and other major publishers, the company linked to the clones denied any role in producing the content they contain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until we reached out for comment, the company “<a href="https://www.springergloballtd.com/">Springer Global Publication</a>” – which is not affiliated with Springer Nature – had advertised a variety of services on its website, including finding a writer for research papers, editing manuscripts, developing research proposals, analyzing data and managing the peer review process, a collection of services which is a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">classic attribute of a paper mill</a>. After we emailed them, they removed descriptions of these services from their website, as well as links to papers published in cloned journals, but did not respond before publication of our story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After our story appeared, we received an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SGP-response.pdf">email</a> signed by “Administrator &#8211; Springergloballtd.com,” in which the company said it did not “create, review, or manage the content associated with the identifiers we issue.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company stated:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130466"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We would like to emphasize that our organization is not a publisher, nor do we operate any journals, cloned or otherwise. Our primary role is to provide Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) as a form of online identification for assignments, research papers, and various other digital content at the request of our customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Our responsibility begins and ends with providing identifiers for submitted content, and we do not evaluate, verify, or publish the content ourselves,” the statement continued. “Our clients are responsible for the content they submit and its intended use.”</p>



<p>On a page still available on <a href="https://springergloballtd.com/publication.html">Springer Global&#8217;s website</a>, and archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241123143541/https://springergloballtd.com/publication.html">here</a>, the company lists 16 journals as “Our Publication [sic],” including “<a href="https://springergloballtd.com/JAMA%20Opthalmology.html"><em>JAMA Ophthalmology</em></a>” and several others with titles matching journals from major publishers. The journal pages link to webpages for <a href="https://jamanetwork.international/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/97106/">articles</a> closely resembling the websites of the original publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While we acknowledge that some submissions may contain journal names or designs that resemble those of established publishers, it is important to note that our role does not extend to verifying the authenticity of submitted content,” the company told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company also stated it does not “create, host, or manage the webpages associated with the identifiers.” These pages are “provided to us by our clients, who assume full responsibility for their content and appearance,” it claimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company asked for us to share “specific cases or evidence that indicate misuse of our services.” We provided a list of DOIs published in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">our story</a>, and asked if they would take any action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another email signed by the “Administrator,” the company replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As a relatively new entity in this domain, this situation has been a significant learning experience for us. Through your findings and our subsequent investigations, we have recognized that there were indeed issues that require our immediate attention and corrective action.</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>We are prepared to take any steps necessary to resolve this matter, including the review and possible retraction or correction of any problematic DOIs.</p>

                Rich countries have agreed to pay developing nations $300 billion a year to help them with their climate actions—but the agreement doesn’t say who specifically should contribute or how.

<p>Until recently, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0">journal hijackers</a> do not appear to have targeted titles from big publishers, in part because their well-known website designs made such clones easy to detect.</p>



<p>Typically, cloned versions of journals’ websites are of low quality and don’t resemble the recognizable and professional designs of Springer Nature and Elsevier. As described in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/anna-abalkina/">previous posts</a>, fraudulent publishers <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0">would usually</a> copy the ISSN, title and other metadata of niche and university journals in order to avoid identification, and possibly index their unauthorized content in bibliographic databases such as <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24855">Scopus</a> or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/26/three-journals-web-domains-expired-then-major-indexes-pointed-to-hijacked-versions/">Web of Science</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve cataloged over 300 such cloned journals in the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, a small number of which involve major publishers like Springer Nature, Elsevier and Wiley. For example, earlier this year the <a href="https://x.com/AbalkinaAnna/status/1818936073306722568"><em>Journal of Academic Ethics</em></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240103081741/https://machineintelligenceresearch.com/"><em>Machine Intelligence Research</em></a>, both published by Springer Nature, were cloned.</p>



<p>But earlier this month, William Black, founder and CEO of<a href="https://www.psiref.com/"> PSIref</a>, an online platform aggregating scholarly publication data which offers advertising opportunities for publishers, sent me evidence of a new, more sophisticated scam.</p>



<span id="more-130458"></span>



<p>The company “<a href="https://www.springergloballtd.com/">Springer Global Publication</a>” – which is not affiliated with Springer Nature – has published dozens of papers cloning the websites of journals officially published by Elsevier, Springer, the American Medical Association and more.&nbsp; The company had advertised a variety of services on its website, including finding a writer for research papers, editing manuscripts, developing research proposals, analyzing data and managing the peer review process. This collection of services is a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">classic attribute of a paper mill</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Global Publication did not respond to our request for comment, but after we contacted them, they removed descriptions of their services from their website, as well as links to papers published in cloned journals. (See an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/26/company-linked-to-cloned-journals-of-major-publishers-denies-cloning-journals-of-major-publishers/">update on this post</a>.)</p>



<p>The design of the websites for the cloned journals is strikingly similar to the original journals’ websites, even with pop-ups about allowing cookies.</p>



<p>For example, the following screenshot is of a paper published in <em>Language Sciences</em>. However, the image comes not from an original website, but a cloned one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeA78GHYvceRspRZG0N5r9hVkhfb6eMi2EkyEpyQ3EkzKFiSY9SiFnt4BULQQsJJV9i0o_Kt__6aKrp88ZXRCVPeonLMHx14R34rOJ6zmPG3LdHhPziSVTYm3EIRDi3ev1Tfb7DFQ?key=y9U8plnqB39_u-BppyTEOjKk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The fake version can be identified from the domain name, which is sciencedirects.com, not sciencedirect.com, as in the original Elsevier website.</p>



<p>This screenshot comes from the original journal, for comparison.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcXRcL3uOVUBIFM1yqrQVDYwFx7o_dANCnSufT0NY-O8eoRVBeDWbQ7sfS-Rwn3UGAmtCnkme2gzSvD139yj6fPNtTAFq42qh--GS6N0zgoirl-OelarwW1ax6O-5dy-tZk4TUgoA?key=y9U8plnqB39_u-BppyTEOjKk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In another example, the following screenshot shows a paper published in <em>Educational Technology Research and Development</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeVr-wLCTOhBpLok_MNMZzVAoZ4lEx2cQhEuJT7Y-ISdQDEDequiPNBZlJVeGXSAaUtFX4APMLYf_PFDPJj6AyA5g8i9pxVpcbjUJLJ_E-i3GFWtjSS0c-mycyfiygdbw0cR4I_ZQ?key=y9U8plnqB39_u-BppyTEOjKk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The design of this webpage mimics that of the original Springer journal. The only detail revealing the scam is the domain name: springer.uk.com instead of the official springer.com<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The design of the original journal is identical.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeS1bVmobADEx05vOIbRAA20Rq-Wj2gepSnQ1OVtgArYDc3p_wpLZn5gTy7RkIdBL_mjFz0ITrfzuhGVgJNy9H4h0kvh4M5O0tbFw3_Ch7lOmZIynyWLzYxh8Dbbk2PfLhkVESQLQ?key=y9U8plnqB39_u-BppyTEOjKk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>All of the papers published by “Springer Global Publications” are assigned DOIs with its own prefix 10.70706, which does not resemble the prefix of either Elsevier or Springer.</p>



<p>Overall, a search through Crossref identified 13 journals to which “Springer Global Publications” has assigned DOIs. All of these journals have similar names to those established by legitimate publishers:</p>

<p>Ginny Hendricks of Crossref told us the organization would add the questionable DOIs to their list to “investigate and take action.” [Editor’s note: Crossref <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/">acquired the Retraction Watch Database</a> last year and funds our efforts to maintain and update it.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>Representatives for Elsevier and Springer Nature both said the publishers take such issues seriously. “We actively work through legal means to shut down fraudulent websites as soon as possible,” the Elsevier spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Nature previously took action to remove fraudulent websites cloning other journals, a spokesperson for the publisher said, and is “currently investigating similar action to address these cases.”</p>



<p>Although this problematic publisher has registered only 13 journals with Crossref, this type of scam allows the publication of papers in an unlimited number of journals from legitimate publishers.</p>



<p>The website of “Springer Global Publication” <a href="https://springergloballtd.com/publication.html">also lists</a> an additional three journals not registered with Crossref: <em>Springer Global Journal of Literature &amp; Linguistics</em>, <em>Springer Global Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences</em>, and <em>Springer Global Journal of Economics and Management.</em></p>



<p>The domain of this company was registered on Sept. 18, 2024. Two associated domains, springer.uk.com and sciencedirects.com, were registered on Nov. 11, and Sept. 18, 2024, respectively.</p>



<p>Papers published on the cloned websites appear to have content recycled from other sources. The company will most likely offer to publish papers in legitimate and reputable journals, but submitted papers will instead appear on cloned versions of the websites. This new scam represents high-quality fraudulent websites, with a remarkable resemblance to legitimate ones, capable of deceiving even experienced researchers. Be aware!</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXckTRbb6Gc6ss4ekm1JQpFI2rHpBGRea0PDkXAuapQYf_f7CL_2GP3uS2lYCyPgYrBNvqSyN6ZKtx7nkaR-WrEi42KV42eMeh9HnB_leno6gS46rC-jnmJvxOTt-HGtD7Zu52VGU6HKoV5tChOU0Fw?key=g4tdTKt1p-CTT7FXvX-p-OT1" alt="A screenshot of Native Land Digital’s interactive map"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">via Smithsonian Magazine</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Smithsonian Magazine</em> has retracted a two-year-old article about an interactive online map describing indigenous lands in North America because the map “did not meet the standards of scholarship we expect of academic projects we cover as part of our editorial purview.”</p>



<p>The move followed sharp criticism from a pro-Israel group about a map produced by a nonprofit organization that formed the basis of the article.</p>



<p>The original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221013212829/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/interactive-map-shows-you-what-indigenous-land-you-live-on-180980920/">article</a>, published on Oct.13, 2022 and titled “This Interactive Map Shows Which Indigenous Lands You Live On,” was based on a map created by <a href="https://native-land.ca/about/why-it-matters">Native Land</a>, a Canadian non-profit the article said “is focused on improving both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people’s relationship with the lands around them.” The article encouraged readers to use the map in order to see which Indigenous communities resided in their city, state, or zip code.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130451"></span>



<p>The article included an image of the map for North America &#8212; see the image at the top of this post &#8212; and linked to Native Land’s website with a map of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to a request for comment, a magazine spokesperson <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Smithsonian-comment.pdf">told Retraction Watch</a>: &#8220;A number of readers reached out to the Smithsonian with their concerns about the Native Lands map, specifically about its treatment of Israel.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/interactive-map-shows-you-what-indigenous-land-you-live-on-180980920/">retraction note</a> on the article does not mention concerns about Israel, and a spokesperson said that would not change.</p>



<p>Native Land’s depiction of Israel on its <a href="https://native-land.ca/">website</a> first drew attention from “Pens From Swords,” a pro-Israel WhatsApp activist group that organizes protests about anti-semitism and anti-Israel/-Zionism on social media and elsewhere online. It has been publicly aggressive in pressuring meeting venues to cancel meetings they consider Pro-Palestinian.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdT9c21YDcd3Ch2BAZtXjtz2j-6S3SCvs09r35SmZUxvJbQEF26pCZ4XHHlW3EDceQ_TFrLh2dcMbvx7-a8lwh7k60jbE50uFOXM3LT805MAjTHh4x4_1ztIUgyVd5t0jWM0ADDOx5DIahT3pDMeQ?key=g4tdTKt1p-CTT7FXvX-p-OT1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">via Pens From Swords</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Pens From Swords, the group’s members believe Native Lands had “erased Israel” by placing “Palestine” over the outline of the current borders of the Jewish state.</p>



<p>Native Land did not respond to a request for comment. However, Aaron Carapella, an advisor to the group and owner of <a href="https://www.tribalnationsmaps.com/">Tribal Nations Maps</a>, criticized <em>Smithsonian</em>’s decision to retract the story. He told Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SmithsonianRetraction-Carapella-Quote.pdf">in an email</a> that he had not done any “work used by Native Land” for its online maps.</p>



<p>“However, my own work has been a victim of cancel culture as well,” he said. &#8220;The notion that the Smithsonian would claim their [Native Land] work is not ‘scholarly’ is code for ‘it wasn&#8217;t created by an academic from one our approved institutions.’&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/is-this-really-me-how-to-tackle-imposter-syndrome">Is this really me? How to tackle imposter syndrome!</a></h4>

              
                <p>Self-doubt, confusion and low self-esteem. Each of these are feelings you might experience when you believe you are not deserving of the position you are in today; you cannot rationalise your current reality and instead contribute your success to other factors, not your own hard work. This is more commonly known as imposter syndrome and is more prevalent in today’s society than ever before. Imposter syndrome can occur in any field, and at any level, but this article will refer to STEM careers and/or higher education.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a young woman, embarking upon my career within Neuroscience, and as the first individual within my family to pursue a STEM career, the emotions that imposter syndrome caused greatly impacted my journey, from before I entered university up until now as a postgraduate student. Imposter syndrome not only affected the way I viewed myself, but also altered the prospects I had for myself within my neuroscience career. So, how can we recognise and combat the feeling that we don’t deserve certain achievements or careers? In this article, I will be sharing my top three tips that I have learnt throughout my neuroscience career that you too can take on board, hopefully allowing you to recognise these self-critical thoughts and shift them into more uplifting ones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>1.         Recognising that your thoughts towards your current situation are self-critical</strong></span></p>
<p>The initial step to defeating your imposter syndrome, particularly as a woman in STEM, is to recognise that the thoughts that are entering your head about your new job role or your position within a particular university or institution, for example, are self-deprecating and are not always healthy. Whilst this can be easier said than done, recognising these thoughts and feeling the consequent negative emotions, such as guilt or low mood, is an important first step in pinpointing that you are stuck in a certain perspective. Consider this scenario for example - you are taking part in a group discussion with your class at university and whilst waiting for your turn to speak, you are listening to your peers’ ideas upon the chosen topic. One of your peers shares an excellent answer that, at the time, you feel is much better than yours. Subsequently, you begin to develop feelings of self-doubt and low self-esteem through believing that you do not share the same academic ability as your peers. And so, in this scenario, noticing that you are feeling such emotions instead of putting them to the side is the first step to defeating imposter syndrome and developing your confidence as a student or academic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>2.         Shifting your self-critical thoughts into positive, uplifting ones</strong></span></p>
<p>One method that particularly worked for me to combat imposter syndrome throughout my neuroscience journey was taking small steps to help rewire my brain’s thought processes from self-critical thoughts to those that reinforce confidence and high self-esteem. Let’s take the previous scenario, for example, where thoughts of you not being clever enough or good enough to participate in this class flood your brain. To act upon this, we would first notice that these thoughts are caused by self-doubt. Instead of reinforcing negative beliefs and allowing this to become a natural thought pattern, we would actively combat these ideas with phrases such as ‘I am good enough’ or ‘I am clever enough’. Whilst this may seem like a silly thing to do initially, it follows the same principle as affirmations, whereby you consistently reinforce positive, confident thoughts about a specific situation to slowly encourage your brain to understand that you truly are each of these positive things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>3.         Supporting your positive, uplifting thoughts with concrete facts</strong></span></p>
<p>Following my two previous tips on how to combat imposter syndrome, there still may be some lingering doubts in your brain that require additional support to help get rid of them. And so, whilst the repetition of positive affirmations does help to rewire your thinking, sometimes the addition of factual information can help solidify these shifts in your mindset. Again, using the scenario we have discussed throughout, it initially began with self-critical thoughts about how ’you’ may not feel as though ‘you’ are good enough to be in that class and take part in such intellectual discussions. To prove that this is not true, we can reverse our thought processes by realising, ‘if I wasn’t clever enough to be in this class, I wouldn’t be here,’ or ‘if I wasn’t good enough to be in this university then, I wouldn’t have achieved the grades to be here or I wouldn’t have passed the interview stage.’ By reinforcing our positive affirmations with facts, we disassociate ourselves from these feelings of self-doubt and move onto those of self-belief and confidence to enable us to achieve whatever we set our minds on.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I am an avid self-help podcast listener, and I have come across some great episodes where imposter syndrome is further discussed and some additional tips and tricks are shared that really helped me when these thoughts began to filter into my head, as a university student. </p>

<p>The first I would like to share is an episode from the podcast, <strong>‘A Millennial Mind’,</strong> hosted by digital creator and speaker Shivani Pau with the addition of Bridgerton’s favourite, Charithra Chandran. Whilst this episode explores imposter syndrome from an actress’s point of view, the take home messages on how to combat such feelings are very similar.</p>

<p>The second podcast episode I would like to share is an episode from, <strong>‘The Mel Robbins Podcast’,</strong> whereby author Mel Robbins shares the most valuable piece of information to help silence the feelings of self-doubt that imposter syndrome brings about.</p>

<p>Ultimately, imposter syndrome is a huge issue, particularly among women working within STEM careers, but with the help of organisations such as WiNUK, there is a community of like-minded individuals who are embarking on their scientific careers. In these communities, open-ended discussions about topics such as imposter syndrome can be had and personal advice or tips on how to manage struggles can be shared! In addition to this, support services such as ‘<strong>Student Space’ led by the UK’s student mental health charity, Student Minds</strong>, can provide additional support and tailored services to students who are experiencing a range of mental health concerns, because of things like imposter syndrome, through a 24-hour text support line, free online workshops and support groups. I hope the advice and resources I have shared within this article, alongside sharing my own personal experiences surrounding imposter syndrome, have helped you to realise that you are not alone and that together, as today’s generation of scientists, we can combat imposter syndrome within the science community.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: Gender is a self-described characteristic, whilst sex is biologically determined. The term ‘women’ can refer to either or both definitions, and this may vary according to the study cited. At Women in Neuroscience UK, we tackle both sexism and gender biases in neuroscience, by covering topics of sex/gender discrimination in neuroscience workplaces and sex differences in neurological conditions. Our current activities primarily support female-identifying neuroscientists, but we actively encourage people of all gender identities to our community. We believe everyone can benefit from learning and peer support towards more diverse and inclusive neuroscience.</em></p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The embattled mega journal <em>Cureus</em> has closed six of its so-called “academic channels,” which it bills as low-cost publication platforms that “<a href="https://www.cureus.com/channels">will turn your organization into a publishing powerhouse</a>,” Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The move follows a joint investigation in May by <em>Science</em> and Retraction Watch that found several organizations critics described as <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">dressed-up paper mills</a> had their own channels at the medical journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we reported in September, indexing for <em>Cureus</em>, which is published by Springer Nature, was recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">put on hold</a> by Clarivate’s Web of Science, apparently due to quality concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130440"></span>



<p>Although <em>Cureus</em> says it maintains oversight of the articles channels publish, owning a channel allows organizations to appoint “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425085255/https:/www.cureus.com/channels">hand-picked editors</a> [who] manage all content from submission to publication,” our investigation with <em>Science</em> pointed out.</p>



<p>The owners of the defunct channels were:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.cibnp.com/">California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences and Psychology</a></li>



<li><a href="https://researchupdate.org/">Research Update Organization</a></li>



<li><a href="https://grrsp.com/">Global Remote Research Scholars Program</a></li>



<li><a href="https://aaracademics.com/">American Academy of Research &amp; Academics</a> (AARA) by <a href="https://imghelpinghands.com/">IMG Helping Hands</a></li>



<li><a href="https://bioleagues.com/">BioLEAGUES</a></li>



<li><a href="https://advancedsciencesacademics.com/">Advanced Sciences Academics</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The first three organizations were named in our investigation, which documented the emergence of a “cottage industry of businesses, consultants, and nonprofits dangling seemingly easy publications” for foreign doctors looking for residency positions in the United States. AARA by IMG Helping Hands also was among two dozen similar organizations we found.</p>



<p>BioLEAGUES is a conference organizer in India. As detailed in an October 1 guest post on our site, the self-described non-profit is part of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">a sprawling organization</a> there offering many of the same services as a traditional publishing house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It appears the term ‘paper mill’ may fail to fully capture the diversity and scale of activities overseen by these hydra-like conglomerates,” Reese Richardson of Northwestern University and colleagues wrote in the post, referring to BioLEAGUES and several organizations tied to it.</p>



<p>Advanced Sciences Academics is a publishing house based in India that, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiroj-bagde/recent-activity/all/">according to its founder</a>, has handled more than 2,000 publications and has written more than 2,000 manuscripts.</p>



<p>At the time of our investigation with <em>Science</em>, Graham Parker-Finger, director of publishing and customer success at <em>Cureus</em>, defended its channels. In a statement, he told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We assess all organisations that have a Cureus channel carefully before approval, considering their history and ethical standards, and have declined many approaches on the basis that the organisations were not credible and their operating principles did not reach our expectations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It appears the journal changed its view after taking a closer look. In a statement for this story, Parker-Finger said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>At the time of your original story, we were in the process of conducting a full assessment of our publishing operations and channels. Organizations with channels must meet established criteria to ensure that they align with the standards we set at Cureus. Following the assessment, we have closed six channels which were judged not to meet our criteria.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Content submitted to Cureus channels undergoes the same editorial assessment by Cureus editors as content submitted outside of channels. Once a channel has been established, the channel is able to appoint their own editors (who are vetted and approved by Cureus), who assist in evaluating initial submissions and post-peer review revisions, but they do not have final authority to accept or reject manuscripts. Cureus editors maintain the same level of oversight of the channel content as they do over the regular content: reviewing all submissions and requests for publication, appointing peer-reviewers, determining whether authors have applied necessary changes, and making the final decision regarding whether to publish or reject all channel articles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We contacted all of the erstwhile channel owners, but only heard back from IMG Helping Hands. The organization promised comments, but at the time of publication has yet to send us any.</p>

                <div id="primary" class="col-md-8 col-xl-9 content-area">
<p>Planning a submission to arXiv in the next few weeks? The 2024 end-of-the-year holiday stretch will be temporarily impacting arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This temporary change only affects the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>While the arXiv team logs in from around the globe, our staff primarily takes time off according to the holiday schedule of the United States, which at the end of the year includes many holidays in quick succession, leading to several announcement delays.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As our team rests, celebrates, and takes time to be with family, there will be some disruption to arXiv’s regular announcements, mailings, and user support.</p>
<p>Please be aware of the delays around the following U.S. holidays and dates. Mailings and public availability of new submission will be deferred accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>U.S. Thanksgiving Holiday</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday, November 28th:</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00 ET Wednesday, 27 November 2024 and before 14:00 ET Friday, 29 November 2024 will be announced at 20:00 ET Sunday, 1 December 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Christmas Holiday</strong></li>

<p>The <em>British Medical Journal </em>has retracted an article examining when unexpected weight loss could be a warning sign of cancer after the authors found an error in their work. The journal published an updated version of the analysis with different conclusions, which the authors think could influence patient care. </p>



<p>The retracted paper, “<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m2651">Prioritising primary care patients with unexpected weight loss for cancer investigation: diagnostic accuracy study</a>,” appeared Aug. 13, 2020. The researchers, led by <a href="https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/brian-nicholson">Brian D. Nicholson</a>, a general practitioner and associate professor in the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, England, used electronic health records data to look for people diagnosed with cancer within six months after a recording of unexpected weight loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors were attempting to replicate their results in another dataset when they found “some differences in the study findings and study population that we could not easily explain,” Nicholson told Retraction Watch. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130433"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For many months we tried hard to understand what could have caused these differences. As part of our investigation, we reviewed the processes that had been used to select the study population included in the analysis and identified that it was likely that an unanticipated selection bias had been introduced whilst the dataset had been prepared for the analysis.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nicholson and his colleagues contacted the <em>BMJ</em> when they felt they could “articulate what we thought had happened,” he said. The group “found the journal very responsive to our approach for advice about what we should do next,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 25, the journal published an <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q688">expression of concern</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors of the paper recently identified an error in their approach to the research. Some patients were excluded from the study because their healthcare records contained a code that was not associated with weight loss. Sometime later, however, some of these patients are likely to have had a code included in their healthcare record that was associated with unintended weight loss and cancer. This created an unintended selection bias in the work; some patients were excluded from the study who should have been included in the study. Rectifying this error would result in substantially more patients being included in the study. Reanalysis changes the study’s key results and messages. It corrects an underestimate of the likelihood of cancer for some men, and a larger group of women. BMJ is working with the authors to review a new version of the paper and to determine what post-publication action is suitable in this case. An update will be provided when our evaluation has concluded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal ultimately decided to publish an updated version of the article, and the authors were “relieved,” Nicholson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj.q1993.full">notice</a>, published October 16, stated the authors and journal agreed to retract the flawed paper, and linked to the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj-2024-080199">updated</a> version. The notice was largely the same as the expression of concern, but elaborated on the effect of excluding the patients who should have been included. The exclusions “caused the study to underestimate the prevalence of cancer in the general primary care population,” the notice stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original study included nearly 64,000 patients with unexpected weight loss recorded in their medical records between 2000-2012, of which 1.4% ended up receiving a cancer diagnosis within six months. In the update, the authors analyzed records from about 326,000 patients with unexpected weight loss between 2000-2019. This time, 4.8% had received a cancer diagnosis half a year later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results also changed. The first analysis found unexpected weight loss indicated a high enough risk of cancer to warrant follow-up investigation only for men at least 50 years old who had smoked and people with additional symptoms. The re-analysis found unexpected weight loss in all men at least 50 years old and women at least 60 years old, as well as younger patients with additional symptoms, indicated “the risk of cancer warrants referral for invasive investigation.”</p>



<p><em>The BMJ</em> “has contacted those who have cited the work to alert them to the new results in the updated version of the paper,” according to a spokesperson for the journal. The authors and <em>The BMJ</em> have also contacted the UK’s <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> “because the paper could inform recommendations about which individuals should be referred to specialist services with unexplained weight loss in primary care.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>NICE did not respond to our request for comment on whether the organization would need to update any recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article has been cited 15 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, with 4 citations since the March expression of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The revised results have not yet been reported as widely as the first article, according to Altmetric, which tracks the online attention articles receive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our updated results report the risk of cancer in patients attending their GP with unexpected weight loss,” Nicholson said. &#8220;We hope these results will be taken into account when our national guidelines, and other international clinical guidelines, are updated about who should be urgently referred for cancer investigation.”</p>

<p>A multiple myeloma specialist “recklessly“ falsified data in at least 10 published articles, according to a joint investigation by the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. </p>



<p>The institutions found Alan Lichtenstein, a former staff physician at the VA, committed research misconduct by reusing images “to falsely represent the results” related to 26 pairs of experiments, according to a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/18/2024-26756/findings-of-research-misconduct-c">notice</a> published in the Federal Register.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least one of the sets of images in each of the pairs “is inaccurate,” the notice stated. The institutions found Lichtenstein had falsified data in “at least ten” of the 13 articles in which the images appeared, perhaps because the investigators could not determine which images, if any, were original.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130429"></span>



<p>Lichtenstein has received more than $10 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health, and was also previously a professor of medicine in residence at UCLA Medical School, according to an <a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/archive/files/agenda/Letter%20to%20the%20Board%20TRAN-11555.pdf">online biosketch</a>. He did not respond to our request for comment sent to his VA email address, which did not bounce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The VA banned Lichtenstein from conducting research for the department for at least two years, and called for notifying the journals where the tainted articles appeared of the misconduct findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lichtenstein did not appeal the findings or corrective actions, according to the Federal Register notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reused images appeared in the following 13 published papers dating back to 2003, three of which have been retracted:</p>

<p>PubPeer users posted comments identifying similarities between images in a few of Lichtenstein’s papers <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/93AA7ACE1D58B0755EECC59CD60324#1">beginning</a> in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/CD05FD7E4146DEF1DFEE340AD6A8C1#1">April</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/32332C26F3777DBD6C2C20B4AB74B8#1">2020</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three years later, in April of 2023, scientific sleuth Kevin Patrick found similarities in images in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/842EF8574E663CD811FDC8A9F07908#1">another paper</a>, which he reported on PubPeer, as well as to the journal, the VA, and UCLA.&nbsp; He went on to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F4F888D5C7D166B5C73A8C51CBCF4F#1">identify</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0C6CE690A2546370870D7402530B99#1">many</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7041D5E3ABAF04BC7CB3731371F879#1">more</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1FB415E93C6DA7A873C586F034DAD1#1">similarities</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/65ECE465453EFFBAC87EC3DBAF7116#1">in</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B8073E30880C51E43993D173B16A3C#1">additional</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0EC8CC2029FC7566B40A5D20AC5BA5#1">papers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the scale of the findings, “if the only penalty was a 2 year suspension, this does not sound severe enough to serve as a deterrent for people considering bad research practices,“ Patrick said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three papers have been retracted so far, but Patrick thinks other concerns that he flagged are ”hard to explain as an accident” and ”should probably lead the journals to retract the paper.” As an example, he cited the 2012 <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> paper in the VA’s findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0291490">pair</a> of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0291491">retractions</a> in <em>PLOS ONE</em> both appeared on Sept. 8, 2023, and list image similarities identified on PubPeer. The authors could not provide original data for either article, the notices state, so the editors decided to retract the articles. Lichtenstein was one of the authors who “either did not respond directly or could not be reached,” the notices stated, despite being the corresponding author of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094011">one</a> of the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-023-02820-5">retraction notice</a> to the 2016 <em>Oncogene</em> article, dated Aug. 31, 2023, lists all the concerns <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7041D5E3ABAF04BC7CB3731371F879#5">called out on PubPeer</a> a few months prior, even using some of the same language. The authors were unable to provide raw data, according to the notice, and the journal’s editors “no longer have confidence in the integrity of the data in this article.” Lichtenstein did not respond to correspondence about the retraction, the notice stated.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/experimental-drug-discovery-could-eventually-treat-common">press release</a> from UCLA on the publication of the 2016 <em>Oncogene </em>article claimed the scientists had discovered a “first-of-its-kind experimental treatment” for multiple myeloma. The release quoted Lichtenstein: “Though this research is only in the preliminary phases, we hope that it will eventually lead to human clinical trials and the development of new treatments for this devastating disease.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Mohammad Tayaraninajaran will talk about his paper &quot;An ensemble learning algorithm for optimization of spark ignition engine performance fuelled with methane/hydrogen blends&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The increasing global demand for sustainable and cleaner transportation has led to
extensive research on alternative fuels for Internal Combustion (IC) engines. One
promising option is the utilization of methane/hydrogen blends in Spark-Ignition (SI)
engines due to their potential to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and improve
engine performance. However, the optimal operation of such an engine is challenging due to
the interdependence of multiple conflicting objectives, including Brake Mean Effective
Pressure (BMEP), Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), and nitrogen oxide (NOx)
emissions. This paper proposes an evolutionary optimization algorithm that employs a
surrogate model as a fitness function to optimize methane/hydrogen SI engine performance
and emissions. To create the surrogate model, we propose a novel ensemble learning
algorithm that consists of several base learners. This paper employs ten different
learning algorithms diversified via the Wagging method to create a pool of base-learner
algorithms. This paper proposes a combinatorial evolutionary pruning algorithm to select
an optimal subset of learning algorithms from a pool of base learners for the final
ensemble algorithm. Once the base learners are designed, they are incorporated into an
ensemble, where their outputs are aggregated using a weighted voting scheme. The weights
of these base learners are optimized through a gradient descent algorithm. However, when
optimizing a problem using surrogate models, the fitness function is subject to
approximation uncertainty. To address this issue, this paper introduces an uncertainty
reduction algorithm that performs averaging within a sphere around each solution.
Experiments are performed to compare the proposed ensemble learning algorithm to the
classical learning algorithms and state-of-the-art ensemble algorithms. Also, the proposed
smoothing algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms.
Experimental studies suggest that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing
algorithms.</p>

<p>The <em>Journal of Biochemical and Molecular Toxicology</em>, a Wiley title, has corrected a pair of retraction notices in which “the reasons for the retraction were described inaccurately,” according to the corrections. The original notices also did not include “the authors&#8217; disapproval of the retraction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted articles, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbt.20357">The cardioprotective effects of a combination of quercetin and α-tocopherol on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats</a>,” and “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbt.20359">Protective effects of caffeic acid on lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, electrocardiogram, adenosine triphosphatases, and hematology on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats</a>,” both appeared in the same journal in 2011, but in different issues. They have been cited 35 times, collectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, Elisabeth Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DDF8121A7E2C2A111E605A9DA68157#1">posted</a> about the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/47F5FB8C8C3EE4B1458E6078F8161B#1">papers</a> on PubPeer, pointing out figures in the articles, which have the same corresponding author, were “unexpectedly similar” to each other. “Note that the lanes represent very different experiments,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130420"></span>



<p>The authors do not appear to have responded to Bik on PubPeer. The corresponding author, P. Stanely Mainzen Prince of Annamalai University in India, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal published nearly identical <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbt.23857">retraction</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbt.20359">notices</a> in September, and corrections a month later. The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbt.23866">corrections</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbt.23867">stated</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In the previously published retraction note, the reasons for the retraction were described inaccurately, and the authors&#8217; disapproval of the retraction was not reflected. This has now been addressed and corrected below.</p>



<p>The retraction has been agreed following an investigation into concerns raised by a third party, which revealed that some of the bands presented in the agarose gel electrophoresis in Figure 2 have been published in another article by one of the same authors. The gels in the two articles represent different experiments. The authors did not provide a satisfactory explanation or their original data. The editors consider the results and conclusion reported in this article unreliable. The authors disagree with the retraction.</p>



<p>We apologize for this error.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An anonymous user on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DDF8121A7E2C2A111E605A9DA68157#2">recorded the text</a> of the original notice, which called the images in the offending figures Western blots. The captions of the figures described the images as depicting agarose gel electrophoresis, a step in making a Western blot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hari K. Bhat, the journal’s editor in chief, referred our questions to Wiley staffers. We received the following response from a spokesperson for the publisher:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We regret that we made an error in the retraction statement when referencing a gel electrophoresis, which we quickly corrected. As is our standard procedure, we provided the authors with advanced notice of the retraction statement, but did not receive a response until after the retraction was published.</p>
