<p>An Elsevier journal has retracted a paper coauthored by a deputy department chair at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and says it plans to retract at least two more of his articles for image-related concerns.</p>



<p>The 2022 paper, in <em>Matrix Biology</em>, describes the regulatory role of proteoglycans in remodeling of the cervix during pregnancy. According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0945053X25000678">the August 12 retraction notice</a>, 18 of the image panels were duplicates. The paper has been cited 18 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jefferson.edu/academics/colleges-schools-institutes/life-sciences/faculty-staff/faculty/iozzo.html">Renato Iozzo</a>, deputy chair of Pathology, Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology at Jefferson, is a coauthor on the study. Neither Iozzo nor corresponding author <a href="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/14546/mala-mahendroo.html">Mala Mahendroo</a>, a researcher at UT Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<span id="more-132778"></span>



<p>The paper was first flagged <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0CCB0A34B1A2D2DD959C583833D36A">on PubPeer in May</a> in a comment noting panels in two different figures were “more similar than expected.” That same month, pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis sent the journal PubPeer comments for that paper and several others coauthored by Iozzo that had been flagged for image problems, according to correspondence Retraction Watch has seen. Three of the articles were published in <em>Matrix Biology</em>.</p>



<p>According to the retraction notice, Mahendroo “acknowledged the image duplications, unequal image sizing, and reuse of images for multiple genotypes” and said “multiple images were generated … from three biological samples.” Although the authors provided corrected images, the notice stated, the editorial team had “lost confidence in the reliability of the findings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[A]pologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process,” the notice continues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails from editor-in-chief Joanne Murphy-Ullrich to Francis that we have seen, at least two other papers by the same authors will be retracted.</p>



<p>One of them is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2017.04.002">2017 paper</a> describing a glycoprotein’s role in angiogenesis that <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1191C03797150B6E4F505D2E5F84E2">was also flagged</a> on PubPeer in May for image duplication and has been cited 59 times.</p>



<p>The corresponding author is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maurizio-mongiat-2a80956/?originalSubdomain=it">Maurizio Mongiat</a>, a <a href="https://research.jefferson.edu/labs/researcher/iozzo-laboratory/team.html">former researcher</a> at Iozzo’s lab, who is currently affiliated with the <a href="https://www.cro.sanita.fvg.it/it/">Oncology Referral Center</a> in Aviano, Italy. Mongiat did not respond to multiple email requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbplus.2020.100029">second article</a>, from 2020, looks at a glycoprotein’s role in gastric cancer and was published in <em>Matrix Biology Plus</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/matrix-biology-plus">a companion title</a> to <em>Matrix Biology</em> that is not indexed in Web of Science. The paper had problems with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9FF57B7D611B428924DB2816CF6C02">two panels that contained unexpected similarities</a>, according to the PubPeer comments.</p>



<p>Murphy-Ullrich, who is also editor-in-chief of <em>Matrix Biology Plus,</em> told Francis on May 11 figures in the 2020 paper “look flipped,” adding, “We will raise this with the authors.” She copied Elsevier publisher Lynn Sherrer on her email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a July 12 email, Murphy-Ullrich added the journal “ran our own forensics and uncovered additional issues” in Iozzo’s papers beyond those flagged on PubPeer. “We have now notified the authors of 3 of the articles that we have decided to retract these articles,” she wrote.</p>



<p><em>Matrix Biology</em> also plans to correct a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2020.10.001">2021 paper</a> that was <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F37F966B400000944CF760D2282F8C">flagged</a> on PubPeer as well, according to the email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An Elsevier spokesperson told us the publisher was still investigating the papers.</p>



<p>More of Iozzo’s works have been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=renato+iozzo">flagged on PubPeer</a> for image issues, including a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27220888/">2016 article</a> in <em>Oncotarget</em> that was <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/28657/pdf/">corrected last October</a>. And in 2019, Iozzo <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215889">lost a paper</a> for duplication, according to the <em>PLOS One</em> retraction notice. He and the other authors of the paper disagreed with the retraction.</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="635" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb-1024x635.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132769" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb-1024x635.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb-300x186.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb-768x476.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-screenshot-forweb.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Earlier this year, China’s supreme court said companies selling fake or low-quality research papers<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00612-3"> should be punished</a>. But shady middlemen there continue to offer questionable deals to journal editors across the globe in a bid to secure publications for their customers, emails obtained by Retraction Watch suggest.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-techo-email-journal-european-mathematical-society.pdf">the emails</a>, sent between May and August and using the same boilerplate language, the Nanjing-based agency A-Techo said it would pay an “expedited processing fee” of $500 to $1,000 US “per accepted manuscript to support the review process.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250905064909/https://a-techo.org/">its website</a>, the company provides various types of publication support. Signatures in the correspondence we obtained listed different names of purported assistant editors, who said they were “writing on behalf of an academic institution that supports Ph.D. researchers and faculty in publishing high-quality research.”</p>



<span id="more-132767"></span>



<p>Some journals allow authors to pay a fee to fast-track the editorial processing of their manuscripts. But when A-Techo’s proposition landed in the inbox of<a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~agricola/"> Ilka Agricola</a>, an editor of the <em>Journal of the European Mathematical Society</em>, she had no doubt about the underlying motive.</p>



<p>“It was clear to me that the ‘fast-track fee’ was a euphemism for ‘bribe,’” she told us, adding that fast-tracking is “unheard of” in mathematics. “The offer was to accept a low-quality paper for money, which would never have been accepted otherwise, in the hope that nobody would notice.”</p>



<p>Agricola, a professor at the Philipp University of Marburg, in Germany, and chair of the International Mathematical Union’s Committee on Publishing, said the entire editorial boards ”of at least two journals” had received emails from A-Techo within “a few days.”</p>



<p>”I was outraged by how brazen some of the fraudsters in this business have become, and so were my colleagues,” she told us.</p>



<p>A-Techo also targeted journals in environmental conservation science and political science with similar offers, according to emails we have seen.</p>



<p>Bribery <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fakin-it-modern-way">is nothing new</a> in academic publishing. A joint investigation by Retraction Watch and <em>Science Magazine</em> last year found a paper mill in China had<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds"> paid tens of thousands of dollars in kickbacks</a> to international editors who accepted its manuscripts. And in December, we wrote about a journal editor in the United States who had received a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/12/bribery-offers-from-china-rattle-journal-editors-are-they-being-scammed/">bribery offer</a> that also appeared to come from China. A sting by an academic and a blogger earlier this year provided more detail about <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2025/05/19/a-sting-inside-a-papermill/">how these furtive agencies operate</a>.</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250905064909/https://a-techo.org/">its website</a>, A-Techo, sometimes written A-Tech, appears to be a full-fledged paper mill, offering “End-to-end support for your publication journey, from manuscript preparation to post-publication promotion.” But there are several red flags. For instance, the site uses stock images purporting to be of staff. It also features dubious testimonials from happy customers such as ”Dr. Sarah Johnson,” who is described as a ”research scientist” at Stanford University. At least one real person with a Ph.D. is named Sarah Johnson and works as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford, but she told us she had never used A-Techo’s services and the image provided was not of her. A Google Lens search showed it was also a stock photo.</p>



<p>Reached for comment at its Nanjing number, a representative of the firm who identified himself only as ”John” said, ”What we&#8217;re actually looking for is that some journals offer some expeditious [sic] review.”</p>



<p>He said the company was “not looking for” editors “to just accept our papers or something,” but simply wanted to know if the journals had “some system that they can review the papers faster.”</p>



<p>But last year,<a href="https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=1076"> David Wood</a>, a professor at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, who edits several accounting journals, had an exchange on LinkedIn suggesting A-Techo’s tactics are less savory than the company would like them to appear.</p>



<p>As Wood<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidawood_edited-the-university-listed-in-this-and-activity-7270870295312265216-FPpK/"> wrote in the LinkedIn post</a> in December, he was contacted by an individual whose profile described him as a research assistant at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.</p>



<p>”We do not want to submit articles through the traditional process. We seek confirmation that our articles will be accepted by your journal, as we have many manuscripts ready for submission,” the person told Wood. ”For each article, we will pay an additional expedited review fee of 1,000 USD( Can be negotiate).”</p>



<p>Wood also included the text of one of the LinkedIn posts from the person who had contacted him, a ”Mizanur Rashid”: “I’m reaching out on behalf of a cultural exchange organization [&#8230;] that has helped over 18,000 research articles from top Chinese universities get published in respected journals worldwide,” the post began. “We’re looking to partner with journal editors to publish high-quality research across different fields.”</p>



<p>The domain name of the contact email address provided was “a-techo.org.”</p>



<p>”Pay-to-publish schemes taint not only the perception of objectivity but very likely objectivity itself,” Wood told us. ”Such providers should work with journal owners, not individual editors. Journal owners can then decide what is best for their journals and communicate that policy transparently to all members. There should be no back-office deals that give one group an unfair advantage over another.”</p>



<p>As Wood noted in an update on LinkedIn, both Rashid and Nanjing University later contacted him to say Rashid’s account had been ”hijacked” by ”someone not associated with the” institution.</p>



<p>Asked for comment on Wood’s post, A-Techo’s “John” said he hadn&#8217;t heard about it and asked for more information. We sent several emails with links to the post and also messaged the company on WhatsApp, but never received a response.</p>



<p>Whether for-profit publishing, in particular charging publication fees, is inherently <a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224">at odds with good science</a> has long been a matter of debate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“However, accepting papers in exchange for a fee without peer review compromises the integrity of scholarly publishing and disregards established peer review practices within the research community, regardless of the review model applied,” said Loreta Tauginienė of Kaunas University of Technology, in Lithuania, editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Academic Ethics.</em></p>



<p>Tauginienė, who is also a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics Council, told us “legal measures against paper mills should be envisaged. Precedents for such practice already exist; for example, administrative penalties are imposed on paper mills in Lithuania, and their websites are banned in Australia.”</p>

<p>A professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in Iraq has been steadily racking up retractions since 2022, with reasons ranging from<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-022-04150-z"> authorship manipulation</a> to<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838822026755"> </a><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/14/6/706">irrelevant citations</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838822026755">peer review-by-author</a> and<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13098-023-01008-x"> not providing study data</a> upon request.</p>



<p>Yasser Fakri Mustafa, who is also dean of the College of Pharmacy at the University of Mosul and editor-in-chief of the <a href="https://ojs.uomosul.edu.iq/index.php/iphr/"><em>Iraqi Journal of Pharmacy</em></a>, now has at least <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dyasser%2bfakri%2bmustafa">16 retractions</a> to his name, and more are likely to follow. One publisher told us it is actively investigating Mustafa’s work, and 81 of his<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mFg4hnMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"> more than 500 papers</a> have been<a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+yasser+fakri+mustafa"> flagged on PubPeer</a>.</p>



<p>From 2008 to 2019, Mustafa published no more than one or two articles a year, and often he had no output at all, according to the research database Dimensions. Then his output rose sharply, peaking at 120 in 2022, according to Dimensions. That same year, however, the researcher’s name appeared in a blog post by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/18/nick-wise-sleuth-publisher-taylor-francis/">Nick Wise</a> and Alexander Magazinov about<a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/10/19/the-incredible-collaborations-of-renaissance-men-and-women/"> authorship-for-sale networks</a>. The two sleuths had found several papers by Mustafa and a slew of international coauthors that matched authorship ads on various websites, including that of a<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6AE5E1D8F499A70016850496C5782F/#2"> Russia-linked</a><a href="https://science-publisher.org/"> paper mill</a> in Latvia, as<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2243EB87ACCC44E03572F8EB865A5"> they</a><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D39C28DF6FD174FF2CD3D26615E113"> documented</a> on PubPeer.</p>



<span id="more-132752"></span>



<p>An<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W9Gy4Msd9rgOHtmZdvKO-pDWeGxl8NTfikDMpQ_ywCc/edit?gid"> online list of other works</a> that match ads found on the Latvian paper mill’s website includes several articles by Mustafa that have not been retracted.</p>



<p>At least one of the dean’s retractions is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960122002274?via%3Dihub">explicitly linked to a PubPeer post</a> that shows a Facebook ad selling authorship of the paper. The retraction notice states the study was submitted by a single author in Iran and that the other authors, including Mustafa, were added during a revision of the manuscript.</p>



<p>Mustafa’s coauthors on the retracted papers include at least <a href="https://somounv.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A/">two</a> <a href="https://alayen.edu.iq/news/details/3757">former</a> Iraqi university presidents. One of them, Shafik Shaker Shafik, whose article was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838823000440">pulled in 2023 for authorship and peer-review manipulation</a>, <a href="https://en.alayen.edu.iq/news/details/3760">now heads the country’s Scientific Research Commission</a>, an organ under the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our questions, Mustafa focused on three retractions in Frontiers journals that provided little detail beyond stating that an investigation had found a “serious breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics.”</p>



<p>“In all three cases, the retractions were due to administrative and procedural concerns related to author order and not due to any academic misconduct, data falsification, plagiarism, or ethical violations,” Mustafa told us. “The research methodologies, results, and conclusions remain valid and scientifically sound.”</p>



<p>Mustafa’s statements echoed assertions by Haider Al-Aboudi, spokesperson for Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, who said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soRbv6QQB_Y">a recent news program</a> (in Arabic) the University of Mosul’s retractions were for “procedural reasons” rather than “issues of research integrity or ethics.” Of the 19 retractions the institution has earned since 2022, all but three are Mustafa’s, according to the Retraction Watch Database.</p>



<p>Citing confidentiality, Frontiers would not share information about the nature of the ethics and authorship violations it had found. But a spokesperson told us, “When investigations raise concerns, we engage with authors as well as their institutions and share relevant findings to support further review or action.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mustafa’s other retractions – in journals from publishers such as Elsevier, MDPI, Wiley, Springer Nature and Taylor &amp; Francis – offer much more detail.</p>



<p>An Elsevier journal, for instance,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838822026755"> described how</a>, “In addition to manipulation of the list of authors, acceptance of this article was partly based upon the positive advice made by a reviewer that had conflict of interest. That reviewer contributed substantively to the preparation of both the original and revised manuscripts without disclosing their involvement to the editor.”</p>



<p>And a Springer Nature journal<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13098-023-01008-x"> noted</a> “the authors have not provided the underlying data on the editor&#8217;s request. Additionally, the authors have not been able to provide documentation that ethical approval was obtained prior to commencing this study. The ethics approval number as stated in this article appears to be identical to an ethics approval number in a previously published article by some of the same authors.”</p>



<p>Mustafa declined to comment on these retractions, and his institution did not reply to repeated requests for comment.</p>



<p>But an academic at the institution told us the problems with Mustafa’s work had caused concern among several of his colleagues. “The damage to the university of Mosul is evident,” said the academic, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frontiers told us it had concluded its investigation into Mustafa’s papers, but Taylor &amp; Francis said it was “independently investigating concerns raised about a number of articles” by the dean.</p>



<p>Despite his growing number of retractions, journals continue to publish Mustafa’s papers at a brisk clip. More than 20 of his articles have appeared in Springer Nature journals since the company’s latest<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-025-36199-5"> retraction of one of his works</a> on March 6, for example.</p>



<p>We asked Springer Nature whether it was currently investigating Mustafa’s work and how it deals with authors who have had several articles retracted for serious ethics breaches. The publisher said it would get back to us, but after two weeks still has not provided comments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>All PLOS journals place a premium on scientific rigor and editorial integrity. We publish research that complies with the highest technical and ethical standards, and makes a meaningful contribution to our shared knowledge. To ensure that we achieve these priorities against an ever-changing publishing landscape, we work closely with our communities to develop and adapt our editorial standards, implementing new checks and workflows as needed to centre editorial excellence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of this work, we recently updated the standards against which we evaluate research using publicly available health and social science databases. When conducted rigorously, these studies are important for understanding prevalence and generating hypotheses for future projects. However, the datasets can <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003152">also be misused</a> for research that lacks a legitimate research question and does not make a contribution to the literature. Data dredging and &ldquo;salami slicing&rdquo; &ndash; whereby studies with closely related research questions, methods and/or results are divided into separate manuscripts to boost publication output &ndash; are particular concerns with these studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address these concerns, journal teams are working in concert with Academic Editors to ensure that all submissions meet common standards around the research question and the age of the dataset. In addition, per our long-standing guidelines, authors who wish to publish their observational studies in any PLOS journal should submit a <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/">STROBE checklist</a> alongside their manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for being part of the PLOS community and supporting our efforts to publish research that is robust, reliable and accessible to all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/09/04/updated-submissions-statistics-now-available-in-arxiv-membership-dashboards/">Updated submissions statistics now available in arXiv membership dashboards</a></h4>

              
                <p>September is here, and so are the updated arXiv membership dashboards!</p>
<p>arXiv is always free to read and free to submit to &#8211; but not free to operate. We are so incredibly grateful to our members who choose to give to arXiv every year. <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/membership.html">arXiv membership is a flexible way to support arXiv</a> and is available to universities, libraries, labs, and research institutions who appreciate the value arXiv provides to their researchers and want to help keep science free, accessible, and open for all. arXiv currently has over 200 members, and their support makes up over 60% of the arXiv operating budget.</p>
<p>In appreciation, arXiv offers a customized dashboard as a benefit of membership, which shares institution-specific usage data based on submissions over a three year period, including a subject category breakdown. These dashboards are updated annually, and we&#8217;re happy to report that the 2025 dashboards (which cover data from the years 2022, 2023, and 2024) are live!</p>
<p><strong>The Membership Dashboards &#8211; what&#8217;s new (besides the data)?</strong></p>
<p>arXiv has been providing submission data to our members since it was first requested in 2021 &#8211; our membership program is even <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/">based on institutional submission data</a>! We&#8217;ve recently made some changes both to how we present the data and how we collect this data to improve transparency, accuracy, and the member experience.</p>
<p>At the end of 2024, we updated the membership dashboard and how it is accessed. Previously, members were sent a password-protected link with an updated dashboard. Now, members must create an arXiv account to access their dashboard. This update was implemented to make the dashboards more secure and easier to share with colleagues, as well as allowing arXiv to more easily add different features to the dashboard as member data needs change. Member representatives are invited by email to create an arXiv account and access their dashboard &#8211; when the dashboard is update, a reminder email is sent. <strong>Haven&#8217;t received your invite email or having trouble accessing your new dashboard? </strong>Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2025, arXiv now collects, analyzes and presents our member submission data in-house. Over the years, arXiv has employed several different methods to parse institutional submission data. In 2021, we tracked and shared this data using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). In 2022, when MAG was deprecated, submission data was provided by <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus">Scopus</a>, the curated abstract and citation database operated by Elsevier. From 2022 to 2024, Scopus used <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html">arXiv’s open APIs</a> to collect and process the data, and returned it to arXiv to share with members. Scopus generously provided this service free of charge.</p>
<p>While the exact methodology may evolve over time, arXiv&#8217;s current approach to the data relies on detecting institutional affiliation from macros in the LaTeX source and other metadata. It is our hope that bringing the institutional affiliation detection in-house will allow us to better address member institutions&#8217; questions about data accuracy, transparency, and availability, and enable arXiv to evolve the data collection and reporting process to support our member institutions&#8217; needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why share this data?</strong></p>
<p>arXiv is a community-supported and community-led resource, and we believe sharing our data with the highest possible accuracy and full transparency is key to helping members and arXiv users understand how arXiv is being used and bringing value to the scientific community.</p>
<p>For the members who support arXiv, the dashboards help institutions build a more holistic picture of the research activities taking place across their institutions. Members will be better able to track changes in their institution’s research outputs posted to arXiv, identifying arXiv usage in different subject categories over time. For institutions, particularly librarians, this level of detail helps them to understand and report on progress towards open access and other key strategic goals. Importantly, arXiv helps institutions fulfill their mission of expanding access to scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>What other data does arXiv share?</strong></p>
<p>While the customized dashboards are only for active members, arXiv does share other data publicly. For those interested in a general overview of submissions by institution, arXiv maintains a ranked list of all organizations who use arXiv, with their average total of submitted papers <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/reports/2024_institution_submissions.html">here</a>. This list is updated annually at the same time that membership dashboards are updated.</p>
<p>arXiv also shares statistics on hourly usage rates, monthly submissions, monthly downloads, and submissions by subject <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/main">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made quite a few changes to the way we present user submission data, so if you&#8217;ve got questions, we&#8217;ve got answers! We&#8217;ve also updated our <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/submission_data_faq.html">Institutional Submission Data and Membership Dashboard FAQ</a> and you can always reach out to <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a> if you have questions about our methodologies or any discrepancies between data from year to year.</p>
<p>Thank you again to all our members for their support!</p>

<p>New <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines">retraction guidelines</a> from the Committee on Publication Ethics include more specific details about when to retract a paper, many of which address paper mill activity. For instance, journals should retract articles when “authorship of the publication cannot be verified or there are serious concerns about accountability for the research,” according to the updated guidance, released today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COPE also recommends retracting papers with “any form of misrepresentation,” including “deception; fraud (eg, a paper mill); identity theft or fictitious authorship; or undisclosed involvement of artificial intelligence (AI).”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The organization has also released a new, <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/mw2J3661">separate guidance</a> for expressions of concern. Both documents reiterate the as-soon-as-possible timeframe for notices and give more specific details on what information should be included in each type of notice.</p>



<span id="more-132727"></span>



<p>COPE chair Nancy Chescheir told Retraction Watch the organization decided to update its 2019 retraction guidelines in part due to “an uptick in the number of retractions” and “concerns raised about timeliness of retractions and the process leading up to them.” However, the most significant factor was “systematic problems with the peer review process, such as paper mills,” she said.</p>



<p>Paper mill activity has markedly increased in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/04/fighting-coordinated-publication-fraud-is-like-emptying-an-overflowing-bathtub-with-a-spoon-study-coauthor-says/">recent years</a>. One way publishers correct the record when fraudulent papers make it through the peer review process is through mass retractions of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/29/frontiers-retract-122-articles-links-thousands-other-publishers-journals-to-unethical-network/">hundreds</a> or even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">thousands</a> of papers.</p>



<p>While the prior guidelines listed “compromised or manipulated peer review process” as a reason for retraction, the new ones list specific ways the process may be compromised: “fake reviewers, paper mill use, or citation manipulation.”</p>



<p>When journals and publishers issue batch retractions for a large number of papers at once, notices should &#8220;clearly state that systematic, coordinated, and widespread manipulation of the publication process has been identified and that the article is one of a group of articles affected by the same process of manipulation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chescheir said authors who were not involved in the mass fraud might sometimes have their papers swept up in the retractions. In these cases, COPE now recommends journal editors offer the chance for the article to be “re-reviewed” before the retraction notices are published.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Like the former guidelines, the new ones include a section on timeliness of retractions, with both documents stating retraction notices should be published “as soon as possible after the editor is convinced that the publication is seriously flawed, misleading,” or otherwise unreliable. The new guidelines reiterate the point at length, and list situations that should not delay retraction, including “the authors or their institutions are not cooperative or responding promptly”, a not-yet-published letter or commentary raising “serious concerns about an article,” and “the outcome of an institutional investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andrew Grey, an associate professor at the University of Auckland, in New Zealand, and a sleuth who has identified many problematic papers leading to their retractions, told us this and other changes deemphasizing “reliance on institutional assessments of researcher behavior or publication integrity [are] welcome.” However, he said the guidance should “be stated more clearly” so it “is clear to journal staff that in the majority of cases, decisions about editorial action can be taken without waiting on the results of institutional assessments.”</p>



<p>But, he added, “the recommendation about timing of publication [of] retraction notices is too vague. Surely once a decision to retract is made, the notice should be published within a few weeks. Currently it can take many months.”&nbsp; Sometimes, journals and publishers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/01/19/my-egregious-delay-science-journal-takes-more-than-three-years-to-retract-paper-after-university-investigation/">take years to start the investigation</a>, or process the retraction <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/17/a-universitys-three-year-battle-to-retract-papers-with-fake-data/">even after receiving an institutional investigation report</a>.</p>



<p>Chescheir said COPE did not include a specific time frame because the length of the process of deciding whether to retract an article can vary widely. However, she noted the new EOC guidelines address the need to notify readers of a potential problem earlier in the process. This document recommends that an EOC be published if an investigation or resolution of a credible concern will take “some time (eg several months).”</p>



<p>The EOC guidelines also state one should be issued “if an editor of a journal determines that concerns raised about an article are substantial and credible enough to warrant alerting readers, but insufficient information is available to decide whether a correction or retraction is required.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guidelines lay out three possible resolutions to the original preliminary notice: no changes are needed, a correction or retraction needs to be published, or the concerns were unable to be resolved. The guidelines also still allow for the EOC to be a permanent outcome, as was the case in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/22/plos-one-slaps-four-papers-with-expressions-of-concern-for-overlapping-control-data/">a recent story </a>regarding four EOCs in <em>PLOS One</em>.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/30/noticed-sleuths-are-starting-to-get-credit-for-retractions/">reported in July</a>, the revised guidelines include guidance on giving credit to sleuths and readers who raise concerns about problematic papers. “If the concerns about the article were raised by a third party, their name could be included in the retraction notice, if relevant, and with permission,” the guidelines state. As our earlier story reported, while many sleuths are in favor of this type of policy, several told us it is secondary to their goal of removing unreliable papers from the literature.</p>



<p>Retraction notices should also reference external investigations when relevant, follow <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-45-2024-crec">National Information Standards Organization best practices</a>, and not be behind a paywall or other access barriers, the revised guidelines state.</p>



<p>“Sometimes a retraction notice will just say this paper has been retracted, if you even get that much information out of it,” Chescheir said. “It is really problematic that there&#8217;s not adherence to content recommendations regarding what should be in a retraction notice, because readers need the transparency about what the problem is with the paper.”</p>



<p>To create these new guidelines, Chescheir said COPE consulted editors and publishers, conducted a literature search, and looked at publishers’ research integrity pages. She said the writing group for the updated retraction guidelines included editors, publishers, individual members, and a university and research institute member. “We don&#8217;t involve [sleuths] at the front end, but certainly we anticipate we&#8217;ll get feedback from all sorts of people who are interested in this topic,” she said. “And that would be fodder for revisions, going forward.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grey suggested including “readers with experience in assessment of publication integrity and communicating them to journals.” He also said future guidelines could provide “linked recommendations for how journals should address integrity concerns.”</p>
