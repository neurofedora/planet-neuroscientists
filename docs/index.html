              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-patagonia-duck-billed-dinosaurs">New fossils from Patagonia may rewrite the history of duck-billed dinosaurs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fossils from the southern tip of Chile are adding a wrinkle to researchers’ understanding of how duck-billed dinosaurs conquered the Cretaceous world.</p>



<p>Duck-billed dinos known as hadrosaurids were highly successful and lived on most continents by the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 million years ago. Now, a study shows that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg2456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an older duck-billed lineage</a> appears to have thrived some 72 million years ago in subantarctic South America, potentially millions of years before hadrosaurids reached the continent, researchers report June 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>“It’s yet another chapter in the dispersion of these dinosaurs that we did not know about,” says Jhonatan Alarcón-Muñoz, a paleontologist at the University of Chile in Santiago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About a decade ago, paleobiologist Marcelo Leppe of the Chilean Antarctic Institute in Punta Arenas was searching for plant fossils in the Río de las Chinas Valley in Chile’s Magallanes region when he spotted fossilized bones. After bringing the finding to the attention of Alexander Vargas, a paleontologist at the University of Chile, researchers extracted the bones for study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alarcón-Muñoz, Vargas, Leppe and their colleagues determined the bones belong to a new type of duck-billed dinosaur — herbivorous giants that had flattened, waterfowl-like snouts. The remains included many body parts, with pieces of hip, limbs, ribs, vertebrae and skull recovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers named the animal <em>Gonkoken nanoi</em>, “gon” and “koken” being the words for “similar to” and “wild duck or swan” in the language of the Indigenous Aónikenk people from the part of southern Patagonia where the bones were found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In all, the researchers suspect they found four distinct <em>Gonkoken</em> individuals. No remains of other animals were found with them, suggesting the dinosaurs were probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/duck-billed-dinosaurs-roamed-arctic-herds">moving in a herd</a>, Vargas says (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/9/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Gonkoken</em> isn’t like other known South American duck-billed dinosaurs, or like any from the old southern supercontinent of Gondwana, which included what came to be South America. Until now, all known duck-billed dinosaurs from Gondwana were hadrosaurids, which had their heyday in the late Cretaceous and had such efficient, stacked, plant-pulverizing teeth that they chewed their way to nearly global dominance, outcompeting other herbivorous dinosaur groups. <em>Gonkoken</em> appears to be part of an older, less specialized lineage that diverged from other duck-billed dinosaurs around 91 million years ago, before the first hadrosaurids evolved, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Gonkoken</em>’s ducklike snout had a simpler construction than that of hadrosaurids, Alarcón-Muñoz says, and it had fewer rows of teeth in its chewing surface. <em>Gonkoken</em> was also relatively small — about four meters long — while some hadrosaurids were true titans, reaching about 15 meters in length.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing a non-hadrosaurid duck-billed dinosaur in South America like <em>Gonkoken</em> is “somewhat unexpected,” says David Evans, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the research. The discovery “makes us rethink their biogeographic history in the Americas in interesting ways.”</p>



<p>For example, rather than a single colonization of the continent, the team thinks that duck-billed dinos arrived in South America from North America in two separate waves. “We suspect our kind of duck-billed dinosaur arrived earlier into South America and reached further south than the hadrosaurids,” says Alarcón-Muñoz, describing <em>Gonkoken</em> as a relict. “In most other places of the world, this kind of dinosaur had already gone extinct by this time.”</p>





<p>The findings may also mean that hadrosaurids were not quite as widespread as previously thought. Fragmentary remains in southern Patagonia and Antarctica that were thought to belong to hadrosaurids may actually be <em>Gonkoken</em> or its close relatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many other outcrops along the Río de las Chinas are studded with dinosaur bones. The researchers want to examine these to see if they belong to <em>Gonkoken</em> as well. &nbsp;Finding more skull bones of <em>Gonkoken</em>, Evans says, could be key for figuring out exactly how it was related to other duck-billed dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-tipping-trouble-climate-cerrado">The Amazon might not have a ‘tipping point.’ But it’s still in trouble</a></h4>

              
                <p>The shore of a sea of nearly 400 billion trees winds through the central Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. Here, the Amazon rainforest rubs up against the Cerrado, the world’s largest savanna.</p>



<p>The two are distinct worlds — one a wet and verdant jungle, the other relatively dry and blanketed in wild grasses, shrubs and small trees. But no clear line demarcates the Amazon and the Cerrado. Instead, there’s a messy transition zone, a continuum of vegetation that grows taller toward the rainforest. Over thousands of years, the boundary ebbs and flows, driven by natural fluctuations in climate.</p>





<p>“But in this formula is a new element,” says ecologist Beatriz Marimon of Mato Grosso State University in Nova Xavantina. Humans, with their ambitions to domesticate the land, she says.</p>



<p>About half a century ago, throngs of people started streaming into the region along new highways, clearing forest for farmland and cattle ranches, she says. Fifty years is a blink in the life span of a forest nearly as old as the dinosaurs, but it’s plenty of time for humans to remodel a landscape.</p>



<p>In 2007, earth system scientist Carlos Nobre, now at the University of São Paulo, and his colleagues suggested that much of the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL030612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon could transform into a savanna</a> if deforestation exceeded 40 percent of the forest’s original area, which was mostly whole before the 1970s. </p>



<p>About a decade later, after accounting for interactions between climate change, deforestation and fire, Nobre and a colleague offered a more dire warning. If <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat2340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 20 to 25 percent of the Amazon was deforested</a> and global warming reached about 2.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the ecosystem could collapse and much of the forest could transform into savanna and shrubland, they found. Today, humans have already deforested about 17 percent of the overall Amazon, and damaged much more, estimates suggest.</p>

<p>That the Amazon may transform into something else after reaching a point at which it cannot cope with exacerbating conditions — a “tipping point” — has raised alarms. Such a shift would imperil the forest’s storied biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions of people. It would also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-could-flip-parts-amazon-carbon-sponge-source-2050">release immense volumes of carbon dioxide</a> and alter the global circulation of heat, vastly complicating efforts to slow climate change (<em>SN Online: 1/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>The Amazon is in grave trouble, scientists agree. Human activities and climate change are exacerbating the dry season; in some areas, it lasts four to five weeks longer than decades ago. Fires have also become more fierce. All of that is stressing the forest out.</p>



<p>But much like the physical transition separating the Amazon from the Cerrado, the forest’s limit is probably not defined by a single, clear tipping point, many scientists now say. The Amazon is no monolith. Different parts may react to threats in different ways, Marimon says.</p>





<p>A multitude of poorly understood factors affect the forest’s fate: The myriad forms of human actions. Climate change. The diverse capabilities and adaptations of plants. The ambit of underground water.</p>



<p>Ongoing research is clarifying if, when and where conditions may push the forest beyond its limits, and could help inform efforts to save the forest from potential widespread dieback. These are urgent tasks, as it’s not yet clear how much time may remain to save the forest, or if it’s already at the brink of some irreversible shift, says Matt Finer, director of the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project, or MAAP, based in Washington, D.C. In either case, he says, “we’re kind of probably the last ones with the option to ponder that.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Felling the Amazon</h4>



<p>Ecologically speaking, the Amazon is without equal. It accounts for more than half of Earth’s remaining tropical forests, through which roughly 17 percent of the world’s river water flows. It also houses about 1 in 4 of the world’s land-dwelling species. That unfathomable bonanza includes its flowers: More types of flowers bloom in the Amazon than there are stars visible to the naked eye in the night sky. What’s more, each year the rainforest absorbs about 5 percent of the world’s annual CO<sub>2</sub><strong> </strong>emissions from fossil fuel burning and land use changes, with its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">carbon reserves</a> weighing as much as 230 million blue whales (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>Much of this vitality is sustained by the trade winds, which blow east to west across the forest from the Atlantic Ocean. The winds carry sea-born moisture into the eastern parts of the forest, where it precipitates. Once fallen, some of this water evaporates back into the air. Much of it soaks into the soil. It’s absorbed by roots, courses up through plant stems and tree trunks, and is then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forest-trees-reduce-global-warming-climate-cooling-carbon">transpired through leaves</a> back to the sky (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 9</em>). A single tree in the Amazon can pump 500 liters of water into the atmosphere each day.</p>



<p>Winds whisk the moisture hundreds of kilometers deeper into the forest, where it rains on more trees. A single molecule of water may repeat this cycle more than five times before exiting the forest basin. The Amazon waters itself.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The rainforest as rainmaker</h3>



<p>Winds carry moisture into the eastern Amazon, where it falls as rain. Much of it soaks into the soil, where some water is taken up by roots and ultimately transpired through leaves back into the air. Winds then carry this moisture deeper into the forest, where the cycle repeats (left). But cutting down trees reduces the water taken up by roots and evapotranspiration (right). That breaks the cycle, increasing local runoff and reducing rainfall in the interior.</p>

<p>But this arrangement has vulnerabilities. If enough of the forest’s eastern expanses are cut down, moisture may run off and out of the basin rather than sail into deeper sections of the forest that need it, Finer says. “That deforestation cuts off the whole system.”</p>



<p>Already, <a href="https://maaproject.org/2022/amazon-tipping-point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 30 percent of the Amazon’s eastern third</a> has been cleared, Finer and colleagues reported in a 2022 MAAP report. Deforestation averaged across the whole forest may not yet have crossed that 20 to 25 percent threshold, but “in that eastern third, it’s way worse,” Finer says. If that destructive trend continues in the east, it could decapitate the Amazon’s skyborne streams of moisture, he says. Finer doesn’t think the forest has yet crossed a tipping point, but, like other scientists, stresses it could be hard to know for years.</p>



<p>Even if this rain recycling goes bust, the forest’s western region — about a third of its expanse — could still hold out. This area is backed by the towering Andes, which wring westbound winds of water and ensure that heavy rain falls upon nearby forests. The area’s lush vegetation shouldn’t suffer too terribly from distant deforestation, Nobre says.</p>



<p>Deforestation doesn’t just harm the tracts where trees are felled. The warming and drying that follow in deforestation’s wake may spill over into the edges of intact forests nearby, affecting which plant and animal species persist there. That’s one of the many ways forests become degraded, a condition that’s often less obvious than outright clear-cutting.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it’s pervasive. About 38 percent of the remaining <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon rainforest has been degraded</a>, researchers reported in January in <em>Science</em>. That’s an area equivalent to nearly a third of Brazil, or more than three times the size of Texas.</p>



<p>Degradation can take many forms, with repercussions that vary depending on the damage’s nature, intensity and scope. Fires can raze parts of the rainforest. If the burned land is left alone, Amazon plants typically return on their own, bursting forth from seeds and roots in the soil. But severe fires can destroy these buried remnants too, denying some species the chance to return. As such, the forests that grow back often lack the diversity of their predecessors. Where humans have repeatedly burned the land in the past, the forest may recover more slowly and be dominated by just a few fire-resistant species even after two decades.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, selective logging can open a forest’s closed canopy, ushering in sunlight to heat and dry the understory, killing some plants, exacerbating fires and pushing out animals.</p>



<p>Where degradation reduces vegetation, it shrivels transpiration. For each leaf lost, the forest’s moisture loses one little gate back into the sky. During a typical dry season, severely degraded forests may release 34 percent less water back to the sky. That loss directly sabotages the forest’s rain recycling, imperiling trees that depend upon it.</p>



<p>Because degradation can unfold in so many ways, computer simulations that project changes in the Amazon’s vegetation cannot say exactly how it may contribute to a tipping point.</p>



<p>“It’s logical to think that such degradation helps push the system towards the tipping point, if it really exists,” says earth system scientist David Lapola of the University of Campinas in Brazil. But “we can’t today say this percentage of degradation will make the system tip to another stable state.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A drier future</h4>



<p>The Amazon isn’t just dealing with deforestation and degradation, of course. Over the last 50 years, the average annual temperature across the forest has climbed <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00228/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 0.6 degrees C</a>. And exceptionally severe droughts have struck the forest three times in the last two decades. Some climate models suggest that by 2060, such extreme drought conditions could occur as often as 9 in every 10 years.</p>



<p>Recent climate simulations suggest that if such drought years became the new “climate normal,” patches of the rainforest may transition to a different state — whether that be savanna or a more open or dry forest — at different times, not all at once.</p>



<p>Some of these localized shifts could trigger a domino effect, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2120777119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing nearby areas to also shift</a>, researchers reported last year in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The Amazon’s southeastern forest appears to be highly vulnerable to local diebacks, while areas downwind to the west seem to be liable to the domino effect.</p>



<p>Projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, which coordinates and standardizes climate projections, also point to localized Amazon diebacks. For a 2022 study, researchers examined projections from <a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phase-6-cmip6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sixth phase of the project, or CMIP6</a>, analyzing models that simulate the response of vegetation to climate change. Five of the seven analyzed CMIP6 models indicate that the risk of sudden, local diebacks will climb as the world reaches and surpasses 1.5 degrees C of global warming above preindustrial levels.</p>



<p>But no two projections completely agree. Even when the same amount of climate change is assumed, CMIP6 models produce different pathways, with diebacks occurring at different points. One model predicts diebacks could begin around 1.3 degrees C of warming, another at about 1.7 degrees C.</p>



<p>The lack of agreement comes in part because these models — and others used to predict the Amazon’s fate — make different assumptions about the complex nature of the world’s greatest rainforest.</p>



<p>Taking a closer look at that complexity may reveal ways in which the forest is more — or less — resilient than we think.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hidden nuance in the trees</h4>



<p>Often, talk of “the Amazon” evokes visions of dense, dripping vines and trees. But the forest is actually a messy medley of ecosystems. There are the vivacious várzeas — floodplains occupied by dense forests, grasslands and swamps that, for months of the year, become inundated under nutrient-rich water, which sustain an abundance of fauna and flora.</p>



<p>The várzea’s uliginous counterpart, the igapós, consists of swamp forests that also flood seasonally, though with nutrient-poor waters as dark as maté, steeped in tannins leached from decaying plants. Igapó trees grow slowly, but they grow dense and excel at sequestering carbon.</p>



<p>Then there are the diverse terra firme, the tall, thick, closed canopy jungles that cover the uplands, above the flood line. Even naturally occurring white-sand savannas can be found within the Amazon’s borders. As for trees, roughly 230 species are thought to dominate the forest, while <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1243092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 16,000 species have been cataloged</a> in the basin.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, research projects often simulate the Amazon’s vegetation as relatively homogenous, says earth system scientist Marina Hirota of the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis, Brazil. They cast every tree as a broadleaf evergreen tree, the forest as a monoculture. These simplified simulations, called “big leaf” models, prevail because researchers lack data, Hirota says, but the models don’t do the forest justice.</p>



<p>Over millions of years, the forest’s myriad plant communities have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved differently to cope with local rainfall pattern</a>s. Research suggests that projections may not fully capture how the lush diversity of plant traits affects the Amazon’s ability to endure and adapt to stress like climate change–induced droughts.</p>

<p>Take for instance, embolism resistance. When soils dry, plants may inadvertently suck bubbles of air into their vascular systems, causing a sometimes-lethal blockage called an embolism. Tree species inhabiting the more drought-prone central eastern Amazon tend to grow slower but be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05971-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more resistant to embolism</a> and vascular collapse than species in the forest’s west. Hirota, Marimon and their colleagues reported this finding in April in <em>Nature</em> after studying 129 tree species from 11 plots across the Amazon. The work suggests rainfall patterns have shaped plant communities’ capacities to cope with drought.</p>



<p>Then, there’s what lies underground — the groundwater — which is poorly captured by many simulations. Most investigations into the forest’s response to drought have focused on upland areas overlying deep water tables, which roots struggle to access. But about half of the Amazon may stand atop a relatively shallow water table. That accessible groundwater could sustain plants through droughts in ways that models don’t account for, says ecologist Flávia Costa of Brazil’s National Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus.</p>



<p>Such areas could serve as drought refugia, Costa says: “Places that do not suffer.” But if drought gets too severe and groundwater recedes beyond the reach of roots, refuges could become ruinous. “Those places may be the ones that suffer the most because the plants are not adapted” to dry conditions, she says.</p>



<p>Hirota, Marimon and others are still studying how Amazonian plants are coping with drought to amass more information about what Hirota calls plants’ “life strategies.” The goal is to use the data to improve existing vegetation models and simulate more accurately the diverse responses to climate change and land use changes.</p>



<p>This research, and other investigations into the many capabilities and adaptations of the Amazon’s plants, will be necessary to better inform projections of the Amazon’s fate, Hirota says. The same, Costa says, goes for the influence of groundwater.</p>



<p>A third source of uncertainty in figuring out the Amazon’s fate wafts invisibly through the air. Researchers had previously suggested that an atmosphere richer in CO<sub>2</sub> might boost the forest’s growth, potentially offsetting some of the tolls of climate change. Some experts had even proposed that this “atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization” could preclude a massive forest dieback.</p>



<p>But CO<sub>2</sub> and sunlight aren’t all that’s needed for growth. Plants also consume nutrients from soils, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-created-amazon-dark-earth">Amazonian soils are notoriously lacking</a>, especially in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphorus-earth-earliest-life-forged-lightning-chemistry">phosphorus</a> (<em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 10</em>;<em> SN: 4/10/21, p. 7</em>). Using computer simulations for a 2019 study, Lapola and colleagues found that a dearth of phosphorus would probably reduce the projected growth gains associated with more abundant CO<sub>2</sub> by about 50 percent over 15 years. The team’s conclusion: Previous projections may have overestimated the benefits of extra carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>No large-scale experiments have yet tested the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization on the Amazon. But Lapola and colleagues have almost finished constructing steel towers that will spray carbon dioxide over mature groves in the Amazon, to see how the trees respond. It may still take years to acquire meaningful results.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What comes next?</h4>



<p>At this point, scientists don’t have enough information to say when, or if, the Amazon will cross some threshold beyond which it becomes unrecognizable, Lapola says. Today’s computer models are trying to open doors into the future, to peer beyond thresholds and see what’s ahead for the Amazon. But with the data available today, “we’re looking into a room from the hole of the lock.”</p>



<p>That a web of local diebacks could unravel across the forest is worrisome, but that fragmented fate may carry more hope than a single catastrophic switch, Hirota says. For one, it could help dissuade people from writing the forest off as a lost cause after crossing some predicted limit.</p>



<p>Resignation is a serious concern, Nobre says. “If we take for granted that the tipping point has already been exceeded, then people say forget it.”</p>



<p>Nobre aims to restore some of the forest’s most deforested areas, to tilt the Amazon away from that momentous tip, or to at least rein in the lengthening of the dry season. He and others have called for extensive reforesting along what they call arcs of restoration. “One arc over the southern Amazon, another one along the Andes,” he says. Such work hasn’t yet begun.</p>



<p>Even if it does, restoration alone cannot succeed if deforestation and degradation continue. It takes far less time to timber a tree than to grow one.</p>



<p>Not all human activity has harmed the forest. People from Indigenous groups have acted as stewards of the forest’s biodiversity for millennia. Plants that they domesticated long ago, such as Brazil nut trees and umari trees, are still abundant in some areas near ancient settlements. Today, Indigenous territories as well as protected areas make up more than half of the forest in the Brazilian Amazon. Since 2000, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-01018-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 5 percent of forest loss</a> has occurred on these grounds. Working with the people living in these areas to stave off further deforestation and degradation will be key, researchers say.</p>



<p>But the forest’s fate will depend on more than restoration and conservation efforts in South America. Greenhouse gases emitted by nations around the world are driving many of the challenges the Amazon faces.</p>



<p>And Marimon implores people to stop buying Amazonian beef and other products that fuel the engine of deforestation. Around 75 percent of the land deforested in the Amazon is used as pastures for grazing cattle, and Brazil is now the world’s largest exporter of beef.</p>

<p>Taking real steps to change behavior is in the best interest of all who call this planet home. Beyond the Amazon’s irreplaceable biodiversity, beyond its colossal carbon stores, there are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-teleconnections-droughts-fires">wind and ocean currents</a> that connect the forest to regions across the globe (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 9</em>). Amazonian temperature anomalies have been linked to anomalies in the Tibetan Plateau, where glaciers that supply around 2 billion people with drinking water are shrinking, and to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.</p>



<p>Back in Mato Grosso, Marimon suspects that the changes she’s witnessed there could eventually unfold across much of the Amazon. Year after year, more trees disappear and the air is getting hotter. Insects that once buzzed about in throngs have vanished. And in some places, the piercing shrieks of the capitão da mata — an iconic, vociferous bird — have vanished. Shrieks that warned to all who heard them: Danger is afoot.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-mechanics-sound-split-phonon">Physicists split bits of sound using quantum mechanics</a></h4>

              
                <p>You can’t divide the indivisible, unless you use quantum mechanics. Physicists have now turned to quantum effects to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg8715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split phonons</a>, the smallest bits of sound, researchers report in the June 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>It’s a breakthrough that mirrors the sort of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-entanglement-communication-security-bell-test">quantum weirdness</a> that’s typically demonstrated with light or tiny particles like electrons and atoms (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>). The achievement may one day lead to sound-based versions of quantum computers or extremely sensitive measuring devices. For now, it shows that mind-bending quantum weirdness applies to sound as well as it does to light.</p>





<p>“There was no one that had really explored that,” says engineering physicist Andrew Cleland of the University of Chicago. Doing so allows researchers “to draw parallels between sound waves and light.”</p>



<p>Phonons have much in common with photons, the tiniest chunks of light. Turning down the volume of a sound is the same as dialing back the number of phonons, much like dimming a light reduces the number of photons. The very quietest sounds of all consist of individual — and indivisible — phonons.</p>



<p>Unlike photons, which can travel through empty space, phonons need a medium such as air or water — or in the case of the new study, the surface of an elastic material. “What&#8217;s really kind of, in my mind, amazing about that is that these sound waves [carry] a very, very small amount of energy, because it&#8217;s a single quantum,” Cleland says. “But it involves the motion of a quadrillion atoms that are all working together to [transmit] this sound wave.”</p>



<p>Phonons can’t be permanently broken into smaller bits. But, as the new experiment showed, they can be temporarily divided into parts using quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>Cleland and his team managed the feat with an acoustic beam splitter, a device that allows about half of an impinging torrent of phonons to pass through while the rest get reflected back. But when just one phonon at a time meets the beam splitter, that phonon enters a special quantum state where it goes both ways at once. The simultaneously reflected and transmitted phonon interacts with itself, in a process known as interference, to change where it ultimately ends up.</p>



<p>The lab demonstration of the effect relied on sound millions of times higher in pitch than humans can hear, in a device cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero. Instead of speakers and microphones to create and hear the sound, the team used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-designer-molecules-quantum-device-qubit">qubits</a>, which store quantum bits of information (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>). The researchers launched a phonon from one qubit toward another qubit. Along the way, the phonon encountered a beam splitter.</p>



<p>Adjusting the parameters of the setup modified the way that the reflected and transmitted portions of the phonon interacted with each other. That allowed the researchers to quantum mechanically change the odds of the whole phonon turning up back at the qubit that launched the phonon or at the qubit on the other side of the beam splitter.</p>



<p>A second experiment confirmed the quantum mechanical behavior of the phonons by sending phonons from two qubits to a beam splitter between them. On their own, each phonon could end up back at the qubit it came from or at the one on the opposite side of the beam splitter. </p>



<p>If the phonons were timed to arrive at the beam splitter at the exact same time, though, they travel together to their ultimate destination. That is, they still unpredictably go to one qubit or the other, but they always end up at the same qubit when the two phonons hit the beam splitter simultaneously.</p>



<p>If phonons followed the classical, nonquantum rules for sound, then there would be no correlation in where the two phonons go after hitting the beam splitter. The effect could serve as the basis for fundamental building blocks in quantum computers known as gates.</p>





<p>“The next logical step in this experiment is to demonstrate that we can do a quantum gate with phonons,” Cleland says. “That would be one gate in the assembly of gates that you need to do an actual computation.”</p>



<p>Sound-based devices are not likely to outperform <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">quantum computers that use photons</a> (<em>SN: 2/14/18</em>). But phonons could lead to new quantum applications, says Andrew Armour, a physicist at the University of Nottingham in England who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s probably not so clear what those [applications] are at the moment,” Armour says. “What you&#8217;re doing is extending the [quantum] toolbox…. People will build on it, and it will keep going, and there&#8217;s no sign of it stopping any time soon.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-xi-why-large-language-models-are-not-conscious/">Notes on consciousness. (XI) Why large language models are not conscious</a></h4>

              
                <p>The current discussions about AI are plagued
with anthropomorphism. Of course, the name “artificial intelligence” has
probably something to do with the matter. A conscious artificial intelligence might
sound like science-fiction, but a sentient statistical model certainly sounds a
bit more bizarre. In this post, I want to address the following question: are
large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, or more generally deep learning
models, conscious? (perhaps just a little bit?)</p>



<p>The first thing that must be realized is that
the question of what it takes for something to be conscious is a very old
question, which has been the subject of considerable work in the past. The
opinions and arguments that we read today are not original. Very often, they
unknowingly repeat common arguments that have been discussed at length in the
past. It might seem for the general public or AI engineers that the spectacular
successes of modern AI programs should bring a new light on these old
questions, but that is not really the case. These spectacular programs already
existed 50 years ago, just as thought experiments: which for logical arguments
makes no difference at all. For example, in 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Searle
articulated an argument</a> against the idea that a
program that seems to behave like a human would necessarily have a mind. The
argument was based on a thought experiment, where an average English-speaking
person would apply the operations of a sophisticated program that takes a
question written in Chinese as input and outputs an answer in Chinese. Searle
argues that while that person is able to have a conversation in Chinese by
mechanically applying rules, she does not understand Chinese. Therefore, he
concludes, understanding cannot be identified with the production of acceptable
answers. Now such programs exist, and their existence does not change anything
to either the argument or the objections that have been raised then. All these
discussions were precisely based on the premises that such systems would exist.</p>



<p>This is an important preamble: a <em>lot</em>
has been said and written about consciousness, what it means, what it takes for
something to be conscious, etc. Answers to these questions are not to be found
in current AI research but in the philosophy literature, and whether a program
produces convincing answers to questions, or can correctly categorize images,
bears very little relevance to any of these discussions. A corollary is that AI
engineering skills provide no particular authority on the subject of AI
consciousness, and indeed, as far as I can tell, many arguments we hear in the
AI community on this subject tend be rather naïve, or at least not original and
with known weaknesses.</p>



<p>Another important remark is that, while there
is a lot of literature on the subject, there is no consensus whatsoever in the
specialized community on those questions. Views on consciousness go from
consciousness does not exist (eliminativism/illusionism) to everything is
conscious (panpsychism(s)). In my view, there is no consensus because there is currently
no convincing theory of consciousness (some say that there can be no theory of
consciousness, which is another proposition on which there is no consensus).
There are good reasons for this state of affair, which I scratched <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-explained-with-sex/">here</a> and <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-x-why-i-am-not-a-panpsychist-reading-notes-on-philip-goffs-galileos-error/">there</a> (and others have too, obviously).</p>



<p>This remark is important because I have seen
it become an argument for why a particular artefact <em>might</em> be conscious: we
don’t know what consciousness is exactly, or what it takes for something to be
conscious, therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that something in
particular is conscious.</p>



<p>However, this is a fallacy. We do not know
what it takes for an entity to be conscious, but we certainly do know that
certain entities <em>cannot</em> be conscious, if the meaning we give to this
notion must have some vague resemblance with its usual meaning.</p>



<p>Now, I will make a few general points against
the idea that LLMs, or more generally formal deep neural networks, are
conscious, by discussing the concept of a “conscious state” (i.e., “how it
feels like now”).</p>



<p>Once we remove the buzzwords, such as
“intelligence”, “learning”, etc., a modern deep learning model is essentially a
massively parallel differentiable program. In effect, it is essentially a tensor
calculator, the state of which is updated by a series of iterations.</p>



<p>The default assumption in the computational
view of mind is that a mental state is something like a program state. But a
conscious state is a very particular kind of state. First of all, a conscious
state has a subject (the entity that is conscious) and an object (what it is
about). Both relate to well-known topics in philosophy of mind, namely the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/">unity of consciousness</a> and the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-intentionality/">intentionality</a> of consciousness.</p>



<p>When we wonder whether something is conscious,
that thing is typically an organism, or a machine, or even, if you adopt <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-x-why-i-am-not-a-panpsychist-reading-notes-on-philip-goffs-galileos-error/">panpsychism</a>, a rock or an atom. But we could
consider many other combinations of molecules and ask whether they are
conscious. How about the entity made of a piece of my finger (still attached to
my body) plus two coins in a fountain in Rome? This seems absurd, but why? There
is a reason why: two objects that do not interact at all have the same
properties whether we look at them one by one or together. New properties above
the individual elements can only arise if there is some kind of interaction
between the elements. So, if neither my finger nor any of the coins is
conscious, then the combination is not conscious either. Thus, we can say that
a necessary condition for a set of components to constitute a subject is that
there is some causal integration between the components. This is actually the
basis of one particular theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory
(which I have criticized <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-ix-why-integrated-information-theory-fails/">here</a>, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/qd4z9">there</a> and <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/modern-panpsychism-about-the-integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/">there</a>, essentially because a necessary condition is
not a sufficient condition). If a deep learning network is conscious, then
which layer is the subject?</p>



<p>I leave this tricky question hanging there to address the more critical ones (but in case you want to dig, look up these keywords: <a href="http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f17/phil204A/readings/Varela%201979%20Principles%20of%20Biological%20Autonomy.part1.pdf">autonomy of the living</a>, biological organism, biological agency). One is the question of intentionality: the fact that a conscious state is about something: I am conscious of something in particular. A large language model is a symbol processing system. The problem is that it is humans who give meaning to symbols. The program is fed with sequences of bits, and outputs sequences of bits. If one asks an LLM “What is the color of a banana?” and the LLM replies “yellow”, does the program understand what a banana is? Clearly, it doesn’t have the visual experience of imagining a banana. It has never seen a banana. It doesn’t experience the smell or touch of a banana. All it does is output 0100, which we have decided stands for the word banana, when we input a particular stream of numbers. But the particular numbers are totally arbitrary: we could choose to assign a different sequence of numbers to each of the words and we would still interpret the computer’s output in exactly the same way, even though the program would now have different inputs and outputs. So, if the program has a conscious experience, then it is about nothing in particular: therefore, there is no conscious experience at all.</p>



<p>This is known as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_grounding_problem">symbol grounding problem</a>”, again a well-known problem (which I examined in the context of “<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">neural codes</a>”). Many people consider that a necessary ingredient has to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition">embodiment</a>, that is, the idea that the machine has to have a body interacting with the world (but again, careful, necessary does not mean sufficient). It seems that it is Yann Le Cun’s position, for example. Again, it is not clear at all what it takes for something to be conscious, but it is clear that there can be no conscious experience at all unless that experience is somehow about something, and so the symbol grounding problem must be addressed.</p>



<p>These are well-known problems in philosophy of
mind. The final point I want to discuss here is more subtle. It relates to the
notion of “state”. In computationalism (more generally, functionalism), a
conscious state is a sort of program state. But there is a big confusion here. Both
terminologies use the word “state”, but their meaning is completely different.
A state of mind, an experience, is not at all a “state” in the physical sense
of pressure, volume and so on, that is, the configuration of a system. Consider
a visual experience. Can it be the case that to see something is to have the
brain in a certain state? For example, some neurons in the inferotemporal
cortex fire when a picture of Jennifer Anniston is presented: is the visual
experience of Jennifer Anniston the same as the active state of the neuron? If
the answer is positive, then why should you have the experience, rather than
that neuron? Otherwise, perhaps the neuron <em>triggers</em> the experience, but
then we need to assign the experience to the state of some downstream neurons
and we face the problem of infinite regress.</p>



<p>The issue is that an experience is simply not
a physical state; to treat it as such is a category error. To see this,
consider this thought experiment, which I called the “<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9">Bewitched thought experiment</a>” (self-quote):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>In the TV series Bewitched, Samantha the housewife twitches her nose and everyone freezes except her. Then she twitches her nose and everyone unfreezes, without noticing that anything happened. For them, time has effectively stopped. Was anyone experiencing anything during that time? According to the encoding view of conscious experience, yes: one experiences the same percept during the entire time, determined by the unchanging state of the brain. But this seems wrong, and indeed in the TV series the characters behave as if there had been no experience at all during that time.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>It would seem bizarre that people experience
something when their brain state is maintained fixed. That is because to experience
is an <em>activity</em>, not a thing. Therefore, a system cannot experience
something just by virtue of being in some state. The vector of activation
states of a neural network is not a conscious “state”. It is not even false: it
is a category error. So, when a deep network outputs a symbol that we associate
to Jennifer Anniston, it doesn’t actually <em>see</em> Jennifer Anniston. Having
the output “neuron” in a particular state is not an experience, let alone an
experience <em>of</em> seeing Jennifer Anniston.</p>



<p>All these remarks, which tend to show that the
application of tensor calculus does not produce conscious experience, can be
perplexing because it is hard to imagine what else could possibly produce
conscious experience. Current “artificial intelligence” is our best shot so far
at mimicking consciousness, and I am saying that it is not even a little bit
conscious. So, what else could consciousness be then?</p>



<p>My honest answer is: I don’t know. Will we
know someday? I also don’t know. Should it be possible, hypothetically, to
build a conscious artifact? Maybe, but I don’t know (but why not? I don’t know,
how then? I also don’t know). I wish I did know, but I don’t find it particularly
bizarre that certain things are still unexplained and unclear. It doesn’t mean
that there’s nothing interesting to be said on consciousness.</p>



<p>But in any case, I want to point out that the
“what else” argument is a self-destructive argument. Asking “what else?” is
just admitting that you have no logical argument that allows you to prove your
proposition. This is not an argument, but rather an admission of failure (which
is fine).</p>



<p>Anyway: I don’t know what it takes for
something to be conscious, but I think we can be fairly confident that LLMs or
deep networks are not conscious.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">Why is the North Atlantic breaking heat records?</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the past few weeks, sea-surface temperatures in some parts of the North Atlantic Ocean have soared to record heights.</p>



<p>The anomalous warming is occurring in a large swath stretching almost one-third of the way across the Atlantic westward from the northwestern coast of Africa. Satellite data reveal that some surface waters in the area are almost 4 degrees Celsius (about 7 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of the year, says Brian McNoldy, a meteorologist at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla.</p>





<p>“There’s been record-breaking warmth since March, but even more so now,” he says.</p>



<p>On June 10, for instance, the average sea-surface temperature for the portion of the Atlantic that stretches from the equator to 60 degrees north — up to southern Norway, southern Greenland and the central portions of Canada’s Hudson Bay — was 22.7° C (nearly 73° F). That’s about 1 degree C higher than the average recorded from 1991 through 2020, McNoldy notes. The previous record for the same date, 22.1° C, occurred in 2010.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hot Atlantic</h3>



<p>Sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic in 2023 (red) have been breaking daily records since March. In this plot, the 1982–2022 daily mean temperatures have been subtracted from this year’s temperatures as well of those from 1982 to 2022 (gray).</p>

<p>This year’s warmer-than-normal waters might help strengthen storms that form in the eastern Atlantic and eventually spawn hurricanes, scientists say.</p>



<p>What’s causing the unusual warm-up isn’t clear. But here’s a rundown of several factors that might be at play.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A dearth of Sahara dust</h4>



<p>Occasionally, vast swathes of desert dust from the Sahara waft across the ocean. They are carried by winds stirred up by a semipermanent high-pressure system dubbed the “Azores high” due to its proximity to those islands.</p>



<p>But lately, the Azores high has weakened and shifted southwest away from Africa. So those winds that typically pick up and transport Saharan dust westward over the North Atlantic are calmer and largely dust free, says Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>





<p>As a result, solar radiation that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-thermostat">normally would be scattered back into space by the dust</a> reaches the ocean surface, warming the dark waters (<em>SN: 9/25/01</em>).</p>



<p>If and when the trade winds strengthen, increased dust from Africa could help cool the area somewhat.</p>

This spring, a lack of dusty air has contributed to warming of the North Atlantic.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3128945">NOAA</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Decreased air pollution</h4>



<p>In 2020, new emissions rules kicked in for long-haul container ships that spew sulfate-rich exhaust plumes. There’s been some speculation that less pollution could lead to more heating. With fewer plumes scattering sunlight back into space, more radiation reaches the sea surface.</p>



<p>But some studies suggest that the cooling effect of ship plumes may have been minor to begin with: Not only do the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ship-tracks-exhaust-studies-overestimate-cooling-pollution-clouds">exhaust plumes have a short life span</a>, the pollutants can cause natural clouds to evaporate more quickly and thus lead to warming, not cooling (<em>SN: 2/1/21</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Global warming trends</h4>



<p>This year marks the return of El Niño, a climate phenomenon whose hallmark is warmer-than-normal sea-surface temperatures along the equator west of South America. By winter, there’s a more than 4 in 5 chance that the El Niño will be either strong or moderate, according to scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center.</p>



<p>Each El Niño <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fizzled-2014-el-nino-fired-ongoing-monster-el-nino">has its own personality</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/16</em>). But in general, El Niño boosts average surface temperatures both on land and at sea worldwide, Mann says. Human-caused climate change has done the same, he notes.</p>



<p>But there’s still a lot of uncertainty about how current conditions may affect the coming forecast.</p>



<p>The unusually warm waters of the North Atlantic may tend to strengthen storm systems that later develop into tropical depressions and then hurricanes. But the El Niño that’s now developing in the equatorial Pacific may hamper their formation by strengthening winds in the upper atmosphere that can shear the tops off nascent hurricanes. How active <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atlantic-hurricane-season-prediction">this year’s hurricane season</a> will be depends on which of these forces will prevail, scientists say (<em>SN: 5/26/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alternative splicing is well known to add a tremendous layer of complexity to eukaryotic transcriptomes, increasing exponentially the amount of information that can be stored in a single genomic region; this also offers opportunities for regulatory mechanisms. Traditional comparative transcriptomics is focused on the aim of assigning gene orthology across distantly related organisms, but transcriptome complexity driven by alternative splicing can make this task more and more challenging as genetic distance increases: intron density and distribution can vary by orders of magnitude across taxa. For this reason, focusing on orthologs does not explain the whole evolutionary history, may introduce bias, and can miss important variations throughout evolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this study, complexity metrics independent from orthology, developed with a transcriptome analysis software (TranD), are used to compare the dynamics of conditioning on orthologs versus whole-transcriptome complexity metrics. Instead of separately analysing single genes to estimate their evolutionary distance between species, this method treats whole-genome transcriptome splicing as a global phenotype that can shift across species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such an approach is able to mitigate bias issues and to capture genetic novelty more efficiently than ortholog-based approaches. It is also able to reveal higher degrees of complexity in taxa that were thought to be among the least complex. This represents a step forward in the emerging field of non-model evolutionary genomics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Training materials simulating clinically relevant scenarios are effective for medical teaching but require much organizational and financial effort. Virtual Reality (VR) technology promises to overcome such barriers and has shown significant educational value in some clinical domains, but its value for training Basic Life Support skills has still to be supported by evidence, especially considering its critical importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this study, the authors evaluated a VR immersive simulator designed for this purpose, considering its validity (is it an accurate representation of the real world training?) and fidelity (does it elicit realistic psycho-behavioral responses from trainees?), taken as major predictors of learning efficiency. Twenty-two medical trainees were asked to perform basic life support tasks on a VR mannequin in a VR environment, then on a real-world mannequin in a real-world setting. The researchers focused on whether behaviors such as self-reported feelings and perceptions or measured eye movement data, as well as performance parameters, were similar between the VR and real-world simulations on a person-by-person basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Results showed that the VR simulation passed the validity test: it was sufficiently immersive to make participants feel ‘present’ and they could properly perform procedural assessments. However, movement-based interactions indicated a limited fidelity, as participants displayed higher self-reported workloads, longer times to task completion, and disrupted attentional responses in the VR environment. This suggests that VR may be limited for improving visuomotor skills of Basic Life Support, but is potentially valuable for transferring perceptual and procedural abilities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Biostimulants are eco-friendly, non-toxic, biodegradable compounds that promote plant growth and enhance crop productivity, reducing disease risk and plant stress. One of the commonest biopolymers used as biostimulants for organic agriculture is chitosan, a component of fungal cell walls. Chitosan is known to stimulate plant growth, but is also able to elicit plant immunity through the activation of multiple defense-related mechanisms. Plant growth and immunity might become competitive upon chitosan treatment. What happens then to the growth-defense trade-off?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To answer that, researchers exposed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Calendula officinalis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> (marigold) to chitosan and measured an impressive number of parameters including the overall biomass, root and shoot growth, and the levels of several steroids and triterpenoids (responsible for plant growth and immunity, respectively). A general growth inhibition and decreased steroid levels were observed, similarly to what has been demonstrated in other models upon chitosan treatment or fungal infection. Chitosan elicitation had a variable effect on specialized triterpenoid metabolites, which may increase, decrease, or stay unchanged. Overall, the observed effects were different from expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These results indicate that chitosan treatment might not always result in enhanced plant growth and fitness: this is a reminder that agricultural solutions, including organic ones, are not universal and require accurate investigation before application.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clinical ethics consultations have always been widely debated, as there can be competing interests, differing moral values, and disagreement in any given encounter between a patient and an ethics consultant. With the advent of “open notes” in the clinical domain, free, real-time notes are available to patients through online portals, raising concerns about issues such as end-of-life care, autonomy, religious and cultural conflict, and confidentiality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The authors of this Review consider a narrative-based approach: whose story is being told through open notes? Shared notes can be reviewed and improved by patients, leading ethics committees to better understand their perspectives and map different viewpoints; however this can be time-consuming and not always action-guiding. The authors also focus on content: what should not be shared? There are indeed cases in which sharing would be unnecessary, or even harmful for the patient, so openness would not be recommended, thus undermining transparency and the feeling of trust. For sure, there are already aspects of all clinical encounters that regularly go undocumented… but is it really an issue? Is there a price to pay for openness? Is sharing always appropriate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, open notes complicate the documentation of clinical ethics consultations, but this comes with more transparency, relational trust building, and improved patient autonomy. Discussions on clinical ethics consultations are widespread, but interlinking that with the era of open notes is a fresh view on the topic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Circadian rhythms are intrinsic cyclical patterns of gene expression and metabolism that enable organisms to adapt to their changing environment, and are regulated by self-generated molecular clocks. In bacteria, the underlying mechanisms have been well characterized in cyanobacteria, but similar schemes have been recently reported in other microorganisms at the population level, especially in terms of composition and function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This Review guides readers through some of the most fascinating cases of microbial circadian clocks: from the classic example of cyanobacteria controlled by a three-component negative feedback loop based on cycles of protein sequestration and modification, to the viral-transmitted capacity to produce proteorhodopsin-mediated light-sensitive oscillations in the oceanic bacterioplankton, without forgetting the cyclical effects that, conversely, microorganisms can have on their environment, as in the case of gut microbiota impacting host metabolism in a circadian manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A comprehensive understanding of the multiple ways bacteria affect and are affected by environmental time patterns has yet to be achieved. There are many things that we do not know about how endogenous clock systems work across life domains, but it is only a matter of time before new, fascinating mechanisms are discovered.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-orbit-blazar">A supermassive black hole orbiting a bigger one revealed itself with a flash</a></h4>

              
                <p>A long-suspected black hole may have finally come out of hiding.</p>



<p>A monstrously massive black hole in a distant galaxy probably has a smaller companion that orbits it every 12 years. But that tiny partner has never been detected. Now, astronomers claim to have seen <a href="https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAS242/ViewSubmissionFile.aspx?sbmID=78&amp;mode=html&amp;validate=false&amp;key=1yfTp1QbH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a flash of light coming directly from the smaller black hole</a> for the first time.</p>



<p>“We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said astronomer Mauri Valtonen on June 7 at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Albuquerque.</p>





<p>Astronomers have been watching this object since the 1880s, when it showed up in a survey of asteroids as a brilliant point of light. That point of light, now dubbed OJ287, is a blazar. Among the brightest-looking objects in the universe, blazars are supermassive black holes that launch bright jets of radiation into space, and those jets happen to point almost directly at Earth. This one sits about 3.5 billion light-years away.</p>



<p>Sometimes, OJ287 shines even brighter than usual. For the past 40 years or so, astronomers have noticed that the object has a dramatic jump in brightness every 11 to 12 years.</p>



<p>In 1996, Valtonen and his colleague Harry Lehto, both of the University of Turku in Finland, suggested that the outbursts could be due to one supermassive black hole orbiting an even more massive black hole. Both black holes are probably behemoths, the astronomers calculated: The smaller is around 150 million times the mass of the sun, and the bigger is around 18 billion solar masses. For perspective, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">black hole in the center of the Milky Way</a> is about 4 million solar masses (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>The bigger black hole is thought to be surrounded by a disk of white-hot gas and dust, which glows at many wavelengths of light. If the smaller black hole exists, then every time it plunges through that disk, it would trigger a flash of light — thus explaining the recurring outbursts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch a black hole plunge through another black hole’s disk | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06bhnoYfPU4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This animation shows a flash of light that a smaller supermassive black hole in the blazar OJ287 emits when it crashes through the disk of gas and dust swirling around the other more massive black hole it orbits.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But until now, no light had been detected from the second black hole itself. Its presence was merely inferred from those regular flares.</p>



<p>Valtonen and his colleagues predicted that the most recent flare should arrive in January or February 2022 and arranged to monitor OJ287 every day using telescopes on Earth and in space. The team saw flares like the ones they had seen before, but there was a new flare that was different. It was bright and quick, fading after one night.</p>



<p>The team proposed that this flare came from a jet created by the smaller black hole pulling material out of the disk as it approached, before the collision.<a></a></p>



<p>“It swallows a whole lot of disk matter,” Valtonen said. “That matter falls into the secondary black hole, and you get a huge flare.”</p>



<p>Previous observations missed that flare because it is so short. The team almost missed it in 2022, due to bad weather. “We never observed OJ287 night to night to night [before], this was the first time,” he said. “That’s why we saw it.”</p>





<p>Some researchers have suggested other ways for a single black hole to give off the same pattern of light. If the team’s interpretation is correct, then it marks the first time the second black hole has been seen directly, Valtonen says.</p>



<p>“The detection of the second black hole should put an end to this discussion,” he says. “More generally, this could be the beginning of work on secondary jets in binary black hole systems, which could open up a new research field, now that we have at least one concrete example to study.” If other binary black holes make similar flashes as the smaller black hole crosses the larger one’s disk, astronomers now know how to look for them.</p>



<p>The observations do suggest the presence of a second black hole, says Caltech astronomer Seppo Laine, although other ideas are still possible.</p>



<p>“Mauri has been basically pushing this supermassive black hole binary model for decades now,” Laine says. “It doesn’t completely confirm it, but if this interpretation is correct, then it’s a significant step forward.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it may be difficult to test. The short flares come only once a decade, so astronomers need to be ready the next time. To resolve the two black holes directly, Valtonen says, might take a radio telescope in space.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/horses-humans-robots-technology">How understanding horses could inspire more trustworthy robots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Throughout history, cowboys have shared epic tales of horses that have taken them home on dark, foggy nights. Legendary horses have even carried wounded soldiers through battle zones.</p>



<p>Sensible and highly trained, these horses remind computer scientist and roboticist Eakta Jain of fully autonomous robots, specifically self-driving cars.</p>



<p>Vehicles today have different levels of autonomy, with level zero or one relating to an antilock braking system. Level two or three has adaptive cruise control, the ability to follow lanes or park. Such volition builds all the way to level five, which is full autonomy.</p>





<p>Those horses that take a rider home are level five, Jain says. “You trust them with your life.”</p>



<p>Interested in how that trust develops and if it could help improve human-robot interactions, Jain, of the University of Florida in Gainesville, immersed herself in the horse world during a year-long sabbatical that ended in 2022. Her experiences gave her a vast amount of information to address open questions about how humans should interact with robots of differing levels of autonomy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Only recently have researchers started focusing on the earliest stages of human-robot interaction, such as the creation of first impressions,&#8221; Jain and University of Florida colleague Christina Garner-McCune <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581245" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in the April <em>Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em></a>. &#8220;Our work seeks to uncover principles for the stage after the first meeting.”</p>



<p>During her sabbatical, Jain watched equine classes at her university, where she took notes based on her observations and conversations with students, teaching assistants and the instructor. She also spoke with other trainers and horse owners. And she learned to ride.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had never interacted with a horse before,&#8221; Jain says. &#8220;I was a new rider learning to interact with a horse who was not a new horse [to riding], but it was still the early stages of relationship building.&#8221;</p>



<p>When working with horses that are new to interacting with humans, the animals must learn how to interpret and appropriately respond as trainers do basic handling, such as leading and brushing them. This training helps ready horses for more advanced handling, such as accepting the saddle and bridle and carrying a human on their first few rides. New riders must learn the intricacies of how horse behavior communicates information and what cues horse handlers can use to direct horses to perform desired actions or correct the horse when it doesn&#8217;t behave as expected.</p>



<p>Analogously, people must learn how to command robots to perform specific tasks. They also must learn what to do when interactions with robots don&#8217;t go according to plan. Robots need to respond to inputs from humans in a predictable way. But more autonomous robots, like horses, must also dynamically respond to changing conditions, such as a self-driving car stopping to avoid hitting something, even when humans command it to continue forward.</p>



<p>In human-horse partnerships, horses primarily communicate nonvocally. For instance, their ears tend to point toward whatever they&#8217;re paying attention to. This behavior could inspire the creation of robots with electronic &#8220;ears&#8221; that can swivel in the direction of a ringing doorbell or people talking near an autonomous vehicle, thereby alerting humans to these sounds, Jain says. &#8220;Instead of the robot saying, &#8216;Knock on the door. Beep, beep,&#8217; if its ears were to point toward the door, it&#8217;s a much less jarring, much more subtle way of informing&#8221; people that the robot hears something it&#8217;s paying attention to.</p>



<p>Such subtleness could also be used as a sign of respect. Trainers and riders work with horses intensively to build respect. Horses nonvocally communicate their respect for their trainers and riders by matching their pace or giving them safe personal space when they walk. The horses&#8217; ears even point toward trainers as a show of respect when they&#8217;re paying attention to them. Trainers require that horses show signs of respect in basic interactions before &#8220;they will move on to the next, more complicated interaction,&#8221; Jain says. Respect can grow into trust. But, even with experienced horses and riders, trust is not a given.</p>



<p>There may be a similar limitation with robots. “Perhaps the same types of nonverbal expressiveness that&#8217;s used in the human-horse context can be used to communicate that the robot respects the human,&#8221; Jain says, which &#8220;might make humans feel safer around robots. It might make them more open to working with a robot.&#8221;</p>





<p>Probing what it means for robots and humans to respect and trust each other is largely uncharted territory, Jain says. Understanding how respect and trust grow between horse and human could be a game-changer.</p>

<p>Hundreds of conference papers published by the U.S.-based <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers</a> (IEEE) show signs of plagiarism, citation fraud and other types of scientific misconduct, according to data sleuths.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am concerned that the issue with these particular conferences is widespread enough such that it indicates systemic issues with their peer review systems,&#8221; <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/">Kendra Albert</a> wrote last August in an email to IEEE that Retraction Watch has seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Albert is a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School and a lecturer in women, gender, and sexuality at Harvard University. On the side, Albert has been working with <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a>, a professor of computer science at the University of Toulouse, in France, to ferret out research misconduct using a computer system called the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1:::NO:::">Problematic Paper Screener</a>.</p>



<span id="more-127299"></span>



<p>The tool flags <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">tortured phrases</a>, which suggest a publication&#8217;s authors have copied work from other researchers and tried to disguise the offense by using paraphrasing software that also renders scientific terminology near-unintelligible. &#8220;Breast cancer&#8221; might become &#8220;<a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/01/bosom-peril-is-not-breast-cancer-how-weird-computer-generated-phrases-help-researchers-find-scientific-publishing-fraud/">bosom peril</a>,&#8221; for instance, whereas &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; could turn into “counterfeit consciousness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;IEEE keeps publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:3::::RIR:IRC_PUBLISHER:IEEE">proceedings riddled with tortured papers</a>&nbsp;and other anomalies,&#8221; Cabanac told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The publisher said it believes its “preventive measures and efforts identify almost all papers submitted to us that do not meet our standards,” and told Retraction Watch that it is “currently evaluating the papers in question.”</p>



<p>IEEE has faced problems with peer review in the past, as we reported last year when <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/06/publisher-retracts-400-papers-at-once-for-violations-of-peer-review-process-policies/">it pulled 400 conference papers</a> at once. In previous years, IEEE has retracted <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.362.6413.393">thousands of papers</a>, accounting for <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?pub%3dIEEE%253a%2bInstitute%2bof%2bElectrical%2band%2bElectronics%2bEngineers">a sizeable chunk of the retractions in our database</a>.</p>



<p>In their email, Albert cited <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402320">a paper</a> in the <em>2021 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics </em>whose abstract begins: &#8220;Tumor growth is the real reason for death on the planet, furthermore, lung disease is the most every now and again observed sort of Tumor growth among others.&#8221;</p>



<p>The paper also contains tortured phrases – say, &#8220;arbitrary backwoods&#8221; instead of &#8220;<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm">random forest</a>&#8221; – as detailed in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/50DDBF8DC43A68C777DB3434301326">a PubPeer comment</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;This paper claims to be a survey of machine learning tools for detection of lung cancer, however, the abstract is incoherent, many of the citations are to irrelevant literature on epilepsy detection via EEG, and much of that literature is incorrectly summarized as being about lung cancer detection,&#8221; Albert wrote. &#8220;It is unclear to me how any reasonable peer review process would accept such an article.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article&#8217;s senior author, <a href="https://www.andhrauniversity.edu.in/college/college-of-engineering/engineering-departments/cse.html">K. Venkata Rao,</a> professor and head of the department of computer science and systems engineering at Andhra University in India, did not respond to requests for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>According to Albert:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Many other papers published in IEEE conference proceedings and flagged by the Problematic Paper Screener and reviewed by human assessors found </em><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F84436C345782643CCB1059BBC7027"><em>clear plagiarism</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4D7A2E37F710120D5FB2D36E1E218E"><em>signs of citation fraud</em></a><em>, or </em><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D59728BA838CF42FAE584DB9B62542"><em>errors of a type that should have been caught by an editing process</em></a><em>. Of note, few, if any, of the authors have responded to PubPeer inquiries about the irregularities in their papers.</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">How so many suspicious papers could slip through peer review is unclear. But an interview with a university researcher familiar with the issue suggests one possible answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal from his institution, said he recently submitted an article to a conference that is “technically sponsored” by IEEE and organized by his university (we are withholding the name of the conference to protect his identity); proceedings from such conferences are available for purchase from IEEE. When the researcher learned that a pair of colleagues would be reviewing his paper, he reported this conflict of interest to the conference chair. The chair, however, told him it was standard procedure to recruit reviewers from the host institution, which also supplied most of the papers for the conference, according to the researcher.</p>



<p>&#8220;What they do is to motivate all the faculty members and students to submit a low quality article which will be accepted through a fake peer review by a fellow colleague,&#8221; the researcher said in an email. &#8220;If the submitted articles in such events were reviewed independently by the international experts in the field no article can get accepted.&#8221;</p>



<p>Not only does this system provide a large number of ostensibly peer-reviewed publications for the host institution, it can also be exploited to ensure that the organizers&#8217; work is cited in the submitted papers, the researcher explained. He added that the &#8220;systematic misconduct&#8221; was &#8220;not limited to IEEE conferences,&#8221; and cautioned that not all of the publisher&#8217;s conferences are tainted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;There are numerous correct IEEE conferences with” acceptance rates of “only 30%,” the researcher said, “where the independent or external chairs handle peer reviews.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As a potential starting point for an investigation, Albert supplied IEEE with a list of 15 conferences whose proceedings contained up to 49 flagged articles each.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, not all papers flagged by the Problematic Paper Screener are indicative of scientific misconduct,&#8221; Albert wrote, &#8220;but the high numbers from these conferences, combined with the findings from our manual reviews suggests that this is likely to be a systemic problem rather than an isolated one.&#8221;</p>



<p>We reached out to the chairs of three conferences &#8212; the <em>2022 Fourth International Conference on Emerging Research in Electronics, Computer Science and Technology</em>, the <em>2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Systems</em>, and the <em>2022 5th International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Informatics</em> &#8212; whose proceedings have drawn <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0772F57BC6A8418C56A661D0D5A051">criticism</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DB12341A71942DF98D59EEBA867118">on</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/569CBBD9A1AEA3F46D14002E90498C">PubPeer</a>, but did not hear back.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Monika M. Stickel, an IEEE spokesperson, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>IEEE continuously reviews and improves our processes to ensure that we detect articles that do not meet our standards and that are reported to IEEE. We believe our preventive measures and efforts identify almost all papers submitted to us that do not meet our standards, and we act accordingly when we are alerted to an error and take the appropriate level of care and time in our review. IEEE is currently evaluating the papers in question. Our policy for removing a paper or providing a label is contingent on the outcome of our evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, IEEE is still selling hundreds of suspicious papers on its website. The gibberish-laden article about lung-cancer detection, for example, can be purchased for $33.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/one-photon-photosynthesis-light">One photon is all it takes to kick off photosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>For photosynthesis, one photon is all it takes.</p>



<p>Only a single particle of light is required to<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06121-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spark the first steps</a> of the biological process that converts light into chemical energy, scientists report June 14 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>While scientists have long assumed that the reactions of photosynthesis begin upon the absorption of just one photon, that hadn’t yet been demonstrated, says physical chemist Graham Fleming, of the University of California, Berkeley. He and colleagues decided “we would just look to see was it really true that one photon was enough to start the whole thing off.”</p>





<p>The sunlight that falls on Earth’s surface seems brilliant to human eyes. But on small scales, that translates to a dribble of photons. Only a few tens of photons of the appropriate wavelengths of sunlight fall on a square nanometer per second, the scale of the tiny chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll molecules that are central to photosynthesis in plants and bacteria.</p>



<p>Many laboratory experiments on photosynthesis use lasers, much more powerful light sources, to kick off the reactions. Instead, Graham and colleagues used a source of light that produces just two photons at a time. One photon served as a herald, going off to a detector to let researchers know when two photons were released. The other photon went into a solution containing photon-absorbing structures from the photosynthetic bacterium <em>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</em>. These structures, called light-harvesting 2 complexes, or LH2, are made up of two rings of bacteriochlorophyll and other molecules.</p>



<p>In a normal photosynthesis reaction, LH2 absorbs a photon and passes its energy to another LH2 complex, and then another, like a game of hot potato. Eventually the energy reaches another type of ring, called the light-harvesting 1 complex, or LH1, which then passes it to the reaction center where the energy is finally converted into a form that the bacterium can use.</p>



<p>In the experiment, there was no LH1, so the LH2 instead emitted a photon of a different wavelength than the first, a sign that energy had been transferred from the first ring of LH2 to the second, a first step of photosynthesis. The researchers detected that second photon, and by comparing the detection times to those of the initial herald photons, confirmed that the LH2 needed to absorb only one photon to kick things off.</p>



<p>Plants and bacteria use different processes for photosynthesis, but the initial steps are similar enough that in plants, too, a single photon would set off the initial steps, Fleming says. However, in plants, multiple independently absorbed photons are needed in order to complete the reaction.</p>



<p>The role of single photons isn’t surprising, says biochemist Richard Cogdell of the University of Glasgow in Scotland. The important thing the researchers have done, he says, is to demonstrate the new technique. “By doing this you’re able to essentially interrogate what will be happening in nature,” he says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Some scientists suspect that photosynthesis <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/algae-use-quantum-trick-harvest-light">relies on quantum physics</a> (<em>SN: 2/3/10</em>). While it’s not clear whether the new technique could resolve the role of quantum effects, it could help scientists disentangle natural effects from artifacts of using intense sources of light in studies of photosynthesis.</p>



<p>“You can really work out what’s happening in the early reactions in photosynthesis as it were outside,” says Cogdell, “[as if] you could shrink yourself down and watch these photons moving around.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polyester-bees-brew-beer-scented-baby-food">‘Polyester bees’ brew beer-scented baby food in plastic cribs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Female <em>Ptiloglossa</em> bees are single moms with a lot to do and little time. Fortunately, they can use a feathery tongue to make infant-care plastics and then brew up batches of baby food.</p>



<p>“We jokingly call them polyester bees,” says pollination ecologist Stephen Buchmann of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>Chemically, the bee-made plastic is a cousin of human-made polyesters. A big gland on a female’s abdomen secretes Tinkertoy-like molecules of repeating lactone compounds, each with its “ester” structural bit that gives polyester its name.</p>

Inside each she starts a batch of fermenting pollen from <em>Solanum</em> nightshade flowers (middle), watery nectar from <em>Agave</em> (far left) and bacteria. The microbes add nutrition and a boozy fragrance.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125277">Bill Singleton</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The stuff makes the finishing touch for little urn-shaped nursery chambers that mother bees dig underground. They use their paintbrush tongues to lick up the gland secretion and slather it on nursery walls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plastic layer is transparent, tough and “can be kind of crunchy,” Buchmann says. It’s “thought to keep the brood chamber area nice and cozy, high-humidity and also to keep out the bad guys.”</p>





<p>These moms are doomsday preppers. In the <em>P. arizonensis</em> Buchmann studies in Arizona, females have only a few weeks to fill plastic retreats with all the food each youngster needs for much of a year underground before its own, brief reproductive frenzy in sunlight. Each generation of big, fast-flying bees grows up floating in, and feeding on, nothing but mom’s limited-edition brew of nectar and pollen — which smells like beer.</p>



<p>Many other bee species mix their baby food of pollen and nectar to “a kind of Play-Doh consistency,” Buchmann says. “Poke it and it dents.” Food stored in a cellophane bee nest, however, is different.</p>



<p>Open and tilt a nursery of baby <em>Ptiloglossa</em> bees “and all this stuff would run out it’s so watery,” Buchmann says. That’s probably because of the unusually watery nectar these polyester bees collect. Much of it comes from the candelabra-shaped bloom spikes of agave plants, runny enough for easy slurping by bats in southeastern Arizona and Sonora, Mexico.</p>



<p>To see what’s in the beer-scented brew, bee microbiome researcher Tobin Hammer of the University of California, Irvine, recruited Buchmann to collect several plastic-making <em>P. arizonensis</em> bees as well as relatives in the larger group called cellophane bees. Collecting the bees, their brood cells, food gatherings and source flowers took several years, mostly of waiting. Bees fly aboveground only a few weeks a year, and then for only about two hours around dawn.</p>



<p>“Quite shocking,” is Buchmann’s summary of what he found. Despite the beery smell of the food that <em>P. arizonensis </em>puts in the plastic vats, he says, “lo and behold, no yeast!”</p>



<p>These bees’ microbial fermenters didn’t evolve anywhere in the vast fungal kingdom. Instead, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10113673/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fermenters are mostly lactic acid bacteria</a>, Hammer, Buchmann and colleagues reported April 5 in <em>Frontiers in Microbiology.</em> The bees’ baby food glop is not yeasty beer but, Hammer says, closer to yogurt or sauerkraut.</p>

<p>Buchmann doubts that young bees take moms’ bacterial culture along when they leave home. Youngsters go through much of their early growth without pooping as far as bee science knows. Then they defecate “all at once,” Buchmann says. This clears the gut of the microbes, and the ejected wastes get separated from the youngster as it wraps itself in silk for its next stage of life. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The aboveground world that youngsters eventually join offers plenty of replacement bacteria. It flourishes in flowers — or “plant genitals,” as Buchmann calls them in his new book <em>What a Bee Knows</em>. Somehow the variety of microbes bees encounter gets winnowed down for baby food, lab analyses suggest. Just how is still an open question.<strong></strong></p>



<p>What the great coming-of-age poop does resolve for human sensibilities is the thought of how bee larvae without diapers can feed month after month on food they’re floating in.</p>

<p>For doctors treating traumatic injuries, keeping a patient’s blood in their body is “one of the most fundamental problems of survival,” <a href="https://charlesbarberwriting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Barber</a> writes in his fast-paced new book, <em>In the Blood</em>.</p>



<p>Solutions to that problem haven’t changed all that much in centuries. Doctors can pack a wound with gauze or put pressure on blood vessels to slow bleeding. While other areas of medicine have leaped ahead over time, Barber notes, emergency medicine has largely stood still, an inertia that’s had deadly consequences. Some 50,000 people in the United States bleed to death every year.</p>





<p>You’d think, then, that a product that can stanch bleeding would be celebrated in the streets, snapped up immediately by military doctors and emergency rooms alike. You’d be wrong. <em>In the Blood </em>chronicles the invention and bafflingly slow adoption of QuikClot and its successors, inexpensive clotting agents that can stop big bleeds in minutes. Barber, who’s also written about criminal justice and mental health, leads readers on the path from product invention to implementation — and it’s a treacherous journey.</p>



<p>Barber starts his story, which races like a thriller, in Mogadishu, Somalia, at the scene of the 1993 battle that inspired the movie <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. After two American helicopters were shot down, John Holcomb, then a U.S. Army major, and other doctors treated dozens of injured soldiers, many of whom died from loss of blood.</p>



<p>That horrific experience electrified Holcomb. Better hemorrhage control was urgently needed, and he was the man to lead the charge. In 2002, Holcomb became head of the Army Institute of Surgical Research, a research laboratory focused on improving combat casualty care. Holcomb championed the development of different clotting candidates, including HemCon, a bandage containing a shrimp-shell chemical, and Factor Seven, an injected drug that boosts the body’s clotting capability, sometimes lethally, it turned out.</p>



<p>In Barber’s telling of the story, Holcomb’s character is complex, shifting between savior and villain. Under his watch, the Army poured millions of dollars into his favorite products. It’s hard to grasp what motivated Holcomb, but Barber argues that he was long unwilling to consider other options — like QuikClot — data be damned. QuikClot seemed to be more effective than the rest. But it didn’t come with a big Army budget or a biotech company’s backing. It was born in an inventor’s basement.</p>



<p>The inventor was Frank Hursey, a mild-mannered engineer from Connecticut who discovered in 1983 that the ground-up mineral zeolite could mop up the water in blood. By concentrating the molecules involved in clotting, Hursey’s invention sped up the process. In 1999, he partnered with “swashbuckling salesman” Bart Gullong, who helped develop and promote the product. Barber pulls readers into their adventure, though he occasionally meanders too far into their backstories.</p>



<p>The action picks up when Barber digs into the evidence behind different clotting agents. He describes clear-cut animal tests, moving accounts from soldiers in the field and reports linking Factor Seven to stroke, heart attack and death. A central question of the book, then, is not so much “How do you stop a hemorrhage?” as “How do you get a hemorrhage-stopping product to the people who need it?”</p>



<p>Hursey and Gullong were up against entrenched military and pharmaceutical interests from the get-go. The company that produced Factor Seven aggressively marketed the drug, Barber reveals, even in the face of its flaws. It’s clear that he is rooting for the underdogs. He lays out facts for readers like a mason placing bricks, building a solid case against a system where money sways whether a medical product gets used. Even when the data suggest it shouldn’t.</p>



<p>In 2008, Holcomb finally recommended an improved version of Hursey’s invention, called QuikClot Combat Gauze, for use in the military, “an almost unimaginable victory,” Barber writes. In recent years, QuikClot gauze has made its way into hospitals, and consumers can now buy it on Amazon for $18.99. </p>



<p>Though Hursey remains largely unknown, Barber calls his discovery “paradigm-shifting.” Hursey “took bleeding control largely out of the hands of doctors,” Barber writes, “and put it into the hands of police officers, EMTs, adventurers, soldiers, hikers, and moms and dads.”</p>

<p>One of the first studies of long COVID has been retracted and replaced seven months after editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/01/buzzy-lancet-long-covid-paper-under-investigation-for-data-errors/">marked it with an expression of concern</a> citing “data errors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original paper, “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32656-8/fulltext#section-3d6acba1-acea-4be2-8dc9-b7e14e5b6583">6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study</a>,” was published in <em>The Lancet</em> in January 2021. It was “the first large cohort study with 6-months’ follow-up” of people hospitalized with COVID-19, according to an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673621004463#bib1">editorial</a> published simultaneously, and has been cited more than 2,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The World Health Organization, for example, <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/97337498/policy-documents">cited it</a> in several documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last November, the article <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02370-4/fulltext">received an expression of concern</a> stating that a researcher had contacted the journal about inconsistencies between that study and a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01755-4/fulltext">paper</a> published in August 2021, also in <em>The Lancet</em>, describing the same cohort of patients after one year of follow up.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127303"></span>



<p>“In view of the extent of these data errors,” the notice stated, the journal editors issued the expression of concern while they conducted a review of corrected data the paper’s authors had submitted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the expression of concern, the work was cited by some 400 other papers.</p>



<p>After their investigation, the editors decided to retract the article and replace it with a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00810-3/fulltext#%20">corrected version</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01175-3/fulltext">notice</a> about the action published June 9.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction and replacement notice describes the steps the journal editors took in their investigation, which involved statistical review of the data changes the authors requested, a clinician’s review of the differences between the 6-month and 1-year follow-up questionnaires, review of the Chinese versions of the questionnaires by <em>The Lancet</em>’s China editors, and asking the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, with which corresponding author Bin Cao is affiliated, to verify the corrected data. All aspects of the investigation turned out in favor of the authors. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given these results, we invited a resubmission with the corrected data, and organised formal peer review of the fully revised paper with the corrected data by all the previous clinical reviewers and the statistical reviewer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cao, who <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990488/">has been described</a> as “a leading researcher in pneumonia and influenza” who “has been instrumental in increasing knowledge about COVID-19,” did not immediately respond to our request for comment. [See update at end of post.]</p>



<p>Last year, <em>The Lancet</em>’s impact factor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/28/the-lancet-more-than-doubles-its-impact-factor-eclipsing-nejm-for-the-first-time-ever/">surpassed</a> that of the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, long the top-ranked medical journal, in large part due to the papers it published about COVID-19, five of which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">have been retracted</a>. One of those articles <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-controversial-hydroxychloroquine-study/">was retracted</a> after sleuths questioned whether its data were real, and the company that sourced the data, Surgisphere, would not produce it for review.</p>



<p>Update, 6/14/23, 0000 UTC: Cao tells us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I really appreciate the comments from a reader about data and symptom questionnaire inconsistencies between 6-month and 1-year outcomes in hospital survivors with COVID-19. The comments help us reanalysis of both database and find the errors at last. Though the changes did not make difference of the conclusions, I replied the reader with great appreciation and emailed editor of the Lancet. When The Lancet published an Expression of Concern on Nov 24, 2022, I got much pressure from media, because the media guess the Concern means retraction. But as a physician scientist, I understand thevalidity of data is more important. We followed the gudieline of the Lancet to re-peer review all the data and questionnaire, even though we did not know whether we could republish the paper or not. The re-peer review is a long journey for me.</p>



<p>Now the readers who are interested in Long COVID can read the&nbsp;confirmed and corrected data from 6-month consequeces of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital. This cohort is unique because these patiens are those infected with original SARS-CoV-2 stran at the beginning of the pandemic. My colleagues and I are following these patients now and try to answer the question of long covid.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-planets-rare-red-dwarf-stars">Jupiter-sized planets are very rare around the least massive stars</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’re looking to visit a gas giant planet in another solar system — or if you’re simply a science fiction writer who needs such a world for your story — you’d better steer clear of little red stars.</p>



<p>A search for planets <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd349" data-type="URL" data-id="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Jupiter around low-mass red dwarf stars</a> came up empty, researchers report in the July <em>Astronomical Journal</em>. “Around 200 stars, we did not detect a single one of these planets,” says Emily Pass, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>





<p>The find — or lack thereof — lends support to a theory of giant-planet building called core accretion. In this theory, gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn form by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-planet-newly-discovered-gas-dust-formation">gradually piecing together a solid core</a> out of debris orbiting a young star (<em>SN: 4/14/22</em>). That core eventually gets massive enough to attract lots of gas. But low-mass red dwarf stars shouldn’t host much solid material to begin with, so a paucity of gas giants is in line with that theory.</p>



<p>About three out of every four stars in the galaxy are red dwarfs, a type of star <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-cool-surface-temperature-failure-lasting-success">much fainter, cooler and smaller than the sun</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/21</em>). They glow dimly because they were born with little mass, about eight to 60 percent that of the sun. Previous planet searches have found that few red dwarfs have gas giant planets. But the new search targeted red dwarfs with only 10 to 30 percent of the sun’s mass, which are the most common such stars.</p>



<p>Pass and colleagues spent about six years searching for the Doppler shift an orbiting planet would cause in starlight as the world pulled its sun toward and away from us. All the observed stars are nearby, within 50 light-years of Earth. The closest is the well-studied Barnard’s Star, just six light-years away, which was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/other-worlds-other-planets">once thought to possess two Jupiter-sized planets</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>4/26/69</em>).</p>



<p>But no gas giants turned up around that star or any of the others. Extrapolating to the rest of the galaxy, the researchers conclude that fewer than two out of every 100 low-mass red dwarfs have planets as massive as Jupiter.</p>



<p>“To actually form a Jupiter [around the lowest-mass stars] is very hard,” says Edward Bryant, an astronomer at University College London, who was not one of the researchers conducting the search. “Their lack of a detection of a Jupiter analog I think is very consistent with the expectations from core accretion.” Because the disks of gas and dust around infant low-mass red dwarfs are small, there’s less material to create gas giants the size of Jupiter.</p>



<p>But smaller, rocky worlds stand a much better chance.</p>



<p>In fact, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many red dwarfs do have Earth-sized planets</a>, some at the right distances from their suns to sport pleasant temperatures. “We are talking about strange new worlds, not an Earth 2.0,” Pass says.</p>



<p>In our solar system, she says, Jupiter’s gravity may have prevented lots of ice from reaching Earth. As a result, our world didn’t end up completely underwater. In a planetary system lacking such a massive gas giant, an Earth-sized planet could turn into a water world that might still give rise to a highly intelligent species, but one that would live underwater — think dolphins — and not do any astronomy at all.</p>



<p>“It’s not saying that you can’t have life on these planets,” Pass says. “But those planets are just going to be so different than our own experiences.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/camouflaging-wheat-smell-pest-control">Camouflaging wheat with a wheat smell could be a new approach to pest control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Now you smell it, now you don’t. Or do you? Used correctly, a little misdirection could help keep mice away from freshly planted wheat seeds. </p>



<p>Camouflaging wheat seeds can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01127-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce seed loss</a> by more than 60 percent, scientists report May 22 in <em>Nature Sustainability. </em>All it takes is to make the whole field smell like wheat.</p>



<p>Rodents, including mice, are responsible for nibbling away at 70 million metric tons of cereals every year. Some of that munching takes place in Australia, where, when the weather is right, house mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) can reach plague proportions — skittering hordes of more than 1,000 mice per hectare, says Peter Banks, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sydney. There are so many mice on the road, he says, no one can avoid them. “It&#8217;s like driving on bubble wrap.”</p>





<p>When farmers plant wheat, mice go down the rows, sniffing out the seeds under the soil and digging them up. Usually, farmers overrun with mice turn to poisons such as zinc phosphide, which changes to phosphine gas in a mouse’s stomach. Unfortunately, it’s hard to make any poison appealing enough to make mice ignore the wheat buffet, and farmers are having to use more and more of it, says Steve Henry, a rodent ecologist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Canberra, Australia, who was not involved in the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What if the mice couldn’t sniff out the grains at all? Banks and his colleague Finn Parker, also a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sydney, have been working on olfactory camouflage — covering scents with, well, more scents. The technique started with invasive predators who hunt for threatened bird nests by smelling them out. “We thought, well, if we put those odors everywhere, how on Earth can they then find out where the nests actually are,” Banks says.</p>



<p>Banks, Parker and their colleagues had been using mice to study olfactory camouflage in the lab. When Banks saw a photo of the holes mice were digging into grain fields, “I thought, they&#8217;re finding those seeds by smell. And so can we use the same idea in that system?”</p>



<p>Before or during sowing, the scientists sprayed mouse-riddled test plots with wheat germ oil, a byproduct of wheat processing that is usually used in cosmetics and animal feed. The oils are the most nutritious parts, Banks says, and the smell of the oils is “what [the mice] are using to find the seeds beneath the ground.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="506" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline.jpg" alt="An overhead photo of a series of holes dug into the ground in three rows with vegetation in between the rows." class="wp-image-3125097" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline-515x383.jpg 515w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline-605x450.jpg 605w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline-250x186.jpg 250w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060123_bb_odor-camouflage_inline-263x197.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3125097">These tiny holes are big problem. Each hole here is a stolen wheat seed that a mouse sniffed and dug out of the soil.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125097">Peter Banks</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Two weeks after the seeds had been sown, plots that had been hosed down with oil before sowing had 74 percent fewer mouse holes—from an average of around 125 holes per plot to fewer than 30. Plots that got the oil during sowing had 63 percent fewer holes — from around 125 to fewer than 40 stolen seeds. When the plots got oil before sowing, Parker says, the mice “were coming, they&#8217;re seeking food, and they were just finding nothing.” In that case when the seeds went into the ground, the mice may have already learned not to bother with that plot. When the oil was delivered during sowing, it became harder for the animals to find the wheat seeds they were seeking.</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s one of the most elegant parts of it,” Henry says. “Saturating the area with the smell of wheat.” The challenge, he notes, will be getting farmers to adopt it. The test was done on a 27-hectare wheat crop, but farmers in Australia are often planting 6,000 hectares or more. They’d need a way to apply the wheat germ oil at the time of planting, when they already have a lot to manage.</p>



<p>And the camouflage probably won’t be enough on its own, Henry says. “I don&#8217;t see it as replacing bait, but I see this another tool in the shed that will really help.”</p>

<p>The sheriff of Franklin County, Ohio, has received an order to seize and sell property of Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University in Columbus, to pay his nearly $1.1 million debt to lawyers who represented him in failed libel and defamation suits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last December, a judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/09/judge-orders-osu-cancer-researcher-to-pay-1-million-to-lawyers-from-failed-libel-suit/">ordered Croce to pay $1,098,642.80</a>, plus interest, to <a href="https://www.keglerbrown.com/">Kegler Brown Hill &amp; Ritter</a>, which was one of the firms that represented him in his <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/19/osu-cancer-researcher-carlo-croce-loses-appeal-of-new-york-times-libel-suit/">libel lawsuit</a> against the <em>New York Times</em> and his <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/13/cancer-researcher-loses-defamation-suit-against-critic/">defamation case</a> against David Sanders, a researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He lost both cases, and the firm <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/26/law-firm-sues-osu-cancer-researcher-for-900000-in-unpaid-fees-following-failed-libel-suit/">sued him</a> for $900,000 in unpaid fees. Croce also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/18/embattled-cancer-researcher-loses-legal-bid-to-be-reinstated-as-department-chair-at-osu/">lost a suit</a> against Ohio State in which he sought to regain his post as chair of his department after the university removed him. </p>



<span id="more-127297"></span>



<p>Croce’s <a href="https://fcdcfcjs.co.franklin.oh.us/CaseInformationOnline/caseSearch?ReOlVBGXxHM46lu2Uk2X">appeal of the December judgment</a> is still in process, but in January the court <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/another-denial.pdf">denied</a> his request for a temporary stay of execution, meaning garnishment and other enforcement of the judgment can continue unless Croce can provide a surety bond or letter of credit for the full amount of the judgment, plus 18 months worth of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Croce and his current lawyer, Andrew Mills Holford of Johrendt &amp; Holford, and Maria M. Guthrie of Kegler Brown, who was representing the firm in its case against the researcher, did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the judgment was issued, the court garnished Croce’s bank accounts, and Ohio State has been garnishing his wages since March by about <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230606-garnishment.pdf">$15,600 each month</a>, or about 25% of his paycheck. As we have previously reported, Croce earns <a href="https://apps.hr.osu.edu/salaries/Home/Salaries?Firstname=carlo&amp;Lastname=croce&amp;Funding=University&amp;WhichSource=Salaries&amp;Year=0&amp;IsValid=True">more than $800,000</a> per year at OSU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 12, the state of Ohio issued a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230512-writ-of-execution.pdf">writ of execution</a> to the sheriff of Franklin County, in which Columbus is located, ordering that Croce’s “goods and chattels” be sold to pay his debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The court’s records include an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230508-artwork-exhibit.pdf">itemized list</a> of Croce’s extensive artwork collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On June 2, Croce filed a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230602-request-for-hearing.pdf">request for a hearing</a> that stated “I believe that some or all of my property may be exempt from execution in the above case.”</p>



<p>We count <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCroce%252c%2bCarlo%2bM">14 retractions</a> for Croce, as well as many corrections and expressions of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another firm that represented Croce is also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/arnold-v-croce.pdf">suing him for unpaid legal fees</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference </a> (fast forward to minute 31) and have been lightly edited for length and format. This is the second of four blogs on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change.<br><br>One of the main reasons why I joined PLOS more than five years ago was its founding principle:&nbsp; An organization established by practicing scientists and dedicated to transforming science communication. We believe it&rsquo;s necessary to fundamentally rethink how we share and consume research based on two key principles:</p>



<ul><li>First, we must continue to move beyond the constraints of the physical format and take advantage of the opportunities provided by the digital world.</li><li>Beyond technology, we must upend archaic systems of funding, reward, and recognition, to honor values like collaboration,<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> inclusion</a>, and transparency.</li></ul>



<p>I&rsquo;m proud to say that PLOS is one of the earliest pioneers in the Open Science publishing space. When we started 23 years ago, as a non-profit, with the mission of accelerating progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication, many in our industry thought we wouldn&rsquo;t survive. As you can tell, we are alive and well, and thriving.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://plos.org/about/">Over the 20 years since our first journal launch</a> we&rsquo;ve helped prove the viability of Open Access. Despite the evolving conversation about how best to achieve it, it&rsquo;s now mainstream.</li><li>We changed the publishing landscape with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information"><em>PLOS ONE,</em></a> enabling all rigorous, peer-reviewed research to be published and discoverable.</li><li>We helped focus the conversation about peer review on <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">rigor and transparency</a>. More people now understand how impact-seeking should never be at the expense of these notions.</li><li>Via a wide range of solutions, we&rsquo;ve worked towards <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">Open Science</a> at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the entire research communication process.</li></ul>



<p>More recently, we&rsquo;ve expanded our portfolio with titles focused on critical challenges outlined in the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>, and signed the UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact. Our intention is to create new and diverse communities of practice, who will, in turn, shape how we address the most pressing health and environmental issues facing our society. </p>



<p>My optimism is also fueled by the range of more radical start-ups entering this space, like <a href="https://www.arcadiascience.com/">Arcadia Science</a>, a new research organization building open science principles into their foundations<strong>,</strong> including reimagining the publishing process from the ground up.</p>



<p><strong>What PLOS Is Doing</strong></p>



<p>Like Arcadia, we have never been driven by tradition<strong>, </strong>but by a willingness to question the status quo and an eagerness to explore how we can improve the system. First, we&rsquo;ve delivered change by embracing progressive improvements to science communication while maintaining its core principles such as transparency, inclusion, and collaboration.</p>



<p>Some of this is about technology. Sadly, the publishing industry has largely digitized existing processes without attempting to imagine alternative solutions. Put simply, most of the industry is still print-first even when there is no print output.</p>



<p>Capturing the potential of digital technologies was fundamental to the vision of PLOS&rsquo; founders. And we&rsquo;ve done that. Fast forward 20 years into the era of big data. Science can now address complex research questions in unprecedented ways. But this requires access to and publication of all supporting data as a norm.</p>



<p>We were the first publisher to introduce a <a href="https://everyone.plos.org/2014/02/24/plos-new-data-policy-public-access-data-2/">data sharing requirement</a> back in 2014 &ndash; and yes, it had its detractorsin the early days. But the policy has been tremendously successful and hasn&rsquo;t encountered the negative consequences that many predicted. It also demonstrated the value of sharing data and gave researchers another way of demonstrating their impact. The sheer scale of introducing a change like this in a journal the size of <em>PLOS ONE</em> has also helped to normalize the sharing of data. We&rsquo;ve built on this with other progressive, values-driven solutions.</p>



<p>PLOS journals have always welcomed submissions with associated preprints, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 2016 that we formalized our support in journal policy and began <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/">accepting incoming direct transfers from bioRxiv</a>. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/02/plos-cold-spring-harbor-preprint-agreement-biorxiv/">In 2018, we expanded that partnership and made it a 2-way street</a>. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">Authors</a> could now have their manuscripts forwarded to bioRxiv as part of the PLOS submission process, instead of two separate submissions. Since then, we&rsquo;ve launched similar partnerships with other preprint servers, like <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/expanding-medrxiv-at-plos/">medRxiv</a> and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">earthRxiv</a>. By simplifying the process, we&rsquo;ve seen consistent growth in preprint posting over time.</p>



<p><strong>Code and Methods Sharing</strong></p>



<p>A second example sought to address one of the key barriers to reproducibility: the poor reporting and sharing of methods. PLOS partnered with <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> in 2017 to <em>encourage</em> sharing of reusable step-by-step protocols on the platform. But fewer than 1% of authors used this option. So, we sought to better understand why through interviews with researchers about their needs. Most importantly, we learned that expert feedback on protocols is important, as is wide accessibility. But it was also important to be able to receive credit for methods development, and to be able to version and modify protocols.</p>



<p>And so we went back to the drawing board to develop a new product, <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/">peer reviewed Lab Protocols.</a><strong> </strong>These combine a dynamic protocol in an easy-to-follow format with a peer-reviewed and published article.</p>



<p>One of the key overarching lessons from our work to date is that we&rsquo;re often dealing with challenges that are not, at heart, technological in nature.</p>



<p>One concrete example. Our internal research shows that scientists are happy with the options available to them to share their data. Yet most of them don&rsquo;t share data&ndash; the solution here is clearly not simply to build another system. The process of sharing is messy and takes time. Sometimes scientists don&rsquo;t know how. And we&rsquo;ve already learned that if there&rsquo;s no reward, busy scientists aren&rsquo;t going to invest the time.</p>



<p>Over the past 5 years we&rsquo;ve focused heavily on how to invite behavioral changes through our publishing process. Our thinking at PLOS has been informed by the classic diffusion theory of innovation, developed by E.M. Rogers in 1962. Essentially, this theory states that adoption of new ideas, behaviors and products doesn&rsquo;t happen simultaneously<strong>.</strong> Some individuals are more open to adaptation than others.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re using this to inform a portfolio approach, focusing on innovators and early adopters for newer ideas and opportunities. But if change is truly to happen, we also need to be thinking about how to bring along those who are more skeptical of change<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>For these groups, offering new features in our journals<strong> &ndash;</strong> a format they&rsquo;re comfortable with &ndash; is likely to be more successful. One fairly recent example here is our experiment with code sharing in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/"><em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></a>. As Jason Papin, co-editor in chief, put it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Code is the life-blood of research in our field. In order to truly build on the discoveries and advances in computational biology, we must be able to build on the work of others</p></blockquote>



<p>When we spoke to researchers in the field, we heard that sharing code <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800">signals confidence and integrity</a> on the part of the authors, which in turn supports trust in the community<strong>.</strong> And that they are ready and willing to open doors for fellow researchersby enabling them to more easily reuse or adapt scripts for their own studies, helping the whole field to advance more quickly.</p>



<p>Our team saw an opportunity to shift behavior by piloting a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">new journal policy<strong>.</strong></a> It would require authors to make public any code directly related to the results of their article upon publication. The proof of the experiment&rsquo;s success? In 2019 &ndash; before the policy was introduced &ndash; the rate of code sharing for articles in the journal was 53%. Not too bad, you might think &ndash; but looking at articles published after the policy was introduced, that number jumped to 87%. That was enough for us to make it a permanent policy. We&rsquo;re now focusing on code quality and reproducibility<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Behavioral Change</strong></p>



<p>Another model we&rsquo;re using at PLOS that influences how we approach behavioral change is one you may be familiar with. It&rsquo;s a comprehensive strategy developed <a href="https://www.cos.io/about/board#:~:text=Brian%20Nosek%20is%20Co%2Dfounder,at%20the%20University%20of%20Virginia.">by Brian Nosek, Executive Director of the Center for Open Science</a>, to help us understand the process of culture change and how we can accelerate it. The model helps us think about what&rsquo;s necessary at each level. For example, the Center for Open Science has done a lot to tackle the level of infrastructure through development of their <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> &ndash; a free, open-source application to support research workflows.</p>



<p>A wide variety of Open Access and data-sharing mandates from funders are driving a great deal of top-down change at the policy level. We&rsquo;re making notable headway at PLOS with the next level, &ldquo;making it easy&rdquo;, with much of the work I&rsquo;ve just described.</p>



<p>Other like-minded publishers are pushing on different parts of the problem. eLife recently announced that it will become &ldquo;a service that reviews preprints&rdquo;, getting rid of the standard &ldquo;accept or reject&rdquo; decision after review. This not only has the potential to begin decoupling peer review and publication, but also to speed up sharing of critical research. And it puts authors in charge of their journey.</p>



<p>Focusing on key decision points in the existing reward system such as this can have meaningful impacts. Over time, by nudging different elements of the publications system, we&rsquo;re moving closer to a system based on transparency and reproducibility.</p>



<p>Creating easier paths to Open Science practices is only one part of the equation. Next week, I&rsquo;ll talk about how institutional business models can also affect change at scale.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bowhead-whales-cancer-dna-repair">Bowhead whales may have a cancer-defying superpower: DNA repair</a></h4>

              
                <p>Near the northern tip of Alaska, on the outskirts of the Arctic Ocean, bowhead whales have given scientists a glimpse into longevity.</p>



<p>The gigantic marine mammals can live more than 200 years — and tissue samples collected from the animals reveal a fix-it superpower that might explain how. Bowhead whales’ cells are whizzes at <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.07.539748v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repairing damaged DNA</a>, scientists report May 8 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>That ability means the animals might mend damage that could otherwise lead to cancer-causing genetic glitches, says Orsolya Vincze, an evolutionary ecologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, who was not involved with the research. Scientists have previously reported other animals’ biological strategies for avoiding cancer. But the new work, Vincze says, “shows that the whales approach cancer resistance from a very new perspective.”</p>





<p>The bowhead whale,<em> </em><em>Balaena mysticetus</em>, can grow to roughly 18 meters long and is among the heaviest mammals on Earth. At more than 80,000 kilograms, it’s about the weight of six fully loaded school buses. All that body mass adds up to a vast number of cells. And every time a cell divides, there’s a chance that a dangerous mutation can arise.</p>



<p>But somehow, large-bodied animals are especially cancer resistant — a puzzle known as Peto’s paradox. That suggests the animals must “have much stronger cancer defenses,” says Lisa Abegglen, a cell biologist at the University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City who was not part of the new work.</p>



<p>Her team discovered that elephants, which can live nearly as long as humans and rarely die from cancer, have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephants-cancer-protection-secret-may-be-genes">extra copies of a tumor-blocking gene called <em>TP53</em></a> (<em>SN: 10/13/15</em>). This gene and another may help elephants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/resurrected-gene-may-protect-elephants-cancer">deal with DNA damage by clearing out afflicted cells</a>, other scientists have reported (<em>SN: 8/14/18</em>).</p>



<p>That’s one way to ward off trouble from damaged DNA, says Marc Tollis, an evolutionary biologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff who did not participate in the new study. Another strategy is to “take the hit,” he says, “and then try to fix it.”</p>



<p>Hints from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bowhead-whales-may-unlock-secrets-long-healthy-life">bowhead whale genome</a> published nearly a decade ago predicted that the mammals may use this alternate strategy (<em>SN: 1/6/15</em>). “But you need actual experiments to actually validate those predictions,” Tollis says.</p>



<p>In the lab, study coauthor Vera Gorbunova at the University of Rochester in New York and her colleagues ran an assortment of experiments on cells harvested from bowhead whale tissue, as well as on cells from humans, cows and mice.</p>



<p>The whale cells were both efficient and accurate at repairing double-strand breaks in DNA, damage that severs both strands of the DNA double helix. Whale repair restored broken DNA to like-new condition more often than cells from other mammals, the team found. In those animals, mends to the genome tended to be sloppier, like a poorly patched pair of jeans. The team also identified two proteins in bowhead whale cells, CIRBP and RPA2, that are part of the DNA repair crew.</p>



<p>Discovering how animals fend off cancer is “incredibly exciting,” Abegglen says, “because all of these strategies have potential to be translated into effective treatments for people with cancer.” Though that day may be far off, the new findings underscore the importance of studying animals with low cancer rates, she says. Abegglen wants to test whether the team’s results hold up in humpback whale and dolphin cells — or if those animals have different defenses.</p>



<p>There’s so much to learn from these and other animals with large bodies and long life spans, Vincze says.&nbsp; “We probably have the solution to cancer medicine out there in nature already,” she says. “We just have to find it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cyclone-swirling-uranus-north-pole-first">A cyclone has been spotted swirling over Uranus’ north pole for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Though it looks like a smooth, solid, pale blue orb, there’s more going on beneath the clouds of Uranus than meets the eye.</p>



<p>A polar <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL102872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyclone has been spotted at the planet&#8217;s north pole</a>, researchers report in the May 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. Observed with radio telescopes, the find is the first direct evidence of a cyclone on Uranus. A previous spacecraft flyby hinted at a similar storm at the planet’s south pole.</p>



<p>“It’s really exciting to see this polar structure come into view,” says Michael Roman, a planetary scientist at the University of Leicester in England who was not involved with the research. The observations “show a rather unique structure that we simply have never been able to study before.”</p>





<p>In 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft revealed winds at the center of Uranus’ south pole were moving faster than those in neighboring areas and were rotating. This evidence pointed to something dynamic like a cyclone occurring at the pole. But the spacecraft’s instruments weren’t sensitive enough to confirm the storm.</p>



<p>In recent years, as the north pole of Uranus turned more toward Earth, scientists were able to probe the other side of the ice giant, where they spotted similar hints of a swirling storm. Using the Very Large Array radio observatory in New Mexico, planetary scientist Alex Akins and colleagues probed the temperature under the clouds for more atmospheric clues. “What we saw with the VLA was kind of the last piece of [evidence],” says Akins, of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New thermal emission observations from 2021 and 2022 show a spot on the north pole where the gas beneath the clouds is warmer and drier than its surroundings, suggesting the presence of a low-pressure region in the midst of those spinning winds. “These contrasts look similar to what we see in hurricanes on Earth,” Akins says.</p>



<p>Excluding Mercury, all the planets in our solar system have now been observed to host <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/huge-cyclone-churns-saturns-north-pole">some kind of swirling air mass</a> at their poles (<em>SN: 10/14/08</em>).</p>



<p>Akins plans to continue to observe the cyclone to see how it changes. Previous observations from 2015 suggest it is growing stronger. Researchers wouldn’t expect Uranus’ atmospheric circulation to change on such a relatively short timescale, Akins says, so a continued strengthening of the storm would suggest there’s more to learn about how the planet’s atmosphere works.</p>



<p>In 2022, experts brought together by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-decadal-survey-uranus-enceladus-astrobiology">recommended NASA send a probe to Uranus</a> (<em>SN: 4/20/22</em>). “The more we can learn about Uranus as we begin to plan a mission,” Roman says, “the better we can focus our planning for that mission.”</p>

<p>Thirty randomized clinical trials involving a researcher in Egypt who has already had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dAbd-Elsalam%252c%2bSherief">six papers retracted</a> show signs of research misconduct and data fabrication, according to the authors of a <a href="https://osf.io/vjcnp/">recent preprint</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/ben-w-mol">Ben Mol</a>, one of the authors of the preprint and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Monash University in Australia, has spent several years investigating the work of <a href="http://tdb2.tanta.edu.eg/staff/SheriefAbd-Elsalam">Sherief Abd-Elsalam</a>, a hepatologist and gastroenterologist at Tanta University in Egypt. Abd-Elsalam denies that his research is false or fabricated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol has been exposing research misconduct in his own field for years. His work <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">revealed dozens of dodgy obstetrics papers</a> by Ahmed <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/10/critics-face-legal-threats-as-journal-takes-more-than-three-years-to-act/">Badawy</a> and Hatem <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/08/ob-gyn-loses-phd-after-committee-finds-he-made-up-research/">Abu Hashim</a> of Mansoura University, in Egypt, as well as serious problems with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/18/ob-gyn-who-called-criticism-racist-and-hate-speech-earns-retraction-several-expressions-of-concern/">clinical trials led by Ahmed Maged</a> at Cairo University, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data/?shared=email&amp;msg=fail">research about c-sections</a> also from Cairo University, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/20/urologist-blames-big-pharma-as-concerns-mount-over-his-research/">urology research</a> by Iranian researcher Mohammad Reza Safarinejad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abd-Elsalam <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Abd-Elsalam-Full-Response.pdf">said in an emai</a>l that he disagrees with the allegations in the preprint. “Where is the problem? We don’t know,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127287"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mol began to question the integrity of Abd-Elsalam’s work after noticing a number of suspicious randomized controlled trials (RCTs) he helped conduct on controversial COVID-19 treatments including ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and the antiviral favipiravir.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four of the seven COVID-19 papers that list Abd-Elsalam as an author have been retracted so far, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/23/groups-second-paper-on-potential-treatments-for-covid-19-is-retracted/">we reported</a> earlier. The retraction notices cite data overlaps, inadequate data validation, and doubts about the randomization process as reasons for the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abd-Elsalam is the first author in three of the four retracted papers:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/103/4/article-p1635.xml"><em>Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study</em></a></li>



<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-021-04956-9"><em>Efficacy of favipiravir in COVID-19 treatment: a multi-center randomized study</em></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/106/3/article-p886.xml"><em>Remdesivir Efficacy in COVID-19 Treatment: A Randomized Controlled Trial</em></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14787210.2021.1950532"><em>Efficacy of combined Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia: a multicenter Egyptian study</em></a></li>
</ul>



<p>Abd-Elsalam has also earned a retraction for a non-RCT paper because of data fabrication; he disagreed with the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-017-3573-0"><em>Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for treatment of cirrhotic patients with genotype 4 hepatitis C virus in real-life clinical practice</em></a></li>
</ul>



<p>Mol’s preprint had originally included a double-up of one of Abd-Elsalam’s papers in the appendix listing his retracted work. The duplication was amended following our reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Seeing the extent of the problematic COVID-19 RCTs led Mol to investigate Abd-Elsalam’s other work.&nbsp;The preprint, which was posted in March, details all 30 RCTs Mol and his co-authors found searching PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus for papers describing clinical trials and listing Abd-Elsalam as an author. Out of the 30, seven are the RCTs on COVID-19 and the rest are in the field of gastroenterology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publications flagged by the authors have been cited more than 1,200 times. To date, just one of the gastroenterology papers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8867223/">has been retracted</a>. As a consequence, clinicians might be giving misinformed advice to patients, according to Mol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The preprint includes a series of allegations about data fabrication, inconsistencies and plagiarism in the 30 RCTs. For example, Mol and his colleagues showed that in nine of the gastroenterology studies the recruitment start date in the trial registration and the published paper were inconsistent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another detail the authors found striking among 15 of the RCTs is that they reported no drop-outs, despite some having long follow-up periods and patients with terminal illnesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The instances of data fabrication allegedly include a number of highly unlikely <em>P</em>-values among the papers. The authors decided to recalculate them by performing a comparison of means and concluded they were incorrect in nine of the RCTs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also noticed unusual data in tables reporting patient characteristics. For example, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/Abstract/2019/03000/A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_Comparing.23.aspx">one paper published in 2019</a> had 40 binary variable categories and 36 of them were even – a result which has a 0.00000929% probability of happening by chance, according to the preprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It goes on and on and on,” Mol said. “It is full of these mistakes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In his emailed response to the allegations, Abd-Elsalam wrote: “I am not sure what I did that …led them to conclude that there are concerns regarding the trials I participated in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added that the non-COVID-19 articles were mostly thesis papers, and claimed that he was listed as an author because of his writing skills.</p>



<p>In October 2022 and February 2023, Mol contacted Abd-Elsalam to share his findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe I see it wrong, maybe there’s an explanation, maybe he also regrets it and decides to retract his own work,” Mol said. “But he basically denied it all and didn’t respond very seriously, so here we are.”</p>



<p>After getting in touch with several editors, some were swifter than others in responding to Mol’s concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-021-04956-9">Efficacy of favipiravir in COVID-19 treatment: a multi-center randomized study</a>,” published in <em>Archives of Virology </em>in January 2021, received an editor’s note citing an investigation into the article in August 2021, and a subsequent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-021-05307-4">retraction</a> in November 2021. The paper has been cited 146 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Tim Skern is the journal’s editor-in-chief and also a co-author on the preprint analyzing the 30 RCTs. According to an email exchange shared by Mol, Skern wrote to Anna Lockhart, a senior editor of medicine and life science journals at Springer, expressing his concern about a second paper published in <em>Archives of Virology </em>in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-020-04639-x">High success rates for the use of sofosbuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + ribavirin and sofosbuvir/simeprevir/daclatasvir + ribavirin in retreatment of chronic hepatitis C infection after unsuccessful sofosbuvir/daclatasvir therapy: a real-life experience</a>,” has been cited eight times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an April 2022 email to Lockhart, Skern wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is clear from the analyses of two other expert statisticians that the following paper is not trustworthy (real terms fabricated) and must be retracted …</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also asked her to attach an editor’s note to the paper saying that it’s under investigation. The paper does not currently have the note. Anna Lockhart did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In April 2023, Mol shared his findings with the editors of the <em>European Journal of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology</em>, a Wolters Kluwer title, which published six of the RCTs included in the analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead publisher for medical journals at Wolters Kluwer, Phil Daly, responded with follow-up queries but to date none of the six papers has been retracted or received an expression of concern. Daly did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol and his co-authors have written to the editors of the journals which have published 10 of the 30 RCTs, not including those of the retracted papers. The only response they’ve received is the one from Wolters Kluwer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The journals don’t all respond, that is unbelievable for me,” he said. “I increasingly find that everybody is looking away from it and we don’t want to speak up. I feel myself a little bit the buffalo separate from the herd.”</p>



<p>Of the retracted COVID-19 papers co-authored by Abd-Elsalam, the journals took between 63 and 414 days to retract following an email from Mol and his colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s complicated to get the data out of these publications,” Mol said. “And it’s extremely uncomfortable to say to people well, maybe the work you were doing is not honest.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In his email, Abd-Elsalam linked to a <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2823793/v4">preprint</a> he says he co-wrote (he is not listed as an author). The paper questions the credibility of a checklist developed by Mol to assess RCTs and uses 16 of Mol’s own RCTs in its analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the preprint conclude: “Using the TRACT (Trustworthiness in Randomized Controlled Trials) checklist, 16 RCTs co-authored by its developer (Mol) showed red flags that need to be investigated further.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abd-Elsalam says he and his colleagues have also made several comments on Mol’s work on <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=%22ben+mol%22">PubPeer</a>, some of which he claims have been removed by the site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to Abd-Elsalam’s concern about his work, Mol wrote in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937823001382">retraction</a> was made at our own request because of an error. Otherwise I had 16 of my papers investigated without any concern raised.</p>



<p>One problem is that there is not a collective response from the academic community to people like Abd-Elsalam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In August 2022, the <em>Journal of Exploratory Research in Pharmacology</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/xiahepublishing/status/1556928469765963776">announced on Twitter</a> that Abd-Elsalam had been appointed to its editorial board. He is currently coordinating 74 clinical trials, with 35 trials marked as recruiting, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=abd-elsalam&amp;Search=Apply&amp;recrs=b&amp;recrs=a&amp;recrs=f&amp;recrs=d&amp;recrs=m&amp;age_v=&amp;gndr=&amp;type=&amp;rslt=">according to clinicaltrials.gov</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol and his co-authors are calling for all papers on which Abd-Elsalam is an author to be marked with an expression of concern.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Han Lu will talk about the preprint entitled &quot;Interplay between homeostatic synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity maintains the robust firing rate of neural networks&quot;.</p>
<p>Han is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Freiburg, Germany. Her studies focus on the homeostatic structural plasticity of neuronal connectivity in
response to external stimulation, using both computational and experimental approaches.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Critical network states and neural plasticity are essential for flexible behavior in an
ever-changing environment, which allows for efficient information processing and
experience-based learning. Synaptic-weight-based Hebbian plasticity and homeostatic
synaptic scaling were considered the key players in enabling memory while stabilizing
network dynamics. However, spine-number-based structural plasticity is not consistently
reported as a homeostatic mechanism, leading to an insufficient under-standing of its
functional impact. Here, we combined live-cell microscopy of eGPF-tagged neurons in
organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures and computational modeling to study the
re-sponse of structural plasticity under activity perturbations and its interplay with
homeostatic synaptic scaling. By following individual dendritic segments, we demonstrated
that the inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission did not linearly regulate dendritic
spine density: Inhibition of AMPA receptors with a low concentration of
2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX, 200 nM) sig-nificantly increased
the spine density while complete blockade of AMPA receptors with 50 µM NBQX reduced spine
density. Motivated by these results, we established network simulations in which a
biphasic structural plasticity rule governs the activity-dependent formation of synapses.
We showed that this bi-phasic rule maintained neural activity homeostasis upon stimulation
and permitted both synapse formation and synapse loss, depending on the degree of activity
deprivation. Homeostatic synaptic scaling affected the recurrent connectivity, modulated
the network activity, and influenced the outcome of structural plasticity. It reduced
stimulation-triggered homeostatic synapse loss by downscaling synaptic weights; meanwhile,
it rescued silencing-induced synapse degeneration by am-plifying recurrent inputs via
upscaling to reactivate silent neurons. Their interplay explains divergent results
obtained in varied experimental settings. In summary, calcium-based synaptic scaling and
homeostatic structural plasticity rules compete and compensate one another other to
achieve an eco-nomical and robust control of firing rate homeostasis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-roman-perfume-smell-patchouli">An old perfume bottle reveals what some ancient Romans smelled like</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprisingly well-preserved perfume bottle is providing a rare olfactory window to ancient Rome — and letting in a familiar smell.</p>



<p>Chemical analyses of the contents of a 2,000-year-old bottle <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/6/6/236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal that one of its ingredients was patchouli</a>, researchers report May 23 in <em>Heritage</em>. The earthy scent is a staple in modern perfumes, but its use by the Romans was unknown until now.</p>



<p>The essence, in a quartz flask dating from the first century, was found in 2019 in a Roman burial in the southern Spanish town of Carmona, once an important Roman settlement. Researchers unearthed an egg-shaped lead case that held a glass urn. Inside the urn they found the flask and the cremated remains of a woman who was around 40 years old, says chemist José Rafael Ruiz Arrebola of the University of Cordoba in Spain. Cremation was a common form of burial at the time, and Romans who could afford it furnished their tombs with items to accompany the deceased into the afterlife.</p>





<p>The quartz bottle was by itself a luxury object in Roman times. Quartz is extremely hard, making it difficult to shape. The tiny size and exquisite detail of the object already made it a rare finding at a burial site. Even more unusual is that it was found tightly sealed with a dolomite top covered in a dark, tarlike substance that chemical analysis revealed as bitumen. Inside the jar, there was a solid mass — the preserved original content of the bottle.</p>



<p>Ancient written perfume recipes, while vague and incomplete, have previously revealed that Romans mixed fragrant extracts with vegetable oils, such as olive oil, as preservative. And in earlier studies, researchers have detected hints of floral extracts in bottles used to keep cosmetics — known as <em>unguentaria. </em>But this is the first time the source of an aroma has been identified.</p>



<p>Laboratory analyses revealed that the bottle contained patchouli and vegetable oil. Patchouli is derived from a tropical plant in Southeast Asia called <em>Pogostemon cablin</em>. It likely reached Rome through trade networks.</p>



<p>Subjecting the bottle’s contents to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry identified multiple substances typical of patchouli essential oil — most importantly patchoulenol, or patchouli alcohol. To rule out nard oil, which has many components in common with patchouli oil but in different proportions, the researchers compared the results with modern samples of patchouli oil.</p>



<p>The bitumen seal was key in preserving the patchouli&#8217;s chemical signature. Not only did the seal keep the fragrance inside the bottle, but it also trapped the perfume molecules through a process called adsorption.</p>



<p>“Chemically, bitumen behaves like carbon, which is the best adsorbent for organic compounds,” Ruiz Arrebola says. The process is similar to carbon filters used in gas masks, he says. “Once adsorbed, [the molecules] aren’t volatile anymore and can’t escape.”</p>

It’s possible that all held the cremated remains of members of the same family.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125200">Juan Manuel Román</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The extraordinary preservation of the burial site also played a role. “Being in a closed place and in total darkness is what allowed [the perfume] to make it to our days,” Ruiz Arrebola says. “Had the tomb collapsed and let light in, it wouldn’t have survived because light is the worst enemy to this type of chemical.”</p>



<p>The discovery fits into a growing trend of piecing together a multidimensional picture of ancient life, including its sounds and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-smell-odor-artifacts-texts-egypt-archaeology">smells</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/22</em>). “There are research groups and companies trying to re-create ancient perfumes,” Ruiz Arrebola says. “This will give them very important clue.”</p>



<p>But the finding doesn’t mean that the whole Roman Empire smelled like patchouli. “At the time, perfumes were reserved for the high society,” Ruiz Arrebola says. That the perfume was made from an exotic essence likely imported from elsewhere and bottled in a costly jar point to a wealthy proprietor, he says.</p>





<p>At the same time, it isn’t clear if this perfume was intended for use in daily life or had a spiritual or funerary meaning. The unopened bottle’s presence inside a funerary urn suggests an intimate gesture, not meant for public display.</p>



<p>“Luxury is useless if it can’t be displayed in front of society,” says historian Jordi Pérez González of the University of Girona in Spain, who was not involved with the study. “So patchouli might have been linked to the funerary world rather than to the daily life.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">Wildfire smoke is blanketing the U.S. East Coast. It won’t be the last time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even as the thick clouds of smoke from wildfires raging in eastern Canada, which blanketed the U.S. East Coast in a dangerous orange haze, begin to dissipate, researchers are warning it’s a sign of the times. </p>



<p>Canada’s fire outlook will remain higher than normal for June. And on a larger scale, climate change is projected to make fire conditions more common across Canada, Russia and Alaska’s boreal forests.</p>



<p>The current fires were sparked by lightning in the Canadian province of Quebec; like much of Canada, <a href="https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agricultural-production/weather/canadian-drought-monitor/current-drought-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parts of Quebec were abnormally dry this spring</a>.</p>





<p>Their smoky haze has dominated headlines, prompting warnings of dangerous air pollution levels. People were urged to stay indoors as much as possible, or wear masks, to avoid inhaling the fine particulate matter. The smoke, a toxic brew of irritant gases and tiny particles, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-health-risks-air-smoke-west-east-united-states">can cause asthma, respiratory and cardiovascular problems</a>, and can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">exacerbate existing conditions such as diabetes</a> and chronic lung conditions (<em>SN: 6/17/22; SN: 9/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>Wildfire-driven air pollution is all too familiar to residents of the Pacific Northwest and the U.S. West, where most of the continent’s large wildfires occur, but it’s less common in the eastern part of North America. So June’s headline-grabbing haze might be a wake-up call to East Coast policy makers about the hazards of climate change, some researchers hope.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of historical precedent for that, says Nicholas Bond, state climatologist for the state of Washington, who is based in Seattle. “There were some periods when dust [from the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s] made it all the way to Washington, D.C., bringing attention to the disaster that was occurring in the Plains states,” he says.</p>



<p>Whether eastern Canada’s forests in particular <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7e6e/meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will become more fire-prone due to climate change isn’t clear</a> from recent simulations of future climate and fire behavior. The current fires are not necessarily a harbinger of things to come so much as a reminder of what’s already here: They’re burning in regions that are already considered at risk of fire.</p>



<p>Climate change is projected to boost fires across other vast swaths of boreal forest in the Northern Hemisphere. It’s already having an impact. “Wildfires in the boreal forests of Alaska burned more acres in the past 20 years” than in the previous 20 years, Bond says. How much of the forest is on fire can vary significantly from year to year; 2020 was below-average, with about 73,000 hectares burned. But the overall trend of burned area in boreal forests is expected to curve steeply upward by the middle of the century: The acreage of burned area in Alaska is projected to increase by 24 to 169 percent from 2020 to 2050.</p>



<p>Fire seasons in boreal forests are also expected to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722018459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last longer and produce larger fires</a> each year. Climate change <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36500-5?utm_campaign=related_content&amp;utm_source=EARTHENV&amp;utm_medium=communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also increase the frequency of lightning strikes </a>that spark fires such as those currently burning in Quebec — although that, too, is still uncertain.</p>



<p>Canada is currently fighting severe fires across the country, from coast to coast, stretching its resources thin. &#8220;It is quite rare for us to have fire over such a broad area. It is an exceptional situation,&#8221; exacerbated by drought conditions in regions across the country, says Ellen Whitman, a forest fire research scientist at Natural Resources Canada, based in Edmonton. &#8220;Lightning ignitions are made more likely by drought, which is associated with climate change,&#8221; she says. And “lightning is expected to become more frequent due to changes to upper air patterns related to climate warming.”  </p>



<p>The threat in Canada is expected to remain high in the coming weeks, the Canadian <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2023/06/the-government-of-canada-provides-update-on-wildfire-seasonal-outlook-and-outlines-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government reported on June 5</a>. That’s also true for the United States. “The Pacific Northwest is liable to be dealing with considerable smoke later this summer,” Bond says, based on a <a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fire potential outlook report released June 1</a> by the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center. “For personal, selfish reasons I hope the winds do not bring the smoke our way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/groundwater-toxic-pollution-superfund">Rising groundwater threatens to spread toxic pollution on U.S. coastlines</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hidden flows of water are poised to flush toxic contamination into U.S. coastal communities.</p>



<p>Sea level rise from climate change won’t just force shorelines to retreat — in inland areas, it will guilefully lift groundwater into shallower soils. That rising water could infiltrate <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.168500245.55690018/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of U.S. Superfund sites</a> — severely polluted locations identified by the Environmental Protection Agency for cleanup — researchers warn in a preliminary study posted May 25 to <em>ESS Open Archive</em>.</p>



<p>These sites — and thousands of other polluted areas — could be at risk of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permafrost-thawing-pollution-arctic-climate-change">releasing heavy metals, radioactive elements, pesticides and industrial chemicals</a> associated with human health problems (<em>SN: 4/26/23</em>). People of color and low-income communities would be disproportionately affected.</p>





<p>“Just the sheer number of Superfund sites where there are these dangerous contaminants that could be liberated — it’s astonishing,” says coastal geologist Patrick Barnard of the U.S. Geological Survey in Santa Cruz, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the study. Many of the polluted areas have been managed without regard for groundwater rise, he says. “We need to think about what the future holds for these sites.”</p>



<p>The link between climate change, the sea and underground water may not be obvious, but it is intimate. At the beach, seawater can seep into the ground and move inland, permeating layers of earth under coastal communities. Meanwhile, rain and runoff can also trickle down from above. In the ground, this freshwater often sits atop the denser saltwater from the sea. And when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-climate-change-estimate-triples-number-people-path-rising-sea-levels">the sea level rises due to climate change</a>, it pushes all this groundwater up through the earth (<em>SN: 10/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>As the top of the groundwater — the water table — nears the surface, it can damage human infrastructure. It can also spread hazardous substances in the soil, exposing people and ecosystems nearby.</p>



<p>Environmental planner and geologist Kristina Hill found motivation for the new study while investigating groundwater conditions at a former Superfund site in the San Francisco Bay Area. There, groundwater was touching pollutants in the soil. “I started wondering, what is the scale of this problem?” says Hill, of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>She and her colleagues identified which of the roughly 1,300 U.S. Superfund sites are in low-lying coastal areas — no more than 10 meters above mean sea level — where groundwater rise could potentially infiltrate.</p>



<p>They found if the sea surface rose by one meter — a <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibility by 2100</a> — then groundwater could potentially rise into contaminated soils at 326 sites. New Jersey and Florida respectively contained the most at-risk Superfund sites — 54 and 51 respectively.</p>



<p>Not every polluted site in the United States is a Superfund site, but that doesn&#8217;t make them less hazardous, Hill says. Her team assessed that potential impact with a case study of the Bay Area alone. They flagged 12 Superfund sites and nearly 5,300 state-managed contaminated areas vulnerable to that one-meter sea level rise. There could be thousands more such sites up and down our coastlines, Hill says.</p>



<p>The researchers analyzed U.S. Census data to investigate who could face the greatest risk of exposure. People from socially vulnerable communities — those whose circumstances limit their ability to prevent suffering or loss in face of a disaster — bore disproportionate risk, they found.</p>



<p>“The findings are not surprising,” says hydrogeologist Holly Michael of the University of Delaware in Newark. This study takes the first step in addressing the hazard, by calling out where it could arise, she says. More local research will be needed to thoroughly assess each site’s risk and determine next steps, be that treating contaminated soils or removing them altogether.</p>



<p>As the ocean encroaches, Hill says, helping people move inland won&#8217;t be enough unless we also clean up our mess. “Otherwise, there will be a toxic area that we leave behind, and that will spread.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drought-forests-trees-weather-future">Surviving a drought may help forests weather future dry spells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some forests take one-two punches surprisingly well.</p>



<p>Researchers have shown that certain California forests exposed to two successive droughts weathered the second one much better than forests only hit by the later dry period. Given that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">the frequency and severity of droughts is increasing with climate change</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>), the findings suggest that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022AV000810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forested regions might fare better than predicted</a> in the future, the research team proposes in the May 17 <em>AGU Advances</em>. That’s important because of the many resources that forests provide, including their ability to sequester about a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the atmosphere every year.</p>





<p>Carl Norlen and Mike Goulden, ecologists at the University of California, Irvine, studied roughly 520,000 hectares of California forest (about 4 percent of the state’s forested areas). The researchers focused on conifers, trees such as pines and firs that have needles rather than flat leaves. Using archival data gleaned from airplane observations, Norlen and Goulden estimated the extent of conifer die-off during two droughts that struck from 1999–2002 and 2012–2015. “Both of them when they happened were considered some of the most severe droughts ever in California,” Norlen says.</p>



<p>When the researchers looked at forests that just experienced the 2012–2015 drought, they found that over 50 percent of forested areas showed evidence of die-off. But when Norlen and Goulden analyzed forests that had weathered both droughts, they were surprised to find that only 13 percent of those forested areas showed evidence of die-off after the second drought. The researchers also analyzed satellite data that revealed the severity of tree die-off, and they again found that forests hurt by one drought were better prepared to weather another.</p>



<p>The underlying cause of those differences probably has to do with the tree mortality that occurred during the first drought, Norlen and Goulden propose. Roughly 31 percent of the forested areas that experienced both droughts showed signs of die-off during the 1999–2002 drought. “We think that it has to do with experiencing die-off the first time,” Norlen says.</p>



<p>That makes sense, says William Anderegg, an ecologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who was not involved in the research. “You might have culled out the weak trees,” he says.</p>



<p>Norlen and Goulden speculate that the first drought eliminated trees <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bark-beetles-fungi-chemical-signals-infest">weakened by pests like bark beetles</a> (<em>SN: 2/21/23</em>), or perhaps that the dry conditions prompted trees to protect themselves by growing deeper roots. Those changes would have helped protect the remaining trees from future droughts, Goulden says. “You effectively have a stronger population.”</p>



<p>Getting at the root of why exactly some forests are better prepared to weather successive droughts will require more investigation, the researchers say. One way forward is to monitor individual trees to better understand their physiology, which other teams have done by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-trees-drought-survival-secrets">outfitting trees with sensors</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/23</em>).</p>



<p>However, the new findings already provide some hope for the forests of the future. Modeling work has suggested that <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/11/jcli-d-12-00430.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upwards of 50 percent of present-day conifer tree coverage could be lost</a> in the Northern Hemisphere by the end of the century. But this new work shows that that prediction might well turn out to be an overestimate. “There’s an element of it that’s actually hopeful,” Goulden says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-enceladus-plume-water-space">JWST captured Enceladus’ plume spraying water nearly 10,000 kilometers into space</a></h4>

              
                <p>Enceladus’ famous plume dwarfs the moon itself.</p>



<p>Geysers on Saturn’s icy moon <a href="https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov/apps/Enceladus_JWST.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spew water vapor nearly 10,000 kilometers into space</a>, a distance about 19 times the diameter of Enceladus, researchers report in a paper accepted in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. If the geysers were on Earth, the plume would touch the edge of our planet’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>NASA’s now-defunct Cassini spacecraft discovered almost two decades ago that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">Enceladus ejects salty water</a> from a subsurface reservoir (<em>SN: 5/2/06</em>). But the spacecraft’s orbit around Saturn meant it was too close to the moon to see the plume’s true extent.</p>





<p>In November, the James Webb Space Telescope turned its powerful infrared camera on Enceladus for the first time, gazing at the moon for about four minutes. JWST’s vantage point from across our solar system let it see the plume extending at least 9,600 kilometers from the south pole.</p>



<p>“Seeing it so big, water being everywhere, it was kind of a surprise,” says planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>



<p>JWST’s observations also shed light on how much water the plume pumps out and where those molecules end up.</p>

<p>Enceladus has been spewing the same amount of water since Cassini arrived at Saturn’s system 19 years ago: about 10 million billion trillion molecules per second (that’s a 10 followed by 28 zeros).</p>



<p>Roughly 30 percent of the molecules feed into a donut-shaped ring — called a torus — that encircles the entire Saturnian system. The remaining water either helps create one of Saturn’s iconic icy rings, or gets blown across the system, where the water may affect the atmospheric chemistry of Saturn and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/20-new-moons-saturn-now-most-any-solar-system-planet">its other moons</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/19</em>).</p>



<p>The plume’s consistency gives Villanueva hope that whenever scientists send another mission to Enceladus, the geysers will still be active. In the meantime, JWST will keep checking up on the moon. “The beauty with James Webb is we can point to it very often and see if that thing remains active all the time,” he says.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y" target="_blank">scientific paper</a>&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/30/560837881/brain-patterns-may-predict-people-at-risk-of-suicide" target="_blank">international</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-a-machine-identify-suicidal-thoughts/" target="_blank">headlines</a>&nbsp;with its bold claim that the combination of brain scans and machine learning algorithms could identify people at risk for suicide with 91% accuracy.</p>



<p>The promise of the work garnered lead author&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/just-marcel.html" target="_blank">Marcel Adam Just</a>&nbsp;of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and co-author&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/about-us/our-people/faculty/david-brent-md" target="_blank">David Brent</a>&nbsp;of the University of Pittsburgh a five-year,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2018/august/marcel-just-nimh-suicide-grant.html" target="_blank">$3.8 million grant</a>&nbsp;from the National Institute of Mental Health to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/t5aT9-W7QECwxmxDXtFrRw/project-details/10386788" target="_blank">conduct a larger follow-up study</a>.</p>



<p>But the 2017 paper attracted immediate and sustained scrutiny from other experts, one of whom attempted to replicate it and found a key problem. Nothing happened until this April, when the authors admitted the work was flawed and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/06/high-profile-paper-that-used-ai-to-identify-suicide-risk-from-brain-scans-retracted-for-flawed-methods/" target="_blank">retracted their article</a>. By then, it had been cited 134 times in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science — a large amount for a young paper — and received so much attention online that the article ranks in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/28130609#score" target="_blank">the top 5%</a>&nbsp;of all the research tracked by Altmetric, a data company focused on scientific publishing.</p>



<p>All this could have been avoided if the journal had followed the advice of its own reviewers, according to <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23837846/nature-human-behavior-editors-decision-letters-and-reviewers-comments.pdf">records of the peer-review process</a> obtained by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/" target="_blank">Retraction Watch</a>. The experts who scrutinized the submitted manuscript for the journal before it was published identified many issues in the initial draft and a revised resubmission. One asked for the authors to replicate the work in a new group of study participants, and overall, they recommended rejecting the manuscript.</p>



<span id="more-127269"></span>



<p>The records also show the journal’s chief editor initially followed the reviewers’ advice — but then accepted the paper with some changes to its text, but no added data. The documents don’t explain the editor’s decision to publish, and a journal spokesperson declined to discuss the reasons.</p>



<p>“I was very upset,” said one of the reviewers, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of breaking the convention of reviewer confidentiality. “Everybody knew this paper was garbage … and yet they went ahead and sent it out into the world.”</p>



<p>Just and colleagues’ manuscript began the peer-review process at the journal Nature Human Behaviour in early 2017. The paper described how the group used machine learning algorithms to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of people’s brains and identify those at elevated risk for attempting suicide.</p>



<p>The researchers used fMRI to catch a glimpse of what happened in the brains of 79 young adults when asked to think about concepts such as “death,” “trouble,” “carefree,” and “good.” After excluding participants whose scans the scientists said had too much noise, they applied machine learning algorithms to the data from 17 of the people who had previously thought about dying by suicide, and 17 control participants who had not reported having suicidal thoughts.</p>



<p>Using a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statology.org/leave-one-out-cross-validation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common method</a>&nbsp;for testing the performance of algorithms, the researchers trained their system on the data of all but one participant, and then asked the model to predict whether the left-out participant had thought about suicide or not. They repeated this process until the model had made a prediction for each participant, and reported the model made the right call 91% of the time. Specifically, the algorithms correctly identified 15 of the 17 participants who had suicidal thoughts and 16 of the 17 controls.</p>



<p>Two of the three experts who reviewed the submission at the request of the journal called the reported accuracy “impressively high,” but offered detailed critiques of the work.</p>



<p>One reviewer called aspects of the methodology “concerning,” such as the authors omitting about half of their original sample of participants when testing their model in the paper’s main analysis. Even if those choices didn’t introduce bias into the model, the reviewer wrote, they indicated the approach was “likely limited” in its usefulness for the general population.</p>



<p>Another reviewer who detailed many concerns with the manuscript called for the authors to test their model on a separate group of people.</p>



<p>The other expert wrote that the paper’s results were “remarkable,” but asked the authors to address “several problems.” That reviewer wanted to see individual brain data included in the supplementary material, and for the authors to show more of their data that went into their statistical analyses.</p>



<p>Based on the feedback, Stavroula Kousta, Nature Human Behaviour’s chief editor, invited the authors to address the reviewers’ “quite substantial concerns” in a revision.</p>



<p>The authors did so, submitting the updated manuscript for another round of review by the two more critical experts.</p>



<p>One of the reviewers was not impressed, because the main analysis still focused on 34 participants “cherry-picked” from an original pool of 79, the reviewer wrote.</p>



<p>The other reviewer was initially more positive, because the revision clarified that the authors had used the same algorithms to evaluate scans of 21 of the participants who were initially excluded from their tests, and achieved an accuracy of 87%.</p>



<p>But in additional comments, that reviewer noted “several irregularities in the details” of the analysis of the excluded participants.</p>



<p>“These things make me a bit worried that some liberties are being taken to make the results better than they would be with a truly straightforward, unbiased replication of the findings in a new sample,” the reviewer concluded. “I would feel more comfortable with an independent replication in a new sample without the ‘fudge factors’ that seem to be present in this analysis.”</p>



<p>In July 2017, Kousta rejected the manuscript.</p>



<p>In the rejection letter, Kousta wrote that “we would be very pleased to consider a revision” if the authors performed an independent replication in a new sample of participants. “Without these data, however, the reviewers’ concerns with the present dataset &amp; analyses are such as to preclude publication in Nature Human Behaviour.”</p>



<p>Yet in October 2017, the journal published the paper, without this additional data. The published version, however, describes the analysis of 21 of the participants who had been excluded from the main analysis, yielding 87% accuracy. The authors concluded these results demonstrate “the findings were replicated on a second sample,” thus “supporting the generalizability of the model.”</p>



<p>Soon after publication, experts took to Twitter to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/06/high-profile-paper-that-used-ai-to-identify-suicide-risk-from-brain-scans-retracted-for-flawed-methods/" target="_blank">critique the paper</a>&nbsp;for its small sample size and questioned whether the model could be broadly applied.In response to renewed criticism in 2019, an account for the journal&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/NatureHumBehav/status/1156894892062367747?s=20" target="_blank">tweeted</a>&nbsp;that the paper was published “following thorough peer review because it provided important proof of concept for a potentially valuable method on a question of substantial clinical relevance.”</p>



<p>The authors&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01581-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retracted</a>&nbsp;the paper this year after Timothy Verstynen of Carnegie Mellon University and Konrad Paul Kording of the University of Pennsylvania submitted a&nbsp;<a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP1952727XEAD4F4DB36F749F198B6A7490000A415YI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41562-023-01560-6&amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matters Arising</a>, a paper detailing their unsuccessful attempts to replicate the 2017 work with the code and data the authors had made available, and their concerns about bias in the model.</p>



<p>“While revising their response to these concerns, the authors confirmed that their method was indeed flawed, which affects the conclusions of the article,” the retraction notice stated. “The authors aim to demonstrate the predictive value of machine learning applied to fMRI data for the classification of suicidal ideators using new data and analyses in an independent future publication.”</p>



<p>In a statement, Just of Carnegie Mellon said they had discovered an “error in the statistical analysis” of the paper that “overestimated the strength of the main finding,” but “the main effect is present and clearly reliable.”</p>



<p>Just said the group was preparing a new submission describing the corrected results, and added the authors had notified their grants officer at the National Institute of Mental Health of the retraction. Their successful grant application&nbsp;<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/t5aT9-W7QECwxmxDXtFrRw/project-details/10386788#description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included the findings</a>&nbsp;described in their now-retracted paper.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Nature Human Behaviour said that the journal “cannot discuss the specifics of individual cases,” but added that, in general, a paper’s authors can appeal the rejection of a submitted paper.</p>



<p>The journal’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/submission-guidelines/editorial-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editorial policies</a>&nbsp;state that “decisions are reversed on appeal only if the editors are convinced that the original decision was an error.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad it only did six years worth of damage rather than 10 years worth of damage,” said the anonymous reviewer about the paper’s eventual retraction. “But it should never have been let out.”</p>

Teams that have some degree of task interdependence need a number of “key ingredients” in order to be effective. To begin, role clarity is a must. Then the team needs to have a compelling reason to be a team. That is, clear, valued goals and a purpose. The team leader matters—a leader who orchestrates the functioning of the team moment-to-moment by providing guidance, support, and caring for team members’ well-being and focus. They set the tone for the behavioral norms and how to resolve conflict and move ahead. This means the team members must perceive they have psychological safety to raise issues of concern. And finally, to mature, evolve, and be resilient—teams need a discipline of debriefing. Engaging in reflections of what transpired and how they can improve.</p><h2>What is the difference between good and bad team communication?</h2><p>The funny thing about team communication is that there is a belief that “more is better.” But research shows that “better is better” and not more. In fact, from our experience the best teams are relatively quiet. That does not mean there is no communication going on, there is, but its timely and efficient. We think that what matters in teams is to hold robust information exchange protocols—protocols that allow for clear and accurate exchange of information and encourage team members to share unique information that others don’t possess.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Organizations need to provide team and leader development and tools that mimic the new remote world.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><h2>How do we develop and support the next generation of leaders in a more remote world?</h2><p>Yeah, the world of work has changed. Hybrid work might be the new normal. Although some organizations are going back to in-person too. In a “remote world” the teamwork issues are more challenging. More salient. Teams must pay more attention to the building blocks we noted as they are less likely to just “happen.” For example, it often takes longer to create psychological safety and mutual trust in a team when some teams members are remote, while others are collocated. So, organizations need to provide team and leader development and tools that mimic the new remote world. For team training, it can be helpful to use “simulations” as a means of building teamwork “muscles” that are relevant to the context they work in.</p><h2>How does increased flexibility impact employees and organizations?</h2><p>Flexibility has two sides. Personally, most employees want flexibility, including having some degree of control over where and when they work. But employees also need to know where and how to communicate and coordinate with co-workers… and it is more difficult to maintain an awareness of who is available and who has the latest information when team members have a great deal of personal flexibility. To attract, retain, and engage employees, employers need to allow ample flexibility. And they then need to provide the tools, resources, and processes that enable them to coordinate effectively.</p><div><blockquote><p>“To attract, retain, and engage employees, employers need to allow ample flexibility and provide the tools that enable them to coordinate effectively.”</p></blockquote></div><h2>What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?</h2><p>From the teamwork and collaboration angle—teams are here to stay, whether they are in person, remote, virtual or some hybrid form. More collaboration will be needed. People will be more connected, there will more networks that need to coordinate, communicate, and cooperate to succeed. We think a disproportionate share of breakthroughs, innovation, and knowledge generation will come from multi-disciplinary teams.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/pages/what-is-the-future-of-work?utm_campaign=1600526366456057904&amp;utm_source=oupblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=button&amp;utm_term=Salas"><strong>Visit the Rethink Work hub for more organizational psychology insights</strong></a></p></blockquote><p><em><sub>Featured image: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/745058687/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/745058687/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f06%2fTeamwork-Stock-Image-Canva-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/finding-purpose-for-the-corporate-office/">Finding purpose for the corporate office</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-veronica-schmidt-harvey-and-kenneth-p-de-meuse/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Veronica Schmidt Harvey and Kenneth P.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-bone-flute-lure-falcon">These ancient flutes may have been used to lure falcons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perforated bones excavated at an ancient settlement in northern Israel may be the oldest wind instruments found in the region. The small flutes could have been used to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35700-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make music, call birds or even communicate over short distances</a>, the researchers suggest June 9 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>The instruments were unearthed from the remains of small stone dwellings at a lakeside site called Eynan-Mallaha, which was home to the last hunter-gatherers in the region until about 12,000 years ago, says Laurent Davin, an archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. All of the flutes were made from the wing bones of waterfowl that spent winter months at the lake, he notes. Of the seven flutes found, the largest appears to be intact and is about 63 millimeters (2.5 inches) long.</p>





<p>Microscopic analyses of the instruments clearly show that the finger holes were carved by humans and were not the results of gnawing by rodents or tooth marks left by predators, says Davin.</p>



<p>Davin and his team used the wing bone of a modern-day female mallard to make a detailed replica of the ancient flute. When played, the instrument produced high-pitched sounds similar to the calls of the common kestrel and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, raising the possibility the instruments were used to lure birds. Evidence suggests the inhabitants of Eynan-Mallaha used the talons of these birds of prey as tools and may have worn them as ornaments, Davin says.</p>

<p>Such flutes may have themselves been worn when hunting, says Davin. The largest of the flutes was decorated with red ochre and had a worn spot where it may have hung from a string or a strip of leather.</p>



<p>Although the team’s finds are oldest wind instruments in the Middle East, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-flutes-found-germany">older musical instruments made of bone and ivory</a> have been unearthed in Germany (<em>SN: 6/24/09</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/taurine-slows-aging-mice-energy-drinks">Taurine slows aging in mice. Will it ever work for people?</a></h4>

              
                <p>An ingredient common in energy drinks and baby formula <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn9257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes mice healthier and extends their life spans</a>. It also appears to make worms live longer and improves the health of middle-aged monkeys, a large international group of scientists reports in the June 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The ingredient, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/herminia-pasantes-taurine-brain-cell-neuroscience">an amino acid called taurine</a>, is made by our bodies, and we eat it in meats (<em>SN: 7/21/22</em>). It’s not known whether extra taurine slows aging in people or if it is even good for us, though the new study turned up an association between lower levels of the amino acid and conditions such as diabetes and obesity.</p>





<p>Aging “is one of the great biological unknowns,” says biologist and cardiologist Toren Finkel of the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study. “So any way you can chip away at that edifice is great. And this is a new set of findings that deserves to be followed up.”<br><br>The results, 11 years in the making, center on taurine in part because scientists found its levels fall with age in the blood of mice, monkeys and humans. As far as amino acids go, taurine is an oddball: Unlike other more familiar amino acids, it doesn’t get incorporated into proteins. Nevertheless, it has a range of suspected jobs in the body, from helping the developing brain to eye health to digestion.</p>



<p>Molecular physiologist Vijay Yadav of Columbia University Irving Medical Center and colleagues found that extra taurine extended mice’s median life spans by 10 to 12 percent. For example, the median life span for female mice that didn’t get extra taurine was around 29 months. With taurine, that increased to nearly 33 months. Taurine led to a similar life span boost for shorter-lived worms; <em>C. elegans</em> went from a median of almost 20 days to about 23 days on the highest doses tested.</p>



<p>Taurine was also linked with health in mice and female monkeys. Extra taurine led to improvements in aspects of bone strength, muscle coordination and memory in experiments with groups of five to 10 mice. Six middle-aged rhesus macaques fed extra taurine for six months seemed healthier, weighed less, had denser bones and showed signs of better metabolic health compared with five monkeys that didn’t get extra.</p>



<p>The mice experiments used taurine levels that would be equivalent to about 3 or 6 grams per day for an adult human, Yadav says. A typical energy drink contains 1 gram. There aren’t obvious, known risks of taurine, but thorough long-term studies at these high doses for people have not been done.</p>



<p>Yadav and his colleagues did look at data of nearly 12,000 people and found that individuals with obesity or diabetes had less taurine in their blood than people without the condition. Those links are correlations; it’s not known whether low taurine had a part in causing those conditions. In a separate experiment, an intense bout of exercise led to more taurine in people’s blood. As to whether taurine supplements improve people’s health, “we need to wait for a clinical trial,” Yadav says.</p>



<p>For now, taurine “is promising as a life span and health-span intervention,” says John Tower, a molecular biologist and geneticist who studies aging at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who wasn’t involved in the study. But lots of questions remain, he says, including what taurine actually does in the body and whether it works similarly in different animals, including people. &#8220;We’ve got a long way to go.”</p>



<p>Finkel is circumspect, too. Because aging is so complex, a singular fountain of youth probably doesn’t exist. “I think there are going to be many tributaries of youth,” he says. “And so maybe this is a tributary, not a fountain.”</p>
