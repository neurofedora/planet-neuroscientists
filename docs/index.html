              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">Wildfire smoke is blanketing the U.S. East Coast. It won’t be the last time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even as the thick clouds of smoke from wildfires raging in eastern Canada, which blanketed the U.S. East Coast in a dangerous orange haze, begin to dissipate, researchers are warning it’s a sign of the times. </p>



<p>Canada’s fire outlook will remain higher than normal for June. And on a larger scale, climate change is projected to make fire conditions more common across Canada, Russia and Alaska’s boreal forests.</p>



<p>The current fires were sparked by lightning in the Canadian province of Quebec; like much of Canada, <a href="https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agricultural-production/weather/canadian-drought-monitor/current-drought-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parts of Quebec were abnormally dry this spring</a>.</p>





<p>Their smoky haze has dominated headlines, prompting warnings of dangerous air pollution levels. People were urged to stay indoors as much as possible, or wear masks, to avoid inhaling the fine particulate matter. The smoke, a toxic brew of irritant gases and tiny particles, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-health-risks-air-smoke-west-east-united-states">can cause asthma, respiratory and cardiovascular problems</a>, and can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">exacerbate existing conditions such as diabetes</a> and chronic lung conditions (<em>SN: 6/17/22; SN: 9/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>Wildfire-driven air pollution is all too familiar to residents of the Pacific Northwest and the U.S. West, where most of the continent’s large wildfires occur, but it’s less common in the eastern part of North America. So June’s headline-grabbing haze might be a wake-up call to East Coast policy makers about the hazards of climate change, some researchers hope.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of historical precedent for that, says Nicholas Bond, state climatologist for the state of Washington, who is based in Seattle. “There were some periods when dust [from the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s] made it all the way to Washington, D.C., bringing attention to the disaster that was occurring in the Plains states,” he says.</p>



<p>Whether eastern Canada’s forests in particular <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7e6e/meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will become more fire-prone due to climate change isn’t clear</a> from recent simulations of future climate and fire behavior. The current fires are not necessarily a harbinger of things to come so much as a reminder of what’s already here: They’re burning in regions that are already considered at risk of fire.</p>



<p>Climate change is projected to boost fires across other vast swaths of boreal forest in the Northern Hemisphere. It’s already having an impact. “Wildfires in the boreal forests of Alaska burned more acres in the past 20 years” than in the previous 20 years, Bond says. How much of the forest is on fire can vary significantly from year to year; 2020 was below-average, with about 73,000 hectares burned. But the overall trend of burned area in boreal forests is expected to curve steeply upward by the middle of the century: The acreage of burned area in Alaska is projected to increase by 24 to 169 percent from 2020 to 2050.</p>



<p>Fire seasons in boreal forests are also expected to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722018459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last longer and produce larger fires</a> each year. Climate change <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36500-5?utm_campaign=related_content&amp;utm_source=EARTHENV&amp;utm_medium=communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also increase the frequency of lightning strikes </a>that spark fires such as those currently burning in Quebec — although that, too, is still uncertain.</p>



<p>Canada is currently fighting severe fires across the country, from coast to coast, stretching its resources thin. &#8220;It is quite rare for us to have fire over such a broad area. It is an exceptional situation,&#8221; exacerbated by drought conditions in regions across the country, says Ellen Whitman, a forest fire research scientist at Natural Resources Canada, based in Edmonton. &#8220;Lightning ignitions are made more likely by drought, which is associated with climate change,&#8221; she says. And “lightning is expected to become more frequent due to changes to upper air patterns related to climate warming.”  </p>



<p>The threat in Canada is expected to remain high in the coming weeks, the Canadian <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2023/06/the-government-of-canada-provides-update-on-wildfire-seasonal-outlook-and-outlines-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government reported on June 5</a>. That’s also true for the United States. “The Pacific Northwest is liable to be dealing with considerable smoke later this summer,” Bond says, based on a <a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fire potential outlook report released June 1</a> by the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center. “For personal, selfish reasons I hope the winds do not bring the smoke our way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/groundwater-toxic-pollution-superfund">Rising groundwater threatens to spread toxic pollution on U.S. coastlines</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hidden flows of water are poised to flush toxic contamination into U.S. coastal communities.</p>



<p>Sea level rise from climate change won’t just force shorelines to retreat — in inland areas, it will guilefully lift groundwater into shallower soils. That rising water could infiltrate <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.168500245.55690018/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of U.S. Superfund sites</a> — severely polluted locations identified by the Environmental Protection Agency for cleanup — researchers warn in a preliminary study posted May 25 to <em>ESS Open Archive</em>.</p>



<p>These sites — and thousands of other polluted areas — could be at risk of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permafrost-thawing-pollution-arctic-climate-change">releasing heavy metals, radioactive elements, pesticides and industrial chemicals</a> associated with human health problems (<em>SN: 4/26/23</em>). People of color and low-income communities would be disproportionately affected.</p>





<p>“Just the sheer number of Superfund sites where there are these dangerous contaminants that could be liberated — it’s astonishing,” says coastal geologist Patrick Barnard of the U.S. Geological Survey in Santa Cruz, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the study. Many of the polluted areas have been managed without regard for groundwater rise, he says. “We need to think about what the future holds for these sites.”</p>



<p>The link between climate change, the sea and underground water may not be obvious, but it is intimate. At the beach, seawater can seep into the ground and move inland, permeating layers of earth under coastal communities. Meanwhile, rain and runoff can also trickle down from above. In the ground, this freshwater often sits atop the denser saltwater from the sea. And when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-climate-change-estimate-triples-number-people-path-rising-sea-levels">the sea level rises due to climate change</a>, it pushes all this groundwater up through the earth (<em>SN: 10/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>As the top of the groundwater — the water table — nears the surface, it can damage human infrastructure. It can also spread hazardous substances in the soil, exposing people and ecosystems nearby.</p>



<p>Environmental planner and geologist Kristina Hill found motivation for the new study while investigating groundwater conditions at a former Superfund site in the San Francisco Bay Area. There, groundwater was touching pollutants in the soil. “I started wondering, what is the scale of this problem?” says Hill, of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>She and her colleagues identified which of the roughly 1,300 U.S. Superfund sites are in low-lying coastal areas — no more than 10 meters above mean sea level — where groundwater rise could potentially infiltrate.</p>



<p>They found if the sea surface rose by one meter — a <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibility by 2100</a> — then groundwater could potentially rise into contaminated soils at 326 sites. New Jersey and Florida respectively contained the most at-risk Superfund sites — 54 and 51 respectively.</p>



<p>Not every polluted site in the United States is a Superfund site, but that doesn&#8217;t make them less hazardous, Hill says. Her team assessed that potential impact with a case study of the Bay Area alone. They flagged five Superfund sites and nearly 5,300 state-managed contaminated areas vulnerable to that one-meter sea level rise. There could be thousands more such sites up and down our coastlines, Hill says.</p>



<p>The researchers analyzed U.S. Census data to investigate who could face the greatest risk of exposure. People from socially vulnerable communities — those whose circumstances limit their ability to prevent suffering or loss in face of a disaster — bore disproportionate risk, they found.</p>



<p>“The findings are not surprising,” says hydrogeologist Holly Michael of the University of Delaware in Newark. This study takes the first step in addressing the hazard, by calling out where it could arise, she says. More local research will be needed to thoroughly assess each site’s risk and determine next steps, be that treating contaminated soils or removing them altogether.</p>



<p>As the ocean encroaches, Hill says, helping people move inland won&#8217;t be enough unless we also clean up our mess. “Otherwise, there will be a toxic area that we leave behind, and that will spread.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drought-forests-trees-weather-future">Surviving a drought may help forests weather future dry spells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some forests take one-two punches surprisingly well.</p>



<p>Researchers have shown that certain California forests exposed to two successive droughts weathered the second one much better than forests only hit by the later dry period. Given that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">the frequency and severity of droughts is increasing with climate change</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>), the findings suggest that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022AV000810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forested regions might fare better than predicted</a> in the future, the research team proposes in the May 17 <em>AGU Advances</em>. That’s important because of the many resources that forests provide, including their ability to sequester about a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the atmosphere every year.</p>





<p>Carl Norlen and Mike Goulden, ecologists at the University of California, Irvine, studied roughly 520,000 hectares of California forest (about 4 percent of the state’s forested areas). The researchers focused on conifers, trees such as pines and firs that have needles rather than flat leaves. Using archival data gleaned from airplane observations, Norlen and Goulden estimated the extent of conifer die-off during two droughts that struck from 1999–2002 and 2012–2015. “Both of them when they happened were considered some of the most severe droughts ever in California,” Norlen says.</p>



<p>When the researchers looked at forests that just experienced the 2012–2015 drought, they found that over 50 percent of forested areas showed evidence of die-off. But when Norlen and Goulden analyzed forests that had weathered both droughts, they were surprised to find that only 13 percent of those forested areas showed evidence of die-off after the second drought. The researchers also analyzed satellite data that revealed the severity of tree die-off, and they again found that forests hurt by one drought were better prepared to weather another.</p>



<p>The underlying cause of those differences probably has to do with the tree mortality that occurred during the first drought, Norlen and Goulden propose. Roughly 31 percent of the forested areas that experienced both droughts showed signs of die-off during the 1999–2002 drought. “We think that it has to do with experiencing die-off the first time,” Norlen says.</p>



<p>That makes sense, says William Anderegg, an ecologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who was not involved in the research. “You might have culled out the weak trees,” he says.</p>



<p>Norlen and Goulden speculate that the first drought eliminated trees <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bark-beetles-fungi-chemical-signals-infest">weakened by pests like bark beetles</a> (<em>SN: 2/21/23</em>), or perhaps that the dry conditions prompted trees to protect themselves by growing deeper roots. Those changes would have helped protect the remaining trees from future droughts, Goulden says. “You effectively have a stronger population.”</p>



<p>Getting at the root of why exactly some forests are better prepared to weather successive droughts will require more investigation, the researchers say. One way forward is to monitor individual trees to better understand their physiology, which other teams have done by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-trees-drought-survival-secrets">outfitting trees with sensors</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/23</em>).</p>



<p>However, the new findings already provide some hope for the forests of the future. Modeling work has suggested that <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/11/jcli-d-12-00430.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upwards of 50 percent of present-day conifer tree coverage could be lost</a> in the Northern Hemisphere by the end of the century. But this new work shows that that prediction might well turn out to be an overestimate. “There’s an element of it that’s actually hopeful,” Goulden says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-enceladus-plume-water-space">JWST captured Enceladus’ plume spraying water nearly 10,000 kilometers into space</a></h4>

              
                <p>Enceladus’ famous plume dwarfs the moon itself.</p>



<p>Geysers on Saturn’s icy moon <a href="https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov/apps/Enceladus_JWST.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spew water vapor nearly 10,000 kilometers into space</a>, a distance about 19 times the diameter of Enceladus, researchers report in a paper accepted in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. If the geysers were on Earth, the plume would touch the edge of our planet’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>NASA’s now-defunct Cassini spacecraft discovered almost two decades ago that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">Enceladus ejects salty water</a> from a subsurface reservoir (<em>SN: 5/2/06</em>). But the spacecraft’s orbit around Saturn meant it was too close to the moon to see the plume’s true extent.</p>





<p>In November, the James Webb Space Telescope turned its powerful infrared camera on Enceladus for the first time, gazing at the moon for about four minutes. JWST’s vantage point from across our solar system let it see the plume extending at least 9,600 kilometers from the south pole.</p>



<p>“Seeing it so big, water being everywhere, it was kind of a surprise,” says planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>



<p>JWST’s observations also shed light on how much water the plume pumps out and where those molecules end up.</p>

<p>Enceladus has been spewing the same amount of water since Cassini arrived at Saturn’s system 19 years ago: about 10 million billion trillion molecules per second (that’s a 10 followed by 28 zeros).</p>



<p>Roughly 30 percent of the molecules feed into a donut-shaped ring — called a torus — that encircles the entire Saturnian system. The remaining water either helps create one of Saturn’s iconic icy rings, or gets blown across the system, where the water may affect the atmospheric chemistry of Saturn and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/20-new-moons-saturn-now-most-any-solar-system-planet">its other moons</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/19</em>).</p>



<p>The plume’s consistency gives Villanueva hope that whenever scientists send another mission to Enceladus, the geysers will still be active. In the meantime, JWST will keep checking up on the moon. “The beauty with James Webb is we can point to it very often and see if that thing remains active all the time,” he says.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0234-y" target="_blank">scientific paper</a>&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/30/560837881/brain-patterns-may-predict-people-at-risk-of-suicide" target="_blank">international</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-a-machine-identify-suicidal-thoughts/" target="_blank">headlines</a>&nbsp;with its bold claim that the combination of brain scans and machine learning algorithms could identify people at risk for suicide with 91% accuracy.</p>



<p>The promise of the work garnered lead author&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/just-marcel.html" target="_blank">Marcel Adam Just</a>&nbsp;of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and co-author&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/about-us/our-people/faculty/david-brent-md" target="_blank">David Brent</a>&nbsp;of the University of Pittsburgh a five-year,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2018/august/marcel-just-nimh-suicide-grant.html" target="_blank">$3.8 million grant</a>&nbsp;from the National Institute of Mental Health to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/t5aT9-W7QECwxmxDXtFrRw/project-details/10386788" target="_blank">conduct a larger follow-up study</a>.</p>



<p>But the 2017 paper attracted immediate and sustained scrutiny from other experts, one of whom attempted to replicate it and found a key problem. Nothing happened until this April, when the authors admitted the work was flawed and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/06/high-profile-paper-that-used-ai-to-identify-suicide-risk-from-brain-scans-retracted-for-flawed-methods/" target="_blank">retracted their article</a>. By then, it had been cited 134 times in the scientific literature, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science — a large amount for a young paper — and received so much attention online that the article ranks in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/28130609#score" target="_blank">the top 5%</a>&nbsp;of all the research tracked by Altmetric, a data company focused on scientific publishing.</p>



<p>All this could have been avoided if the journal had followed the advice of its own reviewers, according to <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23837846/nature-human-behavior-editors-decision-letters-and-reviewers-comments.pdf">records of the peer-review process</a> obtained by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/" target="_blank">Retraction Watch</a>. The experts who scrutinized the submitted manuscript for the journal before it was published identified many issues in the initial draft and a revised resubmission. One asked for the authors to replicate the work in a new group of study participants, and overall, they recommended rejecting the manuscript.</p>



<span id="more-127269"></span>



<p>The records also show the journal’s chief editor initially followed the reviewers’ advice — but then accepted the paper with some changes to its text, but no added data. The documents don’t explain the editor’s decision to publish, and a journal spokesperson declined to discuss the reasons.</p>



<p>“I was very upset,” said one of the reviewers, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of breaking the convention of reviewer confidentiality. “Everybody knew this paper was garbage … and yet they went ahead and sent it out into the world.”</p>



<p>Just and colleagues’ manuscript began the peer-review process at the journal Nature Human Behaviour in early 2017. The paper described how the group used machine learning algorithms to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of people’s brains and identify those at elevated risk for attempting suicide.</p>



<p>The researchers used fMRI to catch a glimpse of what happened in the brains of 79 young adults when asked to think about concepts such as “death,” “trouble,” “carefree,” and “good.” After excluding participants whose scans the scientists said had too much noise, they applied machine learning algorithms to the data from 17 of the people who had previously thought about dying by suicide, and 17 control participants who had not reported having suicidal thoughts.</p>



<p>Using a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statology.org/leave-one-out-cross-validation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common method</a>&nbsp;for testing the performance of algorithms, the researchers trained their system on the data of all but one participant, and then asked the model to predict whether the left-out participant had thought about suicide or not. They repeated this process until the model had made a prediction for each participant, and reported the model made the right call 91% of the time. Specifically, the algorithms correctly identified 15 of the 17 participants who had suicidal thoughts and 16 of the 17 controls.</p>



<p>Two of the three experts who reviewed the submission at the request of the journal called the reported accuracy “impressively high,” but offered detailed critiques of the work.</p>



<p>One reviewer called aspects of the methodology “concerning,” such as the authors omitting about half of their original sample of participants when testing their model in the paper’s main analysis. Even if those choices didn’t introduce bias into the model, the reviewer wrote, they indicated the approach was “likely limited” in its usefulness for the general population.</p>



<p>Another reviewer who detailed many concerns with the manuscript called for the authors to test their model on a separate group of people.</p>



<p>The other expert wrote that the paper’s results were “remarkable,” but asked the authors to address “several problems.” That reviewer wanted to see individual brain data included in the supplementary material, and for the authors to show more of their data that went into their statistical analyses.</p>



<p>Based on the feedback, Stavroula Kousta, Nature Human Behaviour’s chief editor, invited the authors to address the reviewers’ “quite substantial concerns” in a revision.</p>



<p>The authors did so, submitting the updated manuscript for another round of review by the two more critical experts.</p>



<p>One of the reviewers was not impressed, because the main analysis still focused on 34 participants “cherry-picked” from an original pool of 79, the reviewer wrote.</p>



<p>The other reviewer was initially more positive, because the revision clarified that the authors had used the same algorithms to evaluate scans of 21 of the participants who were initially excluded from their tests, and achieved an accuracy of 87%.</p>



<p>But in additional comments, that reviewer noted “several irregularities in the details” of the analysis of the excluded participants.</p>



<p>“These things make me a bit worried that some liberties are being taken to make the results better than they would be with a truly straightforward, unbiased replication of the findings in a new sample,” the reviewer concluded. “I would feel more comfortable with an independent replication in a new sample without the ‘fudge factors’ that seem to be present in this analysis.”</p>



<p>In July 2017, Kousta rejected the manuscript.</p>



<p>In the rejection letter, Kousta wrote that “we would be very pleased to consider a revision” if the authors performed an independent replication in a new sample of participants. “Without these data, however, the reviewers’ concerns with the present dataset &amp; analyses are such as to preclude publication in Nature Human Behaviour.”</p>



<p>Yet in October 2017, the journal published the paper, without this additional data. The published version, however, describes the analysis of 21 of the participants who had been excluded from the main analysis, yielding 87% accuracy. The authors concluded these results demonstrate “the findings were replicated on a second sample,” thus “supporting the generalizability of the model.”</p>



<p>Soon after publication, experts took to Twitter to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/06/high-profile-paper-that-used-ai-to-identify-suicide-risk-from-brain-scans-retracted-for-flawed-methods/" target="_blank">critique the paper</a> for its small sample size and questioned whether the model could be broadly applied.In response to renewed criticism in 2019, an account for the journal <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/NatureHumBehav/status/1156894892062367747?s=20" target="_blank">tweeted</a> that the paper was published “following thorough peer review because it provided important proof of concept for a potentially valuable method on a question of substantial clinical relevance.”</p>



<p>The authors&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01581-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retracted</a>&nbsp;the paper this year after Timothy Verstynen of Carnegie Mellon University and Konrad Paul Kording of the University of Pennsylvania submitted a&nbsp;<a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP1952727XEAD4F4DB36F749F198B6A7490000A415YI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41562-023-01560-6&amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matters Arising</a>, a paper detailing their unsuccessful attempts to replicate the 2017 work with the code and data the authors had made available, and their concerns about bias in the model.</p>



<p>“While revising their response to these concerns, the authors confirmed that their method was indeed flawed, which affects the conclusions of the article,” the retraction notice stated. “The authors aim to demonstrate the predictive value of machine learning applied to fMRI data for the classification of suicidal ideators using new data and analyses in an independent future publication.”</p>



<p>In a statement, Just of Carnegie Mellon said they had discovered an “error in the statistical analysis” of the paper that “overestimated the strength of the main finding,” but “the main effect is present and clearly reliable.”</p>



<p>Just said the group was preparing a new submission describing the corrected results, and added the authors had notified their grants officer at the National Institute of Mental Health of the retraction. Their successful grant application&nbsp;<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/t5aT9-W7QECwxmxDXtFrRw/project-details/10386788#description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included the findings</a>&nbsp;described in their now-retracted paper.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Nature Human Behaviour said that the journal “cannot discuss the specifics of individual cases,” but added that, in general, a paper’s authors can appeal the rejection of a submitted paper.</p>



<p>The journal’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/submission-guidelines/editorial-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editorial policies</a>&nbsp;state that “decisions are reversed on appeal only if the editors are convinced that the original decision was an error.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad it only did six years worth of damage rather than 10 years worth of damage,” said the anonymous reviewer about the paper’s eventual retraction. “But it should never have been let out.”</p>

Teams that have some degree of task interdependence need a number of “key ingredients” in order to be effective. To begin, role clarity is a must. Then the team needs to have a compelling reason to be a team. That is, clear, valued goals and a purpose. The team leader matters—a leader who orchestrates the functioning of the team moment-to-moment by providing guidance, support, and caring for team members’ well-being and focus. They set the tone for the behavioral norms and how to resolve conflict and move ahead. This means the team members must perceive they have psychological safety to raise issues of concern. And finally, to mature, evolve, and be resilient—teams need a discipline of debriefing. Engaging in reflections of what transpired and how they can improve.</p><h2>What is the difference between good and bad team communication?</h2><p>The funny thing about team communication is that there is a belief that “more is better.” But research shows that “better is better” and not more. In fact, from our experience the best teams are relatively quiet. That does not mean there is no communication going on, there is, but its timely and efficient. We think that what matters in teams is to hold robust information exchange protocols—protocols that allow for clear and accurate exchange of information and encourage team members to share unique information that others don’t possess.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Organizations need to provide team and leader development and tools that mimic the new remote world.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><h2>How do we develop and support the next generation of leaders in a more remote world?</h2><p>Yeah, the world of work has changed. Hybrid work might be the new normal. Although some organizations are going back to in-person too. In a “remote world” the teamwork issues are more challenging. More salient. Teams must pay more attention to the building blocks we noted as they are less likely to just “happen.” For example, it often takes longer to create psychological safety and mutual trust in a team when some teams members are remote, while others are collocated. So, organizations need to provide team and leader development and tools that mimic the new remote world. For team training, it can be helpful to use “simulations” as a means of building teamwork “muscles” that are relevant to the context they work in.</p><h2>How does increased flexibility impact employees and organizations?</h2><p>Flexibility has two sides. Personally, most employees want flexibility, including having some degree of control over where and when they work. But employees also need to know where and how to communicate and coordinate with co-workers… and it is more difficult to maintain an awareness of who is available and who has the latest information when team members have a great deal of personal flexibility. To attract, retain, and engage employees, employers need to allow ample flexibility. And they then need to provide the tools, resources, and processes that enable them to coordinate effectively.</p><div><blockquote><p>“To attract, retain, and engage employees, employers need to allow ample flexibility and provide the tools that enable them to coordinate effectively.”</p></blockquote></div><h2>What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?</h2><p>From the teamwork and collaboration angle—teams are here to stay, whether they are in person, remote, virtual or some hybrid form. More collaboration will be needed. People will be more connected, there will more networks that need to coordinate, communicate, and cooperate to succeed. We think a disproportionate share of breakthroughs, innovation, and knowledge generation will come from multi-disciplinary teams.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/pages/what-is-the-future-of-work?utm_campaign=1600526366456057904&amp;utm_source=oupblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=button&amp;utm_term=Salas"><strong>Visit the Rethink Work hub for more organizational psychology insights</strong></a></p></blockquote><p><em><sub>Featured image: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/745058687/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/745058687/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f06%2fTeamwork-Stock-Image-Canva-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/745058687/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/finding-purpose-for-the-corporate-office/">Finding purpose for the corporate office</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-veronica-schmidt-harvey-and-kenneth-p-de-meuse/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Veronica Schmidt Harvey and Kenneth P.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-bone-flute-lure-falcon">These ancient flutes may have been used to lure falcons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perforated bones excavated at an ancient settlement in northern Israel may be the oldest wind instruments found in the region. The small flutes could have been used to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35700-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make music, call birds or even communicate over short distances</a>, the researchers suggest June 9 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>The instruments were unearthed from the remains of small stone dwellings at a lakeside site called Eynan-Mallaha, which was home to the last hunter-gatherers in the region until about 12,000 years ago, says Laurent Davin, an archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. All of the flutes were made from the wing bones of waterfowl that spent winter months at the lake, he notes. Of the seven flutes found, the largest appears to be intact and is about 63 millimeters (2.5 inches) long.</p>





<p>Microscopic analyses of the instruments clearly show that the finger holes were carved by humans and were not the results of gnawing by rodents or tooth marks left by predators, says Davin.</p>



<p>Davin and his team used the wing bone of a modern-day female mallard to make a detailed replica of the ancient flute. When played, the instrument produced high-pitched sounds similar to the calls of the common kestrel and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, raising the possibility the instruments were used to lure birds. Evidence suggests the inhabitants of Eynan-Mallaha used the talons of these birds of prey as tools and may have worn them as ornaments, Davin says.</p>

<p>Such flutes may have themselves been worn when hunting, says Davin. The largest of the flutes was decorated with red ochre and had a worn spot where it may have hung from a string or a strip of leather.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/taurine-slows-aging-mice-energy-drinks">Taurine slows aging in mice. Will it ever work for people?</a></h4>

              
                <p>An ingredient common in energy drinks and baby formula <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn9257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes mice healthier and extends their life spans</a>. It also appears to make worms live longer and improves the health of middle-aged monkeys, a large international group of scientists reports in the June 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The ingredient, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/herminia-pasantes-taurine-brain-cell-neuroscience">an amino acid called taurine</a>, is made by our bodies, and we eat it in meats (<em>SN: 7/21/22</em>). It’s not known whether extra taurine slows aging in people or if it is even good for us, though the new study turned up an association between lower levels of the amino acid and conditions such as diabetes and obesity.</p>





<p>Aging “is one of the great biological unknowns,” says biologist and cardiologist Toren Finkel of the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study. “So any way you can chip away at that edifice is great. And this is a new set of findings that deserves to be followed up.”<br><br>The results, 11 years in the making, center on taurine in part because scientists found its levels fall with age in the blood of mice, monkeys and humans. As far as amino acids go, taurine is an oddball: Unlike other more familiar amino acids, it doesn’t get incorporated into proteins. Nevertheless, it has a range of suspected jobs in the body, from helping the developing brain to eye health to digestion.</p>



<p>Molecular physiologist Vijay Yadav of Columbia University Irving Medical Center and colleagues found that extra taurine extended mice’s median life spans by 10 to 12 percent. For example, the median life span for female mice that didn’t get extra taurine was around 29 months. With taurine, that increased to nearly 33 months. Taurine led to a similar life span boost for shorter-lived worms; <em>C. elegans</em> went from a median of almost 20 days to about 23 days on the highest doses tested.</p>



<p>Taurine was also linked with health in mice and female monkeys. Extra taurine led to improvements in aspects of bone strength, muscle coordination and memory in experiments with groups of five to 10 mice. Six middle-aged rhesus macaques fed extra taurine for six months seemed healthier, weighed less, had denser bones and showed signs of better metabolic health compared with five monkeys that didn’t get extra.</p>



<p>The mice experiments used taurine levels that would be equivalent to about 3 or 6 grams per day for an adult human, Yadav says. A typical energy drink contains 1 gram. There aren’t obvious, known risks of taurine, but thorough long-term studies at these high doses for people have not been done.</p>



<p>Yadav and his colleagues did look at data of nearly 12,000 people and found that individuals with obesity or diabetes had less taurine in their blood than people without the condition. Those links are correlations; it’s not known whether low taurine had a part in causing those conditions. In a separate experiment, an intense bout of exercise led to more taurine in people’s blood. As to whether taurine supplements improve people’s health, “we need to wait for a clinical trial,” Yadav says.</p>



<p>For now, taurine “is promising as a life span and health-span intervention,” says John Tower, a molecular biologist and geneticist who studies aging at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who wasn’t involved in the study. But lots of questions remain, he says, including what taurine actually does in the body and whether it works similarly in different animals, including people. &#8220;We’ve got a long way to go.”</p>



<p>Finkel is circumspect, too. Because aging is so complex, a singular fountain of youth probably doesn’t exist. “I think there are going to be many tributaries of youth,” he says. “And so maybe this is a tributary, not a fountain.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronaut-brain-swell-space-recover">Brain cavities that swell in space may need at least 3 years to recover</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spacing out spaceflights may benefit astronauts’ brains.</p>



<p>While outside Earth’s atmosphere, fluid-filled chambers in the brains of astronauts tend to adapt to microgravity by expanding. But after a space mission, these structures might take <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33331-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three years to shrink back to normal</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The finding suggests that astronauts might need at least that much time between flights before their brains are ready to be in space again.</p>



<p>At the brain’s center sit four cavities — or ventricles — brimming with liquid that cushions the organ and clears out waste. But with little gravity in space, fluids accumulate in an astronaut’s head. So the ventricles adapt by taking in more fluid and expanding, says space scientist Rachael Seidler of the University of Florida in Gainesville.</p>





<p>Researchers knew that astronauts often return to Earth with enlarged ventricles. But Seidler and colleagues wanted to see if time spent in space or how much time had elapsed since past flights affect how much the brain changes during a mission.</p>



<p>The team examined MRI brain scans of 30 astronauts from before and after one of each astronaut’s missions. Analysis showed that the longer the mission, the more three of the four ventricles seemed to expand. The fourth ventricle is so small that possible volume changes may have been too tiny to detect, Seidler says. While two-week trips left a minimal mark on ventricles, six- and 12-month missions resulted in enlargement by fractions of a milliliter. The two longer durations led to similar amounts of expansion, suggesting the swelling slows after six months in space.</p>



<p>For the 18 astronauts who had flown before, time between missions also appeared to make a difference. In those who last visited space three to nine years prior, three of their ventricles expanded — on average, roughly 10 to 25 percent — during the mission that the researchers studied. But ventricles grew little to none in astronauts whose last spaceflight took place less than three years prior, which suggests their brains may not have had enough time between missions to fully recover, the scientists say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m glad that the [study] authors took the first step and are looking at this question,” says neuroradiologist Donna Roberts of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. “There are so many variables that could play into the brain changes that we’re seeing, and it’s hard to sort them out.”</p>



<p>Spaceflight’s effects on the brain are even more pressing now that NASA aims to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-mission-new-diverse-crew-astronauts-moon">send people to Mars</a>, which could be a two-year round trip, she notes (<em>SN: 12/1/22</em>). “Everybody talks about the rocket technology to get to Mars,” Roberts says. But “the humans — that’s the real challenge.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-editing-octopus-dna-cold-protein">RNA editing helps octopuses cope with the cold</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ocean can be a cold place to call home. Mammals like seals stay warm by enveloping themselves in a layer of thick fur and blubber. Cephalopods — the group of (mostly) ultrasmart mollusks that include squid and octopuses — don’t have that luxury.</p>



<p>Instead, some octopuses and squid cope by altering their bodies on the molecular level.</p>



<p>When water temperatures inside their tank dropped by 10 degrees Celsius, California two-spot octopuses (<em>Octopus bimaculoides</em>) changed what proteins they produce <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00523-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by editing vast swathes of their own RNA</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Cell</em>.</p>





<p>The “astounding high levels” of molecular editing — most of which occurs in the nervous system — could help octopuses’ brains function when temperatures plunge, says Joshua Rosenthal, a molecular neurobiologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass.</p>



<p>Another study in <em>Cell</em>, also published June 8, found a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.04.032" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar effect of temperature on RNA editing in California market squid</a> (<em>Doryteuthis opalescens</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have known for over a decade that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-squid-rna-editing-dna-cephalopods">cephalopods are masters of RNA editing</a> (<em>SN: 5/19/23</em>). DNA holds the instructions to make proteins, one of the key building blocks of the body. But it relies on messenger RNA — or mRNA — to shuttle those instructions out of the cell nucleus and to the proteins responsible for building other proteins.</p>



<p>Usually, mRNA faithfully copies these instructions. But sometimes, mRNA is edited, which can change how those proteins behave or even what proteins are made. For instance, about 3 percent of mRNA in humans has the capacity to be edited, though even fewer are edited.</p>



<p>Octopuses and squid take this editing to extremes — changing thousands of mRNA.</p>



<p>What sets off this storm of editing isn’t always obvious. Previous research suggested that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1212795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temperature might be a trigger</a>. To test this, Rosenthal and his colleagues either heated or cooled the tank temperature of octopuses and looked to see what proteins they produced in their brains. While heat set off very little editing, octopuses that experienced cool temperatures altered over 20,000 mRNA sites, which changed around a third of the instructions for making proteins.</p>



<p>This fury of editing started in the space of only a few hours — probably changing the behavior of octopus brains. For instance, the team found that mRNA editing caused kinesin, a protein that shuttles cargo in nerve cells, to slow its movement. Why this happens is unknown, but it might help the cargo-carrying protein harmonize its movements with other processes in the cell if they too become sluggish, Rosenthal says.</p>



<p>Cold-exposed squid also edited their kinesin — though in their case, the changes helped the proteins move greater distances inside cells, says Kavita Rangan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Diego who conducted the squid study.</p>



<p>Previous studies have shown that disease can cause RNA editing. This “truly amazing body of work” shows that environmental changes, like temperature, can also shape mRNA editing, says Heather Hundley, an RNA researcher at Indiana University Bloomington who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>Octopuses have long captured the public imagination through their intelligence and camouflage, says octopus study coauthor Matthew Birk, a cephalopod biologist at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Penn. “We’re now learning that they are strange not just on the outside, but down to the molecular level.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/how-to-prepare-and-share/">I dream of data: How to prepare and share research data to meet increasing institutional, funder, and journal requirements</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Lindsay Morton</em></p>



<p><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">Data sharing</a> has long been a hallmark of high-quality reproducible research. Now, Open Data is becoming the norm, an increasingly expected component of the publication process, encouraged and rewarded by top institutions and major funders. PLOS&rsquo; pioneering data policy helps researchers share data in an ethical way that supports reproducibility while honoring privacy. Learn how you can prepare to meet new and increasing data-sharing requirements with ease, and how we can help.</p>



<h2>The rise of data sharing</h2>



<p>For nearly a decade, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">PLOS&rsquo; data availability policy</a> has required authors to share the raw research data underlying their findings alongside published articles&mdash;with sensible exceptions respecting privacy, vulnerable populations, and dual use research of concern (DURC). That&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands of datasets available for validation, reuse, reanalysis, cross reference, database inclusion, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that same time period, much of our scholarly research community have embraced similar policies. Institutions and funders like <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/knowledge-sharing/cern-announces-new-open-data-policy-support-open-science">CERN</a>, <a href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/data-software-materials-management-and-sharing-policy">Wellcome Trust</a>, <a href="https://openaccess.gatesfoundation.org/how-to-comply/data-sharing-requirements/">Gates Foundation</a> and, soon, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">all US government funding bodies</a>, require data sharing, while others, including the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/guidance-on-the-implementation-of-plan-s/">Plan S</a> <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/organisations/">signatories</a>, strongly encourage it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In just the last four years, <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">we&rsquo;ve seen</a> an increase in public data sharing among PLOS comparators from 41% in 2019 to 47% in 2022. Repository use among PLOS authors has risen from 23% to 28% in the same period, and from 9% to 15% among comparators.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s highly likely that data-sharing requirements will continue to increase, and that the rates of both data sharing and repository usage will continue to trend upward in the coming years.</p>



<h2>When it comes to data, how Open is Open enough?</h2>



<p>Open Data is key to the verification and replication of published research; it demonstrates reliability, makes reuse possible, and enhances understanding of the work. When handled properly, publicly available data has also been associated with a 25% <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">increase in citations</a> on average.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Open&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean simply &ldquo;available.&rdquo; Just like Open Access research articles, truly Open Datasets are accessible, shareable, and reusable without restriction. But, importantly, Open is just a type of license. Data sharing doesn&rsquo;t work in practice unless datasets also meet accepted standards for findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability&mdash;better known as FAIR. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">Introduced in 2016</a>, the FAIR principles outline a <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">framework</a> for good data management that can be used as a guide in nearly any circumstances, whether research is published Open Access or in a subscription journal.</p>



<h2 id="success">Setting yourself up for data-sharing success</h2>



<p>Data-sharing <em>does </em>require some extra effort&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be demanding. By thinking about data presentation early in the research process you can make sharing your data a natural part of communicating your research and reap dividends in readership, citations, and attention.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Plan ahead<br></strong><br>Before you begin your research, create a <a href="https://plos.org/resource/how-to-store-and-manage-your-data/#data-management-plan">data management plan</a>. If you&rsquo;re applying for funding, you may already have given this some thought. Especially when you&rsquo;re working with a team it can be incredibly helpful to <a href="https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/data-management-guide/organising-your-data#Metadata">articulate expectations and establish norms</a> for things like the types and formats of data, storage, backup, and naming conventions, and file structures.<br></li><li><strong>Think about future users as you go<br></strong><br>Often when deep in a research project it&rsquo;s easy to use shorthand and temporary solutions&mdash;file names that make sense to you and no one else, column headers that don&rsquo;t specify units of measurement, dates that don&rsquo;t include the year. It&rsquo;s difficult and time consuming to go back and fix these things at the time of publication, long after the research has been completed. Instead, take a little time as you complete each element to think about what a researcher (another postdoc in your own lab, for example, or even you yourself a year or two in the future) might need to know in order to use the data and make those changes in the moment. When in doubt, refer back to your data management plan.<br></li><li><strong>Prepare a readme file<br></strong><br>Including a file contextualizing your data can make reuse <em>much </em>easier. Your readme file need not be complicated. Try imagining that you are writing a cover email to a collaborator, and include all the details you would want them to have when reviewing your data for the first time. Cornell University Library provides a useful <a href="https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme">template for organizing data readme files</a>.<br></li><li><strong>Choose a repository<br></strong><br>Depositing research data in a purpose-built repository is <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/10/data-repository/">the best way</a> to meet FAIR standards&mdash;especially the standards for findability and reusability. In <a href="https://plos.org/resource/how-to-store-and-manage-your-data/#choosing-repository">choosing the right repository for your research</a>, consider the content of your dataset and your audience. Does your project span several disciplines, making it suitable for a general data repository (like Dryad or figshare), or occupy a specific niche with a database all its own, (like GenBank, Crystallography Open Database, or ArrayExpress)? Where are readers most likely to look for a dataset like yours? If you are targeting a specific journal, do they offer any partner integrations you might take advantage of?<br></li><li><strong>Make sure your metadata makes sense<br></strong><br>The &lsquo;F&rsquo; in FAIR stands for &lsquo;findability&rsquo;&mdash;a quality that depends almost entirely on whether your data has been uploaded to a repository (see point 4), and thoroughly described using metadata. Some metadata may be generated automatically based on factors like your dataset title, field labels, descriptions, and abstract. In addition, most repositories will invite you to enter metadata as part of the upload process. You can prepare in advance by taking some time to consider keywords and search terms that are particularly relevant to your work. And of course, don&rsquo;t forget to switch your dataset from private to public, and include the correct link in any related publications.</li></ol>

<h2>Get started today</h2>



<p>Open Data is well established, and becoming increasingly normalized, but it is not quite universally accepted&mdash;yet. Now is the perfect time to get ahead of the curve and take advantage of the benefits of Open Data. Your future self will thank you.</p>

<p>Each year, the 500 undergraduates at <a href="https://saveethadental.com/">Saveetha Dental College</a> in Chennai, India, participate in 4-hour <a href="https://www.saveetha.com/best-practices">exams</a> that require them to write a 1500-word manuscript on research they have conducted. After faculty and students review and revise the papers, they use an online tool to add references to previously published work. Many of the papers are then submitted to and published by journals; the process contributed to the more than <a href="https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=Saveetha%20Dental%20College&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedDate&amp;orderBy=%2B_score&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=true&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;publishedDate.from=2022-01-01&amp;publishedDate.to=2022-12-31">1400 scholarly works</a> the dental school published last year.</p>



<p>Saveetha, which calls itself a&nbsp;<a href="https://saveethadental.com/research1">“pioneer in undergraduate publications,”</a>&nbsp;says the exercise is designed to help every student gain practical research experience—as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saveetha.com/best-practices">at least 10 publications listed in Scopus</a>, the vast literature database maintained by the publisher Elsevier.&nbsp;<a href="https://saveethadental.com/research1">The college’s website boasts</a>&nbsp;that one Saveetha student published 24 papers.</p>



<p>But the torrent of undergraduate manuscripts—on topics including&nbsp;<a href="https://digibug.ugr.es/handle/10481/79920">fruit intake by students</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=09757619&amp;AN=139149326&amp;h=wELaoTxj%2bpM9kRzof%2fjyTlmYuClMCT6TVeZnBStylzI5Vkuzr0ikqtrj6KmNWWphpdnX8HY9xqWCyvpyLiZZJw%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=/do/10.1126/science.adj1231/full/login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d09757619%26AN%3d139149326">awareness of mental health among teenagers</a>—also appears to serve a less savory purpose, an investigation by Retraction Watch has found. By systematically citing other papers published by Saveetha faculty—including papers on completely unrelated topics—the undergraduate publications have helped dramatically inflate the number of citations, a key measure of academic merit, linked to Saveetha.</p>

<p><strong>Fly factory planned for Mexico </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/natural-sciences-10"><em>Science News</em></a>, June 2, 1973</p>



<p>A ‘fly factory’ whose product is living flies — 300 million of them every week — is to be built in southern Mexico to help eradicate screwworms, a major livestock pest.… They feed on living host animals through open wounds or sores. The fly factory will raise millions of screwworm flies, sterilize them with radiation, and release them from low-flying aircraft to mate with native flies, producing eggs that will not hatch.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Mexico and the United States joined forces to finally purge North America of the screwworm scourge. The fly factory opened in 1976 and legions of sterilized screwworm flies were released in both countries, including along Mexico’s Isthmus of T­ehuantepec to obstruct northerly incursions. The eradication program was so successful that it spread to Panama.</p>



<p>By 2006, the United States, Mexico and Central America <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/3/4/930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared themselves rid of the pest</a>. Though brief outbreaks still occur, such as in Florida in 2016, deploying sterile flies remains an effective remedy. The tactic has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/screwworm-flies-sterilization-insect-control">inspired more recent efforts</a> to control <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-oks-first-gm-mosquito-trial-us-hurdles-remain">mosquitoes</a> and other harmful pests (<em>SN: 11/23/18, SN: 8/5/16</em>).</p>

                <p>On February 5, 2009, we were joined by Allison Doupe, who was Professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Physiology at the University of California San Francisco. Allison talked with us about the value of learned birdsong as a model for sensory and motor learning, the brain circuitry responsible for learning, remembering and controlling the song, and the importance of variability in adapting the song to changes in animal state or the environment.  </p>
<p>Somehow, that conversation was never posted. I encountered it while searching through old files looking for something else, and just recently heard it for the first time.  It is a wonderful conversation with a creative and insightful neuroscientist, and the information is still current, so I am posting it now.  </p>
<p>Stay on after the podcast to listen to an outtake containing a conversation between Allison and Michael Farries on the pallium, the functional equivalent of the cerebral cortex birds, and whether birds do or do not have a cerebral cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">The Parker Solar Probe may have spotted the origin of high-speed solar winds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spacecraft plunging into the sun’s atmosphere has revealed the likely source of powerful blasts of plasma in fast solar winds.</p>



<p>Far from the sun, the solar wind is a nebulous, turbulent plasma. But when NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">Parker Solar Probe</a> dipped within about 8 million kilometers of the sun’s surface, it detected narrow plasma streams (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>). The streams appear <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05955-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be guided by magnetic fields</a> tracing back to two relatively cool regions of the sun’s atmosphere known as coronal holes, researchers report June 7 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>The solar wind — the steady stream of charged particles flowing from the sun — has two distinct speeds, dubbed as “slow” and “fast.” Until now, it wasn’t clear what was speeding the fast solar wind along. The plasma in most of the solar wind consists of protons, electrons and the nuclei of atoms blowing at hundreds of kilometers a second. But plasma from the area above the coronal holes can travel more than 10 times as fast.</p>



<p>The fast plasma streams were associated with events <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">known as switchbacks</a>, in which portions of the magnetic fields near the sun reverse direction (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>). Switchbacks can result when magnetic field loops close to the sun’s surface connect to long field lines extending away from the sun. The reconnection leads to a sharp switchback kink that kicks the plasma on its way into space as the kink straightens out.</p>



<p>Higher energy streams, the researchers propose, are the result of newly reconnected field lines with sharply kinked switchbacks, while lower energy streams come from field lines with older kinks that had become more smoothed out.</p>



<p>Although the evidence that the fast solar wind is due to magnetic reconnections is compelling, it’s still circumstantial, says astrophysicist Stuart Bale of the University of California, Berkeley. “Our results suggest that the solar wind can be accelerated to high speeds very close to the sun,” Bale says.&nbsp;“This is somewhat different [than the] standard scenario of wind energization,” where the acceleration takes place farther from the sun.</p>



<p>Getting a handle on processes like the origin of the fast solar wind is important for practical reasons, Bale says. “We also believe that magnetic reconnection is responsible for solar flares and is involved in the release of coronal mass ejections, which have a major impact in space weather.” Solar flares and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-solar-flares-scientists-predict-sun-outbursts">space weather they create</a> have led to electrical grid disruptions on Earth and interrupted radio communications, and they may threaten astronauts (<em>SN: 7/30/2020</em>).</p>



<p>The findings are also an important clue in the enduring mystery of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona">why the sun’s atmosphere is millions of degrees Celsius hotter than its surface</a>, says astrophysicist Gary Zank, who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 8/20/17</em>). “But they do not identify the heating mechanism.” </p>



<p>The observations identify the importance of magnetic reconnection close to the sun, says Zank, of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. “The next step is to link that to the dissipation of the magnetic energy in determining the actual heating process.”</p>



<p>Another interesting aspect of the study is how the structure of the solar surface seems to be imprinted on the solar wind near the sun despite the presence of turbulence, says Amitava Bhattacharjee, a Princeton University astrophysicist who was not involved with the study. Other researchers have proposed that it can happen, he says, but in the new study, “the experimental and simulation evidence is more convincing.”</p>



<p>Parker’s ever closer encounters with the sun could confirm the source of the fast solar wind more definitively. And future passes will come as the sun heads into a phase with increasing numbers of sunspots and more solar wind, on the way to peak solar activity around July 2025.&nbsp; “As we move into solar maximum,” Bale says, “we expect some serious surprises.”</p>

<p>A public-health journal has retracted a study from Ethiopia that made unlicensed use of a questionnaire developed by a U.S. researcher known to aggressively protect his intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time, he didn&#8217;t have to: The journal’s publisher flagged the copyright infringement itself, Renee Hoch, managing editor at PLOS Publication Ethics, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<span id="more-127251"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>PLOS Global Public Health decided to retract the article because the authors did not have a license to use the MMAS-8 scale and the MMAS-8 data were essential in supporting the article’s conclusions. This decision is supported by the PLOS Licenses and Copyright policy and the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/sites/default/files/retraction-guidelines-cope.pdf">COPE Retraction Guidelines</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0000099">study</a> found that people with diabetes who had a glucometer at home were more likely to take their medicine as prescribed. It has been cited three times since it was published last year, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science, including once by a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274971">paper in <em>PLOS ONE</em></a> by the same group.</p>



<p>The Morisky Medication Adherence Scales (MMAS)-8 survey used in the study was first described in a 2008 publication by <a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/donald-e-morisky">Donald Morisky</a> of the University of California, Los Angeles. Since then, Morisky has demanded <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pay-or-retract-survey-creators-demands-money-rile-some-health-researchers">steep payments</a> from hundreds of researchers using the questionnaire, causing some who couldn&#8217;t pay to retract their work, as we reported in 2017 in partnership with <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morisky registered the copyright for the MMAS-8 scale in 2018 and trademarked it the following year. Philip Morisky, managing partner of Donald Morisky, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am not familiar with the article in question. Copyright exists automatically in an original work of authorship once it is fixed, but a copyright owner can take steps to enhance the protections.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He did not comment on the chilling effect such steps could have on public-health research, particularly in poorer countries. But Hoch said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As an Open Access publisher, we regret that license fees and other restrictions can create barriers to utilization of resources such as the MMAS-8, thereby creating inequities within the research community and impeding the advancement of research. Nevertheless, work published in PLOS must meet all applicable ethical and legal requirements, and we will take editorial action as needed if authors did not have requisite permissions or licenses for use of a third party resource.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hoch added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Of note, this type of issue can arise due to honest error if researchers are unaware of the applicable license requirements.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither the corresponding author nor the second author of the paper responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its May 10 <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0000099">retraction notice</a> for the study, titled &#8220;Medication adherence and its associated factors among type 2 diabetic patients in Ethiopian General Hospital, 2019: Institutional based cross-sectional study,&#8221; the journal states that the issue regarding permission to use the questionnaire could not be resolved during discussions with the authors, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Considering the nature of the concerns in this case, the article contents were removed from the journal’s website at the time of retraction.</p>



<p>The authors did not reply or could not be reached to comment on the retraction decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 6/9/23, 1115 UTC: Sofonyas A. Tiruneh, the second author of the paper, tells us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All the authors are from a developing country, and honestly, we were not aware that the Donald Morisky medication adherence tool required a fee to use. When we received the retraction notice, we attempted to contact Morisky, but unfortunately, no one responded to our emails before the retraction was initiated by the journal.</p>



<p>We are extremely disappointed with the situation, as it will have a negative impact on our professional profiles moving forward. We are uncertain about how we can reverse the retraction at this point, but we are willing to take any necessary steps if there is a possibility to do so.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-dying-star-supernova">A simulation of a dying star shows how it could create gravitational waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cocoons of debris around dying stars could shake ripples in spacetime unlike any astronomers have ever seen.</p>



<p>“This is a potential source of gravitational waves that has never been investigated before,” astrophysicist Ore Gottlieb of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., said June 5 in a news conference at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Albuquerque.</p>



<p>The waves could potentially be picked up in the latest run of LIGO, which began on May 24.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">LIGO’s first detection in 2015</a>, all the gravitational waves seen thus far have been from the spiraling death dance of two compact objects — black holes, neutron stars or both (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). These events give off what are called coherent gravitational waves. “You can think of it as an orchestra playing harmonically,” Gottlieb said.</p>





<p>A second type, incoherent waves, are expected to come from stellar explosions like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-searching-sources-gravitational-waves">supernovas</a> (<em>SN: 5/6/19</em>). Because those bursts are spherically symmetrical and relatively slow, their waves are difficult for LIGO to detect. They’re more analogous to individual instruments playing different songs at the same time.</p>



<p>Gottlieb and colleagues considered another type of stellar death called a collapsar. When massive stars collapse into a black hole, they can emit jets of material traveling close to the speed of light. Computer simulations of how those jets form <a href="https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAS242/ViewSubmissionFile.aspx?sbmID=120&amp;mode=html&amp;validate=false&amp;key=0Fs85MQav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a cocoon of material surrounding the jet</a>, full of hot, turbulent gas and debris that expand in an asymmetric bubble around the dying star, says Gottlieb, who presented the research June 6.</p>



<p>As the bubble expands and pushes its way through the star, it could bump spacetime enough to produce incoherent gravitational waves, Gottlieb and colleagues concluded.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">As a massive star collapses, it emits jets of material (red) and a cocoon of other debris around the jets (yellow and green). This simulation shows how the turbulence in the jets and cocoon could shake spacetime, and translates the gravitational waves they might emit into sound.</figcaption></figure>



<p>LIGO and its fellow detectors — Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan — currently have about a 1 percent chance of detecting cocoon gravitational waves. In future runs with improved detectors, that chance will go up.</p>



<p>Catching these waves could give astronomers a glimpse into the innermost parts of dying stars, which can’t be studied any other way, Gottlieb said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/masturbation-evolve-primates">When and why did masturbation evolve in primates? A new study provides clues</a></h4>

              
                <p>Though masturbation is common across the animal kingdom, it seems, at its face, to be an evolutionary paradox: Why would an animal waste time, energy and reproductive resources on self-pleasure instead of copulating with a partner?</p>



<p>Studies on individual species have found some explanations. Low-ranking Japanese macaques (<em>Macaca fuscata</em>), for example, masturbate to keep their sperm fresh for when they get a rare chance to mate. But the questions of when and why masturbation evolved in the first place have remained unsolved.</p>





<p>A new study, published in the June 7 <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>, suggests that the evolutionary history of masturbation in primates extends back at least 40 million years, and the behavior might indeed help male primates <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.0061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be ready to mate when they get the chance, and also stay free of disease</a>.</p>



<p>The authors are “the first to use a cross-species approach” to explore the function of masturbation, says Lateefah Roth, a biologist at the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry and Sex Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. It’s “a great starting point,” Roth says.</p>



<p>To determine when masturbation first evolved in primates, evolutionary biologist Matilda Brindle of University College London and colleagues sifted through the scientific literature to find records of which primates masturbate and which do not, whether in the wild or in captivity. </p>



<p>To fill gaps in the data due to masturbation not always being easy to observe (or looked for at all) by biologists, Brindle also sent out questionnaires to researchers to ask about their observations of primate masturbation that weren’t reported in the literature. This was especially important for information on female masturbation, Brindle says, which tends to go unnoticed because of a lack of an easy-to-spot erection. The team then used computer analyses to determine where in the primate lineage the behavior most likely originated.</p>



<p>Because of missing data, Brindle can’t definitely say whether the first ever primates masturbated. But she can say that from around 40 million years ago, “the ancestors of all monkeys and apes” seemed to have masturbated. This would be around when simians — apes and monkeys — split from the tarsiers, diminutive, bug-eyed primates that live in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>Once Brindle had identified when, she next turned to why. She looked at whether primates that masturbate tend to mate with multiple partners. This mating system would lead to evolutionary pressure for both males and females to gain more control over the mating process, like by being able to copulate more quickly, being readily aroused for preferred partners or by improving male sperm quality, as seen in the macaques. </p>



<p>Brindle also looked to see if primate species that masturbate tend to be infected by more pathogens, including those that cause sexually transmitted infections. Male Cape ground squirrels (<em>Geosciurus inauris</em>), for instance, are known to masturbate after sex to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013060" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleanse their systems</a> of infectious agents.</p>



<p>Brindle found that multiple mating partners and pathogen prevalence are associated with masturbation in male primates, but not in females. Masturbation can help males be ready to mate quickly with fresh sperm while also purging their reproductive tract of pathogens. But for females, the two hypotheses don’t mix. “Normally, the vagina is mildly acidic to keep pathogens at bay,” Brindle says, but it becomes less so when the female primate is aroused so that sperm aren’t killed on arrival. Making the vaginal environment safer for sperm also makes it safer for pathogens.</p>



<p>While the study found no correlation between female primate masturbation and having multiple mating partners, Brindle suspects that there probably is a relationship that would come to light with more data. “I would bet a lot of money on the fact that if we got more data down the line,” she says, “then we would find an effect for females.” The paucity of data for females may be driven in part by the historical tendency to think of female animals as “passive recipients of male behavior,” Brindle says.</p>



<p>The stigma around studying masturbation and sexual behavior has started to ease up, Brindle notes, which makes her hopeful that more discoveries will be made soon. But given that other mammals, as well as birds and reptiles, also masturbate, Roth says, “if we want to understand the bigger evolutionary picture of this behavior, we need to look beyond primates.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-shot-cats-spay-pregnant">A gene therapy shot might keep cats from getting pregnant without being spayed</a></h4>

              
                <p>Invasive surgeries to spay cats could one day be a thing of the past, replaced instead with a single shot. &nbsp;</p>



<p>An injected gene therapy given to female cats <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38721-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented them from getting pregnant</a>, researchers report June 6 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. None gave birth to a litter of kittens even after mating with a fertile male. The tactic, if it holds up in further testing, could offer a more efficient way to control a global population of feral cats that numbers in the hundreds of millions.</p>





<p>“We love domestic cats, but they are killers out in the environment,” says Bill Swanson, a conservation biologist at the Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden. Every year, free-roaming cats around the world probably kill <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cat-meat-meals-diet-playtime-wildlife-birds">billions of birds and small mammals</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/13</em>). Spaying both feral and pet cats can help to keep feline populations, and their casualties, under control. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The experimental gene therapy targets anti-Müellerian hormone, also known as Müllerian inhibiting substance, a protein that helps fetal sex organs develop. After injection, a modified virus introduces the gene that makes the hormone into the cats’ cells. The cells then make more anti-Müellerian hormone than normal. High levels of the protein may prevent a cat’s ovaries from releasing eggs by keeping follicles — the structures that house and release eggs — in a dormant state.</p>



<p>In the new study, Swanson and colleagues treated six female cats with the gene therapy. Three received a high dose and another three received a lower dose. An additional three control cats got a placebo. None had any severe side effects.</p>



<p>The team housed all nine cats together with a fertile male in two, four-month-long trials. One trial took place eight months after treatment; the second, with a different male, happened nearly two years after the injection. In both trials, the control cats gave birth to litters after mating with males only once. But none of the six treated cats became pregnant, despite two of them mating with the males.</p>



<p>The proof-of-concept study is “the first real sign of hope that we could do something besides spaying cats,” says Julie Levy, a veterinarian at the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved in the study. The single-dose injection is especially promising to control feral populations, eliminating the need to bring wild-living cats into a clinic for surgery or trap animals more than once to administer multiple doses.</p>



<p>Past alternatives to surgery, such as vaccines, proved ineffective over the long term. Vaccines teach the body to attack foreign invaders. Crafting a contraceptive vaccine targeted at the pituitary, which releases the hormones that spark ovulation, was difficult. “Your whole immune system is tuned to know what’s you, and it should not attack, and what is foreign, and it should attack,” Levy says. Diseases can develop when immune responses learn to attack the body itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many researchers tried to develop various vaccines as a cat contraceptive, but “we gave up,” Levy says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The experimental gene therapy could be a better approach because it doesn’t rely on the immune system and instead makes more of something that the body already has, so the immune system ideally won’t get involved at all.</p>



<p>What’s more, the gene is delivered to muscle cells, says David Pépin, a reproductive biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. There, the cell makes the hormone using small, circular strings of DNA. These strings float around the cell and aren’t inserted into the cell’s instruction manual, the DNA housed inside the nucleus. Because muscle cells generally don’t die, the DNA can stick around for a lifetime.</p>



<p>The study reports results after two years, Pépin says, but to date the team has followed the cats for more than four. Because gene therapy can last for a lifetime in other animals, including people, it’s likely that, with proper dosing, the same would be true for cats.</p>





<p>In the study, two of the treated cats mated with males. One mated a total of nine times yet still never got pregnant. Zooming in on all the cats’ hormones revealed that the treated females didn’t ovulate, but other hormones involved in reproduction and estrus — also known as heat, a time when female cats are ready to mate — remained intact.</p>



<p>The four treated cats that never bred with the males had spikes in estrogen levels, one sign of estrus. But you’d never have guessed that based on the cats’ behavior, Swanson notes. The females didn’t allow the males to breed, a sign those females weren’t in heat.</p>



<p>Males pursuing a ready-to-breed female are incredibly persistent if she’s in estrus, he says. A male will become restless, endlessly following a female and attempting to mount her if he thinks it’s possible to breed. “It’s like velociraptors in Jurassic Park testing the fence. All the time they’re testing these cats if they’re in estrus.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the kind of annoying behavior that makes people not want cats in their neighborhoods, Levy says. For her, the ideal cat contraception would keep females from allowing any males to breed with them. Hopefully that would stop fertile, disruptive males from yowling, spraying urine to mark territory and fighting other males when chasing a female rendered infertile by gene therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will still be years before the treatment makes it to vet offices, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar agencies around the world. Swanson, Pépin and colleagues are still tweaking the gene and method of delivery, exploring how to make it as effective as possible as well as cost-effective to make. Clinical studies with more cats are also required to verify the injection’s safety and efficacy.</p>



<p>Still, “it’s a really different way to do contraception,” Pépin says. And anti-Müellerian hormone is common among animals, so it may be possible to expand to other invasive species. Pépin and others are even exploring ways to leverage the hormone <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birth-control-research-moving-beyond-pill">in humans as a nonpermanent form of contraception</a> (<em>SN: 8/22/17</em>). There’s still a lot to learn, “but I think there’s a great opportunity here.”</p>

                <p>A crack team of arthropod bodyguards may be defending that cherry tree in your backyard or the maple across the street.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mites protect plants by acting like herds of grazing sheep, munching the fungi that creep across leaves. And ants patrol branches, ready to bite or sting hungry caterpillars ­— or even elephants. In return for the protection, plants offer food and housing.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>This kind of cooperation has evolved over and over again, says Marjorie Weber, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Plant bodyguards are everywhere, she says, but most people don’t even notice.</p>



<p>Weber says she has long been drawn to “bizarre and interesting and underappreciated species.” As a kid, she liked roly-polys, earthworms, beetles and spiders. But more than individual bugs, Weber is fascinated by the richness of life on Earth. How did this vast assortment of species come to be? Start talking biodiversity, and Weber bubbles with questions: Why do we have so many different types of flowers? Why are there millions of insect species and relatively few species of sharks? Why did one branch of the tree of life flourish while another withered? “I’m just really passionate about these big biological mysteries,” she says.</p>





<p>Her office at the university looks how you might imagine it would for someone so captivated by the natural world. A fiddle-leaf fig towers over her desk and potted plants crowd the window. Science art adorns the walls: a hanging print of flowering plants’ evolutionary history, a blown-up image of a glimmering orchid bee and an illustration of Charles Darwin, his famous finches peeking out from his beard.</p>



<p>Since Darwin’s time, scientists studying what drives evolution have focused largely on antagonistic interactions between species, like finches competing for seeds and arms races between predators and prey. Cooperation’s role in evolution hasn’t always been taken seriously, “largely because it was viewed as a more feminine perspective,” Weber says.</p>



<p>Weber’s lab focuses on how cooperation drives evolution and biodiversity. She spends her time in the field, greenhouse and the lab, documenting interactions between plants and arthropods, as well as using computational techniques to analyze evolutionary patterns.</p>



<p>Weber may be best known for her work on extrafloral nectaries. These nectar-filled knuckles bulge from leaves and stems on some plants, leaking sugary snacks that entice ants to stick around and fend off attacks. Weber looked at extrafloral nectaries in modern vascular plants and then reconstructed the trait’s evolution across ancient plant species. The trait, she discovered, was a recipe for evolutionary success. Once the sweet structures evolved in a branch of the plant family tree, that branch quickly accumulated more species. That suggests that the opportunity to trade nectar for insect protection actually spurred plants to diversify.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042823_SN10-marjorie-weber_inline.jpg" alt="An ant stepping on a branch covered in green lumps" class="wp-image-3124620" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042823_SN10-marjorie-weber_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042823_SN10-marjorie-weber_inline-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042823_SN10-marjorie-weber_inline-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/042823_SN10-marjorie-weber_inline-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124620">Some plants form sugar-secreting growths (green ovals) that ants find appetizing. These insects protect the plants from predators, a kind of ant-plant cooperation that has appeared often throughout evolution.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124620">Ellen Woods</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“That’s not what people expected,” says Judith Bronstein, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Scientists might assume such an adaptation would help a particular plant survive and its population to grow, but they don’t know why the number of plant species would multiply.&nbsp; “Somehow, possessing extrafloral nectaries leads to diversification,” she says. “And that’s a fantastic avenue for future research.”</p>



<p>Weber’s work stands out because she’s able to pull together scientific threads and braid them into something “completely new and completely different,” Bronstein says. “That’s how you trailblaze in our field.”</p>



<p>Weber is blazing trails elsewhere too. In 2018, she cofounded <a href="https://projectbiodiversify.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Biodiversify</a>, a program to make biology education not only accurate and compelling, but also “as equitable and inclusive as possible,” Weber says.</p>



<p>Weber didn’t see herself as a scientist when she was young. As a student growing up in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, she didn’t see examples of women scientists, and she never thought about science as a career option. A biology course with spider scientist Greta Binford at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Ore., changed everything. “Knowing that was a job and watching her do it was just incredibly life-shaping for me,” Weber says. Binford let Weber come work in her lab, studying brown recluse spiders. She encouraged Weber’s interests and “went out of her way to convince me that I was smart enough and could do this,” she says.</p>



<p>Years later, after Weber had a lab of her own, she and colleagues decided to investigate how well college biology textbooks represented a diverse set of scientists. The results, reported in 2020, called out the <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.0877" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stark demographic mismatch between scientists featured in textbooks</a> (mostly white men) and the students using them. Weber’s team works to bridge that gap by developing resources for teachers that highlight a diverse group of role models in biology.</p>





<p>Weber hopes to inspire students to learn about how the world works. She’s a “fantastic adviser,” says ecologist Eric LoPresti of the University of South Carolina in Columbia, a former postdoc in Weber’s lab. She builds a supportive community and makes sure that everyone feels involved, he says. It’s a culture LoPresti has tried to mimic in his own lab.</p>



<p>Weber’s advice for young people is to look around and take note of what sparks your excitement ­— maybe you’ll spot a curious-looking crew of ants marching up and down a tree. “That’s what it really means to be a scientist,” Weber says. “Pursue those feelings of awe and ask questions about the world with your eyes wide open.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-dug-cave-graves-carved-marks">Homo naledi may have dug cave graves and carved marks into cave walls</a></h4>

              
                <p>An extinct, small-brained hominid known as <em>Homo naledi</em> <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.01.543127v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intentionally buried its dead</a> in two underground cave chambers 160,000 years or more before the earliest evidence of deliberate interments by <em>Homo sapiens</em> or Neandertals, researchers say. But that conclusion has already generated skepticism and calls for more thorough investigations of the new South African finds.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans"><em>H. naledi</em>, which lived in southern Africa between roughly 335,000 and 236,000 years ago</a>, also engraved marks on the side of a corridor and entryway that connects the adjacent cave chambers, contends an international team led by National Geographic Explorer in Residence Lee Berger, a paleoanthropologist at Wits University in Johannesburg, South Africa (<em>SN: 5/9/17</em>). <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.01.543133v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many engravings</a> consist of isolated lines or lines that form crosshatches, squares, triangles, crosses and X shapes.</p>





<p>If correct, Berger and colleagues’ interpretation of their discoveries indicates that an ancient <em>Homo</em> species with an orange-sized brain — which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledis-brain-shows-humanlike-features">possibly displayed humanlike features</a> — engaged in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.01.543135v1.article-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortuary and symbolic activities</a> often thought to have emerged only in larger-brained species such as <em>H. sapiens </em>(<em>SN: 4/25/17</em>).</p>



<p>“These are remarkable discoveries of a [<em>Homo</em>] species that had brains one-third the size of ours yet buried their dead and carved meaning-making symbols on cave walls,” Berger,  said at a press conference on June 1. He and colleagues report the new <em>H. naledi</em> findings in three bioRxiv.org papers accepted for publication in <em>eLife</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-oldest-known-human-burial-child-grave-cave">The oldest known <em>H. sapiens</em> grave</a> dates to about 78,300 years ago in Africa (<em>SN: 5/5/21</em>). Contested <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-cave-fossils-have-revived-debate-over-neandertal-burials">Neandertal graves in Iraqi Kurdistan</a> are roughly 70,000 to 60,000 years old (<em>SN: 2/18/20</em>). In South Africa’s Blombos Cave, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-african-cave-stone-may-bear-worlds-oldest-drawing">a crosshatched design on a rock</a> dates to around 73,000 years ago and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engraved-pigments-point-ancient-symbolic-tradition">geometric patterns incised on pigment pieces</a> date to as early as about 100,000 years ago (<em>SN: 9/12/18</em>; <em>SN: 6/12/09</em>).</p>



<p>Some researchers consider the new evidence inadequate to confirm that <em>H. naledi</em> interred its own in cave graves. And there is no way to determine whether <em>H. naledi</em> or perhaps later <em>H. sapiens</em> visitors to the underground caves — part of South Africa’s Rising Star Cave System, about 40 kilometers west of Johannesburg — created the undated engravings found by Berger’s group.</p>



<p>“I think that deliberate burial of the dead by <em>Homo naledi</em> is clear, although it is unlikely that the evidence so far presented will satisfy all scholars,” says archaeologist Michael Petraglia of Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, who is not part of Berger’s team.</p>



<p>One objection comes from paleoanthropologist María Martinón-Torres, director of the Spanish National Research Center on Human Evolution in Burgos. She suspects that disconnected skeletal parts described in the new papers accumulated either after bodies of the dead that had been placed in cave shafts later fell through or had been left at the back of underground caves. Trampling or other <em>H. naledi</em> activities in caves could eventually have produced fragmentary sets of fossils uncovered by Berger’s group, says Martinón-Torres, who along with Petraglia studied the oldest known <em>H. sapiens</em> burial in Africa.</p>



<p>It’s possible that periodic water seepage into the underground caves helped to move partial or complete <em>H. naledi</em> corpses down sloping cave floors until they came to rest in natural depressions that Berger’s team suggests are intentional burial sites, says archaeologist Paul Pettitt of Durham University in England.</p>



<p>Previous suggestions that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-fire-hominid-cave-human-evolution"><em>H. naledi</em> lit campfires</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-child-skull-hominid-cave-discovery">deposited comrades’ dead bodies in passages</a> that descend into underground chambers have also been criticized as lacking definitive evidence (<em>SN: 12/2/22</em>; <em>SN: 11/4/21</em>).</p>

<p>In 2018, Berger’s team excavated what they consider the skeletal remains of an adult <em>H. naledi</em> whose body was placed in a shallow pit that was dug in the Dinaledi Chamber, a cave space in the Rising Star Cave System where <em>H. naledi</em> fossils have previously been found. Bones of the newly unearthed individual became detached over time as the body decomposed in dry sediment that collapsed in on it, the scientists say. That process, or perhaps the digging of other burials in the chamber, caused bone fragments of at least one other individual to enter the grave.</p>



<p>A second set of fragmentary <em>H. naledi</em> fossils found in another shallow pit in the Dinaledi Chamber have not yet been analyzed.</p>





<p>In 2017, the scientists also removed fragile <em>H. naledi</em> remains encased in three blocks of sediment from a small section of an adjacent underground space dubbed the Hill Antechamber.</p>



<p>CT scans of the blocks have identified partial skeletal remains of a roughly 13-year-old <em>H. naledi</em> whose body, curled in a fetal position, was placed in a shallow, dug-out depression and covered with dirt, the scientists say. Scattered teeth of two other <em>H. naledi</em> individuals were also detected in this block, possibly entering via sediment disturbances or as <em>H. naledi</em> buried others in the Hill Antechamber, the team suspects.</p>



<p>A crescent-shaped stone identified among scanned <em>H. naledi</em> fossils includes a point, sharp edges and other signs of having been an implement of some kind, the investigators note. But scans of that stone reveal no clear indications of intentional modifications, Pettitt says. This find should be examined more closely after it’s removed from surrounding sediment, he says.</p>



<p><em>H. naledi</em> must have used a tool capable of chiseling through extremely hard rock to engrave lines and designs found on the sides of a corridor and entryway into the Hill Antechamber, Berger said at the news conference. Later Stone Age cave art of Neandertals and <em>H. sapiens</em> includes similar geometric drawings. There is no evidence that present-day cavers have created comparable engravings anywhere in the Rising Star Cave System, he said.</p>



<p>But the underground cave engravings remain undated. There is no way to know whether people reached the cave chambers within the past few thousand years and carved those wall patterns, Pettitt says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pieces-homo-naledi-story-continue-puzzle"><em>H. naledi</em> may have had access to larger openings into the Dinaledi Chamber</a> than exist now, says zooarchaeologist Aurore Val of Aix-Marseille University in France (<em>SN: 4/19/16</em>). Although the new reports don’t clearly establish that <em>H. naledi</em> dug cave graves and created rock designs, members of this ancient species were “doing something different and unusual” in the Rising Star Cave System, Val says.</p>

          <p>Author: Alison Mudditt, CEO, PLOS</p>
<p>Note: This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the UN Open Science Conference and has been lightly edited for length and format. This is the first of four blog posts on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>For the past three years, scientists have been going to school in a giant lab whether they realized it or not. The pandemic placed research in the spotlight like never before. We saw global scientific collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Across countries and disciplines, thousands of experts focused urgently on a single problem, that of COVID-19.</p>



<p>This forced some key breakthroughs for Open Science as everyone rose to the challenge:</p>



<ul><li>Information previously locked behind paywalls, even though much of it was publicly funded, was opened to scientists globally.</li><li>Many of the usual imperatives of the dysfunctional academic credit system were set aside as results and data were shared immediately.&nbsp;</li><li>Preprints and other online sharing become the norm when the delay of even a few weeks to publication could mean lives lost.</li><li>Hundreds of clinical trials were launched, bringing together labs and hospitals around the globe.</li><li>The usual secrecy and hoarding of data that might lead to grants and promotions was eroded by the urgency of the moment.</li></ul>



<p>All of this happened because it was a matter of survival experienced urgently and simultaneously by societies around the world. But the fundamental flaws of traditional research practices and sharing were also laid bare by the pandemic. And they perfectly illustrate the imperatives of Open Science at global scale<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The lessons learned by all of us should light a better path forward. What became possible during the pandemic should become the norm, not the exception.</p>



<p>Publishers agreed that access to COVID-related research was critical to accelerate our response to the pandemic. Which raises both a practical and moral question as to why the same approach isn&rsquo;t required to solve problems like the climate crisis or finding a cure for cancer.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, we&rsquo;ve made tremendous progress with Open Access to scholarly knowledge. The vision that the entire body of published scholarship should be made available to everyone free of charge is now within sight.</p>



<p>But open science is about more than being able to read an article. It&rsquo;s about providing the right context to understand it, the resources to replicate it, the tools to collaborate and make science better. And it is also about equitable participation in knowledge creation and sharing.</p>



<p>Take a problem such as the hunt for a universal coronavirus vaccine. Imagine if we all had access to all elements of past and current research. Imagine if we had enough detail about experiments to replicate them. Imagine if we had access to all the underlying data to be able to reuse it. And imagine if we knew as much about the experiments that failed as the ones that worked. Is there anyone who really thinks that we wouldn&rsquo;t have found a vaccine both more quickly and efficiently?</p>



<p><strong>What&rsquo;s broken in scientific publishing and what it will take to institute radical change</strong></p>



<p>For scholarly publishing to arrive at this future state requires some radical change. Without change, we risk a range of challenges, including one we are all experiencing today &ndash; the continuing erosion of trust in science and expertise.</p>



<p>At the societal level, trust and confidence in science are crucial if we are to collectively tackle our global challenges. How, for example, can we expect people to &lsquo;get the jab&rsquo; if they don&rsquo;t trust the science or scientists who developed it?</p>



<p>Here in the US, trust in science took a real hit during the pandemic. But what is really striking is how this trend has been dangerously fueled globally by the rise in populist movements. A shift that&rsquo;s making it even harder to find agreement about causes and solutions to key threats such as the climate crisis.</p>



<p>Lack of public understanding &ndash; particularly among those with less knowledge about science &ndash; was a significant underlying cause. But the solution isn&rsquo;t to put science back into its black box.</p>



<p>The ways we share and communicate the results of research can make an impact. Accessible publication of the results, data and ideas arising from research is a fundamental part of how science functions and advances. Incentivizing this transparency can help build trust among stakeholders and enable more robust evaluation. However, a world in which every stage of the research process is shared by default is very different from the way the system works today.</p>



<p><strong>What&rsquo;s wrong with the current system?</strong></p>



<p>Plenty of people &ndash; primarily those who&rsquo;ve benefited from the current system &ndash; think it&rsquo;s fine. And those who want to change it, such as early career researchers, lack the power and influence to do so.</p>



<p>When it comes to scientific publishing, concerns about the ways in which commercial interests are distorting scientific values have been growing for decades.</p>



<p>There are most certainly commercial drivers at work. For many publishers, radical change is a threat to a very profitable business model that they want to protect.</p>



<p>Publishers operate in a conservative system in which change is slow and blocked, in large part by a fundamentally broken system of researcher incentives and rewards.</p>



<p>Most established researchers have been practicing closed science for years, even decades.&nbsp; Changing these old habits requires some upfront time and effort. Technology is helping speed this process of adopting open habits, but behavioral change is hard.</p>



<p>Scientists, like other humans, tend to repeat behaviors that are rewarded. Given the profusion of demands for assessment for grants and promotion, it&rsquo;s too easy to fall back on narrow and biased proxy metrics such as the Journal Impact Factor. It&rsquo;s an extraordinarily poorly used metric, frequently used as a mark of prestige which overshadows indicators of good scientific practices.</p>



<p>And journal editors tend to favor publishing papers that tell a tidy story with perfectly clear results. This has led researchers to craft their papers to be free from blemish, omitting &ldquo;failed&rdquo; studies that don&rsquo;t clearly support their theories.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a particular set of challenges for researchers in the Global South who are pressured into norms set by the Global North<strong>.</strong> To illustrate, here&rsquo;s a short story about an African scientist from the Jakarta Post.</p>



<p>She&rsquo;s a leader in the field of crop science whose recent research examined the role indigenous vegetables might have in addressing poverty, malnutrition and food insecurity in Africa.&nbsp; But when she submitted papers to well-regarded international scientific journals describing these findings, they were rejected. Not because the research was not good, but because the crops she was writing about were regarded as weeds by reviewers and editors in the Global North.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s just one example of how African research is excluded from established science publishing. People in developed economies determine what good science is without knowledge of the varying circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How We&rsquo;ll Make Change</strong></p>



<p>The challenges associated with changing these systems can feel overwhelming<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>They start with a broken incentive system where we&rsquo;re rewarding novelty and prestige. As a result, many research outputs aren&rsquo;t available &ndash; often because there&rsquo;s no incentive to share them. And this, in turn, fuels challenges with <a href="https://www.cos.io/rpcb">reproduction.</a></p>



<p>Finally, zooming up to the 30,000-foot level<strong>,</strong> it&rsquo;s hard to believe that well into the digital age, publication remains slow and final when the research process itself is dynamic and subject to revision.</p>



<p>Collectively, these problems lead to an entrenched stasis which blocks change.</p>



<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about here is a transformation of research culture and the incentives that drive researcher behavior. One that requires action from institutions, funders and policymakers along with publishers.</p>



<p>Publishers like to think of themselves as custodians of the research information supply chain. We pride ourselves on the critical role we play in weeding out poor quality and fraud<strong>, </strong>on curating what&rsquo;s most relevant and important to different readers and users.</p>



<p>Without underestimating the profound systemic issues<strong>,</strong> there are meaningful ways in which we can start to make progress and build a publishing system that better matches the research process it serves.</p>



<p>You will soon hear more on that next week when I provide specifics about how Open Science publishing can lead to transformational change.<strong></strong></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/air-pollution-track-biodiversity-edna">Air pollution monitoring may accidentally help scientists track biodiversity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to track animals and plants is up in the air — literally — thanks to help from an unexpected source.</p>



<p>Around the globe, many air quality control stations filter air through small paper disks on a daily or weekly basis, allowing scientists to ensure concentrations of hazardous pollutants such as heavy metals are below certain levels. But the filters also pick up <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00515-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plant and animal DNA that has been scattered into the wind</a>, researchers report June 5 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>The eDNA, short for environmental DNA, on those filters could make air quality control stations a treasure trove of samples cataloging local animals and plants. Such records could help researchers track biodiversity at a larger scale than ever before and more easily catch species declines or track how ecosystems are changing overall.</p>



<p>“It’s this incredible system that already exists, and we’re effectively piggybacking on it for a totally new use,” says Elizabeth Clare, a molecular ecologist at York University in Toronto. The facilities are widespread across North and Central America, Europe and Asia but are less dense in the global South.</p>



<p>“It never occurred to us that these filters capturing particulate matter could even be analyzed for environmental DNA,” says James Allerton, an air quality scientist at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, England. That changed when Allerton read a news story about two studies where scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-dna-air-scientist-vacuum-first-time-zoo">vacuumed animal DNA out of thin air</a> at two zoos, one in England — led by Clare — and another in Denmark (<em>SN: 1/18/22</em>).</p>



<p>Learning about the potential for capturing eDNA sparked a “light bulb moment,” Allerton says, and he reached out to Clare to collaborate. The Teddington facility holds onto its pollution-monitoring filters for a year in case scientists need to do a repeat measurement for heavy metals, meaning there could be a year’s worth of eDNA to claim, he realized.</p>



<p>Clare, Allerton and colleagues analyzed filters from the Teddington facility that were exposed to ambient air for one hour, one day or one week. The team also examined eight-month-old filters from an air quality control station in Scotland that had each been exposed to air for a week.</p>



<p>Genetic material in the filters revealed the presence of more than 180 different types of local fauna including pine trees, badgers, owls, fungi and newts. That volume is surprising given that the filters and storage conditions weren’t set up with eDNA in mind, says David Duffy, a biologist at the University of Florida’s Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience in St. Augustine. That the researchers recovered so much eDNA from a system designed to monitor air quality shows how prevalent airborne DNA is and how much biodiversity data could be up for grabs.</p>



<p>The filters detected plenty of plant life, even on disks exposed to air for only an hour. Birds and mammals, on the other hand, were more likely to pop up in samples taken for longer periods of time. That’s probably because trees are stationary while animals are constantly moving around, so it takes more time to detect them, Clare says.</p>



<p>She notes that even older samples might exist. There are numerous filter-using stations around the globe, some of which have never thrown the disks away since their opening. “We do know of some places where there are potentially 50 or 60 years of these stored,” Clare says. It’s unclear if those samples are viable, but the idea being able to track biodiversity that far back is “unbelievable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not every air quality control station uses filters to monitor pollution, says Fabian Roger, an ecologist at ETH Zürich. Many stations rely on sensors that can detect airborne particles in real time. Those sensors can’t capture eDNA, so the number of suitable facilities to extract such genetic material will vary from place to place.</p>



<p>But air quality control stations that do rely on filters certainly have great potential, says Roger, who is also studying how the facilities could help biodiversity efforts. He says that researchers now need to figure out how useful the genetic information is. It’s unclear how closely the DNA from filters matches local fauna, he says. How far away any sources of DNA might be, whether it’s a few blocks, a few kilometers or even farther, is also unknown.</p>





<p>Answering those questions is a priority, Clare says. Still, &#8220;the idea that there’s something that’s been collected daily or weekly, that’s just unheard of in our discipline,” she says. “And if [an air quality control station] has the potential of producing data that’s this rich over and over and over and over again, that is an unbelievable treasure of biodiversity information that we have never noticed.”</p>

<p>A biochemistry study has been retracted nearly a year after a whistleblower found significant overlap between the article and one published in a different journal by the same research group.</p>



<p>The study, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986110002912">Berberine ameliorates renal injury in diabetic C57BL/6 mice: Involvement of suppression of SphK–S1P signaling pathway</a>,” appeared in the journal <em>Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics</em> in July 2010. It has been cited 76 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study examines how berberine, a compound found in plants such as tree turmeric, might improve kidney injury in diabetic mice. People sometimes take berberine supplements to help treat diabetes, but the evidence for its effectiveness is mixed. The authors of the paper are researchers at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China.</p>

<p>In July 2022, Bardia Askari, an associate professor of biomedical sciences at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine in Old Westbury, noticed duplicated data and images in the two research papers. Askari was concerned enough that he decided to contact the publisher, Elsevier, by phone. In a later email message, which Askari provided to Retraction Watch, he wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I came across these observations when I was preparing a review on the benefits of nutraceuticals.&nbsp; I was very impressed by the well-organized and well-presented papers, “Effects of berberine on matrix accumulation and NF-kappa B signal pathway in alloxan-induced diabetic mice with renal injury”, DOI: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.04.033, published in the European Journal of Pharmacology (EJJ 638: 150–155) and “Berberine ameliorates renal injury in diabetic C57BL/6 mice: Involvement of suppression of SphK–S1P signaling pathway”, DOI: 10.1016/j.abb.2010.07.012, published in the Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics (APP (502 (2):112-120)… However, as I delved into the papers I began to see some very glaring issues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his message,<em> </em>Askari detailed each instance of duplication, including multiple cases of common data listed in data tables, a duplicated image that was only slightly altered between studies, and figures that appeared to show the same kidney sample. Yet the studies purported to describe separate animal studies, Askari wrote.</p>



<p>Eventually, a senior journal manager at Elsevier, which publishes <em>Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics</em>, told Askari she would pass on the message to an editor-in-chief of the journal. Several days later, Askari received a message from one such editor, Henry Jay Forman, saying that the journal would be “following up on your concerns” and would contact the corresponding author for an explanation. Forman added that the editors did not have the manuscript of the 10-year-old paper.</p>



<p>We don’t know if Askari’s concerns ever reached the editors of the other journal, the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology</em>. The study in that journal contains no signs of being under investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April, Askari received an email from an ethics editor at Elsevier informing him that the article would be retracted. The study was not pulled until late May, nearly 10 months after Askari initially contacted Elsevier.</p>



<p>Heqing Huang, the senior author of both studies, did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch. In reply to a question about the nearly year-long timeline of the retraction, Forman wrote that “the rules were followed, which cannot be rushed,” but referred any further comments to an ethics committee, which has not yet provided any comment to Retraction Watch. A spokesperson for Elsevier also said they were waiting to hear back from the ethics team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering that the article was over 10 years old, Askari said in an email to Retraction Watch that it didn’t bother him that the journal took 10 months to retract it.</p>



<p>“There were no implications for clinical guidelines nor any modifications on current therapeutic practices,” he said. Given this, “there didn’t appear to be any need for urgency or [expedited] decision-making.”</p>



<p>Askari said it did bother him that he had to go into such detail about the duplication before his concerns were sent to the journal editors and investigated. In an email to Retraction Watch, he wrote, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I went into excruciating detail about my thought process before I started the inquiry. Frankly, it bothered me that I had to do this, as being “science police” was not my intent or goal.&nbsp; I initiated this with the journals because I thought the use of duplicate data was flagrant and frankly, inexcusable.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/744336329/0/oupblogpsychology/">Finding purpose for the corporate office</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/finding-purpose-for-the-corporate-office/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stock-image-corporate-office-2-480x185.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/finding-purpose-for-the-corporate-office/">Finding purpose for the corporate office</a></p><p>Over two decades ago, a new type of fictional TV series debuted on the BBC that established a foothold between reality TV and sit-com. The Office brought the viewer into a familiar, yet mundane environment loaded with caricatures of people they ran into on a daily basis and thereby blurred the line between fiction and reality. The format was so effective at creating tension between characters that it verged on cringe-worthy, especially when Ricky Gervais was in the role of David Brent. Common character arcs played upon power dynamics between boss and employee, ill-advised office romance, and useless business procedures, creating a solid foundation for the&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43113390">10 global incarnations of the show</a>.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://percolate.com/app/763/posts/post:1630555786283587385/content#_msocom_1"></a>&nbsp;Regarding the American version, we remember fondly the rivalry between Jim and Dwight, the incompetence of Michael as manager, and the growth of Pam from receptionist to sales associate. The characters got deeper and the call-backs grew stronger as the show navigated nine seasons and 201 episodes, an amazing run for any show, especially considering its humble back-drop of Dunder Mifflin, a fictional wholesale distributor of paper and office supplies.</p><p>The Office was not the first TV series to depict the workplace, but it was probably the most effective at capturing what many of us experienced on a routine basis, due to the show’s mockumentary style. Sitting in a conference room for sales training, calling HR to resolve a personal dispute, and participating in a community service day were instantly relatable. In March 2020, the pandemic drew to an end this version of the corporate office, as a new normal of work was ushered in based upon virtual collaboration technology. The depiction of Dunder Mifflin has become more akin to a time capsule of the corporate office’s heyday than an enduring depiction of the workplace. Three years later and employee expectations are firmly set on hybrid work, averaging between two or three days from home each week. Moreover,&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ey.com/en_us/news/2021/05/more-than-half-of-employees-globally-would-quit-their-jobs-if-not-provided-post-pandemic-flexibility-ey-survey-finds">a majority of employees are prepared to quit their jobs if employers do not offer the flexibility they desire</a>. When pressed about whether employees desire greater flexibility in either where or when they work, they place greater weight on work hours, yet both forms of flexibility have become table stakes when defining a desired employee experience for attracting and retaining talent.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;A majority of employees are prepared to quit their jobs if employers do not offer the flexibility they desire.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>It is ironic that Dunder Mifflin was a paper company, as the primary purpose of a corporate office was based in large part on the creation and retention of documents. Around the same time as the premiere of The Office, early signs of a dwindling sense of purpose for the physical corporate workplace began, as companies introduced the concept of “the paperless office.” E-mail replaced letters and document retention transferred to large computer servers. Such a move did not immediately eliminate the need for a physical office, as employees still required computers, phones, scanners, printers, and fax machines to do their jobs. Office life continued, with confidential documents circulating from desk to desk via a sealed manila envelope and assistants printing important documents just in case the computer crashed. Soon after, the provision of work laptops and Blackberry phones further chipped away at its purpose. Employees embraced the ability to work from anywhere, including the local coffee shop. Office space that was designed for a world based upon paper was out of step with modern day working, as evidenced by the empty bookshelves and file drawers of a traditional office. Despite a lack of purpose based upon paper or technology, employees still traveled to the office, if nothing more than out of habit.</p><p>When the pandemic occurred, a major shift to virtual work occurred out of necessity and those in corporate settings adapted magnificently to a new way of working. Any apprehensions that collaboration technology was not ready for wide scale adoption were quickly put to rest and with them, the last meaningful purpose for a physical office. If meetings, workshops, and trainings could all be done from anywhere, how much value was left for informal water-cooler types of conversations and do they in any way justify a full return to the office, now that most health concerns have abated? It is important to note that many jobs never shifted during the pandemic; for those working in manufacturing, healthcare, or similar industries, their jobs are inherently linked to a physical environment where virtual work may not be an easy or effective option. For jobs based upon paper, the story is different, with occupancy rates in downtown settings still trailing pre-pandemic levels and&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-17/as-remote-work-endures-downtowns-are-adapting">likely to stabilize to around 20% lower than before</a>.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;With little of the original purpose for the corporate office left, it may be time for a reinvention of what the workplace should be.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>So where does this leave the corporate office and what are the long-term ramifications for hybrid and remote work? To keep the physical office relevant, employers are searching for the core reason why employees should bother to travel in. Should the office act as a connector, primarily to foster conversations and innovation, or should it be considered a magnet, pulling employees in for key events and professional development? Alternatively, should it transform into a hub fully embracing the blend between work and personal time, with onsite facilities like day care? Regardless of the model, the effects of hybrid and remote work on psychological well-being will be experienced for years to come. Beyond the fatigue already felt by employees from attending endless video conferences, as well as the intrusion of work into personal time, there are likely some very real consequences for interpersonal relationships. For example, helping behavior relies upon individuals knowing that they are on point to be helpful, which is confused by the anonymity offered by virtual work and leads to free-riding. Alternatively, with less opportunity for intimate interactions, repairing strained relationships will likely become harder. As a third example, corporate identity is less pronounced without the experience of walking into a physical office, which can lead to a more transactional mindset amongst employees and a lack of shared social norms about acceptable performance.</p><p>In many ways, the relevance of the physical corporate office has been under fire for decades, but the pandemic accelerated the shift and eliminated any remaining hesitations about the feasibility of hybrid and remote work. Without finding a new purpose, it is unlikely that the antics of The Office will be repeated in the same way or frequency as before. We might look back at the series in a different way, more of a time capsule than the mockumentary that it was intended to be. With little of the original purpose for the corporate office left, it may be time for a reinvention of what the workplace should be, one that embraces the new reality of work and blends our personal and professional lives to a much greater extent. Instead of the towering skyscrapers from the twentieth century, a visual representation of an apartment above a storefront might be a closer depiction to where we are heading. If that means one less character like David Brent, then the future of work might be alright after all.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/744336329/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/744336329/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/744336329/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/744336329/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/744336329/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f06%2fStock-image-corporate-office-2-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/744336329/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/744336329/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/744336329/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/744336329/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-veronica-schmidt-harvey-and-kenneth-p-de-meuse/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Veronica Schmidt Harvey and Kenneth P.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-einstein-tile-math">A ‘vampire einstein’ tile outdoes mathematicians’ latest feat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Einstein, meet “vampire einstein.”</p>



<p>It’s been just months since researchers reported the first&nbsp; “einstein” — a single tile that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">can cover an infinite plane</a>, but only with a pattern that never repeats (<em>SN: 3/24/23</em>). Now, the same team has found a shape that’s even more special.</p>



<p>The original einstein, nicknamed “the hat,” made a pattern that involved both the hat and its mirror image. The new tile also makes a pattern that never repeats, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17743" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without such reflections</a>, the researchers report May 28 at arXiv.org. Because the shape isn’t accompanied by its reflection, you might call it a “vampire einstein,” the researchers point out. (The “einstein” part of the name comes from the German for “one stone,” not from the name of the famous physicist.) The shape is part of a family of vampire einsteins that the researchers found, which they called “spectres.”</p>





<p>Describing how tiles cover an infinite plane without any overlaps or gaps between them is a time-honored fascination for mathematicians. While certain other tiles can be arranged so that they don’t form a repeating pattern, einsteins are special because that’s the only way they can tile. Previously, mathematicians knew of sets of tiles that could tile the plane only with non-repeating patterns. But until this year, they didn’t know of a single tile that would do it.</p>



<p>After finding the first einstein, the researchers wondered if they could find a tile that would make a non-repeating pattern without any reflected versions of the tile. Starting from a shape related to the hat and curving its edges in such a way that the tile’s reflection no longer fit together with itself, the researchers created the vampire einstein tile.</p>



<p>“I would never have predicted that we’d stumble upon a shape that solves this [vampire einstein] subproblem so quickly,” says computer scientist Craig Kaplan of the University of Waterloo in Canada.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-weird-secrets-early-universe">Weird black holes may hold secrets of the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Our galaxy’s heart is a gluttonous monster. Like the mythical Kammapa of the Sotho people of southern Africa, the Milky Way’s central, supermassive black hole has swallowed nearly everything around it, growing heftier and heftier the more it eats. And it’s not alone. Black holes weighing as much as thousands, millions or even billions of suns sit at the center of nearly all known massive galaxies.</p>



<p>For decades, scientists thought that was the only place they’d find such behemoths, because only massive galaxies had enough material to feed the monsters’ excessive appetites. But beginning about two decades ago, computer simulations of the earliest black holes started turning up oddities — big black holes that weren’t smack-dab where they were expected. These misfits must be nothing more than flukes, many scientists reasoned at the time, dismissing the results without a second thought.</p>





<p>But others weren’t so certain the oddballs should be cast off. If observations show that these unusual black holes exist in the nearby universe, these astrophysicists speculated, they could be untapped clues to the universe’s infancy and adolescence.</p>



<p>“We can, weirdly, [learn about] the super-beginning of the universe by looking at things really close to us,” says theoretical astrophysicist Jillian Bellovary of Queensborough Community College in New York City.</p>



<p>The notion remained just an idea for years. But now, the existence of these misfits isn’t so easy to ignore. Astronomers have turned up signs of a number of unexpectedly massive black holes in the universe’s tiniest galaxies, and surprisingly, some of those black holes don’t appear to sit at their galaxies’ centers. Even more intriguing, astronomers have spotted evidence of black holes wandering at their galaxies’ edges, and in rare cases, being kicked from their homes into intergalactic space.</p>



<p>Perhaps these black holes aren’t merely cosmic nonconformists but instead big players in the story of our universe. If so, they are a tool for probing one of the greatest mysteries in all of astrophysics — how the cosmic Kammapas we see today came to be.</p>



<p>“Without understanding what black holes are doing, you cannot understand galaxy evolution,” says Xiaohui Fan, a cosmologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, making it impossible to explain the landscape of the universe.</p>

<h4>Little galaxies can have big black holes</h4>



<p>Our current cosmological understanding of how black holes got so big goes something like this: As galaxies grow, collide and merge over cosmic time, they take on gobs of new stars, gas and dust. The black holes at the galaxies’ centers grow in lockstep, ballooning as they merge with one another and feed on the newly acquired material. A rough estimate puts a supermassive black hole’s heft at somewhere around a thousandth of the mass of its home galaxy.</p>



<p>In this scenario, the universe’s littlest galaxies, called dwarf galaxies, probably didn’t go through many mergers in the past. Tipping the scales at only about a millionth the mass of the Milky Way, they should have relatively runty black holes, or none at all.</p>



<p>But in the late 2000s, astrophysicist Marta Volonteri of Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris at Sorbonne University helped run computer simulations that tracked the evolution of massive black holes from birth to today. In those efforts, almost as soon as they popped into existence, even the smallest galaxies could have surprisingly large black holes. As time passed, some of those galaxies never grew or merged with others, leaving them unmarred after billions of years of cosmic evolution.</p>





<p>A wild idea occurred to Volonteri and her colleagues: These galaxies and their black holes were relics of the universe’s birth. If massive black holes in dwarf galaxies did exist, and if astronomers could find them, those black holes would be an unprecedented window into how the first black holes formed.</p>



<p>The first hints that they do exist came from a serendipitous find by astronomer Amy Reines. More than a decade ago, she was in graduate school at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville poring through telescope data on a dwarf galaxy 30 million light-years from Earth. It was bursting with stars, and Reines was trying to learn more about how these balls of hot gas are born.</p>



<p>Initially Reines looked at data from the galaxy, called Henize&nbsp;2-10, in radio and near-infrared wavelengths of light. She spotted a cosmic baby rattle, a roughly 300-light-year-long bridge of gas connecting two dusty balls swaddling newly coalescing stars. A deeper dive into the data revealed extreme radio emissions right in the middle of the rattle, along with bright X-rays coming from the same spot, inklings of a huge black hole with a mass of a million suns.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t seen this before,” says Reines, now at Montana State University in Bozeman. Dwarf galaxies, she too had assumed, shouldn’t have big black holes. She remained skeptical of her interpretation until a few months later when she attended a talk in Seattle at the 2011 American Astronomical Society meeting.</p>



<p>It was there that Bellovary, then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and collaborating with Volonteri, presented new simulations of galaxy formation. Bellovary described the formation of galaxies with a range of masses and histories, and discussed how the results could make predictions about how massive black holes are scattered throughout the universe.</p>



<p>Like Volonteri’s earlier work, Bellovary’s simulations suggested that big galaxies were not the only ones to harbor big black holes; scrawny galaxies could have them too.</p>



<p>In a session at the same meeting, Reines highlighted her discovery of dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10 and its uncharacteristically massive black hole. Like two black holes circling each other and then colliding, unexpected computer simulations met un­expected real-world observations.</p>



<p>The combined work suggested that not only do massive galaxies have big black holes, but maybe a majority of galaxies do too, Fan says. And that raised a lot of new questions about how black holes and galaxies grow up together.</p>



<p>After hearing Bellovary’s talk and publishing her own findings, Reines shifted her research focus from the birth of stars to finding big black holes. The behemoths pulled her in. She launched an effort to search for them in dwarf galaxies. Like other astronomers, she decided to scan the skies for the rings of cosmic crumbs that burn brightly around feeding black holes at the centers of galaxies — active galactic nuclei. That’s where black holes should be, she assumed. “I mean, it’s in the name, active galactic nuclei,” she explains.</p>



<p>Reines combed through data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey looking for the visible-light signatures of central black holes. Of the roughly 25,000 dwarf galaxies in her analysis, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/775/2/116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">151&nbsp;of them appeared to harbor a big black hole</a>, she and colleagues reported in 2013.</p>



<p>Volonteri says she was elated by the results. They validated her wild idea that dwarf galaxies could have really big black holes, and possibly that those black holes could tell us something about the very first black holes.</p>



<p>A key clue may be in the masses of dwarf galaxies’ black holes. The two leading ideas for how the first black holes formed create black holes of different masses. One idea supposes that these black holes formed from the implosion of the first stars and would tend to be relatively lightweight. The other idea suggests that the first black holes formed from the direct collapse of giant gas clouds and would be heavier. If the gas cloud idea is correct, it could explain another cosmic puzzle: how black holes in the early universe got so big so fast. “We observe them, and they are already huge,” Bellovary says. If the history of the universe was displayed on a clock, these monsters would have mere seconds to form, she explains.</p>



<p>If big black holes in dwarf galaxies are indeed ancient relics from the early universe, their masses should be akin to the masses of the first black holes. If so, they could help explain how the seeds of some of the heftiest black holes we see today formed.</p>



<p>According to a recent estimate, the black hole in Henize 2-10 tips the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-mass-measure-new-technique-accretion-disk">scales at a few million suns</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 12</em>). That’s a data point in favor of the direct cloud collapse idea, but it’s just one measurement with a lot of assumptions. For now, measuring black holes’ masses is no easy task.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Misfit predictions</h3>



<p>In computer simulations, big black holes don’t show up only at galaxy centers. Simulations predict that this galaxy has many in its halo (black circles). The five heftiest black holes (orange) include four that are off-kilter. Simulated gas and X-ray views show how these black holes might appear to astronomers in telescope images.</p>

<h4>Wandering black holes may offer cosmic clues</h4>



<p>Fortunately, there’s another way to get a clue to the masses of early black holes. It relies heavily on another type of oddball — big black holes that don’t sit exactly at the center of dwarf galaxies.</p>



<p>When Bellovary shared her simulations back in 2011, the idea of big black holes in scrawny galaxies wasn’t the only surprise. Her work also predicted that some Kammapas would be off-kilter from their galactic centers, wandering around the dwarfs’ edges after failing to fall to their cores.</p>



<p>“I always like to think about the outliers, or the weird little rejects, or the nonconformists,” Bellovary says. She chose to rerun her simulations, zooming in on the littlest galaxies. When she did, she found that <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482.2913B/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half of the massive black holes in dwarf galaxies should be off-center</a>, she reported in early 2019 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>



<p>As if on cue, Reines came in a few months later with observations that bolstered Bellovary’s simulations. Using the Very Large Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico, Reines and colleagues had peered at emissions coming from 111 dwarf galaxies, 13 of which most likely had big black holes. Of those 13 big black holes, a few appeared to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-black-holes-can-settle-outskirts-small-galaxies">sit off-center from their galaxies’ cores</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/19, p. 12)</em>.</p>



<p>Finding wanderers was a jackpot. “Once a black hole starts wandering, it does not grow in mass anymore,” Volonteri says. The lowest-mass wanderers should roughly match the initial mass of the very first black holes, making them a good proxy for the seeds that would later grow into supermassive black holes.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this animation, two galaxies repeatedly smash into each other until they collide. The galaxies’ central black holes (white dots circled with black) also tango. In the end, the merged black hole is kicked far from the new galaxy’s core, possibly ejected into intergalactic space.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the mass of wanderers is even harder to figure out than the mass of Kammapas sitting at their galaxies’ cores. Researchers are instead turning to these wanderers’ overall numbers for clues. If the earliest black holes — the seeds of today’s supermassive black holes — formed from the direct collapse of huge gas clouds flowing into galaxies, then wanderers shouldn’t be very common in dwarf galaxies. That’s because converting a gas cloud’s mass into a massive black hole is difficult and thus expected to be a rare phenomenon, Volonteri explains. An easier way to form early black holes — through the implosion of the first stars — would result in many more wanderers.</p>



<p>Another possible scenario that scientists are now considering is whether mergers of early stars or black holes in dense galaxy cores could have made the seeds of supermassive black holes. That process would also result in a lot of wanderers. But these black holes would be somewhat more massive than black holes formed from stellar implosions.</p>



<p>Because signs of wanderers keep popping up, researchers are leaning away from the direct collapse idea. But to truly get a better sense of how big black holes formed, researchers need to census wandering black holes not only in the nearby universe but also further back in time, says Angelo Ricarte of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. We need to know if what’s happening now is similar to what happened then, because the environment in the early universe was very different.</p>

<h4>Are rogue black holes real?</h4>



<p>Massive galaxies appear to have wanderers too, some that are flying across their host galaxies at 10 times the speed of wanderers in dwarf galaxies.</p>



<p>But scientists aren’t entirely sure if these black holes gone rogue are real. When one turned up in 2003 in Volonteri’s simulations, scientists blew it off. The rogues showed up again in Bellovary’s simulations. The reaction? Skepticism. And that skepticism remained even when astronomers announced bright, flashy X-ray signals coming from candidate rogues.</p>



<p>Several years ago, a Hubble Space Telescope image and data from other observatories offered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-gets-kicked-galactic-curb">evidence of a black hole with a billion suns’ worth of mass</a> getting booted to the edge of its galaxy (<em>SN: 4/29/17, p. 16</em>). And earlier this year, images from Hubble and the Keck Observatory revealed the possibility of a trifecta of supermassive black holes interacting, with one given so much oomph <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/runaway-black-hole-galaxy-hubble">that it’s been ejected to intergalactic space</a> (<em>SN:&nbsp;4/8/23, p. 11</em>). But a separate team proposes that what some scientists are calling a rogue black hole <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-black-hole-spiral-galaxy">might instead be a galaxy viewed edge on</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="470" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/060323_black-hole_inline-4.jpg" alt="image of a faraway galaxy with two insets showing a closer view of the galaxy itself and pink x-ray light come from its edge" class="wp-image-3125013" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/060323_black-hole_inline-4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/060323_black-hole_inline-4-554x383.jpg 554w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/060323_black-hole_inline-4-651x450.jpg 651w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/060323_black-hole_inline-4-269x186.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3125013">The X-ray light (pink in inset) coming from the edge of a galaxy some 4.5 billion light-years from Earth could be a wandering big black hole that was thrown from the center of its own galaxy when that galaxy merged with a larger one.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125013">X-RAY: CXC/NASA, UNH, D. LIN <em>ET AL</em>; OPTICAL: NASA, STSCI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Volonteri continues to track each candidate rogue, along with other oddball black holes astronomers have put forward. They all somehow have to fit into our full understanding of the history of supermassive black holes, she says. And once again, how often they show up in observations could provide clues to the fuller picture.</p>



<p>If observations show that slow-moving wanderers are abundant, then collisions and mergers of really big black holes are presumably rare. Slow-moving wanderers haven’t interacted with other black holes and so haven’t picked up extra zing relative to the stars around them. The story the universe would be telling us is that the supermassive black holes we see today didn’t grow through repeated mergers after all. But, Volonteri says, if there are a lot of supermassive black holes being shot from the centers of their galaxies to the distant edges, black hole interactions, including mergers, must be common.</p>



<p>With a few dozen candidate oddballs in dwarf galaxies and only a few far-flung rogue candidates identified, the picture is not yet clear. What we do know, Fan explains, is that understanding cosmic evolution requires a good sense of the birth and evolution of the “dark sector” of galaxies — including black holes.</p>



<p>More observational evidence of oddballs would help, and more astronomers have joined the search. In 2021, a team including Reines and Mallory Molina of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1ffa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported a new way to spot signs of massive black holes in dwarfs</a>, specifically if the behemoths are feeding on gas and dust. The technique searches dwarfs for a red glow given off by an unusual type of iron. And a team from Dartmouth reported last year that very-high-energy X-rays <a href="https://baas.aas.org/pub/2022n3i106p35/release/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also reveal obscure behemoths</a>.</p>



<p>Future observatories may aid in the hunt too. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, located in Chile and slated to turn on next year, can sweep the skies looking for wanderers. And the next-generation Very Large Array, a proposed radio observatory, will be sensitive enough to spot signs of black holes in dwarf galaxies.</p>



<p>With the goal of detecting collisions of very massive black holes, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA, and the proposed Einstein Telescope may one day offer clues to how common cataclysmic black hole interactions are and have been.</p>



<p>Time and new technology will tell. For now, oddball black holes spark our imagination, prompting us to ask big questions and uncover new evidence in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of cosmic history. With each purported discovery, you can’t help but wonder: What else is hidden out there? Perhaps there are other oddities not yet discovered that could tie us to the earliest universe, Bellovary says, and reveal our cosmic origins. But only if we’re willing to chase the misfits and their stories.</p>

De Meuse, editors of&nbsp;</em>The Age of Agility<em>, offer valuable insight into the concept of “learning agility” and strategies that promote more effective leadership. They are both experts in the field of leadership practical experience developing healthy skills that help both individuals and organizations to thrive.&nbsp;</em></p><h2>Why is “learning agility” an important trend in organizations?&nbsp;</h2><p>There are several reasons. First: the pace of change. Most will agree that the world of work is a turbulent place. It only takes looking back at the COVID pandemic to recognize how quickly our world can be turned upside down! Then we can think of such recent trends as quiet quitting, AI, the virtual workforce, the mental health crisis, and on and on. Consequently, both leaders and organizations are recognizing that survival of the fittest equates to “survival of the agile.” Organizations that cultivate leaders who are learning agile are much better prepared to deal with change.</p><p>A second important reason is that organizations need high performing leaders. Challenges with an adequate leadership pipeline consistently show up on surveys as one of the things that keeps CEOs up at night! And the evidence is clear that learning agility is one of the most robust predictors of leadership success as measured by:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>leadership potential</li><li>performance&nbsp;</li><li>levels of effectiveness&nbsp;</li><li>promotions&nbsp;</li><li>advancement&nbsp;</li><li>international assignments</li><li>salary increases&nbsp;</li><li>faster speed to competence in a new role</li></ul><p>In fact, a meta-analysis conducted by Ken in 2019 found that learning agility is a stronger predictor of leadership performance than IQ, EQ, or job experience. It is not just hyperbole to say that the effectiveness of leadership in organization depends on the levels of learning agility among their leaders. &nbsp;</p><p>Third, we believe the development of learning agility can help in diversifying the leadership pipeline. Research indicates that learning agility when properly assessed does not disproportionally screen out women, minorities, individuals over 40, or other marginalized groups. Organizations increase their objectivity and level the playing field for all employees and applicants alike. Supporting the development of learning agility shows promise for not only expanding but increasing the diversity of leadership pipelines.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;Organizations that cultivate leaders who are learning agile are much better prepared to deal with change.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><h2>Is learning agility a new concept?&nbsp;</h2><p>Although agility is a term that is clearly trending, the concept of learning agility does have considerable history. At least dating back to the early 1980s, organizations began to recognize the importance of identifying individuals with the potential to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing circumstances. Dr Morgan McCall and his colleagues at The Center for Creative Leadership published the now-classic book<em>&nbsp;The Lessons of Experience</em>&nbsp;in 1988. Veronica’s own dissertation in that same year focused on how successful leaders learn from their experiences rather than solely in a classroom (Schmidt, 1988).</p><p>The specific term “learning agility” was first coined more than two decades ago by Drs Mike Lombardo and Bob Eichinger (2000). They agreed with McCall that a primary indicator of leadership potential is learning agility, aptly describing it as “knowing what to do when you don’t know what to do.” While learning agility is a relatively new compared to some other psychological constructs, it is not simply a “shiny-new-object” that is likely to become irrelevant any time soon.</p><h2>How would you describe learning agility to someone unfamiliar with the concept?&nbsp;</h2><p>Researchers have used a number of different definitions. And, like many complex constructs, there are differences in opinion among them. The following two definitions are frequently used:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>“The ability and willingness to learn from experience and then apply those lessons to perform well in new and challenging leadership situations” (De Meuse, 2017)&nbsp;</li><li>“The self-regulated behaviors, strategies, and habits that enable learning at an accelerated pace, facilitate more agile adaptation to dynamic conditions and result in more effective leadership” (Harvey &amp; Prager, 2021).</li></ol><p>Despite multiple definitions, as we describe in Chapter 19 of&nbsp;<em>The Age of Agility</em>, there is considerable consensus among researchers and practitioners alike that learning agility is a “metacompetency.” One can think of learning agility as a “whole body exercise” involving (a) how we perceive things—the perceptual; (b) how we process information—the cognitive; (c) how we regulate our emotions, and (d) how all of these are manifest in our observable behavior. Learning agility is the ability and willingness to learn from experiences and the attitudinal, cognitive, and behavioral flexibility to apply those lessons to perform effectively in current and new leadership roles.</p><h2>What are the most successful methods of developing agility in employees and organizations?&nbsp;</h2><p>As part of writing Chapter 6 for&nbsp;<em>The Age of Agility</em>, Veronica and her colleague Raphael Prager and took a deep dive into reviewing the literature on developing learning agility. As a result, an evidence-based model was that focuses on five sets of behaviors and strategies that can be learned:</p><ul><li><em>Observing</em>&nbsp;includes mindful awareness of situations and experiences as well as the ability to scan and forecast what will be needed in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><em>Doing</em>&nbsp;includes seeking information and experiences, experimenting with different behaviors, and deliberately practicing new ways of responding. &nbsp;</li><li><em>Connecting&nbsp;</em>involves learning with and from others by asking for help, observing role models, learning through coaches and mentors, and seeking feedback. &nbsp;</li><li><em>Thinking&nbsp;</em>includes cognitive strategies such as reflection, understanding the mental filters that may be biasing our actions, approaching situations with curiosity, and adapting a learning mindset.</li><li><em>Mobilizing&nbsp;</em>involves learning to set goals, regulate emotions, maintain focus and discipline, and recognize when resilience and periods of renewal are needed.</li></ul><h2>How do we develop and support the next generation of leaders in a more remote world?&nbsp;</h2><p>As we explore new ways of working, one of the best ways we can support the next generation of leaders is to accurately identify them by assessing for learning agility along with other predictors of leadership. Then once identified, offer them numerous opportunities to develop their learning agility. It is incredibly empowering to have confidence in one’s own capability to learn what to do no matter what life may throw at you. A colleague Anna Marie Valerio and Veronica recently published an article in the&nbsp;<em>Consulting Psychology</em>&nbsp;journal on “Coaching to Develop Learning Agility<em>.</em>”<em>&nbsp;</em>It is likely one of the most critical things that leadership coaches can do!&nbsp;</p><h2>How does increased learning agility impact employees and organizations?&nbsp;</h2><p>The negative impact a poor leader can have on a team and in an organization is hard to overstate. The proper application of learning agility can help minimize such mistakes. Moreover, the promotion and hiring of effective leaders (regardless of age, gender, or minority status) sends a powerful signal to all employees that they matter and management has their back!</p><h2>What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?</h2><p>One thing that is certain is that it will look considerably different than it does today! It is impossible to predict with any precision what those change will be. However, we do feel certain that those leaders with strong learning agility will be better equipped to successfully respond. Perhaps, Alvin Toffler said it best in his book&nbsp;<em>Future Shock</em>&nbsp;(1970), “The illiterate of the twenty-first century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn.” And he wrote it more than 50 years ago!</p><p><em><sub>Featured image: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/743937665/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/743937665/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/743937665/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/743937665/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/743937665/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f05%2fStock-Image-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/743937665/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/743937665/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/743937665/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/743937665/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-eduardo-salas-and-scott-tannenbaum/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Eduardo Salas and Scott Tannenbaum</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/finding-purpose-for-the-corporate-office/">Finding purpose for the corporate office</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/05/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-adrienne-j-colella-and-eden-b-king/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Adrienne J.
