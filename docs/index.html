<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This coming Monday, January 20, 2025, arXiv staff will be observing Martin Luther King Jr. Day. This holiday will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on </span><a href="http://arxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced by email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our team celebrates MLK Day 2025, announcements will be slightly deferred.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you plan your submissions to arXiv this week, please be aware of the following changes:</span></p>
<p><b>Monday, January 20,</b> <b>2025</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Friday, January 17, 2025, and before 14:00 ET Tuesday, January 21, 2025, will be announced on Tuesday, January 21, 2025.</span></p>

<p>Two management journals from the same publisher have retracted a pair of articles for taking “models, samples, and results” from each other and earlier work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A tip from an anonymous account sent in November to Retraction Watch, sleuth Elisabeth Bik, and others called out duplications in the papers. Bik then posted the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A03358728BCC84CE8F15BDDFCD3A89">two</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/724C26B5898C267CA09CECB9935D45">articles</a> on PubPeer in November 2024, noting several identical sets of tables between the papers, despite the works investigating survey data on different topics from different populations — intention to leave among employees from the hospitality sector, and resistance to change among managers at private organizations.</p>



<span id="more-130804"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/er-07-2019-0293/full/html">&#8220;Workplace bullying and intention to leave: a moderated mediation model of emotional exhaustion and supervisory support&#8221;</a> was published online July 8, 2020, in <em>Employee Relations </em>and has been cited 35 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The other article, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jocm-02-2020-0063/full/html">&#8220;Resistance to change and turnover intention: a moderated mediation model of burnout and perceived organizational support,”</a> appeared online July 29, 2020, in the <em>Journal of Organizational Change Management </em>(<em>JOCM</em>)<em> </em>and has been cited 59 times.</p>



<p>The journals are both titles of <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/">Emerald Publishing</a> and are listed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first author on the articles is Shalini Srivastava, a professor at the Jaipuria Institute of Management in India, according to her <a href="https://www.jaipuria.ac.in/faculty/shalini-srivastava/">faculty profile page</a>. <em>Employee Relations</em> <a href="https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/er">lists her</a> as an associate editor of the journal. Links to Google Scholar and LinkedIn on Srivastava’s <a href="https://www.jaipuria.ac.in/faculty/shalini-srivastava/">faculty profile page</a> appear to have been deleted, although an archived version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240718162153/https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QjR1lOQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">the Google Scholar profile</a> exists on the Internet Archive.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jocm-02-2020-0063/full/html">retraction notice</a> for the <em>JOCM</em> article, posted December 23, acknowledged the similarities: “It has come to our attention that a large portion of this article’s models, samples, and results are taken, without full and proper attribution, from an earlier original work” — referring to the other retracted article. The notice continues:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>On investigation of this matter, further concerns were raised with regard to the data used as the same analysis employed in the earlier work was also applied here despite the two articles looking at fundamentally different contexts. As such, the findings of this article cannot be relied upon. The authors of this paper would like to note that they agree with the content of this notice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/er-07-2019-0293/full/html">notice</a> for the <em>Employee Relations </em>article, published December 24, cites overlap with yet another paper coauthored by Srivastava — a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0972262919869747">2019 article on organizational citizenship behavior</a> that appeared in <em>Vision</em>, a journal of the Management Development Institute in Gurgaon, India, published by Sage Publications.</p>



<p>Queries to the editors in chief of <em>JOCM</em> and <em>Employee Relations</em> were answered by a spokesperson from Emerald’s research integrity department. “Emerald’s research integrity team and the Editors-in-Chief of both journals investigated the system evidence and the content of both articles in accordance with COPE&#8217;s principles on duplicate publications,” the spokesperson told Retraction Watch. “The authors were contacted for an explanation. The investigation concluded that the responses were insufficient and that the results in the articles could not be relied upon.”</p>



<p>Bik and others have called out several of Srivastava’s articles <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=shalini+srivastava">on PubPeer</a> for various reasons, including for similarities in data and methodology between articles, and for omitting mention of institutional review board approval, participant consent, or recruitment strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Srivastava nor Swati Agrawal, the coauthor on the two retracted articles, responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sage journal <em>American Surgeon </em>has issued a mass expression of concern for 116 articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00031348241305412">expression of concern</a> states the journal “was made aware” of “concerning author activity” on the articles.</p>



<p>Sage is no stranger to mass editorial actions. In 2023, the publisher pulled large tranches of papers at <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/21/sage-retracting-three-dozen-articles-for-compromised-peer-review/">least</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/02/sage-retracts-more-than-200-papers-from-journal-for-compromised-peer-review/">three</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/14/turmoil-at-sage-journal-as-retractions-mount/">times</a>, and last year it retracted over <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/exclusive-publisher-retracts-more-than-450-papers-from-journal-it-acquired-last-year/">450 papers</a> from a journal the company had acquired from IOS Press. The publisher was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/31/guest-post-a-look-behind-the-scenes-of-bulk-retractions-from-sage/">one of the first</a> to begin retracting papers in bulk, primarily to combat manipulated peer review.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.care.piedmont.org/provider/Don+Ken+Nakayama/2451980">Don Nakayama</a>, the editor-in-chief of the journal and a pediatric surgeon in Columbus, Georgia, forwarded our request for comment to Sage.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Laura West, a Sage spokesperson, said “SCOPUS” — presumably Elsevier’s Scopus database — reached out with concerns “about the quality of content in this journal.” Sage won’t provide any additional information while the investigation is ongoing, West said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier did not respond directly to questions regarding the tip from Scopus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the concerning papers had one common author: <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7730-617X">Adel Elkbuli</a>. Elkbuli’s affiliation is listed on the most recent articles as the Department of Surgery at Orlando Regional Medical Center, in Florida, although he does not appear to have a directory listing or profile page <a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/facilities/orlando-regional-medical-center">at the center</a>. He is also affiliated with the University of Miami.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elkbuli did not respond to our request for comment. He has 378 publications listed in Clarivate’s Web of Science that have been cited a total of over 3,000 times.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/neurons-and-learning-activity-driven-neuroplasticity">Neurons and learning: activity-driven neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When we start learning a new skill, every little aspect requires deliberate, conscious effort. With practice and repetition, our actions become smoother and easier to recall, eventually transforming initially demanding skills into second nature. Underlying this process of skill acquisition are intricate firing patterns in brain networks, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP), or &quot;activity-driven neuroplasticity.&quot; LTP strengthens specific synaptic connections without affecting others, maintaining input specificity. Its counterpart, long-term depression (LTD), works in the opposite direction. Together, LTP and LTD play crucial roles in fine-tuning neural circuits, which are essential for learning and memory, and rely on similar neurological processes at the molecular level.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Molecular mechanisms</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The concept of LTP was introduced over 30 years ago, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remained elusive until the 1980s, when key insights identified NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors as central players. These Ca²⁺ channels in the brain are unique because they are blocked by Mg²⁺ ions at resting membrane potentials. During low-frequency stimulation, smaller action potentials activate AMPA receptors by facilitating glutamate binding, but NMDA receptors remain blocked by Mg²⁺. Only when the neuronal membrane depolarizes sufficiently to expel the Mg²⁺ ion do NMDA receptors open, allowing Ca²⁺ to enter the postsynaptic neuron.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Importantly, the unique properties of NMDA receptors explain LTP&apos;s specificity and associativity. When one group of synaptic inputs is strongly activated, LTP occurs only at those specific synapses, as NMDA receptors at other synapses fail to meet the activation threshold. For associativity, weakly stimulated synapses alone cannot depolarize the neuron enough to remove the Mg²⁺ block. However, if neighboring synapses are strongly activated, they can provide sufficient depolarization, enhancing Ca²⁺ influx through NMDA receptors at the weakly stimulated synapse and inducing LTP.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;">&quot;LTP is closely linked to learning processes in the hippocampus, the brain region critical for memory formation.&quot;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Ca²⁺ influx is critical for LTP, as it activates key protein kinases like CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and Protein Kinase C (PKC). CaMKII, in particular, is abundant in LTP-associated synapses and is thought to increase postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate by either adding more receptors to the synapse or enhancing the sensitivity of existing ones. Some theories also suggest that LTP involves increased neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons through retrograde signaling, where the postsynaptic neuron regulates presynaptic activity using molecules like nitric oxide to strengthen communication.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>LTP &amp; learning</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">LTP is closely linked to learning processes in the hippocampus, the brain region critical for memory formation. Dendritic spines, small protrusions on neurons housing excitatory synapses, are indicators of synaptic growth and restructuring driven by LTP and LTD. These processes are initiated by cascades of Ca²⁺ signaling influenced by pre- and postsynaptic activity. Moreover, LTP occurs in two distinct phases: early-phase LTP, which is transient and prone to decay, and late-phase LTP, which is longer-lasting. Late-phase LTP involves a mechanism called synaptic-tagging-and-capture (STC), where synapses marked during the early phase &quot;capture&quot; proteins necessary for long-term changes. This process helps consolidate and stabilize memories. Interestingly, recent research highlights that LTP decay, an active process occurring within 1-6 hours after induction, is mediated by the endocytosis of AMPA receptors.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;">&quot;(...) if neighboring synapses are strongly activated, they can provide sufficient depolarization, (...) inducing LTP&quot;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>LTP &amp; neurodegenerative conditions</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">LTP&apos;s role also extends to understanding neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, where impaired synaptic plasticity contributes to cognitive decline. Protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), essential for maintaining non-decaying LTP, is often mislocalized or degraded due to neurofibrillary tangles. This disruption weakens synaptic strength and memory retention. However, recent advances show promise: the synthetic peptide GluA23Y inhibits AMPA receptor endocytosis, converting decaying LTP into non-decaying LTP and slowing memory loss. Furthermore, GluA23Y has demonstrated the potential to reduce toxic plaques in Alzheimer’s mouse models, making it a promising therapeutic avenue.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In conclusion, long-term potentiation lies at the core of our understanding of how the brain learns and remembers. Through the contributions of NMDA receptors, Ca²⁺ influx, and protein kinases, LTP and LTD shape synaptic plasticity. Its links to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s underscore its importance, while innovative interventions like GluA23Y highlight the potential to restore cognitive functions. Exploring the mechanisms of LTP continues to unlock profound insights into brain function and paves the way for transformative therapies in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.</span></span></p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/j-biochem-tech-cover.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="400" height="540" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/j-biochem-tech-cover.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-130769" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/j-biochem-tech-cover.jpg 400w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/j-biochem-tech-cover-222x300.jpg 222w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></figure></div>


<p class="has-drop-cap">Last October, Martin McPhillie, a <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/5234/dr-martin-mcphillie">lecturer</a> in organic chemistry at the UK’s University of Leeds, received an email alert from his institution about a new article bearing his name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “Docking Study of Licensed Non-Viral Drugs to Obtain Ebola Virus Inhibitors,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Biochemical Technology</em>, a title of Istanbul, Turkey-based <a href="https://deniz.pub/journals">Deniz Publication</a>. The journal is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study was within McPhillie’s area of expertise, and aligned with work he and the other listed coauthors had previously published. But he knew the new study wasn’t his.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130766"></span>



<p>“I felt very professionally violated at the time and still angry about the whole episode,” McPhillie told Retraction Watch. “I am acutely aware of how academic malpractice can ruin an academic career so did not want to be associated with this paper.”</p>



<p>McPhillie emailed the journal’s <a href="https://jbiochemtech.com/journal-page/editorial-team">editor in chief</a>, Marcello Iriti, an <a href="https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/marcello-iriti">associate professor</a> of biomedical, surgical, and dental sciences at the Università degli Studi di Milano in Italy, and explained the situation. Iriti “was apologetic but did not offer an explanation,” McPhillie said. According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, the editor called the publication of the article a “mystery.”</p>



<p>Iriti also told us he didn’t know how the paper came to be published with the names of authors who had no involvement in the work. He referred our question to an unnamed managing editor copied on his reply. The managing editor did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McPhillie was initially “relieved” Iriti responded, but then the journal removed the article from its website with an undated notice that stated only “<a href="https://jbiochemtech.com/article/docking-study-of-licensed-non-viral-drugs-to-obtain-ebola-virus-inhibitors-qiq049ivryvrbac">This article has been retracted</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To my mind, ‘retracted’ usually means that the authors have committed malpractice,” McPhillie said, but in his case, “the authors are innocent” and the problem likely lies with the journal. “There is stigma associated with retracted papers.”</p>



<p>When McPhillie contacted Iriti again, the editor was “rather dismissive” and said “there was nothing more they could do,” McPhillie said. </p>



<p>“I would have thought the journal would have other options to remove papers like this,” McPhillie said, which he thinks would also benefit the journal. “They don&#8217;t seem to care.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In cases we’ve covered previously, researchers who find their names attached to papers they didn’t write have had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/09/violated-engineering-professor-found-her-name-on-four-papers-she-didnt-write/">mixed</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/">results</a> in getting the papers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">removed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to alerting the other listed authors, McPhillie Googled the paper title and found an <a href="https://ijpras.com/article/docking-study-o-f-licensed-non-viral-drugs-to-obtain-ebola-virus-inhibitors-gcjqwyjxkygeu9g">identical article</a> with different authors published in 2024 in the <em>International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Allied Sciences</em>. The journal appears to belong to another Istanbul-based entity, <a href="https://meralpublisher.com/">Meral Publisher</a>, and also is not listed in Web of Science. Ozgur Karcioglu, the editor in chief, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="587" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-1024x587.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130768" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-1024x587.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-300x172.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-768x440.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-1536x880.png 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers.png 1670w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This image from PubPeer user “Cisticola tinniens” shows two nearly identical papers from two journals with different authors listed. The paper on the right has been retracted. Neither journal is indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Muhammad Rafiq of the Balochistan University of IT, Engineering and Management Sciences in Quetta, Pakistan, the listed corresponding author of the <em>International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Allied Sciences</em> article, told Retraction Watch he had “nothing to do” with the paper. “I don’t know why this appeared with my name.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rafiq and the same group of coauthors had published a similar study, “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/14/6/660">Identification of Prospective Ebola Virus VP35 and VP40 Protein Inhibitors from Myxobacterial Natural Products</a>,” in <em>Biomolecules</em>, an MDPI title, in June 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in December, an anonymous PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/90992B779547EB4C3E4A34EE2D8A7A#1">posted</a> about the retraction statement in the <em>Journal of Biochemical Technology </em>and asked the authors or publisher to clarify the reason for their decision. The user also pointed out several issues in the paper, most notably the stated use of “AutoCAD,” a design software used in engineering. “I have never seen AutoCAD used in computational chemistry,” the commenter wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the journal had removed the paper from its website, the PubPeer commenter had found a version of record on White Rose, the University of Leeds institutional repository, which has since been removed as well. McPhillie learned of the copy of the paper in the repository from PubPeer, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have asked our research library team for information about how this paper could be deposited internally, as someone had to &#8216;claim&#8217; it,” he told us. “I haven&#8217;t received a response to that, although they were sympathetic to our situation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than a dozen universities have used “questionable authorship practices” to inflate their publication metrics, authors of a new study say. One university even saw an increase in published articles of nearly 1,500% in the last four years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00339/125732/Using-Bibliometrics-to-Detect-Questionable">published January 5 in <em>Quantitative Science Studies</em></a>, “intends to serve as a starting point for broader discussions on balancing the pressures of global competition with maintaining ethical standards in research productivity and authorship practice,” study authors <a href="https://sites.aub.edu.lb/lmeho/">Lokman Meho</a> and <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/spark/Pages/drelieakl.aspx">Elie Akl</a>, researchers at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, told <em>Retraction Watch</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130720"></span>



<p>Universities manipulating publication metrics have made headlines recently. Highly cited researchers started <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/saudi-universities-lose-highly-cited-researchers-after-payment-schemes-raise-ethics">cutting ties</a> with schools in Saudi Arabia after an investigation revealed that institutions were offering cash in exchange for affiliation — all to boost rankings. In 2023, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/21/exclusive-researcher-outs-indian-universitys-publishing-scam-after-it-fails-to-pay-him/">covered a case</a> in which a prominent researcher was offered money by a university senior administrator to add his name to publications, outing the scam after not getting paid. And <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">our 2023 investigation</a> with <em>Science</em> uncovered a self-citation scheme at Saveetha Dental College — affiliated with Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, a name you will see again below — used to boost rankings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There has been speculation about universities gaming the metrics system for a while,” sleuth Dorothy Bishop said in an email, “but I’m not aware of any previous attempt to study this formally using bibliometric indicators.” Bishop said “motivations of the universities who take part in this are hard to understand, but it’s clearly done to improve performance on international rankings.”</p>



<p>Meho and Akl used data from Elsevier’s SciVal, Scopus, and Clarivate’s Web of Science to identify 80 universities that experienced growth in research output, as measured by number of published journal articles, of over 100% from 2019 to 2023 — far outpacing the global average of 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of these, 14 institutions also had declines in rates of first authorship of more than 15 percentage points over four years.This rate, over five times the average decrease of 3%, could be a sign of questionable authorship practices like sold or honorary authorship, the researchers said. “Such a dramatic decline often indicates a fundamental shift in how research contributions are distributed within an institution.”</p>



<p>Those 14 universities are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>An earlier <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18331">preprint</a> of the study results used different thresholds, resulting in the addition of Saveetha University and the removal of three others from the list. None of the 14 universities responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the universities saw a 234% rise in total publications over four years and a 23% drop in rates of first authorship. Eight of the 14 schools ranked at the top of the list of most significant declines in first authorship rates out of the 1,000 most-published universities. By 2023, 11 ranked among the 15 universities with lowest first authorship rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers also looked at hyperprolific authorship, defining it as publishing 40 or more articles annually. Combined, the 14 universities had an increase in hyperprolific authors from 23 in 2019 to 177 in 2023, an increase of 670% and a growth rate 10 times the average. However, this rate wasn’t consistent over all schools: King Saud University, for example, went from four hyperprolific authors in 2019 to 63 in 2023, a 1,500% increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers defined many of the hyperprolific authors among the 14 universities as “noncore,” meaning they published articles with universities they are not directly affiliated with. An increase in authors with multiple affiliations can mean a rise in ethical collaborations. But a sharp increase — as seen in some of the listed universities — can indicate “strategic efforts to amplify research output,” the researchers wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 2019 to 2023, the percentage of articles with authors with multiple affiliations remained stable at 18%. The control group, consisting of four universities known for conventional authorship practices — California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, and the University of California, Berkeley — had a much lower proportion of papers with authors with multiple affiliations, at 6%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inflating academic output “directly biases the outcomes of ranking systems, compromising their reliability and usefulness,” Meho and Akl write in the study. They conclude with a call to action for universities, funding agencies, and policymakers, among other bodies, to create and enforce more stringent guidelines and review processes around authorship practices.&nbsp;</p>

                Cartilage cells that contain fat explain why some skeletal tissues are less rigid than others, and could one day be grown in labs to produce better materials for performing reconstructive surgeries and rhinoplasties.

<p>A 2014 paper in <em>Science </em>by a lab in Toronto has been retracted after a December <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7951">expression of concern</a> raised “potential data integrity issues.”</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1248024">Mitosis Inhibits DNA Double-Strand Break Repair to Guard Against Telomere Fusions</a>,” is from the <a href="https://durocherlab.org/">lab of Daniel Durocher</a>, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Toronto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice, published today and signed by all of the original authors, reads, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130695"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We have since become aware of anomalies in Fig. 1 in the main paper and in figs. S3, S7, S9, and S11 in the supplementary materials. As a result of these issues, Science posted an Editorial Expression of Concern about the Report on 5 December 2024 (2). We are working with our institution to determine the basis of the problems. However, because of the scope and seriousness of the data and image irregularities, we have decided to retract the paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article has been cited 258 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. As we previously reported, the two papers <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=daniel+durocher">are among several</a> from Durocher’s lab that have been flagged for potentially duplicated images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meagan Phelan, a communications director for <em>Science</em>, said in an email Durocher and his colleagues are still evaluating the paper in cooperation with the Sinai Health Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. “However, because of the scope and seriousness of the data and image irregularities as they’ve already uncovered them, the authors have decided to retract the paper now, which we commend them for and agree with,” she told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sholto David, who uses the name “Mycosphaerella arachidis” on PubPeer, flagged the potential image duplication in a November 2024 <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0AF7C9EA1C32C958CE1A0E086CB846#1">comment</a>. He called the bands in the images “surprisingly similar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/05/science-places-expressions-of-concern-on-two-articles-as-torontos-sinai-health-investigates/">reported</a> in early December, the 2014 paper was one of two in <em>Science</em> that received an expression of concern. A 2007 article, “Orchestration of the DNA-Damage Response by the RNF8 Ubiquitin Ligase,” had a “duplicate image in Fig. 3D,” according to the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7744">notice</a>. That paper has been cited over 700 times, according to Web of Science.</p>



<p>Phelan told us the journal was “working with the authors to get the experiment reproduced” before considering retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Durocher did not respond directly to our request for comment. After we reached out to him, Jovana Drinjakovic, a scientific communications officer for the Sinai Health Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, sent us the same email we received in December after the two papers received expressions of concern:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While the 2007 paper has a figure error that the authors are working to correct, the 2014 paper was noted to contain data irregularities. As soon as the senior author was made aware of the irregularities pertaining to the 2014 study, he promptly notified Sinai Health. This triggered an internal inquiry, in accordance with its policy on addressing research misconduct allegations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Durocher replied on PubPeer threads for both the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9FD4EF09B9702618F5B1411AD25C3B">2007 paper</a> and the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0AF7C9EA1C32C958CE1A0E086CB846#1">2014 paper</a> that his lab would look into the irregularities.&nbsp;</p>
