<p>The journal <em>BMJ Public Health</em> is placing an expression of concern on a paper it said “gave rise to widespread misreporting and misunderstanding,” namely, “claims that it implies a direct causal link between COVID-19 vaccination and mortality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://bmjpublichealth.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000282">Excess mortality across countries in the Western World since the COVID-19 pandemic: ‘Our World in Data’ estimates of January 2020 to December 2022</a>,” appeared online June 3, and quickly attracted <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/164170334?src=bookmarklet">attention</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BD524B3E696274C2F24DFFC8CCA546">criticism</a>. The expression of concern is not yet live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their conclusions, the authors wrote: </p>



<span id="more-129413"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Excess mortality has remained high in the Western World for three consecutive years, despite the implementation of COVID-19 containment measures and COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next step, they wrote, was to distinguish “between the various potential contributors to excess mortality, including COVID-19 infection, indirect effects of containment measures and COVID-19 vaccination programmes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lots of outlets covered the study. <em>The Telegraph</em> ran its story with the headline, “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/04/covid-vaccines-may-have-helped-fuel-rise-in-excess-deaths/">Covid vaccines may have helped fuel rise in excess deaths</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>New York Post</em>’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/06/us-news/excess-deaths-since-pandemic-need-to-be-thoroughly-investigated-study/">story</a> took a similar angle, writing that the researchers found “excess mortality has ‘remained high’ since 2020 — despite the widespread rollout of COVID vaccines and various containment measures,” and quoting the paper’s statements about reported “serious injuries and deaths following vaccination.” The <em>Post</em> later corrected its story and added the following note:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An earlier version of this article did not reflect that the study did not analyze the impact of vaccination nor establish a link between mortality and vaccination status.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to the coverage, BMJ released the following <a href="http://press.psprings.co.uk/ph/june/bmjphstatement.pdf">statement</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Various news outlets have claimed that this research implies a direct causal link between COVID-19 vaccination and mortality. This study does not establish any such link. The researchers looked only at trends in excess mortality over time, not its causes. While the researchers recognise that side effects are reported after vaccination, the research does not support the claim that vaccines are a major contributory factor to excess deaths since the start of the pandemic. Vaccines have, in fact, been instrumental in reducing the severe illness and death associated with COVID-19 infection.</p>



<p>The message of the research is that understanding overall excess mortality since the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for future health policy, but that identifying specific causes is complex due to varying national data quality and reporting methods.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a similar episode, the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/06/02/nejm-issues-unusual-warning-readers-1980-letter-opioid-addiction/">added an editor’s note</a> in 2017 to a 1980 letter published in the journal that, the note said, had been “‘heavily and uncritically cited’ as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.”</p>



<p>Despite BMJ’s statement, scientists <a href="https://x.com/ActuaryByDay/status/1799439284833030192">critiqued the study’s methodology</a> on X (formerly Twitter). Ariel Karlinsky, an economist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, whose work the study cited, wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The onus here is on BMJ Public Health which published a really bad paper with a misleading title (nothing to do with OWID) and copies some of our work in WMD almost verbatim and misleadingly.<br><br>The researchers who wrote it then talked with Telegraph and this is the result.</p>&mdash; Ariel Karlinsky (@ArielKarlinsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielKarlinsky/status/1798371389558362279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Karlinsky told Retraction Watch he and a few colleagues have submitted a commentary and request for retraction to <em>BMJ Public Health</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three of the authors (Saskia Mostert, Minke Huibers, and Gertjan Kaspers) are affiliated with the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology in Utrecht, The Netherlands; the fourth, Marcel Hoogland, is identified as an “independent researcher” in Amsterdam. Mostert, the corresponding author, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On June 11, the Princess Máxima Center issued a <a href="https://www.prinsesmaximacentrum.nl/en/news-events/news/the-princess-maxima-center-distances-itself-from-publication-excess-mortality-during-covid-19-pandemic">statement</a> saying it “distances itself from the publication” and will “investigate the scientific quality of this study.” The statement added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Originally, the idea was to look at the effect of COVID measures on, among other things, the mortality rate of children with cancer in low-income countries. During the course of the study, the focus shifted and diverted in a direction that we felt was too far from our expertise: pediatric oncology. We are not experts in epidemiology, nor do we want to give that impression. The Máxima Center therefore emphatically distances itself from this publication. We should have been more alert to the formation and results of this publication and will further investigate the way it was created. If it turns out that carelessness was involved in the realization of this publication, it will of course be withdrawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On June 13, BMJ sent a press release to reporters saying it is “investigating the quality of the research and the messaging” of the paper, and would place an expression of concern on the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BMJ’s press release concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As part of the investigation the authors will be asked to review and respond to the concerns raised to BMJ about the quality and messaging of the paper. BMJ will then decide what further action is needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In February, <a href="https://www.uniklinikum-saarland.de/de/einrichtungen/fachrichtungen/forensische_psychologie_und_psychiatrie/wir_ueber_uns/unser_team/wissenschaftliche_mitarbeiterinnen/dr_phil_steffen_barra">Steffen Barra</a> Googled his name. A clinician working in the field of forensic psychiatry, he was in the habit of periodically checking if anything negative had been written about him. What he didn’t expect to find was a plagiarized paper with his name attached to it. </p>



<p>Barra, a researcher at the University of Saarland in Germany, told us the 2023 article, “<a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/introducing-the-complexities-of-forensic-psychology-decoding-the-mind-behind-the-crime.pdf">Introducing the Complexities of Forensic Psychology: Decoding the Mind Behind the Crime</a>,” &nbsp; plagiarized from an <a href="https://www.centreofexcellence.com/what-is-forensic-psychology/">information page</a> from a company offering online courses. The article also resembles many college informational pages about the field, such as <a href="https://und.edu/blog/what-is-forensic-psychology.html">this one</a> from the University of North Dakota, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Concerned he might be blamed for the misconduct, Barra immediately contacted the publisher, Hilaris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A company representative responded to Barra the same day, February 29, with one phrase: “We will remove the link.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129395"></span>



<p>Once Barra pressed for an explanation, a representative from the journal named Jennifer responded: “We will take necessary action against the person who is responsible for the uploading of wrong file with your details.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Hilaris’ <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/author/steffen-barra-36371">author page</a> for Barra is still live, as is the link to the PDF of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We attempted to contact the email listed in the paper, but it forwarded automatically to Barra’s email address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Barra also reached out to Hjördis Czesnick, head of <a href="https://ombudsman-fuer-die-wissenschaft.de/?lang=en">Office of the German Research Ombudsman</a>, for help investigating the case. Czesnick found Hilaris’ registered address on their website: a PO box in Brussels. On behalf of Barra, Czesnick contacted the Secretary of the Flemish Commission for Research Integrity, as well as Belgian police.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Czesnick told us the journal in which the article appeared, <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/abnormal-behavioural-psychology.html"><em>Abnormal and Behavioural Psychology</em></a>, is “known for dubious practices” and is “probably fake.” The title appears on Cabell’s List of predatory publishers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/abnormal-behavioural-psychology.html">website </a>for <em>Abnormal and Behavioural Psychology</em> says the open-access journal charges $99 for a“Fast Editorial Execution and Review Process,” which promises a decision in three days, review comments in five days after submission, and a galley proof two days after acceptance. Any manuscript accepted for publication incurs an article processing charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;ilaris did not respond to our request for comment. Their page on plagiarism states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Ethical standards of very high-quality ensures [sic] the authenticity of the scientific publication and wins [sic] the public trust on scientific findings so that it [sic] enhances the credibility of the research work or idea.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Barra said he feels “perplexed” by the situation: “[N]o one could think of any good reason for a ‘Publisher’ to do something like that,” he told us in an email.</p>



<p>Past instances of false authorship could provide a hint. In April 2023, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">covered a similar case</a> in which a researcher was listed as an author on a plagiarized paper that had nothing to do with her field of study. Commenters on the post said including a reputable researcher in the publication may have been an attempt to improve the journal’s image.</p>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We are back with our series Bridging the Gap! For each post, we are interviewing women in neuroscience to discuss the gaps, and the health inequalities, relating to different areas of neuroscience, as well as the exciting new research that is attempting to bridge these gaps. For our second article, we talked with Dr Katelynn Boerner, investigator at the British Columbia Children&apos;s Hospital Research Institute (BCCHR) and assistant professor in the department of Paediatrics at the University of British Columbia (UBC). In our interview, Dr Boerner shared with us her experience in working with gender diverse and neurodiverse young people with chronic pain and her opinions on the importance of creating more inclusive research practices. </strong></span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_02178e8a49084538aad34bc0360a42c3~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_238,h_241,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Dr Katelynn Boerner, investigator at the BCCHR and assistant professor in the department of Paediatrics at the UBC."></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Chronic pain can seriously impact the everyday life of people affected by it. In children and young people, living in pain can significantly affect their social and emotional development. Whilst any young person can experience acute or chronic pain, certain populations, including neurodiverse and gender diverse young people, are observed to report, or experience higher rates of, chronic pain. However, these populations are also often under-represented in paediatric pain research, resulting in an inability to comprehensively understand their pain experience and a scarcity of truly effective and targeted treatments. It is being increasingly acknowledged, in this field, that there is an urgent requirement to improve our understanding of the complex pain experiences endured by these young people, with different identities, in order to provide better care. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With both her clinical work and research on chronic pain in autistic and gender diverse youth, Dr Katelynn Boerner advocates for the adoption of an intersectional approach in the field of paediatric pain. This involves taking into account the broader social context that contributes to putting these people at a higher risk of developing pain conditions; in doing so, she also works to make research more inclusive by creating, in an active collaboration with patients and their families, alternative methodologies. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Could you tell me a little bit about your background in science?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I did my PhD in clinical psychology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. I was really interested in learning how physical health and psychology intersect and that’s how I ended up in the field of paediatric pain, focusing on studying the experiences of young people who live with chronic and acute pain. After my PhD, I did a clinical internship at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, and then moved to Vancouver to do two postdoc fellowships at BC Children’s Hospital and UBC. Through my experience as a clinician scientist, doing both research and providing clinical care, I started seeing these really big gaps between the kids and families that are represented in research and the kids and families that I was actually seeing in the clinic. It&apos;s really hard when I see a family in the clinic, and when I look at the research, to see how to best support them; I just don’t see anything that describes families that are in that particular situation. In this way, it’s hard to know how to provide evidence-based care. That’s why I became interested in health equality and why I started shifting my work towards trying to make research more accessible for the people that I was actually seeing in the clinic, to enable us to make better clinical decisions. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Once you started noticing these gaps, what inspired you to pursue research on chronic pain in gender-diverse and neurodiverse young people?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I was always interested in pain. Partially because pain is really everywhere; it is a feature of pretty much any disease or illness in childhood. Even ‘generally healthy’ children experience pain on a regular basis, so it’s really a topic that is relevant to everyone. During my PhD, I was investigating sex differences in pain. We know that, following puberty, we start seeing a disparity, with women and female-identifying people having higher rates of chronic pain, or being more impacted by chronic pain, and responding differently to treatments, compared to men and male-identifying people. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As a paediatric psychologist, I was interested in understanding what happens throughout the developmental trajectory, but the more I was looking at sex differences, the more I became “dissatisfied”. I was feeling that making binary comparisons was not telling the whole story. So, I started extending my perspective and became interested in looking at gender to understand some of the differences in pain experiences that we were observing, even between people with the same sex assigned at birth. Then it just sort of snowballed a bit from there. I realised that it was hard to look at just gender, without looking at other factors and other identities, so I became interested in understanding pain also in neurodiverse and autistic people. A lot of the young people that we support with pain, who are gender diverse, also identify as neurodiverse. I think the more I understood these young people’s experiences and lives, the more I realised I couldn’t just make a comparison between groups and feel like I actually knew the whole story: the more I learnt, the more I realised there are more and more layers of understanding pain, and knowing all those layers was essential to providing the best care.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>So what projects are you working on at the moment?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I would say the overall theme of my projects is trying to understand how to support young people that often end up in the limitations sections of papers, or that are often excluded from the research, either explicitly or implicitly, because the methods are not accessible to them. I have a couple of streams of research looking at the experience of trans and gender diverse youth that live with chronic pain and some work looking at pain in autistic young people, studying both everyday pain experience and chronic pain experiences. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Then I have a project called “The Living Lab at Home &apos;&apos; that I co-lead with my postdoc mentor, Dr. Tim Oberlander. During the pandemic, we realised that we needed to find a different way to do research, as we couldn’t bring people into the lab. As we were looking at this, we started to think, “maybe, even once we </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">can </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">bring people into the lab, we </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">shouldn’t</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. Maybe there are better ways of collecting data that actually reaches families where they are at”. The more we started talking about this idea to other researchers, clinicians and families, the more we realised that there are lots of families for whom coming in person to participate in a study is not accessible, because of where they live, the challenges they are dealing with, or the anxiety and trauma associated with coming to a clinical space. With the Living Lab at Home project, we have been exploring different ways to bring child health research into the community and make research methods accessible. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Some of the tools used to collect data in the community have been used for a long time, but have not been necessarily co-designed or developed with families, nor adapted to be used in populations that have different accessibility needs. So, the focus of the project is to come up with a core set of methods that have been developed with the families’ input, tried out with them, iterated and improved upon, and then to share these methods with other scientists, to use them with different research questions. I am trying to include more and more of these methods in my projects on gender diversity and neurodiversity in pain. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Are these projects done locally or would you like to do this research internationally?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Right now, most of our projects are conducted in the province where I am based, British Columbia, and only one is being done across Canada. We would love to bring our research further afield, but there are a lot of logistics we had to deal with, even with rolling out our research project across the country. It has been very interesting to think about, for example, how to bring research equipment to people, how to get it back, how to collect data from families who may live in areas where they don’t have great cell phone coverage or internet access. So it has definitely been challenging to try out our core set of research methods with teams that have different populations of interest and see what adaptations need to be made for different contexts, people, life circumstances and, most importantly, different systemic and structural inequalities that might represent a barrier in traditional research methodologies. It’s taking a lot of creativity and flexibility to think about how to do all that, and about alternative ways of conducting research, to make it more accessible. I have to say, a lot of the ideas about how to make this actually work have come from the families and the young people with lived experiences that we partnered with. They came up with a lot of the solutions, so I am fully convinced that we should never do any similar research project, or really any research at all, without hearing from the people who are actually going to be doing it and hopefully benefit from it.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Different circumstances in different places, for example here in the UK compared to there in Canada, can play a role in these projects, but would you say that there are common issues in research? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it’s one of those things that once you start to look for it, you see inequities everywhere in the way we do research. I have been thinking a lot lately about one of the tools we use in the ”Living Lab at Home”, the ecological momentary assessment, where we ask folks to fill out a couple of brief questionnaires a couple of times a day for a few weeks to get sort of micro-longitudinal data. It made us think a lot about the issue of “compliance”, a word that I don’t like to use because it implies a judgement. In a lot of studies, if a participant has “low compliance”, for instance if they don’t fill out enough questionnaire time points, then their data get excluded from the analysis. It certainly takes a lot of effort and resources to try to do things differently, but I feel like we are missing so much important information from folks that may have very legitimate reasons for why they can’t perfectly follow the research protocol. I think it is a problem if we end up excluding that data because it doesn’t conform to what we expect as researchers, or what we need statistically. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I definitely see similar issues in research on trans and gender diverse people with pain. We say these young people are not well represented in research, but then if you actually look, sometimes we do have data from them. It’s just that they get excluded because we don’t have a big enough sample size to put them in a category and allow us to do the statistics that we want. So I always feel this tension because I do very much believe in strong and rigorous research evidence, as well as the need to make clinical decisions on well conducted research. However, I think we need to realise that the traditional way of doing things is just not going to work for all situations for all people. I am getting so much more excited about the idea of pairing some of those traditional methods with alternative ways of doing things, to try and bring different sources of knowledge together and address some of these equity gaps that we see in research and then trickle down to clinical practice. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>I can see how it can be difficult, from an analysis point of view, to handle data from people that, for one way or another, can&apos;t follow the protocol. In your projects, how do you deal with all these different cases?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Recently, I have been doing a lot of qualitative research which allows for incorporating different types and levels of data and accounts for diverse experiences and perspectives. In our “Living Lab at Home”, when something isn’t working or when we are not collecting enough data, rather than throwing it away, we ask ourselves why. Embedded in all of our research protocols now, there are opportunities to get feedback from people who participated in the studies. This way, even if the actual data that they gave us might not fit the analysis, we can get feedback about what got in the way and what we could do differently as a research team to facilitate their participation. I am so privileged to work with people who have way more statistical expertise than me and, together, we are constantly thinking about ways to structure the protocol in a way that we prioritise the data that we need and to engage with families before we even start collecting the data. We are always trying to figure out how to actually make it work and the different ways of telling the story, incorporating the data that we do have, because sometimes the absence of data is actually data itself. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Before, you mentioned you started noticing, during your clinical practice, a gap between the folks that participate in research and those that come to clinics. What contributes to such a gap? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">A lot of it comes back to this issue of </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">how</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> we are conducting research. For example, the requirements to successfully complete a treatment through a randomised control trial are quite rigorous. I understand why that is, to try to isolate a specific factor and understand exactly what a treatment does for this particular issue. However, in doing that, a lot of folks are going to get excluded because of the “variance” they’d bring to the data with their profile. A really good example is neurodiversity. A lot of young people that live with chronic pain are neurodivergent, or autistic, and a lot of clinical protocols will exclude these young people. This might be because of the high amount of variability in the types of pain they experience, or maybe because they have different needs for how they communicate their pain. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We see something similar happening with medical conditions, or psychiatric conditions, that often end up not fitting the inclusion criteria in a clinical trial, again because they are trying to isolate what the impact of this treatment is on chronic pain. But the reality is in specialised pain clinic, it’s very rare to see a child where pain is the only thing they are dealing with – there are often other symptoms, diagnoses, or challenges. So it’s hard to tell a young person that has multiple co-occurring conditions whether a treatment, which hasn’t been tested on anybody with a similar experience, is going to work for them. There are certainly some good reasons to think it would work and it might need some adaptations, but we don’t have the research to help us make the decisions on what those adaptations should look like.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Similarly, you said that these young people, who are under-represented in research, are often also the ones experiencing higher rates of pain. Can you explain to us why that is?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We know that for people who are autistic or neurodivergent, there might be differences in the way pain is processed in their body and differences in the sensory and nervous system. Moreover, for a lot of young people, the discrimination against their identity - whether that is neurodiversity, gender diversity, race or socioeconomic status - can impact their health outcomes. Because they are living in a certain stressful situation, they are being discriminated against, they don’t have the same access to healthcare, or healthcare that seems safe for them to access - all of this is going to put them at a higher risk of developing a chronic pain condition, amongst other conditions.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think one of the most important things that is happening in research right now is this increasing acknowledgement that, when it comes to populations that are “at risk”, there’s a whole bunch of systems that work against this person and that put them at risk. It’s such an important message that the young person themselves, and their identity, are not the problem. This ‘damage-centred’ view has been the narrative for a long time and has taken over in research, but I am glad to see a shift happening to understand the systems and structures that contribute to putting these young people at risk in the first place. I hope that we continue this discourse and incorporate it more and more into our research, not only to understand what kind of care we can provide for the individual person, but also how we can act on some of the bigger factors that lead to the higher risk.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>When these factors are neglected, how would you describe the consequences both on the clinical and research practices?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">If you want to study a specific treatment and don’t take those factors into account, you might not actually be able to get an understanding of why some treatments don’t work. There are a lot of good treatments out there and we are asking people to use them and apply them even in really challenging conditions. If you are living under a higher amount of stress because of your social situation, because you are being discriminated against, or because you don’t have access to what you need, it might not be realistic to expect the treatment to work to its full potential. I worry that this could discourage researchers from continuing to study a treatment in a particular population, or discourage a family, or a young person, from thinking that there’s something that could help them. In paediatric pain, we do an amazing job at showing how no child lives with their pain in isolation. We have done a lot of research on how the family system, the ways the parents interact with their child, and the ways the child interacts with their health provider, influence the pain experience. Now, I think we need to continue to extend our understanding of that influence, beyond just the immediate relationships, and look at the broader context that the young person is living in and how that context can impact them in very different ways, depending on their identity. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Throughout this interview, you have emphasised the necessity to change how research is conducted. Thinking also about your own effort to do that, can you tell me how methodologies should be modified to make research more inclusive and ensure that young people of all identities are cared for?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think one of the most important things that we have been doing in our work is asking young people about what parts of the research experience has worked for them and what hasn’t. That has been helpful to make modifications to the protocol and to offer different options. Much of this comes down to a couple of key principles:</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of these is flexibility. As researchers, we like clean protocols and for things to be controlled, but figuring out where it is possible to be flexible is so important. Another is to actually </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">ask </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">the people with lived experience what would make a difference to them. Some of our qualitative data have shown how patients having a relationship with the research team, and being shown how their ideas are being incorporated, can be really powerful and helps make sure that they are getting something back too. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Indeed, we have been thinking a lot about how to create a reciprocal relationship, for example by designing our platform so that we can feed the data back to the participants. This way, they can see the data in a way that makes sense to them and they can track the things that are meaningful to them, rather than sending us information and never seeing it again. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Finally, I think that a lot of what’s needed really comes down to basic principles of respect. I feel sad that I have to say that, but when we think of some of the experiences that these families have been going through - navigating the healthcare systems, having other experiences of research participation, or just living in a world that is often not designed for them - I think it can go a really long way to think about how to approach someone with respect. There is an assumption in research that we need to have everything figured out and sometimes that prevents us from asking important questions, like how we can approach families in a way that is going to make them feel comfortable and safe, whilst also being meaningful to them. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Part of what I have been thinking about, is that we talk a lot in clinical care about providing trauma-informed clinical care, but I think we need to start talking about how to provide trauma-informed research, and that can be such an important step in undoing what has made research inaccessible for some populations. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Issues with the way research is conducted can trickle down to the clinical experiences. Can you think of any way that the clinical practices can be changed to contribute to addressing the unmet needs of young people with different identities?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think a lot of clinicians naturally make modifications to the way they provide treatment. The problem is that we don’t always know if what we are doing is working, because of how we are collecting data. I think that, again, it is so important to incorporate the patient’s and family’s perspectives on what a meaningful treatment outcome would be. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In pain trials, we always measure pain intensity, functional disability, anxiety and depression as health outcomes of a given treatment. But those are not always the outcomes that are significant to a family. Instead, it could be more important to be able to sleep better at night, or to be able to do a sport they love. So, I think that part of making a treatment accessible, is also thinking about how we can modify things to make their desired outcome happen. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">For example, there are certainly a lot of similarities between the cisgender and gender diverse youth’s experiences of chronic pain, so some treatments can still work. However, there are some parts of the pain experience that are specific to gender diverse young people. A lot of the gender diverse young people we talked to for our research have talked about chest binding and how, even if it is a source of pain, it is also very important in developing their identity. So, if we are focused on the idea that for our treatment to be effective, we need to decrease the pain from a 7/10 to a 4/10, we don’t understand that this pain represents something important to the young person; we end up missing the mark in providing really good care. We need to give the right space for that young person to talk about their experience, and what is critical for them. That’s why I think that having clinician scientists is so important, because there is such a difference between the real clinical world, that can be really messy, and what we ideally like to do in research. Incorporating this information back into research, and understanding what’s working, when and for who, is so important. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Before, you said there is an increasing awareness in research of the influence of some broader contextual factors on pain experiences of pain. Can you talk to me a little bit more about the changes and advancements you see happening in the field of paediatric pain?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it’s amazing the amount of interest there is now in trying to understand more about young people that have not been historically included in pain research. There is a really incredible community of folks that have a specific interest in gender diversity and paediatric chronic pain, and are trying to do really meaningful research. Also, I am excited about the fact that I am seeing more and more work with an intersectional perspective - projects, that are not looking at sex or gender differences in isolation, but are instead also taking into consideration race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and other social positions that might be associated with marginalisation, power or privilege. They are trying to understand how all these factors intersect and, how the health disparities that we observe, fit into this framework. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the reasons why this kind of work excites me so much is that it’s hard, it’s challenging. I like the hard things in science, because it means they are important and they open up so many interesting opportunities for amazing collaborations. Intersectionality is not a new concept, per se, but it is now being applied directly in paediatric pain research. This is leading to interesting discussions on how to translate this into practice, using mixed methods, and how to engage differently with people with lived experience (and importantly, it leads to bridging between disciplines). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Pain has always been a very interdisciplinary field anyway, where medicine, psychology, basic and clinical science are integrated. However, I am glad to see that now there is, more often, an effort to link the pain experiences to the broader social context, that goes beyond the parent-child, or provider-patient relationship. There is a shift in thinking about our research more generally, and in an intersectional way, to incorporate multiple different identities, social positions and contexts.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>To conclude, what are the future prospects in this field that you are most excited about?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are a lot of things I am excited about! One of them is the increasing representation. I will be so thrilled the day that I can have a young person walk into my office and I will be able to say, “Look, this is where you are represented in the research and we know how to help people like you. This person’s experience in research might not 100% be your experience, because you are an individual person, but science cares about you too”. </span></span></p>

<p>A research group at the University of California, San Francisco, under investigation for potential misconduct has had a second paper retracted.</p>



<p>The group, led by <a href="https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/pieper.russell">Russell O. Pieper</a>, director of basic science at the UCSF Brain Tumor Center and vice-chairman of the UCSF Department of Neurological Surgery, previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/07/brain-tumor-researchers-retract-paper-from-science-journal/">lost a 2021 paper</a> in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em> after Elisabeth Bik and other commenters on PubPeer posted concerns about some of the images in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The newly retracted paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720304174">Phosphoglycerate Mutase 1 Activates DNA Damage Repair via Regulation of WIP1 Activity</a>,” appeared in <em>Cell Reports</em> in 2020. It has been cited 25 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. </p>



<span id="more-129392"></span>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720304174">retraction notice</a>, Pieper and his colleagues duplicated an image from two of the group’s previous studies but labeled it as a different cell type and from different experimental conditions than in the other publications. An anonymous commenter on PubPeer had flagged the duplicated image <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/11DE66AF84C3290E6CAA7A2E4FAF31#1">in August 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pieper reported the matter to the Office of Ethics and Compliance at UCSF, where an investigation is still ongoing, the notice stated. Because <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joydeep-mukherjee-b8306115/">Joydeep Mukherjee</a>, the paper’s corresponding author, did not provide the figure’s raw data to the editors of <em>Cell Reports</em>, the editors concluded that the outcome of the investigation, while clarifying how the duplication came to be, will not affect the decision to retract and thus felt that the most responsible course of action was to retract the paper even though the investigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached Pieper by phone but he hung up without commenting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mukherjee’s <a href="https://pieperlab.ucsf.edu/people/joydeep-mukherjee">research profile</a> at UCSF appears to have been removed. He did not respond to an email seeking comment. The office conducting the investigation did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Most of the co-authors of the paper approved of the retraction, except for those the journal could not reach by email, the retraction notice stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice also stated Pieper requested a correction to the author’s contributions to the paper, but because all the authors didn’t agree the journal didn’t change it. The original article stated Pieper designed the experiments with his co-authors. In his correction, Pieper wrote he only obtained funding for the study. Mukherjee “disputed entirely” the revised statement, according to the retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Cell Reports</em> said the journal does not comment on individual cases beyond what is included in the retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multiple posts on PubPeer have expressed concerns about image duplication in other papers by Pieper and Mukherjee that have not been retracted.</p>

<p>Recently our philosophy faculty at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, like many institutions around the world, introduced a ranking of journals based on Elsevier’s Scopus database to evaluate the research output of its employees for awards and promotions. This database is also used by our institution in the hiring process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The database provides three main measures: CiteScore, SJR, and SNIP. CiteScore counts the citations received in four-year periods (e.g. 2020-2023) by texts published in this span and divides this figure by the number of papers published in the same interval. SJR and SNIP – which our institution uses to rank journals – are more complicated, with their full algorithms not publicly available.</p>



<p>We checked the <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sources.uri">Scopus philosophy list</a> and discovered three journals published by Addleton Academic Publishers – which we had never heard of – are in the top 10 of the 2023 CiteScore ranking: <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/linguistic-and-philosophical-investigations"><em>Linguistic and Philosophical Investigations</em></a> (3rd on the list of 806 philosophy journals indexed by Scopus in 2023), <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/review-of-contemporary-philosophy"><em>Review of Contemporary Philosophy</em></a> (5/806), and <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/analysis-and-metaphysics"><em>Analysis and Metaphysics</em></a> (6/806). All three also are in the top 100 of the 2023 SJR ranking.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129387"></span>



<p>Addleton publishes two other journals indexed by Scopus: <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/knowledge-cultures"><em>Knowledge Cultures</em></a> (67/806 in CiteScore Philosophy ranking and 8/1,106 in Literature and Literary Theory ranking) and <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/contemporary-readings-in-law-and-social-justice"><em>Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice</em></a><em>, </em>which is<em> </em>indexed as a social science journal (33/1025 in Law).&nbsp; The publisher initially had nine journals in Scopus, but four of them have now been removed because of “Publication Concerns,” according to the most recent Scopus update on May 5. Early in May the company announced on their website that <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/linguistic-and-philosophical-investigations"><em>Linguistic and Philosophical Investigations</em></a>, <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/review-of-contemporary-philosophy"><em>Review of Contemporary Philosophy</em></a>, <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/analysis-and-metaphysics"><em>Analysis and Metaphysics</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/contemporary-readings-in-law-and-social-justice"><em>Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice</em></a> will have a new publisher: Auricle Global Society of Education and Research, based in India.</p>



<p>How was it possible to get into the Scopus top 10 in philosophy? The trick is simple: The Addleton journals extensively cross-cite each other. For example, of 541 citations to <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/linguistic-and-philosophical-investigations"><em>Linguistic and Philosophical Investigations</em></a> used to calculate the 2023 CiteScore, 208 come from journals published by Addleton. Additional citations come mostly from Frontiers and MDPI journals.</p>



<p>These journals are filled with automatically generated papers, all using the same template, extensively using buzzwords such as “blockchain,” “metaverse,” “deep learning,” “immersive visualization,” “neuro-engineering technologies,” and “internet of things.” Most papers claim to examine the recently published literature on these topics by “a quantitative literature review of the main databases.” They also claim to analyze initially (always!) between 170 and 180 articles that satisfied the undisclosed “eligibility criteria.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The papers claim that after quality checks with tools called AMSTAR, AXIS, MMAT, ROBIS, etc., the authors decided to focus (always!) on between 30 and 35 articles. Then there are the phrases. “ROBIS assessed the risk of bias in systematic reviews,” “AXIS evaluated the quality of cross-sectional studies,” and “The quality of academic articles was determined and risk of bias was measured by MMAT” appear in Google Scholar 270 times as of early May, solely in journals published by Addleton.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although our quick search showed that some authors have real affiliations, mostly in Romania, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, a substantial share of authors and their affiliations seem to be fake – for example authors at <a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/contents-rcp/2699-volume-22-2023/4514-holographic-telepresence-and-digital-twin-simulation-technologies-3d-virtual-space-networking-and-machine-learning-based-image-recognition-tools-and-environment-mapping-and-cognitive-artificial-intelligence-algorithms-in-a-fully-connected-metaverse">“The Cognitive Labor Institute in New York,”</a> “<a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/contents-lpi/2445-volume-21-2022/4238-predictive-algorithms-data-visualization-tools-and-artificial-neural-networks-in-the-retail-metaverse">The Sustainable Industrial Networks Research Unit at CLI in Springfield, IL, USA</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.addletonacademicpublishers.com/contents-am/2700-volume-22-2023/4573-mobile-biometric-and-sentiment-data-generative-artificial-intelligence-and-behavior-tracking-tools-and-wearable-sensor-based-and-connected-monitoring-devices-in-immersive-interconnected-3d-worlds">The Center for Sensing and Computing Technologies, Bradford at ISBDA</a>” in England, all with “aa-er.org” email addresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That domain – also used by some of the editors in chief – belongs to the American Association for Economic Research, which on its website shares an address – 30-18 50th Street, Woodside, New York, NY, 11377 – with Addleton and seems to be a random house in the New York City borough of Queens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authors also use fake grant numbers allegedly from fake institutions – “Grant GE-1420897 from the Internet of Things Sensing Infrastructures Research Unit, Newport, Wales;” “Grant GE-1764317 from the Cyber-Physical Process Monitoring Systems Laboratory, Norwich, England;” “Grant GE-1823847 from the Internet of Things Sensing Networks Research Unit, Plymouth, England.” The same editorial board serves for three journals, with 10<em> </em>members who are dead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we informally alerted some colleagues involved in introducing these rankings at our institution, we met with indifference. The presence of these fake journals on the relevant lists is apparently perceived to have negligible consequences. However, the lists as used in the employee evaluation process – for example, to nominate researchers for yearly awards – have firm percentile cutoffs. And the fact that three fake journals are among the leaders in the Scopus rankings has the practical consequence that three honest journals which should have received the top score from the perspective of our local evaluation have been pushed to the lower tier.</p>



<p>We have contacted three &#8220;authors&#8221; with &#8220;<a href="http://aa-er.org">aa-er.org</a>&#8221; email addresses, asking them to send their papers, but they have not replied. We also contacted various members of the journals’ editorial boards. One – Liz Jackson of Hong Kong – said she was invited to be on the board but has since not been asked to do anything. She said she would ask to have her name removed. One of us (LW) also contacted some apparently real authors from the University of Craiova to discuss the content of their papers. None has replied.</p>



<p>Rankings based on Scopus frequently serve universities and funding bodies as indicators of the quality of research, including in philosophy. They play a crucial role in decisions regarding academic awards, hiring, and promotion, and thus may influence the publication strategies of researchers. A <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04342-9">recent philosophy article</a> that provides a meta-ranking of philosophy journals claimed “CiteScore is the one [measure] that correlates most strongly with all four meta-rankings. Tentatively this might be a reason to prefer CiteScore as a source of information on a journal if it has no other rankings.” Our findings show that research institutions should refrain from the automatic use of such rankings.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Shabnam Kadir will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;Visual experience, topology, and the perception of art&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The brain has access to visual information via a variety of neural codes, e.g. there are
cells tuned to edge orientation, spatial frequency, edges, corners, contrasts and colour.
Higher cortical areas of the brain are thought to then further process visual information
as well as integrate a visual scene with other senses and the conscious mind. How this
visual information is combined with experience to form a holistic experience that elicits
an emotional response of pleasure, distress and/or other forms of meaning is an active
research question. The human perception of art and the question of what constitutes art
touch upon all these elements of perception and integration. We shall show how topology
provides a vital new lens in examining these questions.</p>
<p>We discuss recent work where methods from applied topology, namely persistent homology
of certain cubical complexes, are applied to images produced by both a human artist and
a neural network shown in two exhibitions in Torun, Poland. The images shown in the two
exhibitions were matched for certain information-theoretic pixel-based characteristics.
Experimental measurements of EEG, tracking of eye movement, as well as conscious
perception/appreciation of these paintings were collected from a selection of visitors
to these exhibitions, namely second-year art students.</p>

<p>Last July, <a href="https://news.iu.edu/live/profiles/945-david-allison">David Allison </a>and his students identified what they considered to be fatal errors in a paper that had appeared in Elsevier’s <em>Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice</em>.</p>



<p>The authors of the <a href="https://www.diabetesresearchclinicalpractice.com/article/S0168-8227(23)00599-5/fulltext">article</a>, led by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sergio-Di-Molfetta">Sergio Di Molfetta</a>, of University of Bari Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy, used a cluster randomized controlled trial, but did an improper statistical analysis, according to Allison’s group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August, Allison, dean of Indiana University’s School of Public Health in Bloomington, and his colleagues requested the authors’ data.</p>



<p>Then they hit a wall.</p>



<span id="more-129354"></span>



<p>Over the next three months, Allison –&nbsp; who said he works to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/18/prompt-and-decisive-editor-says-obesity-study-will-be-retracted-after-critique/">contribute</a> to the “regular reproducibility, transparency, and trustworthiness of science” –&nbsp; and his colleagues emailed with the authors, explaining their reasoning for requesting the data. They copied <a href="https://esc365.escardio.org/person/24820">Antonio Cerellio</a>, the journal’s editor in chief, on an email requesting he uphold the journal’s policy on data sharing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November, in an email seen by Retraction Watch, <a href="https://www.easd.org/media-centre/home.html#!users/8429">Francesco Giorgino</a>, the paper&#8217;s corresponding author, said sharing data with a third party would breach the study participant&#8217;s consent and European rules on data protection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The suggested statistical analysis by Allison’s group would “likely be biased” as there were only 23 patients in the study, Giorgino said. However, “some descriptive steps of the statistical analysis were perhaps carelessly omitted,” he said because the authors thought they were too detailed for a pilot study. Giorgino did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>In April, Allison’s group submitted a critical letter of the paper to the journal. This letter was rejected in May by Cerellio as the “paper cannot be assigned sufficient priority to allow publication.” <a href="https://publichealth.indiana.edu/research/postdoctoral-fellows-research-associate/profile.html?user=ocrobert">Olivia Robertson</a>, a postdoctoral fellow in Allison’s group, emailed Cerellio urging him to reconsider publishing the manuscript to address the paper&#8217;s errors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email seen by Retraction Watch, Cerellio responded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I think that it its time to stop this never-ending story. You have been in contact with the authors, who were raising several legal issues. From the journal&#8217;s view, considering that the paper received a full review process and that it is not our intention to be engaged in a legal issue, the question stops now. If you continue to have concerns, you can prosecute the authors.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cerellio did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Allison and his group have not heard from the editor since this response and said they are unsure of what “legal issues” Cerellio may have been referencing.</p>



<p>“We are disappointed that the editor and original study authors have not been more responsive and committed to upholding the accuracy and integrity of science by correcting the errors we identified but we are forging on, nonetheless,” Robertson said. “Unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/26/when-editors-confuse-direct-criticism-with-being-impolite-science-loses/">first time our group has received</a> an unsupportive response.”</p>

<p>A math professor in Poland has lost two papers because she plagiarized a doctoral thesis written before the United States had put a man on the moon.</p>



<p>The articles by Daria Michalik, &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864117303735">The decomposition uniqueness for infinite Cartesian products</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864115005532">Some remarks on the uniqueness of decomposition into Cartesian product</a>,” published in 2017 and 2016, respectively, were retracted this year from <em>Topology and its Applications</em> over concerns they closely resembled an unpublished 1968 dissertation from Polish topologist <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=302642">Zbigniew Furdzik</a>: “On the properties of certain decompositions of topological spaces into Cartesian products.”</p>



<p>Michalik has associations with the Institute of Mathematics, the same institution with which Furdzik, now deceased, earned his PhD. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9524-5403">As of August of 2023</a>, she was a researcher at Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Poland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction statements for both papers read:</p>



<span id="more-129335"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors-in-Chief after receiving a complaint about citation issues. The editors solicited further independent reviews which indicated that the statements in this paper substantially overlap with the PhD thesis of Z. Furdzik [O własnościach pewnych rozkładów przestrzeni topologicznych na iloczyny kartezjańskie, 1968 (unpublished, in Polish), Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw], without proper citation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsevier received the complaint in June of 2023, according to a spokesperson, who did not say who had sent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2016 paper was cited once – in Michalik’s 2017 paper, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. In the citation, Michalik compares her work with Furdzik’s:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This part of our work is contained in Section 4; here, the main result is Theorem 3, which was independently proved by the author and Furdzik</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The 2017 paper has not been cited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michalik hasn’t responded to our request for comment.</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=Engineering%20Analysis%20with%20Boundary%20Elements&amp;cid=271096&amp;qs=expression%20of%20concern&amp;years=2024&amp;lastSelectedFacet=years">expressed concern </a>over 73 papers with evidence of manipulated peer-review and rigged citations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last July, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/19/journal-asks-scientist-to-step-down-from-editorial-board-after-sleuths-comments-linked-him-to-paper-mill/">reported</a> that <a href="https://research.iaun.ac.ir/pd/afrand/">Masoud Afrand</a>, a former member of the editorial board of <em>Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements</em>, had been linked to paper mill activity. At the time, Alexander Cheng, the journal’s editor in chief said Afrand had been asked to step down due to “unethical publication conduct.” (For other coverage of the journal since then, see <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/04/02/karimipour-saga-i-setting-boundaries/">this post</a> by Maarten van Kampen and Alexander Magazinov.)</p>



<p>Cheng told Retraction Watch the journal is investigating the “temporary” expressions of concern. “Findings will be published, and actions will be taken, once investigations are completed,” he said.</p>



<span id="more-129343"></span>



<p>The 73 notices state that the “editors are investigating the article, including contacting the authors, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and Elsevier&#8217;s policies. The Expression of Concern will remain appended to the article until the investigation has been completed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the articles involve many different authors, three researchers appear repeatedly. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Muc4_v4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Mohammad S. Sajadi</a>, a professor of nutrition at&nbsp; Cihan University in Erbil, Iraq, is an author on 24 papers published in the journal – 16 of which are now marked with expressions of concern and one of which has been retracted. According to Clarivate’s Web of Science, Sajadi’s work has garnered more than 10,000 citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=gw3EVzwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Quynh Hoang Le</a>, of Duy Tan University in Da Nang, Vietnam, has published 11 papers in the journal, of which two have been retracted and nine are flagged with an expression of concern. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kXDeyfoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Mohammed A. Albedah</a>, an assistant professor of material science at Majmaah University in Al Majma&#8217;ah, Saudi Arabia, published three papers, all of which are now marked with expressions of concern. None of the authors have responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier is “conducting a full investigation and cannot comment any further until the investigations are complete,” a company spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The authors of a paper published in <em>Science</em> have retracted their article following the discovery of calculation errors.</p>



<p>The article,“<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi1071">Drought sensitivity in mesic forests heightens their</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi1071">vulnerability to climate change</a>” by <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/robert-heilmayr">Robert Heilmayr</a> of the University of California, Santa Barbara and colleagues found that in drier areas, trees are less sensitive to drought and in hotter regions with a wet climate, tree growth is expected to decrease.</p>



<p>It has been cited once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Since its publication in December, <a href="https://science.altmetric.com/details/157293460/news">the article</a> has been downloaded 4,641 times, posted by 154 X users, and written about by 20 news outlets and press release sites.</p>



<span id="more-129347"></span>



<p>In January, a group led by Stefan Klesse of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research informed the authors of errors in their R script, which was used to characterize weather and climate in these drought-affected regions. When the authors reran their script, the statistical significance of some conclusions, and test results changed – prompting them to retract the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We believe the journal has handled this process incredibly well,” Heilmayr told Retraction Watch. “They encouraged us to work with Klesse et al. to get to the bottom of their concerns, and then followed our recommendation to retract the paper. Although we are disappointed, we were happy we were able to correct the scientific record.”</p>



<p>Klesse and his colleagues did not respond to our request for comment. [See an update at the end of this post.]</p>



<p>Four papers have been retracted from Science since the beginning of last year. The first was a similar case, in which researchers discovered an error and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/30/one-small-error-for-a-physicist-one-giant-blunder-for-planetary-science/">the authors retracted</a>. Two involved the high-profile case of former <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/31/stanford-president-retracts-two-science-papers-following-investigation/">Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne</a>, and the other was from another <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1104">high-profile case at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Science</em> said “It continues to encourage us to see examples like this where a data user lets the authors know about an error and the authors work quickly to correct the record.”</p>



<p>Update, 1800 UTC, 6/10/24: Klesse said our request for comment landed in his spam folder, and told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The main message of the paper stood against everything that I (and the greater tree-ring community, there were certainly more people puzzled by the results than just the four of us who reached out to the authors) was used to know from working with basically the same dataset for years. If this had been published in a “lesser” journal than Science or similar I might have just shrugged and not cared about it too much. But published in such a lighthouse journal, I really tried to understand how they could have gotten their results. Did WE always do something wrong, or is there some mistake in THEIR data/code? And after some days of digging, I stumbled over some rather big calculation mistakes, that changed a lot on my/our end in the “expected” direction (confirmed by using other independent climate datasets and target climate variables). Basically, the review process (the reviewers to be specific) failed the authors and the journal – and I am not saying that the reviewers should have read their R code, we can’t expect that. But thanks to the open data policy of Science, we were able to pinpoint the mistake and correct the record. Too bad Science doesn’t publish their review reports.  </p>

<p>The publisher MDPI has reversed itself on one reason it said a paper does not need to be retracted following allegations the authors had plagiarized a thesis.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/03/a-disturbing-experience-postdoc-fights-to-have-work-that-plagiarized-her-thesis-retracted/">reported earlier this week</a>, the editorial office at <em>Nutrients</em> told Solange Saxby, a postdoctoral research fellow at Dartmouth Health in Lebanon, NH, in May that it didn’t consider apparent overlap between a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/15/3337">2023 paper</a> and her <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/items/40c83f1d-38c0-4071-b505-324f41049344">2020 thesis</a> plagiarism “because thesis materials are not classified as prior publications.”</p>



<p>Yesterday, MDPI did a 180, blaming a “mismatch in their internal communications” for the responses Saxby received.</p>



<span id="more-129351"></span>



<p>“As a publisher, we do not support the statement that ‘the behavior did not amount to plagiarism because the prior work was a thesis,’” Rui Duarte, the public relations manager for&nbsp; the company, said. “While we strive to maintain high standards of service and clear communication, occasional errors can occur.”</p>



<p>The corresponding author of the <em>Nutrients</em> paper has called the failure to cite Saxby’s thesis “an oversight” and said she has been working with the publisher to correct the error.</p>



<p>Following the publication of our story, the <em>Nutrients</em> editorial office told Retraction Watch that the investigation into this case was now closed, concluding “there was no plagiarism or any significant overlap.” The office said that a technical analysis and detailed comparison between the two manuscripts found less than 1% overlap.</p>



<p>Duarte reiterated the investigation was closed. He said the editorial board determined that the “similarities with Dr. Saxby’s thesis consist of well-established statements that exist within the wider body of the literature related to the Taro root and are cited as such.”</p>



<p>Here is a comparison of some passages of the <em>Nutrients</em> paper with Saxby’s dissertation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saxby dissertation, page 15:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Taro contains a unique composition of protein polypeptides that have not been found in other root crops, and exclusively found in tubers from <em>C. esculenta</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Section 3.3 of the <em>Nutrients</em> paper:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Taro contains a unique protein polypeptide composition that has not been found in other root crops and is exclusively found in tubers from <em>C. esculenta</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Same paragraph, Saxby dissertation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Furthermore, taro differs from sweet potato, cassava and yams, in that it contains two major types of storage protein: G1 (a mannosebinding lectin) and G2 (a trypsin inhibitor related to sporamin). Thus, the low protein content and gluten-free composition of taro makes for great hypoallergenic food and potential food substitutes for individuals with food allergies.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Same paragraph, <em>Nutrients</em> paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Furthermore, in terms of protein content, taro differs from other root crops as it contains two important types of protein: G1 (a mannose-binding lectin) and G2 (a trypsin inhibitor) [43]. Therefore, taro constitutes an excellent hypoallergenic food and a possible substitute for people with food allergies because of its low protein content and gluten-free composition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>MDPI said a correction to acknowledge Saxby&#8217;s work is “necessary” and “under preparation.”</p>



<p>Saxby declined to comment further.</p>

I am incredibly fortunate to have been a researcher in this field for over a decade now, and during this time I have built many professional relationships and collaborations internationally. I think many would agree that this conference provided all of us in this community with a great opportunity to reconnect in person with likeminded friends who live on different continents. The sense of camaraderie and shared commitment to advancing traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) makes these gatherings particularly meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any talks that piqued your interest?</strong></p>
<p>The session titled “NIH Open Access Repositories: How Can They Be Leveraged to Advance Whole Person Health Research?” was of particular interest to me. This session focused on the recent efforts by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to promote open science through the 2023 Data Management and Sharing Policy, highlighting several open access repositories. The session provided an insightful overview of the various repositories, such as those integrating data on anatomy, histology, physiology, and computational modeling to advance our understanding of peripheral organ systems. Another talk discussed a platform that strengthens knowledge of the biological basis of acupoints, which is crucial for integrating acupuncture into clinical care. Additionally, there was an engaging discussion on a database for noninvasive neuroimaging and how these repositories collectively contribute to understanding whole person health. As someone who is deeply interested in open science and who sees its value, I was glad to see that work in this area is being furthered by the NIH, and in particular, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is an aspect of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine that is currently being overlooked by the community?</strong></p>
<p>One aspect of TCIM that I believe is currently being overlooked by the community is the value of open science and meta-research. These practices hold serious potential for advancing the field of TCIM, yet in my view, they remain underutilized.</p>
<p>Open science practices, such as study registration, adherence to reporting guidelines, data sharing, preprinting, and open access publishing, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422024000271?via%3Dihub">can greatly benefit our field of TCIM research.</a> These practices improve research quality, increase public trust, accelerate innovation, and enhance evidence-based decision-making. Despite the growing acceptance of open science in broader medical research, its application in TCIM research has to date been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301251">limited in both understanding and application. </a></p>
<p>Embracing open science can transform the development, dissemination, and implementation of evidence based TCIM, leading to more robust and transparent research outcomes. Similarly, meta-research—or the study of research itself—offers a crucial opportunity to evaluate and improve the quality of TCIM research. Key areas of focus include study design, research methodology, reporting guidelines, research ethics, reproducibility/replicability, peer review practices, and funding. By systematically examining these aspects through meta-research initiatives we can maintain public trust, safeguard research integrity, and advance evidence based TCIM practices.</p>
<p>It must also be acknowledged that challenges associated with implementing open science and meta-research exist, such as data privacy concerns, limited resources, and respect for traditional knowledge. I believe these challenges are not insurmountable, however, as strategies such as ethical guidelines, education programs, funding advocacy, interdisciplinary dialogue, and patient engagement can each help to overcome these obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel publishing can better support the field of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine?</strong></p>
<p>Publishing can better support the field of TCIM by also adopting open science and meta-research practices. These approaches are not limited to just researchers and their research; publishers can—and, in my view, should—play a crucial role in their implementation and promotion.</p>
<p>Open access publishing is essential for making research findings widely accessible. Open access journals promote transparency and inclusivity by ensuring that research is freely available, which aligns well with the patient-centered and holistic approach of TCIM. This accessibility benefits patients, healthcare providers, and the broader scientific community, who may not have the means to afford research held behind a subscription paywall.</p>
<p>However, the open access model also has its challenges, such as the risk of low-quality journals that inadequately vet the contents of manuscript submissions and exploit the model for financial gain by charging high article processing fees.</p>
<p>More generally speaking, open access comprises a small portion of open science. I recently conducted an audit of open science practices among TCIM journals; our findings would suggest that TCIM journals provide minimal guidelines to encourage or require authors to adhere to open science practices and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302655">there is an opportunity to improve the use of open science practices in the field.</a></p>
<p>Moreover, peer review and journal editorial practices are critical for maintaining the quality and integrity of research publications. Meta-research can evaluate and improve the effectiveness and reliability of peer review processes and editorial practices in TCIM journals. This involves examining the transparency of peer review procedures, the expertise of reviewers, and the consistency of editorial decision-making. Identifying and addressing potential biases, conflicts of interest, and inefficiencies in these areas can enhance the robustness and credibility of TCIM research publications.</p>
<p>By promoting transparency, accountability, and high standards in peer review and editorial practices, publishers can help uphold research rigour and foster greater trust in TCIM research dissemination. Implementing open science practices, such as study registration, adherence to reporting guidelines, data sharing, and preprinting, further supports these goals by improving research quality and increasing public trust.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging fields and topics in of traditional, complementary, and integrative that we should keep an eye out on?</strong></p>
<p>While not directly related to TCIM itself, over recent years one field that the world has seen to be leading in innovation is artificial intelligence (AI). Like any other medical field, it is inevitable that AI is going to have large impacts on the field of TCIM, and its convergence represents a promising frontier in healthcare. AI technologies have the potential to enhance TCIM by facilitating data-driven decision-making and personalized treatment plans. This alignment can potentially improve patient outcomes, enhance care quality, and promote holistic wellness.</p>
<p>AI has already been proposed to augment TCIM in several ways. Such as potentially assisting in early disease detection, potentially providing personalized treatment plans, predicting health trends, and enhancing patient engagement. We are already beginning to see some of this come to fruition in real time. For instance, AI algorithms have the potential to analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, identifying patterns and insights that might not be apparent through traditional methods. This has the potential to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422024000040">lead to more accurate diagnoses and more effective, individualized treatment strategies</a>.</p>
<p>All things considered, I remain cautious about the integration of AI into TCIM as it also presents several challenges. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, as is navigating the complex regulatory landscape surrounding AI in healthcare. Especially pertinent to many TCIM practitioners, maintaining the human touch in patient-provider relationships is crucial, and I think many would argue that AI should complement rather than replace the personal interactions that are central to TCIM modalities. Additionally, mitigating bias in AI algorithms is essential to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all patients. Addressing the associated challenges and fostering collaboration between AI experts, TCIM practitioners, and policymakers will be vital to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422024000040">harnessing the full potential of this intersection of fields</a>.</p>
