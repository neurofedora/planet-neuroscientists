                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/word-cloud-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong><em>BMC Ecology and Evolution &#8211;</em> <a href="https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-022-02089-4">Land use and soil characteristics affect soil organisms differently from above-ground assemblages</a></strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13111 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/EcoEvo.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />This week almost 200 countries signed a historic deal at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal in a big push to halt our planet’s biodiversity loss by 2030. This deal includes plans to restore 30% of earth’s degraded terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. While this is a great step into the right direction, understanding all parts of ecosystem loss is important to implement the right actions. Soil biodiversity (the variety of organisms that live in soil and leaf litter) has been notoriously underrepresented in biodiversity indicators like the Living Planet Index, despite its fundamental role in soil health, water purification and carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>In this study published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution,</em> researchers modelled abundances of above-ground and soil organisms in different land uses and soil properties based on data from the <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/biodiversity/predicts.html">PREDICTS</a> project. This project analyzes ecological data on the human impact &#8211; particularly related to land use change and intensification &#8211; on changing biodiversity. Their results show that soil biodiversity responds differently to land use than above-ground organisms. For instance, soil biodiversity is much more impacted by high-intensity farming and recovers much more slowly from clear felling and reforestation with different tree species than above-ground organisms.</p>
<p>This study highlights the need to find more sustainable ways to feed a rapidly growing population without impacting soil biodiversity. In addition, off-setting carbon with plantation forests should be weighed against the risk of losing healthy soil biodiversity, required to underpin ecosystem function. More research is needed to understand the complexities of soil biodiversity, ecology, and the interplay between below- and above-ground communities.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Genomics</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-022-08963-1">Genomic trajectories of a near-extinction event in the Chatham Island black robin</a></strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13112 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/Genomics.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As species extinction accelerates at unprecedented rate, finding reliable ways to protect endangered species has become one of the top priorities of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Critically endangered species pose a particular challenge as inbreeding in small populations can lead to the accumulation of harmful mutations and reduced fitness. Eventually this may either cause extinction due to a so-called “mutational meltdown” or enhance natural selection by more efficiently reducing harmful mutations in offspring – a process called genetic purging.</p>
<p>In this study, published in <em>BMC Genomics, </em>researchers used the critically endangered Chatham Island black robin as a model to obtain insights into the genomic impact of near-extinction events. This bird was driven to near extinction due to habitat fragmentation and introduction of rats, with a population size of 5 individuals in 1976. Conservation efforts managed to increase the population number, with a total of 25 birds in 2021, all of which were descendants of a single breeding pair. Comparing the genome of 52 Chatham Island black robin genomes over the span of 150 years the researchers found evidence of a decrease in genome-wide diversity and an increase in mutational load. Some of the results also support the loss of harmful mutations through genetic purging, which may have been a side-effect of early habitat fragmentation.</p>
<p>The genetic mechanisms described in this paper are important factors to consider in conservation biology and genetic management of threatened species. The authors suggest that when it comes to future conservation efforts, individuals with the lowest mutational load should be selected to maximize breeding success.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01778-4">Applying the 4Ps of social marketing to retain and engage participants in longitudinal cohort studies: generation 2 Raine study participant perspectives</a></strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13114 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/MRM.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />The Raine Study is one of the largest prospective longitudinal cohort studies, established in 1989 in Australia. The aim of this study was to investigate how events during pregnancy and early childhood affect people’s adult health and disease. In the first recruitment phase, 2,900 pregnant women (Generation 1) were included and their resultant 2,868 births were followed up with as Generation 2. Multi-generational long-term studies are invaluable for our understanding of human health and disease and can help shape policies and medical practice further down the line. But how do we retain participants over such a long period of time?</p>
<p>In this qualitative study published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology,</em> researchers describe the experience of active and inactive participants of Generation 2 in relation to the so-called 4Ps &#8211; Product, Price, Place and Promotion &#8211; of social marketing. Social marketing uses commercial marketing principles to influence people’s behaviors for their own or society’s benefit. Based on participant responses, researchers could define the Raine Study’s product as regular health check-ups for participants and the feeling of contributing to the greater good. These beneficial products came at the price of “feeling like a lab rat” and the inconvenience of repeatedly completing surveys and questionnaires. Having to attend the Raine Study headquarters for regular check-ups (place) was mentioned as an inconvenience that could deter participants from actively participating in the study. However, the biggest promotional asset for active members was the feeling of being part of the “Raine Study family” and its associated purpose, prestige, and importance.</p>
<p>The social marketing framework described in this paper illustrates how researchers can create a deeper understanding of how participants perceive cost and benefit accrued through their participation in longitudinal studies. This in turn can help to specifically target these issues and retain participants over a longer period of time.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirt</em><em>h</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-022-05225-6">The human right to safely give birth: data from 193 countries show that gender equality does affect maternal mortality</a></strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13115 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/PC.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="200" />Due to a big effort to improve child survival, numbers of neonatal deaths dropped worldwide by more than 50% over the past 3 decades. In contrast, maternal mortality is still unacceptably high and in the majority of cases completely preventable. Most maternal deaths occur in low-income countries which greatly reflects inequalities in access to appropriate healthcare. But this is only part of the picture. Research has shown that gender inequality plays a major role in maternal health outcomes.</p>
<p>In this article, published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,</em> researchers examine the correlation between gender equality and the reduction of maternal mortality using 512 gender-sensitive variables representing 193 countries. Their results show a clear reduction in the maternal mortality ratio with an increase in gender equality. Female education is an important marker for gender equality and positively influences other crucial factors, including the use of contraception and financial independence. In addition, women in leadership and political positions have an irrefutable impact on maternal health. Not surprisingly, child marriage, intimate partner violence and lack of autonomy have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>This article clearly identifies the variables that play a role in improving maternal health and can be used to monitor progress in this field. Addressing gender equality through women’s education and empowerment are at the forefront of improving maternal health. In addition, the authors recommend reinforcing policies and laws aimed at eliminating child marriage and intimate partner violence.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13113 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/METH.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a useful and cost-efficient tool to assist healthcare professionals in medical decision-making. The applications of AI in the medical field are broad and reach from interpreting images in pathology and radiology to identifying patients for clinical trials or analyzing genetic data. While this is a clear advancement for the medical field, an important question remains to be tackled: do we trust medical AI?</p>
<p>This qualitative study published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics </em>explores the question of under which conditions we trust AI, from the developers&#8217; and clinical users&#8217; perspective. In this study, researchers interviewed members of the Minerva Initiative, a consortium of commercial, clinical, and academic researchers who work on computational phenotyping using facial recognition algorithms. This study found that trust in the reliability and quality of the tool is crucial from both the clinicians&#8217; and the patients&#8217; side. The tools need to work well and produce reliable and validated results. Over time the clinician’s positive experience will be directly influence the patient’s trust in the AI tools.</p>
<p>This study emphasizes the need for deliberate and meticulous steps in designing trustworthy and confidence-worthy AI processes. The authors suggest that randomized controlled trials or increased transparency would help signify the epistemic trustworthiness of these tools.</p>

<p>Remember the paper that made the rounds on Twitter after readers discovered that the error bars in one of its figures were really just capital Ts?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, it’s now been retracted, with the notice citing “concerns about the article’s scientific reliability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Error bars are supposed to express the statistical uncertainty of a measurement depicted in a graph, but the ones in this paper appeared to be capital letter Ts pasted on for looks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we mentioned in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/05/a-paper-used-capital-ts-instead-of-error-bars-but-wait-theres-more/">previous post</a>, the error bars were just the most obvious strange thing about the paper, “<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2022/3802603/">Monitoring of Sports Health Indicators Based on Wearable Nanobiosensors</a>,” which was published earlier this year in a special issue of the Hindawi journal <em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126263"></span>



<p>The journal published an expression of concern for the paper on December 1, days after the error bars attracted attention that led to readers finding other oddities in the article, saying that the publisher “is investigating these concerns and will revisit this article with any necessary post-publication amendments.”</p>



<p>On December 19, the journal published the following retraction <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2022/9758123/">notice</a>, which acknowledged that one of the issues a reader spotted was its own fault:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Advances in Materials Science and Engineering</em> has retracted the article titled “Monitoring of Sports Health Indicators Based on Wearable Nanobiosensors” [1]. Since publication, readers have raised concerns that the error bars in Figure 9 appear to be the letter “T.” Moreover, it has been noted that the authors state that “no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study” which is contradictory to the study described. This therefore raises questions about the reliability of the underlying data and the article’s conclusions.</p>



<p>The article includes several instances where different sections are clearly unrelated. For instance, as the survey collecting information on the fitness activity of elderly people in Jilin province is not well described, it is unclear how it relates to the research on nanomaterials and wearable biosensors. Furthermore, several references cited do not support the article and have been found to be irrelevant. Of note, in addition to not being relevant to the corresponding text, reference [16] was retracted prior to the submission of the current article due to containing nonsensical content [2].</p>



<p>Finally, we would like also to acknowledge that a reader raised concerns that an incorrect notation was used in Equations (13) and (14); however, upon review, this appears to be an error made during the production process. The Publisher apologizes for this error.</p>



<p>The authors did not respond to our summary of the concerns nor our request to provide the original data and ethics approval documentation. After careful assessment of the concerns raised, we have concerns about the article’s scientific reliability and are therefore retracting.</p>



<p>The authors agree to the retraction and the notice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-glass-frogs-blood-liver">Sleeping glass frogs hide by storing most of their blood in their liver</a></h4>

              
                <p>As tiny glass frogs fall asleep for the day, they take almost 90 percent of their red blood cells out of circulation.</p>



<p>The colorful cells cram into hideaway pockets inside the frog liver, which disguises the cells behind a mirrorlike surface, a new study finds. Biologists have known that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glass-frog-wears-its-heart-all-see">glass frogs</a> have translucent skin, but temporarily hiding bold red blood brings a new twist to vertebrate camouflage (<em>SN: 6/23/17</em>).</p>



<p>“The heart stopped pumping red, which is the normal color of blood, and only pumped a bluish liquid,” says evolutionary biochemist Carlos Taboada of Duke University, one of the discoverers of the hidden blood.</p>





<p>What may be even more amazing to humans — prone to circulatory sludge and clogs — is that the frogs&nbsp;hold almost all their red blood cells packed together for hours with no blood clots, says co-discoverer Jesse Delia, now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Wake the frog up, and cells just unpack themselves and get circulating again.</p>



<p>Hiding those red blood cells can <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl6620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double or triple the transparency of glass frogs</a>, Taboada, Delia and colleagues report in the Dec. 23 <em>Science</em>. That greenish transparency can matter a lot for the snack-sized frogs, which spend the day hiding like little shadows on the undersides of the leaves high in the forest canopy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122122_SM_transparent-frog_inline-675x450.png" alt="A photo on the left showing a sleeping female glass frog with most of her red blood cells tucked into her liver.

<p>What got Delia wondering about transparency was a photo emergency. He had studied glass frog behavior, but had never even seen them asleep. “They go to bed, I go to bed — that was my life for years,” he says. When he needed some charismatic portraits, however, he put some frogs in lab dishes and at last saw how the animals sleep the day away.</p>



<p>“It was really obvious that I couldn’t see any red blood in the circulatory system,” Delia says. “I shot a video of it — it was crazy.”</p>



<p>As he pitched his project to a Duke University lab for support, he was stunned&nbsp;to discover that another young researcher was pitching the same lab to study transparency in glass frogs. “I was like, oh, man,” Delia says. But the leader of the biological optics lab at Duke,&nbsp;Sönke Johnsen, told Delia and his rival, Taboada, that they had different skill sets and should tackle the problem together. “I think we were hardheaded at first,” Delia says. “Now I consider him as close as family.”</p>





<p>To show what red blood cells do in living frogs made a tough puzzle. Light microscopy wouldn’t work for seeing through the mirrorlike outer tissue of the liver. Nor would anything that woke up the frogs (<em>Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni</em>), because the red blood cells would rush out through the body. Even anesthetizing the frogs kept the liver trick from working.</p>



<p>The answer Delia and Taboada found comes from a technique called photoacoustic imaging, mostly used by engineers. It reveals hidden interiors thanks to the subtle vibrations created by light striking various molecules and causing slight energy releases. Duke’s&nbsp;Junjie Yao joined team glass frog to tailor the technique to frog livers, taking special care not to wake the animals in the process.</p>

<p>Despite glass frogs’ name, transparency among vertebrates can get much more extreme, says fish biologist Sarah Friedman of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. She <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahtfried/status/1538596561738903552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted an image</a> in June of a newly caught blotched snailfish (<em>Crystallichthys cyclospilus</em>), clear enough in most of its body to show flesh tones and finger lines in her hand as she cradled it. And that’s not even the best example. The larval stages of tarpon fish and eels, glassfishes and a kind of Asian glass catfish “are almost perfectly transparent,” says Friedman, who wasn’t involved in the new study.</p>



<p>But these marvels have the advantage of living in water, she says. Evolving exquisite glassiness is easier where there’s not as sharp a visible difference between animals’ bodies and their watery homes. Still, having a transparent body is pretty cool, on land or sea.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-weather-climate-change-2022">Extreme weather in 2022 showed the global impact of climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was another shattering year.</p>



<p>Climate change amped up weather extremes around the globe, smashing temperature records, sinking river levels to historic lows and raising rainfall to devastating highs. Droughts set the stage for wildfires and worsened food insecurity. Researchers found themselves pondering <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">the limits of humans’ ability to tolerate extreme heat</a> (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>The extreme events from 2022 pinpointed on the map below are just a sample of this year’s climate disasters. Each was exacerbated by human-caused climate change or is in line with projections of regional impacts.</p>





<p>In its Sixth Assessment Report, released in 2021 and 2022, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, warned that humans are dramatically overhauling Earth’s climate (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). Earth’s average surface temperature <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already risen by at least 1.1 degree Celsius</a>&nbsp;since preindustrial times, thanks to human inputs of heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide and methane (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). That warming has shifted the flow of energy around the planet, altering weather patterns, raising sea levels and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-extreme-heat-wave-past-climate-new-normal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turning past extremes into new normals</a> (<em>SN: 2/1/22</em>).</p>



<p>And the world will have to weather more such climate extremes as carbon keeps accumulating in the atmosphere and global temperatures continue to rise. But IPCC scientists and others hope that, by highlighting the regional and local effects of climate change, the world will ramp up its efforts to reduce climate-warming emissions — averting a more disastrous future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/io-magma-ocean-hot-metal-core-jupiter">Io may have an underworld magma ocean or a hot metal heart</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> — An entire ocean of liquid magma, or maybe a hot heart of solid metal, may lurk in Io’s underworld.</p>



<p>The surface of Jupiter’s innermost moon is covered in scorching lava lakes and gored by hundreds of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/three-volcanic-eruptions-rock-jupiters-moon-io">active volcanoes</a>, some spitting molten rock dozens of kilometers high (<em>SN: 8/6/14</em>). Over the years, the moon’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/io-jupiter-moon-lava-frost-mystery-lumps-dunes">restless, mesmerizing hellscape</a> has attracted the attention of many planetary scientists (<em>SN: 5/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>Now, researchers are digging into the nature of Io’s infernal interior to explain what is driving the spectacular volcanism on the moon’s fiery surface. “It’s the most volcanically active place in the solar system,” says planetary scientist Samuel Howell of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “But it’s not really clear where that energy comes from.”</p>





<p>Researchers generally agree that Io gets most of its energy from a gravitational tug-of-war between its parent planet Jupiter and its sibling moon Europa. Those grand forces pull on Io’s rocky body, generating tremendous frictional heat in its interior. But how that heat is stored and moved around remains a mystery.</p>



<p>One explanation is that Io’s netherworld may house <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1200202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an enormous ocean of liquid magma</a>, planetary scientist David Stevenson of Caltech said December 15 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. Though the exact size of the proposed molten sea remains uncertain, it would need to be relatively large, he said. “The magma ocean could be, say, 100 kilometers thick.”</p>



<p>In 2011, researchers reported that Io’s mantle couldn’t be completely solid. Magnetic measurements of Io from the Galileo spacecraft indicated there must be an electrically conductive layer inside the moon. A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1201425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global underground layer containing molten rock</a>, the scientists wrote, would fit the bill. &nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="451" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-451x450.jpg" alt="An infrared image of Io with hot spots speckling the surface." class="wp-image-3120540" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-451x450.jpg 451w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-384x383.jpg 384w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-187x186.jpg 187w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-582x580.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022_no_Io-magma-ocean_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120540">Hot spots speckle the surface of the volcanic moon Io in this infrared image captured by NASA’s Juno spacecraft on July 5, 2022, when the spacecraft was about 80,000 kilometers from the moon.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120540">JPL-Caltech/NASA, SwRI, ASI, INAF, JIRAM</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But the researchers couldn’t tell whether that layer would consist of a continuous sea of magma or many little pockets of molten rock dispersed throughout solid rock, resembling a soggy sponge.</p>



<p>Building off that previous work, Stevenson and Caltech geophysicist Yoshinori Miyazaki calculated that a mixed layer of magma and solid rock beneath Io’s crust would be fundamentally unstable under the amount of heating they predict occurs inside the moon. The molten rock and solid rock would split into distinct layers, with the molten rock coalescing into a subsurface sea, Stevenson said. “The final conclusion is [that] Io has a magma ocean.”</p>





<p>But there are other possibilities. “A lot of information is consistent with a large, global conductive layer that could be a magma ocean,” Howell says. “But I wouldn’t say there’s consensus on how to interpret that data.”</p>



<p>Instead, the truth may lie within Io’s heart, where <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1048370" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a core made of solid metal may lurk</a>, Howell reported December 15 at the meeting. Previous research has suggested that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JE006473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Io has a core rich in metals</a>. Howell and colleagues calculate that a metal core that’s about as rigid as solid ice and a rocky mantle as viscous as Earth’s could fully dispense the immense quantities of heat that Io is estimated to emit. That would fulfill the energy-shedding role of a magma ocean.</p>



<p>Future measurements collected by NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-juno-jupiter-moons-mission">ongoing Juno mission</a> as well two future spacecraft — NASA’s Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency’s JUICE — may provide the data needed to determine whether either, or some combination, of the hypotheses is correct, Stevenson and Howell said (<em>SN: 12/15/22</em>). Until then, the mystery of what dwells in Io’s dark depths may have to remain in purgatory.</p>

                <p><em>Science News</em> drew over 13 million visitors to our website this year. Here’s a recap of the most-read news stories and long reads of 2022.</p>



<h4>Top news stories</h4>



<h5>1. A special brew may have calmed Inca children headed for sacrifice</h5>



<p>The mummified remains of two Inca children ritually sacrificed more than 500 years ago contain chemical clues to their final days and weeks. On the journey to the Peruvian mountain where they were sacrificed, the children <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-children-sacrifice-ayahuasca-chemical">may have chewed coca leaves and drunk a beverage</a> with antidepressant-like ingredients to soothe their nerves (<em>SN: 6/4/22, p. 10</em>).</p>





<h5>2. A ‘mystery monkey’ in Borneo may be a rare hybrid. That has scientists worried</h5>



<p>An unusual monkey first spotted six years ago appears to be a cross between a female silvered leaf monkey (<em>Trachypithecus cristatus</em>) and a male proboscis monkey (<em>Nasalis larvatus</em>). The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-monkey-hybrid-borneo-habitat">possible cross-genera pairing</a> has scientists worried because such matings are usually a sign that species are facing ecological pressures (<em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 11</em>).</p>



<h5>3. What experts told me to do after my positive COVID-19 at-home test</h5>



<p>After <em>Science News</em> intern Anna Gibbs came down with COVID-19, she <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">turned to health experts</a> to figure out how to report her case to public health officials and how long she needed to isolate (<em>SN Online: 4/22/22</em>).</p>



<h5>4. All of the bases in DNA and RNA have now been found in meteorites</h5>





<p>Here’s more evidence that life’s precursors could have come from space. All five of the nucleobases that store information in DNA and RNA have been discovered in meteorites. This year, scientists reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">detecting cytosine and thymine in fallen space rocks</a>, completing the list (<em>SN: 6/4/22, p. 7</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Humans may not be able to handle as much heat as scientists thought</h5>



<p>For years, it was thought the human body can tolerate heat up to a “wet bulb” temperature — a measure combining humidity and air temperature — of 35° Celsius (95° Fahrenheit). But experiments <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">hint that the threshold may be several degrees lower</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/22, p. 6</em>).</p>

<p>In 1992, two astronomers discovered a doughnut-shaped region far beyond Neptune, dubbed the Kuiper Belt, that’s home to a swarm of frozen objects left over from the solar system’s formation. By studying these far-off objects over the last 30 years, scientists have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-discovery-solar-system-planets-space">gained new insights into how planets form</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/22, p. 22</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Clovis hunters’ reputation as mammoth killers takes a hit</h5>



<p>Ancient Americans may have been big-game scavengers rather than big-game hunters. Some recent analyses suggest that Clovis stone points <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clovis-hunter-stone-points-mammoth-kill-north-america">were more likely tools for butchering large carcasses than weapons</a> for taking down mammoths and other large animals (<em>SN: 1/15/22, p. 22</em>).</p>

<p>Dear Retraction Watch readers, we have some exciting news to share.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.woodnext.org/">WoodNext Foundation</a> has awarded The Center For Scientific Integrity, our parent 501(c)3 nonprofit, a two-year $250,000 grant that will allow us to add another editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The WoodNext Foundation is the philanthropy of tech innovator and Roku CEO/founder Anthony Wood and his wife Susan, and its mission is “to advance human progress and remove obstacles to a fulfilling life.”</p>



<p>With the grant, we have hired <a href="http://joelving.com/pages/about.php">Frederik Joelving</a>, an experienced investigative reporter focused on health and science, and added to our freelance budget. Joelving, who is based in Copenhagen, will start on January 3. His award-winning work has had a big impact, including a ban by the Indian government on lucrative but troubling sales practices by drugmakers.</p>



<span id="more-126259"></span>



<p>Joelving joins Ellie Kincaid on our small journalism team. Bulking up our reporting resources will allow us to cover more stories, do deeper investigations, and partner with larger news outlets to reach a wider audience.</p>



<p>Thank you, WoodNext Foundation, and thank you to all those who’ve supported us, critiqued us, sent us tips, contributed financially, and much, much more. We’re eager to begin this new chapter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/">2022 PLOS accomplishments</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was a banner year for PLOS. We set some ambitious objectives and worked diligently and passionately in achieving them. And, our goals all have one core question: how can we best serve researchers and the scholarly publishing ecosystem in which they work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some highlights:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/#expand">Our new journals, launched to address global issues like climate change, published more than 1,000 papers</a></li><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/#advance">We just published our first dataset on our Open Science Indicators, a new initiative that will help us surface and understand researcher practices with regards to sharing data and code, among other Open Science practices&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/#partner">We set up PLOS entities across the globe and formed relationships with stakeholders within local research ecosystems</a></li><li><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/2022-plos-accomplishments/#remove">We doubled the number of our institutional partnerships</a></li></ul>



<p>As you can see, our goals can be placed in broad categories: expanding and accelerating our journal offerings, advancing Open Science adoption, establishing a more global presence, expanding our institutional partnerships and creating efficiencies in our infrastructure.</p>



<h2 id="expand"><strong>Expand and accelerate journal offerings</strong></h2>



<p>Two years ago, we made a momentous decision to expand our journal portfolio. We had not launched a journal since 2007, when we introduced <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>. But as we considered how best to effect change in communicating research, we saw an opportunity to work with communities to co-create opportunities for Open Science. Launching more focused journals like PLOS Water enables us to address the challenges facing researchers in those fields. Our journal offerings were prioritized by titles in which Open Science could have the greatest impact in increasing the visibility of research to key stakeholders and facilitating an exchange of knowledge across disciplines studying social, economic, and ethical aspects of some of the world&rsquo;s biggest challenges. In 2022, the journals[1] began publishing their <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/plos-sustainability-and-transformation-publishes-first-papers/">first papers</a>.&nbsp; We are happy to announce that collectively these five journals have already published over 1,000 papers.</p>



<h2 id="advance"><strong>Advancing Open Science</strong></h2>



<p>Our journals are not static. We continue to innovate every year and provide our authors with new opportunities for openness. While PLOS is a publisher first, we also have a mission to change the scholarly ecosystem, and the way we best achieve this aim is through our Open Science offerings and practices. Our goal in 2022 was to increase adoption of Open Science practices around data, methods (such as code and protocols), and preprints, especially in disciplinary communities with diverse geographic representation.</p>



<p>To help us reach our goals, we partnered with<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/"> DataSeer,</a> who are collaborating with us to create a suite of&nbsp; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">Open Science Indicators,</a> which will enable us all to understand how Open Science is being practiced. We recently released the <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">first set of Open Science Indicators results</a>, and are seeking feedback from the community on their development. We&rsquo;re studying PLOS content from 2019 onwards, as well as a comparator set of 6,000 publicly-available research articles from PubMed Central. These indicators will initially focus on three Open Science practices, expanding to other practices in 2023:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Data sharing: </strong>As part of a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">project funded by the Wellcome Trust</a>, we are experimenting with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">solutions</a> designed to increase sharing and discovery of research data. Earlier this year we launched a solution intended to promote the use of data repositories for data sharing and the linking of data to publications. It&rsquo;s an <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">&lsquo;Accessible Data&rsquo; feature</a> deployed on articles that link to research data in one of several repositories. This complements our dryad integration, which allows authors at PLOS Pathogens to deposit data in the Dryad repository for free, right from our submission system.</li><li><strong>Code sharing: </strong>We shared <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010193">the results</a> of the first year of <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s mandatory code sharing policy, which showed rates of code sharing in the journal have reached 86% since the policy was introduced. In addition, PLOS <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13933/">published research</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19122611">supporting data</a> on research conducted to understand the needs and habits of researchers in relation to code sharing and reuse as well as to gather feedback on prototype code notebooks and help determine strategies that publishers could use to increase code sharing. You can learn more about our findings in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/which-solutions-best-support-sharing-and-reuse-of-code/">this blog</a>.</li><li><strong>Preprint posting: </strong>We expanded our commitment to preprints with facilitated posting to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-extend-partnership-to-accelerate-preprint-sharing-in-medicine/">medRxiv</a> this year, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/plos-announces-partnership-with-eartharxiv/">EarthArXiv</a>&nbsp;in early 2023. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52646">Research</a> suggests that early sharing via preprint is associated with increased attention and citations for the corresponding peer-reviewed publication. In addition, we are engaged with the evolving landscape of preprint review through our participation in <a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</a>. We&rsquo;ve now published more than 150 articles submitted through this initiative, which makes the review process more efficient and reduces overall burden on the reviewer pool.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Other Open Science progress</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, PLOS shared <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/7jxav/">the results</a> of a first-of-its-kind survey that aimed to understand researchers&rsquo; practices and priorities around sharing detailed methods information, such as <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/11/how-do-researchers-really-feel-about-methods-sharing/">protocols</a>. We also <a href="https://everyone.plos.org/2022/06/16/protocol-entry-service-expanded-to-all-lab-protocol-authors/">expanded the protocol entry service</a> available to authors of Lab Protocols, who can now get support for formatting step-by-step protocols on protocols.io at no charge and at any stage of the writing or review process, even prior to submission.</p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; journal offerings and Open Science aims all ensure that research quality, rigor and integrity are at the forefront of our decisions. This is exemplified by our (<em>PLOS ONE </em>and <em>PLOS Biology</em>) <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/04/partnering-with-cruk/">partnership with Cancer Research UK</a> to improve quality and reproducibility in cancer research through preregistration. Preregistration is a practice of depositing a study design with a repository (and, optionally, submitting it for peer review at a journal) <em>before </em>experimentation and data collection begin. <em>PLOS Biology</em> has now <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001611">published two registered reports, </a>and <em>PLOS ONE </em>has published 17 registered reports.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="partner"><strong>Partnering globally to drive change in research communication</strong></h2>



<p>We now have an established presence in Singapore (following establishment of a presence in Germany in 2021). These virtual entities will enable PLOS to embed ourselves in, learn from, and be influenced by, local communities. This will enable us to form networks and relationships with key stakeholders in local research ecosystems: governments, funders, policymakers, institutional leaders, as well as librarians and researchers. We are already up and running and achieving this in<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/"> Africa</a> via our partnership with TCC in Kenya.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some tangible ways that PLOS has made global progress:<br></p>



<ol><li>Key initiatives include our collaborations with high-level stakeholders in Africa, including the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/expanding-globally-listening-locally-open-science-in-africa/nce-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/">African Association of Universities</a>, and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/n-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/">East African Commission for Science &amp; Technology</a> with our partners <a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/">TCC Africa</a>. These organizations are looking to increase education and awareness around the benefits of Open Science with institutional leadership, national research councils and higher education commission, with a view to increasing Open Science policies and mandates at institutional, national and regional levels. Our work in Africa has brought the support of UNESCO and they are involved with the majority of our activities on the continent.</li><li>Our Regional Directors (in Europe and Asia) advocate for Open Science at a local level and via the networks and relationships they form, aim to advance Open Science adoption. This is Open Science adoption in its broadest sense, whether engaging with the philosophical principles of Open Science and its potential to increase equitable participation, or from a purely practical perspective. The UNESCO Open Science recommendation provides a handy (and broad) reference point here that can be applied globally.</li></ol>



<h2 id="remove"><strong>Removing barriers to Open Access publishing</strong></h2>



<p>One challenge that we&rsquo;re still tackling, and with great success, is how to fairly allocate the cost of Open Access publishing. PLOS was part of the vanguard of publishers who demonstrated that Open Access publishing could be sustainable, but we only had half the equation right because the APC business model was so biased towards highly funded regions and disciplines. In short, we weren&rsquo;t fulfilling our entire vision for an open and inclusive research ecosystem that facilitated the exchange of free and unrestricted knowledge. Anyone could read the research we published, but the cost of publishing in an Open venue was&ndash;and continues to be&ndash;a barrier for many authors. To solve that riddle without the use of subscriptions, we developed new, more equitable&nbsp; models to reduce or remove financial and administrative burdens on authors. We have models that target specific challenges in the Open Access ecosystem&mdash;keeping costs low for selective journals through <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">Community Action Publishing</a>, reflecting regional economic differences through <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a>. And our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee</a> model similarly aims to make Open Access publishing easier and more accessible for researchers while being flexible and granular enough to suit many different communities. Though we still have more work ahead of us and many more conversations to be had with research stakeholders around the world, as of today, 181 institutions in 26 countries have partnered with us, that&rsquo;s up from 93 and 6, respectively from last year.</p>



<h2 id="Infrastructure"><strong>Infrastructure progress</strong></h2>



<p>Efficiency in PLOS&rsquo; infrastructure is not a topic that stirs people&rsquo;s passion, but it&rsquo;s really important for authors in an unseen way. The more inefficiencies we remove from the publishing process, the faster we can get papers published. One of our goals this year was to improve author experience through a less time-intensive submission process.&nbsp;Papers submitted to PLOS undergo a rigorous technical check before undergoing review. We wanted to reduce friction in the technical check and formatting stages to speed up the time these papers move to review. As a result of many internal improvements, manuscripts submitted to <em>PLOS ONE</em> are assigned an Academic Editor under ten days of submission, and the time to first decision has decreased by more than 20%.</p>



<h2 id="looking-ahead"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>



<p>We are really excited for what we have in store for 2023. We&rsquo;ll have more data to share on Open Science Indicators, our partnership with EarthArXiv will take effect, and we&rsquo;ll be announcing new institutional partnerships, among other things. Watch this space for all of our updates.</p>

                <p>COVID-19 may continue to dominate headlines, but this year’s biomedical advances weren’t all about “the Rona.” 2022 saw fruitful and seemingly fantastical research that could one day mean good news for patients.</p>



<h4>Growing synthetic embryos</h4>



<p>Two reports this year revealed how to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05246-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fabricate the early stages of mammalian life</a>. With a bit of laboratory wizardry, scientists mingled mouse stem cells, which self-assembled to spawn what appears to be a kind of <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00981-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fledgling embryo</a> — no egg or sperm required. As they grow, these stem cell–derived synthetic embryos can form proto hearts, brains and guts. But the similarity to natural mouse embryos fades quickly. The synthetic and natural versions match up for only about eight days of development. Still, studying similar clusters of human stem cells might one day offer a way to probe the development of human embryos without relying on the real thing.</p>





<h4>Next-level organ transplants</h4>



<p>Organ transplants have started mirroring science fiction. In January, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">an ailing 57-year-old man received a heart from a genetically engineered pig</a> and survived for two months with the transplanted organ (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 26</em>). Other surgeries <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pig-heart-organ-transplant-brain-dead-people">plugged pig hearts into the bodies of brain-dead patients</a>, a step that prepares researchers for future clinical trials (<em>SN Online: 7/12/22</em>). And a high-tech system hooked up to pigs’ bodies an hour after death helped keep organs functioning. The technology, which might one day preserve human organs slated for surgery, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/organ-donation-pig-death-artificial-system-restored-cell-life">pumps a mix of real and artificial blood through the animals</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/22, p. 12</em>).</p>

<h4>Epstein-Barr’s link to MS</h4>



<p>Scientists dropped an Epstein-Barr bombshell early this year when they suggested that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the virus is the main cause of the neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis</a>. Infection with the virus greatly upped the odds of later developing MS, an analysis of millions of U.S. military recruits found. The link between the virus and MS, which scientists had suspected but never outlined so clearly, might guide the way to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-virus-vaccines-treatments">potential MS treatments</a> — or even, one day, vaccines to prevent the disease (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 14</em>).</p>

<h4>A complete human genome, finally</h4>



<p>Researchers announced back in 2003 that they had read all the genetic info packed into strands of human DNA — the first sequence of the human genome. But that genome was not quite complete; some tangled-up lengths of DNA remained difficult to decipher. This year, a team tied up the loose ends. In March, the researchers reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">a new and improved human genome</a> — this time, complete from end to end (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 6</em>).</p>

<h4>AI predicts protein structures</h4>



<p>Artificial intelligence has taken structural biology to warp speed. A deep-learning program called AlphaFold has now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alphafold-ai-protein-structure-folding-prediction">predicted the 3-D shapes of more than 200 million proteins</a> (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 16</em>). Though the shapes are not lab-verified structures, the massive dataset could help researchers studying health and disease in all sorts of organisms, from humans to honeybees. Now, looking up a protein’s predicted structure is almost as easy as typing it into Google, according to the cofounder of the AI company that created AlphaFold.</p>

<p><strong>A perfect ending for the final Apollo</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/perfect-ending-final-apollo">Science News</a></em>, December 23, 1972</p>



<p>Project Apollo ended this week. The last moon men … returned to Earth … and splashed down on a target in the Pacific Dec. 19.… All of the surface and orbital instruments appear to be working with the exception of the surface gravimeter.… The geology investigation team summed it up this way: “Apollo 17 will be remembered as the most scientifically sophisticated, not as the last, manned lunar landing.”</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The Apollo missions continue adding to our knowledge of the moon and Earth. Scientists have used lunar soil samples collected by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-dirt-plants-farming-regolith">Apollo astronauts</a> to show that growing plants on the moon, while challenging, may be possible (<em>SN: 7/2/22, p. 4</em>). In May, NASA researchers began scrutinizing<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/apollo-17-lunar-samples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> untouched lunar rock and soil samples from the Apollo 17 mission</a> for hints of past moon conditions and the chemicals crucial for life. Then in November, a new era of moon missions dawned with the launch of NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">Artemis I mission</a>. NASA hopes to land humans on the moon in 2025 to pick up where Apollo 17 astronauts left off.</p>

<p>What retractions grabbed the most attention in 2022?</p>



<p>As we&#8217;ve now done <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/top-10-retractions-of-2013-38213">for a decade</a>, we took a look through the year&#8217;s stories about retractions for our friends at <em>The Scientist </em>and gathered the ten that seemed to most capture the limelight. As we write there, the cases ranged from &#8220;typo-laden code in psychedelics research to paper mills and plagiarism.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/record-breaking-science-discoveries-2022">Here are 5 record-breaking science discoveries from 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>New scientific records are set every year, and 2022 was no exception. A bacterial behemoth, a shockingly speedy supercomputer and a close-by black hole are among the most notable superlatives of the year.</p>



<h4>Earliest surgery</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amputation-surgery-oldest-fossil-borneo">first known surgical operation was a leg amputation</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 5</em>). That’s the conclusion researchers came to after investigating the skeleton of a person who lived on the Indonesian island of Borneo about 31,000 years ago. Healed bone where the lower left leg had been removed suggests the individual survived for several years after the procedure. The discovery pushes surgery’s origin back by some 20,000 years.</p>





<h4>Biggest single-celled bacterium</h4>



<p>Bacteria normally dwell in the microscopic world. Not <em>Thiomargarita magnifica</em>. Averaging about a centimeter long, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-eukaryote-thiomargarita-magnifica-namibiensis-largest-bacterium">this newfound bacterium is visible to the naked eye</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 17</em>). <em>T. magnifica</em>, which lives in the mangrove forests of the Caribbean’s Lesser Antilles, is about 50 times larger than other species of big bacteria and about 5,000 times larger than typical bacteria. Why this species evolved into such a giant is unknown.</p>

<h4>Fastest supercomputer</h4>



<p>A supercomputer named Frontier crunched numbers with mind-blowing speed this year: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercomputer-exascale-frontier-speed-record-computing-calculations">1.1 quintillion operations per second</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/1/22</em>). That makes the machine, run by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the first exascale computer — a computer that can perform at least 10<sup>18</sup> operations per second. The next fastest computer tops out at 442 quadrillion (that’s 10<sup>15</sup>) operations per second. Exascale computing is expected to lead to breakthroughs in everything from climate science to health to particle physics.</p>

<h4>Largest fish colony</h4>



<p>Deep off the coast of Antarctica, icefish congregate in a breeding colony as big as Orlando, Fla. Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-fish-nest-antarctica-breeding-colony-largest-group">60 million nests of Jonah’s icefish</a> (<em>Neopagetopsis ionah</em>) stretch across at least 240 square kilometers of seafloor (<em>SN: 2/12/22, p. 12</em>). Previously, nest-building species of fish were known to gather in only the hundreds. An abundant food supply and access to a zone of unusually warm water may explain the exceptionally large group.</p>

<h4>Closest black hole </h4>



<p>By sifting through data released by the Gaia spacecraft, astrophysicists discovered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/closest-known-black-hole-to-earth">a black hole that’s just over 1,560 light-years from Earth</a> (<em>SN Online: 11/4/22</em>). Dubbed Gaia BH1, it’s about twice as close as the previously nearest known black hole. But that record may not stand. About 100 million black holes are predicted to exist in the Milky Way. Since most are invisible, they’re hard to find. But when Gaia, which is precisely mapping a billion stars, releases its next batch of data in a few years, even closer black holes may turn up.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-rna-cold-adaptation">Squid edit their RNA to keep cellular supply lines moving in the cold</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — Squid don’t have thermostats to control ocean temperatures. Instead, the cephalopods tweak RNA to adjust to frigid waters, a study suggests.</p>



<p>Usually, genetic instructions encoded in DNA are faithfully copied into messenger RNA, or mRNA, and then into proteins. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squid-edit-their-genetic-material-uniquely-weird-place">squid</a> and other soft-bodied <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cephalopods-may-have-traded-evolution-gains-extra-smarts">cephalopods edit many of their mRNAs</a> so that the resulting proteins contain some different building blocks than are inscribed in DNA (<em>SN: 3/25/20; SN: 4/6/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In these animals, 60 percent or more of their proteins are actually recoded. This is astonishing in comparison to how [rarely RNA] editing is used in mammals,” molecular biologist Kavita Rangan said December 5 at Cell Bio 2022, the annual joint meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology and the European Molecular Biology Organization.</p>





<p>Rangan, of the University of California, San Diego, examined the consequences that editing has on proteins called kinesins. Those molecular motors ferry cargo throughout cells along protein tracks called microtubules. Problems on the cellular railway can lead to cells’ disfunction or death and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prion-proteins-clog-cell-traffic-brains-neurodegenerative-diseases">may contribute to disease</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/19</em>).</p>



<p>Squid hatchlings put in chilly 6° Celsius water for a day <a href="https://plan.core-apps.com/ascbembo2022/abstract/afc643f2-d071-4dab-8868-f2d66dbc6ec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edited mRNAs for a kinesin protein</a> differently and more heavily than hatchlings placed in warm 20° C water, Rangon found.</p>



<p>She then made an unedited version and several edited versions of kinesin in the laboratory and compared the proteins’ movements on microtubules. In the cold, unedited kinesin moved more slowly, traveled shorter distances and fell off microtubule tracks more often than it did when warm.</p>



<p>Two of the edited kinesins, like those made by squid in cold water, moved a little slower than the unedited protein. But the renovated versions grabbed on to microtubules more often and had longer runs than unedited kinesin. “This suggests that recoding can allow kinesin to stay on its tracks and travel farther” in the cold, Rangan said.</p>



<p>Changing some made-on-demand RNAs instead of permanently altering DNA may give squid more flexibility to adjust to fluctuating ocean temperatures, she said.</p>

<p>The authors of a paper that proposed the Omicron variant of SARS-Cov-2 had evolved in Western Africa months before it was first detected in South Africa have retracted their study after discovering contamination in their samples, as several scientists had suggested on Twitter was the case. </p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8737">Gradual emergence followed by exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in Africa</a>,” was published in <em>Science</em> on December 1 by a team led by Jan Felix Drexler of Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after publication, many geneticists expressed skepticism on social media about the study, including questioning whether the results came from contamination during the sequencing process.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.krisp.org.za/people.php?fullName=de%20Oliveira%20T">Tulio de Oliveira</a>, director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation and the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, tweeted on December 4 about “weaknesses” in the study, including that “the quality of the sequences seems problematic”: </p>

<p>The critiques prompted the authors to revisit their data. They indeed found contamination and decided to retract the article. According to the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg2821">notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the Research Article “Gradual emergence followed by exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in Africa” (1), we reported data from retrospective characterization of viral genomes of putative ancestors of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant from Western Africa months before the first detection of Omicron. After several social media posts suggested that these putative early Omicron ancestor sequences may have been false positives, we reanalyzed our data and the residual samples. We found a mixture of different SARS-CoV-2 genomic fragments contaminating some of the samples and sequence data on which we based our analysis. The residual samples are now exhausted, and the reconstruction of evolutionary intermediates cannot be replicated. Therefore, we are retracting our Research Article. The epidemiological data are not called into question and will be made available. All authors agree with this retraction. As the consortium leaders, we sign this Retraction on behalf of all authors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We reached out to corresponding author Drexler for comment, and he didn’t immediately reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin issued a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/974952">press release</a> that said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>One of the article’s messages – that viruses with Omicron sequence signatures existed across the continent before Omicron was officially detected in South Africa – is based on collective data from PCR analysis done independently by laboratories in several African countries. However, the conclusive reconstruction of the virus’s evolution, another of the article’s key messages, is likely to be affected by sequence contamination not detected before analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contamination also makes it impossible to correct the analyses retrospectively in due time, because this would require additional analyses of thousands of patient samples from Africa that may not be available in sufficient quantity and quality. Therefore, in agreement with all the authors, the entire article is being retracted. The research group that ran the project is currently carrying out an evaluation and review of the analyses. Other research groups and projects at Charité as well as those involving the consortium of authors are not affected.</p>



<p>Prof. Drexler and his team deeply regret the incident and are grateful to their international colleagues for flagging the potential problems following the article’s publication.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-dart-artemis-space-news-2022">The James Webb Space Telescope wasn’t the only big space news in 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>While the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">stunning images</a> from the James Webb Space Telescope captured space fans’ attention this year, other telescopes and spacecraft were busy on Earth and around the solar system (<em>SN Online: 12/7/22</em>). Here are some of the coolest space highlights that had nothing to do with JWST.</p>



<h4>Back to the moon</h4>



<p>After several aborted attempts, NASA launched the Artemis I mission on November 16. That was a big step toward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">the goal of landing people on the moon</a> as early as 2025 (<em>SN: 12/3/22, p. 14</em>). No human has set foot there since 1972. Artemis I included a new rocket, the Space Launch System, which had previously suffered a series of hydrogen fuel leaks, and the new Orion spacecraft. No astronauts were aboard the test flight, but Orion carried a manikin in the commander’s seat and two manikin torsos to test radiation protection and life-support systems, plus a cargo hold full of small satellites that went off on their own missions. On December 11, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-orion-moon-spacecraft-capsule">the Orion capsule successfully returned to Earth</a>, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Mexico (<em>SN Online: 12/12/22</em>).</p>





<h4>DART shoves an asteroid</h4>



<p>NASA’s DART spacecraft successfully nudged an asteroid into a new orbit this year. On September 26, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test slammed into asteroid Dimorphos, about 11 million kilometers from Earth at the time of impact. In October, NASA announced that the impact <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">shortened Dimorphos’ roughly 12-hour orbit</a> around its sibling asteroid, Didymos, by 32 minutes (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 14</em>). Dimorphos posed no threat to Earth, but the test will help inform future missions to divert any asteroids on a potentially dangerous collision course with our home planet, researchers say.</p>

<h4>Massive Marsquakes</h4>



<p>The InSight Mars lander is going out on a high note. After scientists reported in May that InSight had recorded the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-mars-marsquake">largest known Marsquake</a>, roughly a magnitude 5, news came in October that the lander’s seismometer had also detected the rumblings of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq7704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two biggest meteorite impacts</a> ever observed on Mars. Those impacts created gaping craters and sent <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq7157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic waves rippling along the top of the planet’s crust</a>.</p>



<p>The details of how those waves and others moved through the Red Planet gave researchers new intel on the structure of Mars’ crust, which is hard to study any other way. The data also suggest that some Marsquakes are caused by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-volcanic-activity-planet-nasa-insight">magma moving beneath the surface</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/22, p. 12</em>). The solar panels that power the lander are now covered in dust after four years on Mars, a death knell for the mission.</p>

<h4>Chemistry of life turns up in meteorites</h4>



<p>All five bases in DNA and RNA have been found in rocks that fell to Earth. Three of the nucleobases, which combine with sugars and phosphates to make up the genetic material of all known life, had previously been found in meteorites. But the last two — cytosine and thymine — were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">reported from space rocks only this year</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/22, p. 7</em>). The find supports the idea that life’s precursors could have come to Earth from space, researchers say.</p>

<h4>Sagittarius A* snapshot</h4>



<p>The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way became the second black hole to get its close-up. After releasing a picture of the behemoth at the heart of galaxy M87 in 2019, astronomers used data from the Event Horizon Telescope, a network of radio telescopes around the world, to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">assemble an image of Sagittarius A*</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/22, p. 6</em>). The image, released in May, shows a faint fuzzy shadow nestled in the glowing ring of the accretion disk. That may not sound impressive on its own, but the result provides new details about the turbulence roiling near our black hole’s edge.</p>

                <p>From spiders that catapult their way to safety to sea sponges that sneeze themselves clean, here are the creature features that most impressed us in 2022.</p>



<h4>Fishing fox</h4>



<p>Pics or it didn’t happen. In the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-fox-fish-food-first-video-spain">first recorded instance of a fox fishing</a>, a team from Spain filmed a red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) catching 10 carp over a couple hours (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 4</em>). This makes foxes only the second type of canid — wolves can do it too — that are known to fish for a feast.</p>

<h4>Skydiving salamander</h4>





<p>Flying squirrels, yes, but a skydiving salamander? This bold amphibian, native to northwestern California, can jump and glide among the tops of towering redwood trees. By extending its front and hind legs like a skydiver, the wandering salamander (<em>Aneides vagrans</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wandering-salamanders-glide-trees">can control and adjust its speed and direction while in the air</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 12</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Scientists put salamanders in a vertical wind tunnel to simulate falling from a tree and filmed the animals. While falling, the wandering salamander (<em>Aneides vagrans</em>) can move horizontally (glide) in the air and slow its descent (parachute). It, like its close relative&nbsp;<em>A. lugubris</em>&nbsp;(shown in the third clip), can also move its limbs to change direction midair.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Crafty cockatoos</h4>



<p>In an interspecies battle for the ages, people in Sydney have had to up their defenses to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoo-open-trash-cans">stop cockatoos from rifling through outdoor trash bins</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 10</em>). The birds have learned to push bricks off the bin covers using brute force, while sneakers jammed through a bin’s handles are a better deterrent. But these trash thieves may eventually find a way around that blockade too.</p>

<p><em>Philoponella prominens</em> males perform a death-defying stunt to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orb-spiders-mating-male-catapult-female-sex-cannibalism">keep from being eaten by a mate after sex</a>. The orb weaver uses hydraulic pressure within its leg joints to launch nearly 90 centimeters per s­econd to safety (<em>SN Online: 4/25/22</em>).</p>

<h4>Joyriding goldfish</h4>



<p>Teach a fish to drive a motorized fish tank and it will drive wherever it wants. Goldfish taught to drive <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/goldfish-car-drive-navigation-biology">showed they could navigate outside their natural environment</a> and reach a target (<em>SN: 2/12/22, p. 4</em>). Maybe one day these cruising fish will boldly go where no fish has gone before.</p>

<h4>Snotty, sneezy sea sponges</h4>



<p>These creatures take self-care to the next level. Sponges are filter feeders, sucking up water through their pores to get nutrients. But when unwanted junk comes in, an <em>Aplysina archeri</em> tube sponge traps the particles in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-sponge-snot-rocket-mucus-pore">mucus, then expels it in one slow-motion sneeze</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/22, p. 4</em>). The Caribbean sponges are constantly oozing mucus like a child with a runny nose. Looks like someone could use a tissue.</p>

In real time, this sponge takes between 20 and 50 minutes to complete a sneeze.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The authors of a 2021 paper on a method of male enhancement have been forced to retract the paper after losing a legal battle over the technology.</p>



<p>At the heart (er, groin?) of the matter is a dispute over the ownership of a penile implant. According to <a href="https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/55391/International-Medical-Devices-v.-Cornell.Proposed-FAC-1.pdf">court documents</a>, <a href="https://www.drelist.com/">James Elist</a>, a urologist in Beverly Hills, Calif., developed the device, which he commercialized as <a href="https://penuma.com/">Penuma</a> for men who want a bit more than nature provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Penuma received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004, becoming the first such product to reach the market. (As Elist <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/penis-enlargement-surgery?mbid=social_facebook">told <em>GQ</em></a> in 2016, the surgically-implanted devices come only in large sizes because “nobody wants a small.”)</p>



<p>Elist alleges in a lawsuit that in 2018, a urologist in Texas named Robert Cornell contacted him with questions about how to use the Penuma in practice – questions the California physician claims were really efforts at corporate espionage:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126237"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In reality, Dr. Cornell’s stated interest in Penuma training was a ruse. Dr. Cornell’s true intention was to gather confidential trade secrets and other information with which he, along with his co-defendants, intended to (and eventually did) launch a competing product. Unware [sic] of Dr. Cornell’s plans, Dr. Elist hosted Dr. Cornell for Penuma training on March 30, 2018. During that all-day training, Dr. Cornell witnessed multiple Penuma procedures, asking Dr. Elist and his associates numerous questions about the development and future of Penuma. Dr. Elist answered those questions. During his visit, Dr. Cornell signed the non-disclosure agreement with IMD (the “Penuma NDA”).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Armed with what he’d learned, Elist’s lawyers say:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following his Penuma training, Dr. Cornell used the information Dr. Elist and his associates had provided – all subject to the Penuma NDA – to develop a competing implant, now named Augmenta.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a 2021 paper in <em>Sexual Medicine</em>, Cornell and his colleagues <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355497352_The_Augmenta_Implant_A_Cadaver_Model_of_a_Novel_Anatomic_Subdermal_Implant_for_Cosmetic_Penile_Enhancement">described Augmenta as</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>an innovative, technologically advanced subcutaneous elastomer-silicone cosmetic penile implant</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But, according to Elist, Cornell’s group were no kind of penile pioneers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>[T]hey did not invent; they stole. Dr. Cornell also included in his patent application Penuma drawings he neither created nor had any right or authorization to use.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elist asserted two Augmenta patents are&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>comprised entirely of Plaintiffs’ intellectual property … the product of fraud on the USPTO and unenforceable.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s more, Elist has accused Cornell of enlisting the help of another – let’s just call him cinematically named – urologist, Run Wang, who’d served on the advisory board for Penuma and is now a defendant in the suit. Wang, per court documents:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>breached the strict confidentiality agreement he entered with IMD by providing substantial assistance and advice to Dr. Cornell and the other co-defendants in exchange for an equity stake in the competing Augmenta implant.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The court agreed with Elist, granting him a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Preliminary-injunction.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> in January 2021 which, among other things, ordered the defendants to stop:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Commercializing, marketing, advertising, promoting, offering for sale, and/or profiting from the Augmenta implant …</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It also demanded that they return or destroy surgical instruments and supplies used in the implant procedure and notes Cornell might have taken during the training, and that they stop disclosing trade secrets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(The court refused to block them from pursuing one of the patents or “preventing Defendants from pursuing any pending Food and Drug Administration 510(k) submission.”)</p>



<p>But in November 2021, Elist and his attorneys became aware of the paper in <em>Sexual Medicine</em> published a month earlier, describing Augmenta as not only unique but commercially available – both of which, they argued, violated the terms of the injunction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, the court agreed again, issuing an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMD-contempt-order.pdf">order</a> holding Cornell and his colleagues in civil contempt.  </p>



<p>Ryan Baker, one of several attorneys representing Elist in the case, told us the retraction resulted from Cornell and his colleagues violating the terms of the &nbsp; preliminary injunction:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The court found Dr. Cornell and others in contempt of the court’s preliminary injunction order for the publication of the article.&nbsp; The Court then ordered that the article be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the notice states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been removed: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal">https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal</a>).</p>



<p>Removed due to legal reasons.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Also withdrawn was <a href="https://www.smoa.jsexmed.org/article/S2050-1161(22)00001-0/fulltext">an erratum</a> to the paper, dated Feb. 1, 2022, which declared:</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Cornell has not responded to a request for comment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tuskegee-syphilis-study-medical-racism">Medical racism didn’t begin or end with the syphilis study at Tuskegee</a></h4>

              
                <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>“We were all hard-working men … and citizens of the United States.”</em></p>
<cite>Herman Shaw, 1997</cite></blockquote>



<p>Born in Alabama in 1902, Herman Shaw was a farmer and a cotton mill worker. He and his wife, Fannie Mae, were married for 62 years and had two children and six grandchildren.</p>



<p>Shaw was also a survivor of a 40-year medical experiment.</p>



<p>From 1932 until the Associated Press broke the story in 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service conducted a study of more than 600 Black men in Macon County, Ala., without their informed consent. The men were told they were being tested and receiving free therapies for “bad blood,” a local term for several ailments. Instead, it was a study of untreated syphilis. Roughly two-thirds of the men had the transmissible disease. The Public Health Service did not disclose to the men their diagnoses and withheld available treatments.</p>





<p>The experiment tracked the damage the disease inflicted on the men. The endpoint was death.</p>



<p>In the 50 years since its end, the U.S. Public Health Service Study of Untreated Syphilis at Tuskegee in Alabama has often been held up as a primary driver of distrust of the U.S. health care system in Black communities. Yet medical abuse of Black people has occurred throughout U.S. history.</p>



<p>White people have long justified abuse and mistreatment of Black people by describing them, explicitly and implicitly, as inferior. There have been “four hundred years of active decisions to dehumanize Black people and Black bodies,” says Rachel Hardeman, a reproductive health equity researcher at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis.</p>



<p>As John Heller, chief of the Division of Venereal Diseases at the U.S. Public Health Service from 1943 to 1948, did. Heller said in an interview with historian James Jones for his book on the syphilis study, “Bad Blood,” that “the men’s status did not warrant ethical debate. They were subjects, not patients; clinical material, not sick people.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half a century later, this racist experiment can look like a product of a long-gone era, even as it gets outsize credit for distrust today. In reality, the racism that fueled the syphilis study has existed for centuries and still permeates the U.S. health care system, causing racial disparities in access to medical care and measures of health. While there are a variety of efforts to address these disparities, including medical training to bring awareness of racial biases, there is far to go.</p>





<p>“It is never too late to work to restore faith and trust,” Herman Shaw said in 1997 when the United States apologized for the study. &nbsp;U.S. President Joe Biden echoed these words during a November 30 event acknowledging the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/tuskegee-remembrance/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;50th anniversary of the end of the study</a>: “Restoring faith and trust is the work of our time.”</p>



<h4>Experimentation during slavery</h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>“A slave is not a human being in the eye of the law, and the slaveholder looks upon him just as what the law makes him; nothing more, and perhaps even something less.” </em></p>
<cite><em> </em>John Brown, 1855</cite></blockquote>



<p>In his 1855 memoir, John Brown wrote about his enslavement in Georgia and his escape to England. He described being experimented on to <a href="https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/jbrown/jbrown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test therapies for heat stroke</a>. Brown was forced to sit in a fire-heated pit with only his head exposed.</p>



<p>“In about half an hour I fainted. I was then lifted out and revived, the doctor taking a note of the degree of heat when I left the pit,” Brown wrote. The experiments continued as the doctor investigated which medicine “enabled me to withstand the greatest degree of heat.”</p>



<p>The enslavement and abuse of Black Americans were sanctioned by prevailing medical theories. Antebellum doctors claimed that Black people “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0749-3797(18)30664-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possessed peculiar physiological and anatomical features that justified their enslavement</a>,” Vanessa Northington Gamble wrote in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em> in 1993. “This medical distinctiveness, [the physicians] argued, made Africans not only inferior but inherently suited for slavery.” And for medical experimentation.</p>



<p>That included excruciatingly painful gynecological surgeries performed on enslaved Black women by white doctors, experiments that advanced the field. Thought of as biologically inferior to white women, while also deemed to have a high tolerance for pain, enslaved women were <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt69x.1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered “perfect medical subjects” </a>for experimentation, Deirdre Cooper Owens, a historian at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, wrote in her 2017 book <em>Medical Bondage: Race, Gender, and the Origins of American Gynecology</em>.</p>

He performed surgeries on the women, without anesthesia, to develop a repair for an abnormal opening between the bladder and the vagina. Held on Sims’ property from 1844 to 1849, the women were trained by Sims to assist with the procedure and became his surgical nurses, Cooper Owens wrote.</p>



<p>The work brought Sims renown as a gynecological surgeon. But, she wrote, “the central role that enslaved women played in these advances — by providing doctors the bodies and sometimes labor needed for experimentation, treatment, and repair — went unacknowledged.”</p>



<h4>Embedded racism</h4>

<p><em>“The Alabama community offered an unparalleled opportunity for the study of the effect of untreated syphilis.” </em></p>
<cite>Taliaferro Clark, Public Health Service, 1932</cite></blockquote>



<p>In the early 20th century, white physicians attributed the high rates of syphilis among Black people to their supposed immorality and excessive sexual desire. White doctors alleged that the disease was difficult to treat in Black people, because they wouldn’t <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0749-3797(18)30664-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliably seek out or follow a therapeutic regimen</a>, Northington Gamble wrote in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Another prevailing theory that motivated the experiment was “the belief that syphilis was a different disease in African Americans than it was in white people,” says Northington Gamble, a medical historian and physician at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. “This whole theory of Black bodies being fundamentally different was a foundation not only of the syphilis study, but also the foundation of medical practice.”</p>



<p>The idea persists today. Race is <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/new-ama-policies-recognize-race-social-not-biological-construct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a social concept</a>, but using race as though it designates biological differences informs <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2004740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment decisions about the kidneys, the lungs, pregnancy and more</a>.</p>



<p>For example, an equation that estimates kidney function long included a race-based adjustment, despite a lack of evidence for its use. The adjustment could mask the kidneys’ true condition in Black people.</p>



<p>Without the adjustment, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00478-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.3 million more Black Americans met a threshold for stage 3 chronic kidney disease</a>, researchers reported in <em>eClinicalMedicine</em> in 2021. At this stage, complications from kidney disease start to occur, meaning Black Americans could be missing out on needed care, the researchers wrote. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2798758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new equation to estimate kidney function</a> without a race adjustment is starting to be used in clinical practice.</p>



<p>In contrast, the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1516047113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">belief that Black people experience less pain than white people</a> hasn’t been extinguished. Today, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMpv2024759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black people often report their pain is not taken seriously</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/22/1/75/6046167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence shows their pain is undertreated</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Racism has been baked into health care,” Hardeman says. It’s <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1609535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embedded in the system</a>: in therapeutic protocols, in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-022-07562-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distribution of health care resources</a>, in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racial-bias-race-us-patient-medical-notes-chart-records">how a physician treats a patient</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/22</em>).</p>



<p>Black people are nearly twice as likely as white people to have <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/birt.12641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">procedures during perinatal care and birth done without their consent</a>, researchers reported in <em>Birth </em>in June. Hardeman has talked to Black people whose doctors sent their urine samples for toxicological screens in prenatal visits without their consent. “There’s this underlying assumption that there is likely drug use and that a tox screen is necessary,” she says.</p>

<p>This embedded, structural racism is <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2789583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a risk to health</a>, and underlies health disparities at birth and throughout life in the United States. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-newborn-baby-survival-doctor-race-mortality-rate-disparity">Black newborns are more likely to die</a> than white newborns (<em>SN: 8/25/20</em>). The rate of <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jwh.2020.8882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal mortality for Black women</a> is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly three times</a> that of white women.

<p>Singling out the syphilis study when discussing African Americans’ attitudes towards the medical system is “overly simplistic and historically inaccurate,” Northington Gamble says. The view that “the medical profession did not always have the best interest of African Americans at heart predated the syphilis study.” And the burden shouldn’t be on African Americans to change their attitudes, she says. “Trust should be earned.”</p>



<p>Along with past examples, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMpv2035827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern-day instances of medical racism that contribute to distrust</a>, says Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “Every single day it’s still going on,” she says.</p>



<h4>Beyond the syphilis study</h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>“What the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.”  </em></p>
<cite>President Bill Clinton, 1997</cite></blockquote>



<p>Twenty-five years after the end of the syphilis study, the U.S. government apologized. Northington Gamble was part of the <a href="https://www.tuskegee.edu/about-us/centers-of-excellence/bioethics-center/syphilis-study-legacy-committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committee that helped to make the apology happen</a>. She spoke about the event during the November 30 remembrance of the syphilis study, hosted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>



<p>“When President Clinton said, ‘and I am sorry,’ … there were sobs around the room,” Northington Gamble said. “And it wasn’t sobs just about the syphilis study, but it was sobs about how Black people have been treated in this country.”</p>

<p>Addressing and dismantling the racism behind that unequal treatment “will require <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing systems, laws, policies and practices</a>,” researchers wrote in <em>Health Affairs</em> in February. Those changes should include mandating standards for health care systems to achieve equitable results for patients, and medical <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp2021072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">training in the health effects of structural racism</a>, knowledge that would be required for professional licensing, Hardeman and colleagues wrote in 2020.</p>



<p>Some medical schools are bolstering their curriculum with <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/medical-schools-overhaul-curricula-fight-inequities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more extensive instruction on racism and health inequities</a>.</p>



<p>Doriane Miller, a primary care physician at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and director of the institution’s Center for Community Health and Vitality, leads doctors in training on tours of the surrounding area, in the south side of Chicago. People often see the area as defined by poverty and violence, Miller says. The tour offers a different story.</p>



<p>Miller talks about “how people came to this city looking for opportunities from the Deep South, in order to escape racism and segregation, and formed thriving businesses and communities.” She takes the new doctors by Provident Hospital, founded by the <a href="https://provfound.org/index.php/history/history-dr-daniel-hale-williams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black surgeon Daniel Hale Williams</a> in 1891. The first Black-owned and -operated hospital in the nation, it also provided training for Black doctors and nurses. Williams performed the first successful open-heart surgery in the United States in 1893 and helped establish the National Medical Association, the first national organization of medical professionals open to African Americans.</p>



<p>The historical tour is a way to give new doctors “a sense of, not just physical place, but the people they will be serving,” Miller says. People “want to have you understand their circumstances, so that you can respond to them as individuals,” she says, “rather than making presumptions about who they are and where they come from.”</p>



<p>Like the presumptions many made about the men included in the syphilis study. “What happens is that the humanity and the individuality and the life experiences and history of the men themselves, and their families, are erased,” Northington Gamble says. “People forget the fact that these were men with lives and families and stories.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-small-far-planets-space">The James Webb telescope is getting glimpses of small, far-off planets</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>BALTIMORE</strong> — When the James Webb Space Telescope was first dreamed up, exoplanets hadn’t even been discovered yet. Now the observatory is showing astronomers what it can learn about planets orbiting other stars — including the small ones.</p>



<p>Since its launch in December 2021, JWST had already <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-carbon-dioxide-exoplanet-atmosphere">“sniffed” the atmospheres</a> of Jupiter-sized planets orbiting searingly close to their stars (<em>SN: 8/26/22</em>). Those intense worlds are interesting, but not the places where astronomers hope to look for signs of life. The telescope is now getting glimpses of atmospheres on known exoplanets of the more terrestrial persuasion, astronomers reported December 13 and 14 at the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/events/stsci/2022/december/first-science-results-from-jwst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Science Results from JWST</a> conference.</p>





<p>And JWST is starting to find new rocky worlds too.</p>



<p>These early peeks at far-off worlds don’t yet reveal a lot about these remote locales. But researchers are buoyed by what JWST’s sharp vision in infrared wavelengths could eventually unearth about the smaller planets beyond our solar system.</p>



<p>“The main message is, we’re in business,” said University of Montreal astronomer Björn Benneke. “We don’t even have all the observations yet, but they are already quite exciting.”</p>



<p>One of the smaller planets that JWST looked at is GJ 1214b, which has frustrated astronomers since its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/super-earth-found-close-may-host-water">discovery in 2009</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/09</em>). The planet is a sub-Neptune, meaning its size is somewhere between that of a rocky world like Earth and a gaseous one like Neptune.</p>



<p>“What the heck are sub-Neptunes?” asked astronomer Eliza Kempton of the University of Maryland in College Park. They could be balls of rock with thick hydrogen and helium atmospheres, or maybe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planet-exotic-water-world">water worlds</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/12</em>). “What we’d like to do with atmospheric characterization is measure their atmospheres and see which is which,” Kempton said.</p>



<p>Previously, astronomers tried to observe the makeup of GJ 1214b’s atmosphere by watching how starlight filtered through it. But the atmosphere is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/signs-cloudy-skies-seen-two-exoplanet-atmospheres">thick and hazy</a>, blocking astronomers’ ability to detect individual molecules in it.</p>



<p>Instead of watching the planet pass in front of its star, Kempton and colleagues used JWST to look for the glow of the planet right before it disappeared <em>behind</em> the star. And it worked: After 38 hours of observing, the researchers detected the planet’s infrared glow, Kempton said in a December 13 presentation.</p>





<p>There’s more work to do, but the initial data suggest the planet has a lot of chemical components, possibly including water and methane. It’s also enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.</p>



<p>As for knowing what kind of world GJ 1214b is, “I’d say we’re not quite there yet,” Kempton said. It could be a watery planet, she said, or a gassy planet that has lost a fair amount of its lighter elements.</p>



<p>The telescope also had its first look at the tantalizing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trappist-1-earth-sized-planets-top-science-stories-2017-yir">TRAPPIST-1 system</a>, Benneke said in a different December 13 presentation (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>). Discovered in 2017, the system contains seven Earth-sized worlds that are probably rocky. Three of those planets might have the right temperatures for liquid water to exist on their surface, making them particularly interesting targets for JWST and other telescopes to look for signs of life.</p>



<p>But TRAPPIST-1 is a small, red star called an M dwarf, a type of star that is notorious for violent flares and strong radiation. For years, astronomers have debated whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-might-have-shot-planets-orbiting-dim-red-stars">planets around these stars would be hospitable to life</a>, or if the stars would strip their planets’ atmospheres away (<em>SN: 6/14/17</em>).</p>



<p>“If the TRAPPIST planets don’t have atmospheres, then we need to move on” from M dwarfs in the search for extraterrestrial life, says astronomer Mercedes Lόpez-Morales of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., who was not involved in the new JWST observations.</p>



<p>JWST’s first look at one of those potentially habitable worlds, TRAPPIST-1g, did not reveal any clear signs of an atmosphere. But the telescope looked at the planet for only about five hours. With more observations, an atmosphere should be detectable if it’s there, Benneke said.</p>



<p>JWST is getting into the planet-hunting game too, said astronomer Kevin Stevenson on December 14. The telescope double-checked a potentially interesting observation from another telescope and confirmed that it had seen a rocky, Earth-sized world around a nearby M dwarf. This proves that JWST has the precision to find such worlds.</p>



<p><a></a>“It is an exciting result, perhaps the first discovery of an exoplanet by JWST,” said Stevenson, of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. The planet orbits its dim star every two days, so it’s probably around 225° Celsius on the surface — likely too hot to be habitable, he says. “It’s more like an exo-Venus than an exo-Earth.”</p>



<p>While it’s still early days, the researchers emphasized, the forecast for planet hunting using JWST is good.</p>



<p>The results are paving the way for future observatories too, said astrophysicist John Mather of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Astronomers’ <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/ocga/testimony-before-congress/a-review-of-the-decadal-survey-for-astronomy-and-astrophysics-in-the-2020s-kennicut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wish list for future missions</a> includes a telescope that can dig even further into the details of potentially habitable worlds.</p>



<p>“If it’s not impossible,” Mather said, “let’s do it.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/image-1-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques hold a great potential in solving complex world problems. They can facilitate clinical decision making by providing actionable insights through ‘learning’ from large volumes of patient data. Among others, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31645-3">deep learning algorithms were proved able to accurately identify head CT scan abnormalities</a> requiring urgent attention, significantly increasing the efficiency of health services</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Encouraged by such exciting developments, AI is increasingly expected to be a promising means to realise high-performing medicine in the near future and is widely hoped to be the rescue for the overstretched health systems across the world in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this promise comes with critical and alarming caveats for clinical decision making: there is a consensus that AI models, particularly those using data-driven technologies, are subject to, or themselves cause, bias and discrimination, exacerbating existing health inequalities. </span></p>
<p><b>Health inequities </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recent studies show that without proper mitigation on potential bias against underrepresented groups such as women and ethnic minorities, implementation of AI in healthcare can result in life or death consequences. A <a href="https://informatics.bmj.com/content/29/1/e100457.full">study by Straw and Wu</a> showed that AI models built to identify people at high risk of liver disease from blood tests are twice as likely to miss the disease in women as in men</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is because data-driven AI models make inferences by finding ‘patterns’ from the data they analyse, but disparities such as those on racial and ethnic basis <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25032386/">have long existed in health and care</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Without effective mitigation approaches, </span>inferences learnt from such biased data are inevitably channeling embedded inequities into the decisions they make.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from data-embedded structural health inequities, under-representation of minorities in health datasets creates a real technical challenge for machine learning to come up with sensible conclusions for such groups, creating another potential source of inequities exacerbated by AI. </span>An insufficient number of samples of a minority group will cause computational models to draw inaccurate predictions for them<span style="font-weight: 400">. Unfortunately, such situations are pervasive for ethnic minority groups in healthcare datasets, which might not</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> always reflect the actual population diversity:</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> machine learning models trained on such data would draw inaccurate conclusions regarding the incidence or the risk of a disease within a specific population subset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to those embedded in data, biases could also arise from methodological choices for AI development and deployment. Obermeyer and colleagues</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342">analysed an algorithm widely employed in the US</a> that uses health costs as a proxy for health needs and they demonstrated that it falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Technically speaking,</span> bias might be unintentionally and easily induced in the feature selections (the choice of the input variables) and label determinations (the choice of target variables) of AI model developments.</p>

<p><b>Patient care</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides potential bias and inequalities, already well-established as ethical concerns associated with the use of AI in health care, there are also numerous other challenges that may have significant impact on patient care. AI has the potential to impact not only diagnosis but also prevention, treatment, and disease management on systems-scale, thus raising broader questions about its role in public health, for example in anticipating epidemics and providing patient support. AI is data-driven and health care data are often difficult (or even impossible) to anonymise, raising worries about privacy and data protection for patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Questions of legal accountability and moral responsibility in AI-driven decision-making have been raised, drawing attention to the potential changes in doctor-patient relationships. A <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-022-00842-4">study by Hallowell et al.</a> recently published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em> explores under what conditions trust could be placed in AI medical tools, highlighting that relational and epistemic trust is crucial, as clinician’s positive experience is directly correlated to future patient’s trust in AI tools. This study emphasises the need for deliberate and meticulous steps in designing trustworthy, confidence-worthy AI processes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Increasingly data-heavy medical practice might require novel skills from the next generation of medical professionals with consequences for the future of medical education. In order to address these issues, implementation of critical frameworks such as <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-022-00746-3">embedded ethics in the development of medical AI</a> is required.</span></p>
<p><b>The need for tools to mitigate or overcome ethical issues</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All in all, the use of AI in medicine, although it may bear high reward, is currently associated with high risk, as its consequences and implications are high-stakes including widening the social gap in health services and further fragmenting an already-divided society. Some tools are already available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05577">for general bias audit</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> or particularly <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/721">designed for healthcare application</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and focused research communities are emerging, such as the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/health-equity">Health Equity group</a> at the Alan Turing Institute </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and the independent community of <a href="https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/">Data Science for Health Equity</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Metrics such as fairness, accountability, methods for bias mitigation, and explainability or interpretability are major aspects that impact the perception and use of AI in ethically-sensitive fields such as medicine, and methods endowed with these features might play a significant role in overcoming mistrust, although they could not guarantee trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we still do not have a clear picture about data-embedded and AI-induced bias in healthcare and their implications in our society: the biases of AI models are not quantified and reported with the same enthusiastic attention as accuracies, let alone apply effective mitigation approaches before deployments. Similarly, studies about the impact the use of AI has in healthcare, from multiple practical and theoretical perspectives, are still relatively limited compared to the impressive expansion of this field: more discussion is needed for a fair and critical consideration of these new technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For these reasons, a cross-journal collection, <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/eaihm"><em>Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Health and Medicine</em></a>, has been launched in collaboration with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Medical Ethics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The collection welcomes studies focused on technical assessment and evaluation of AI-based medical decision making methods with regards to these ethics-relevant features, as well as more theoretical considerations on the medical use of AI-based methods. This includes but is not limited to the presentation of novel AI-based methods able to fulfil such ethical requirements and tools able to mitigate issues like bias, the elaboration of novel ethics-relevant metrics, research on attitudes and perceptions of physicians and the public on AI implementation, ethics surrounding AI-associated privacy and surveillance, and ethical challenges surrounding implementation of medical AI.</span></p>

<p>A paper about the potential influence of neurotransmitters on the development of sexual orientation and psychiatric disorders that caught flack on social media a year ago has now been retracted – so recently that the corresponding author said he didn’t know about the retraction until we asked him about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Late last year, <em>Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews</em>, an Elsevier journal, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/06/paper-on-sexual-orientation-and-neuropsychiatric-disorders-earns-an-expression-of-concern/">published an expression of concern</a> for the article “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763421004310#">Sexual orientation, neuropsychiatric disorders and the neurotransmitters involved</a>.” It was published online in September 2021 and has not been cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice said only that “some readers have raised concerns” about the article, which the journal was discussing the the authors, a group led by <a href="https://nin.nl/research-groups/swaab/">Dick Swaab</a> of the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience in Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126228"></span>



<p>We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/06/paper-on-sexual-orientation-and-neuropsychiatric-disorders-earns-an-expression-of-concern/">pointed out at the time</a> that the expression of concern followed criticism on social media, including by <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenMaren">Steve Maren</a>, a biobehaviorial neuroscientist at Texas A&amp;M University and member of the journal’s editorial board, who <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenMaren/status/1466421574056255511?s=20&amp;t=z-qXHqiEI5zwJttKwYQq8g">tweeted</a> that he had emailed the editor in chief requesting the paper’s retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The day after our original story published, Maren tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenMaren/status/1468237808997437444">detailed thread</a> about how the review article “completely misrepresented” one of the studies it referenced:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Recently – we don’t know exactly when, because of how Elsevier publishes retraction notices – the journal retracted the article. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor in Chief of Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews after concerns were raised with respect to the phrasing of comparisons drawn between humans and animal models. These comparisons were deemed unsupportable, and thus in the best interests of publication standards the Editor has concluded it is necessary to retract the paper. The authors disagree with the reason for the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed Giovanni Laviola, the editor in chief of the journal, for more information, but haven’t heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we reached out to Swaab for comment last week, he was apparently unaware that the paper had been retracted, asking us,&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Is the paper retracted? I thought we were still discussing the matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We confirmed that the online article said it had been retracted, and he responded that he would “go after it next week.” He has not yet replied to our follow-up request for comment but we will update with anything we learn. [Update, 1500 UTC, 12/21/22: Swaab declined to comment further, saying, “This is not a forum for a scientific discussion.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maren also learned that the article had been retracted from our email asking for comment, he told us. He summarized his concerns with the paper–the data misrepresentation, that the authors had overstated the relevance of animal models to human gender and sexual orientation, and that the paper exhibited a “false narrative,” namely, “that homosexual behavior is non-normative and induced by prenatal insults caused by maternal medication or drugs.” We’ve made his full comments available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Maren.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maren said he was glad to hear from us that the paper had been pulled:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I presented some of the concerns I detail above to the editor-in-chief and other than receiving an acknowledgment that the concerns had been received I had not further correspondence with the editors or Elsevier.&nbsp; In fact, your email is the first I have heard that the paper had been retracted.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 1600 UTC, 12/23/22: Laviola sent us the following comment: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We can confirm that the article from Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews was retracted on November 21, 2022 following a reassessment due to a number of complaints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts concluded that the literature and research on animal models raised a few critiques but crucially the subsequent interpretation was not supportable, specifically the statements about the potential implications for humans. The reviewers felt that the human situation is far more complex, and that it was inappropriate to directly transfer information on mechanisms and processes from basic research in experimental animal models to the clinical setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors were informed that the Editor had decided to retract the paper and a draft text of the retraction note was shared with the authors in October, however due to an oversight, the authors were not informed of the publication of the retraction, which officially took place in November.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-ichthyosaur-graveyard-breeding-ground">Mysterious ichthyosaur graveyard may have been a breeding ground</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some 230 million years ago, massive dolphinlike reptiles called ichthyosaurs gathered to breed in safe waters — just like many modern whales do. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the conclusion that researchers arrived at after studying a mysterious ichthyosaur graveyard in Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park in Nevada. The park is home to the world’s richest assemblage of fossils of <em>Shonisaurus popularis</em>, one of the largest <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-dragons">ichthyosaurs</a> ever discovered (<em>SN: 8/19/02</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is something we see in modern marine vertebrates — gray whales make [the] trek to Baja California every year” to breed, says Randall Irmis, a paleontologist at the National History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City. The sheltered, warm water offers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-aaas-3">safety for the whales</a> (<em>SN: 1/19/80</em>).</p>





<p>The <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01761-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982222017614%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new finding</a>, described December 19 in <em>Current Biology</em>, shows that this behavior “goes back at least 230 million years,” Irmis says. “It really connects the past to the present in a big way.”</p>



<p>The idea of birthing areas for ichthyosaurs has been proposed previously, and is even well-known enough to often be incorporated into artists’ renderings of the creatures, says Erin Maxwell, a paleontologist at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany, who wasn’t involved in the new research. But, she says, this study “is the first to support these speculations with data.”</p>



<p>Nevada’s ichthyosaur fossil trove has been a puzzle to paleontologists for decades. One curiosity is the many ichthyosaur fossils clustered in what’s now the park, but about 230 million years ago, was part of a tropical sea. Another oddity is that the site seems as if it were almost entirely populated by giant, 14-meter-long adult <em>S.</em> <em>popularis</em>. And then there’s the tantalizing question of what caused the deaths.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously suggested that the reptiles, which could be roughly the length of a school bus when grown, had congregated together for some unknown reason before something caused their mortality en masse.</p>



<p>Several pockets, or quarries, of specimens are scattered across the park. All told, Irmis and colleagues identified at least 112 ichthyosaur individuals in these quarries, including at one site where park officials had left previously discovered bones half-encased in the rock for public viewing.</p>



<p>That death snapshot meant that scientists could examine how the fossils were arranged relative to one another, perhaps offering insight into the reptiles’ behavior, says Neil Kelley, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.</p>



<p>Kelley, Irmis and colleagues used digital cameras and a laser scanner to collect hundreds of measurements of the bone bed with the half-buried reptiles, combining the data into a 3-D model of the site. The team also studied the sizes and shapes of bones from across the park, including some now in museum collections. And the researchers analyzed the chemical makeup of the surrounding rocks and pored over older photographs and field notes.</p>

<p>These scraps of evidence helped the researchers begin to understand what they were looking at — and potentially solve at least one long-standing mystery: what brought these creatures together.</p>



<p>Though almost all of the park&#8217;s <em>Shonisaurus</em> skeletons are fully-grown adults, the site does have a few very tiny ichthyosaur remains, the scientists found. Using micro-computed tomography, a 3-D imaging technique that uses X-rays to see inside the fossils, the researchers discovered that some tiny bones were those of embryonic and newborn <em>Shonisaurus</em>.</p>





<p>The finding led the team to conclude that the site was a birthing ground. That could explain why there were so many of the same creatures in the same place alongside newborns, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The site also seems to have been a birthing ground for <em>Shonisaurus</em> for a long time. Rather than all the quarries dating to roughly the same time, different ones are separated by at least hundreds of thousands of years, the researchers found.</p>



<p>As for what killed the reptiles, “we don’t know,” Irmis says.</p>



<p>Among the hypotheses for a mass mortality event were harmful algal blooms or large-scale volcanic activity. But the new rock chemistry data eliminated those events as culprits.</p>



<p>Some of the animals in each quarry could have still died en masse. Having the creatures grouped in one place to breed may have left the reptiles vulnerable to a sudden catastrophic event that buried them in sediment, such as an undersea landslide.</p>



<p>But the fossil finds might also represent “just normal mortality over time,” Irmis says, given how the creatures seem to have come to the site again and again.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-long-genital-spines-male-defense-survival">Long genital spines on male wasps can save their lives</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fending off an attacker by swordplay with two genital spines turns out to be a moderately useful form of self-defense for male wasps, an unusual study shows. A mason wasp’s rear spikes may be useless when it comes to delivering sperm, but they could save his life.</p>



<p>Male wasps (and bees) don’t grow venom-injecting stingers. That’s female weaponry that evolved with the equipment for laying eggs. Instead, males of a mason wasp species fight against gulping tree frogs (and collecting entomologists) by deploying a pair of spines that evolved with male reproductive genital equipment at the wasp’s rear.</p>





<p>The spines are just pseudo-stings. There’s no venom, but a male wasp can stab an attacking frog in the face and mouth.</p>



<p>“Our study is the&nbsp;first to demonstrate the defensive roles of pseudo-stings as counterattack&nbsp;devices in wasps,” says ecologist Shinji Sugiura of Kobe University in Japan. Biologists have long known the spines exist, but the new study, published December 19 in <em>Current Biology</em>, tests how well they work.</p>



<p>The inspiration came from Sugiura’s student and coauthor, Misaki Tsujii, who got jabbed while collecting a male <em>Anterhynchium gibbifrons </em>mason wasp.</p>



<p>Female mason wasps use their real stinging equipment to paralyze multiple caterpillars as still-alive and fresh baby food. A mom seals zombified caterpillars into the private nursery chamber she builds for each offspring.</p>



<p>Males, without true stinging power, can still deliver “a pricking pain,” says Sugiura. &nbsp;To see just how much protection that pricking offered, the researchers put the wasps near various hungry frogs in the lab.</p>



<p>Each of 17 male wasps trapped with a pond frog (<em>Pelophylax nigromaculatus</em>) got eaten despite the pricking. Confrontations with the tree frog <em>Dryophytes japonica</em>, however, were a different story.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Male <em>Anterhynchium gibbifrons</em> mason wasps don’t have stingers, but they do have genital spikes on their rears. So when a tree frog gulps the male, lunch doesn’t always go well. &nbsp;Here, the wasp stabs its spines into the frog’s face and mouth — prompting the frog to vigorously spit out the wasp.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>Male wasps resisted, and this time with some success. Their genital spines “were frequently observed to pierce the frog mouth,” the researchers report. Lab video shows a tree frog batting its skinny-toed feet against a wasp it was vigorously spitting out of its wide frog mouth. Frogs ultimately rejected six of 17 wasps. &nbsp;When offered wasps with the spines removed, however, the tree frogs ate them all.</p>





<p>Judging by Tsujii’s own reaction to being pseudo-stung by one of these male wasps, they don’t sound like pleasant snacks. She ranks the pain as a 1 on the 0–4 Schmidt pain scale <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-books-deliver-double-dose-venomous-animal-facts">used to categorize sting agony</a> increasing from none to, non-technically, chained in hot lava (<em>SN: 7/24/16</em>). A honeybee delivers a 2 of stinging pain.</p>



<p>“I can attest from personal experience that male pseudo-stings … are used in defense,” says James Carpenter, a wasp specialist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “I’ve been jabbed by them several&nbsp;times, and they can be painful enough that they elicit a startle response and you drop the wasp.”</p>



<p>Despite the rear position, though, “the spines don&#8217;t appear to be used in copulation,” Carpenter says. On such occasions, “they&#8217;re moved out of the way.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121522_sm_wasp-rear-spikes_inline.jpg" alt="photo of the rear of a Anterhynchium gibbifrons wasp with a red arrow pointing to the sperm delivery system and a two blue arrows pointing to two spines next to it" class="wp-image-3120402" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121522_sm_wasp-rear-spikes_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121522_sm_wasp-rear-spikes_inline-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120402">Slim little spines (blue arrows) on the rear of this <em>Anterhynchium gibbifrons </em>wasp, one on either side of his sperm-delivery organ (red arrow), don’t have the defensive power of the female stinger. But a new test pitting the wasps against tree frogs finds spines are better than nothing.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120402">Shinji Sugiura</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Sugiura and Tsujii even checked to see if a male that a female had rejected in courtship would use his spines in some way to overcome her objection. No, the researchers say after watching 10 matings and seven rejections: The spines in this species appear merely defensive.</p>



<p>The male spikes, called parameral spines, show up in other kinds of wasps too but have not been tested in those species for defensive power. And the possibility that the spines still have some sexual function should be considered, says Menno Schilthuizen, an evolutionary ecologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center and Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>“The male genitalia of many insects have such accessory spines, whip or drumstick-like structures,” he says.&nbsp; Remaining “outside of the female&#8217;s body during copulation … does not mean that they do not play a role in reproduction. In many species they tap or stroke the female&#8217;s abdomen in what&#8217;s known as ‘copulatory courtship,’ enhancing the male&#8217;s chances that the female will actually use his sperm for fertilizing her eggs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Few studies, even in nonwasps, have documented genital action for self-defense. The other example Sugiura and Tsujii cite comes from hawkmoths. These big, night-flying foragers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hawkmoths-squeak-their-genitals-threatening-bats">use a genital structure to create scratchy static</a> that jams the echolocation frequencies of moth-hunting bats (<em>SN: 7/3/13</em>).</p>



<p>Studying genital structures in terms of defense instead of just sexual allure is important, the researchers argue, in large part because it’s not common. Looking for death-dodging aspects of genital evolution could encourage “a new perspective,” the researchers propose. And there’s astonishing variety to account for in the evolution of genital forms. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-planet-exoplanet-dying-kepler-space-telescope">The first planet found by the Kepler space telescope is doomed</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first planet ever spotted by the Kepler space telescope is falling into its star.</p>



<p>Kepler launched in 2009 on a mission to find exoplanets by watching them cross in front of their stars. The first potential planet the telescope spotted was initially dismissed as a false alarm, but in 2019 astronomer Ashley Chontos and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-planet-kepler-finally-confirmed-10-years-later">proved it was real</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/19</em>). The planet was officially named Kepler 1658b.</p>



<p><a></a>Now, Chontos and others have determined Kepler 1658b’s fate. “It is tragically spiraling into its host star,” says Chontos, now at Princeton University. The planet has roughly 2.5 million years left before it faces a fiery death. “It will ultimately end up being engulfed. Death by star.”</p>





<p>The roughly Jupiter-sized planet is searingly hot, orbiting its star once every three days. In follow-up observations from 2019 to 2022, the planet kept transiting the star earlier than expected.</p>



<p>Combined data from Kepler and other telescopes show that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aca47e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the planet is inching closer to the star</a>, Chontos and colleagues report December 19 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“You can see the interval between the transits is shrinking, really slowly but really consistently, at a rate of 131 milliseconds per year,” says astrophysicist Shreyas Vissapragada of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>



<p>That doesn’t sound like much. But if this trend continues, the planet has only 2 million or 3 million years left to live. “For something that’s been around for 2 to 3 <em>billion</em> years, that’s pretty short,” Vissapragada says. If the planet’s lifetime was a more human 100 years, it would have a little more than a month left.</p>



<p>Studying Kepler 1658b as it dies will help explain the life cycles of similar planets. “Learning something about the actual physics of how orbits shrink over time, we can get a better handle on the fates of all of these planets,” Vissapragada says.</p>

                <p>These reported discoveries from 2022 could be game changers, if only we were sure of the findings. News reports this year left us wondering …</p>



<h4>Is new physics around the corner?</h4>



<p>A measurement of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-particle-mass-standard-model-physics">the mass of an elementary particle called the W boson</a> has physicists holding their breath. Data from the Collider Detector at Fermilab, or CDF, suggest the particle is heftier than expected (<em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 12</em>). If so, the finding would be just the kind of crack that researchers have been looking for in the standard model of particle physics. That theory successfully describes the basic constituents of our world but doesn’t explain how gravity fits in. Whether the discovery dissolves with further measurements or points the way to a new and better understanding of matter remains to be seen.</p>

<h4>Was Old MacDonald a gopher?</h4>



<p>Root-munching southeastern pocket gophers (<em>Geomys pinetis</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pocket-gophers-farm-soil-roots-fertilize">tend their tunnels like farmers tend their fields</a>, scientists claimed (<em>SN Online: 7/14/22</em>). The gophers, which live in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, spread their feces in the tunnels, churn the soil and nibble existing roots. All of that encourages new roots to grow, and so secures future lunch. But some researchers say the gophers’ inadvertent environmental changes don’t count as agriculture. For now, it’s an open question whether any mammals but people cultivate crops.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="382" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_big-if_gopher.jpg" alt="A photo of a southeastern pocket gopher emerging from a hole" class="wp-image-3120315" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_big-if_gopher.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_big-if_gopher-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120315">A controversial claim suggests that southeastern pocket gophers “farm” roots as they dig their dig tunnels.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120315">Veronica Selden/Eurekalert CC BY-SA 2.0</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>Do limb bones reveal our roots?</h4>



<p>There’s no doubt that fossils of a part of a leg and two forearms unearthed in 2001 in Chad are a window into the past. But what they can tell us about our own evolution has been hotly debated. The bones, which date to around 7 million years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-hominid-limb-fossils-sahelanthropus-tchadensis">belong to <em>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em></a> and confirm that the species walked upright, scientists reported (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 7</em>). That conclusion cements the species’ status as the earliest known hominid, those scientists argue. Other proposed early hominids are much younger, dating from about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-ancestor-gets-leg-walking">5 million to 6 million years ago</a>. But some scientists say the 7-million-year-old bones don’t clearly point to a two-legged gait and belonged instead to an ancient ape. With all the uncertainty, these findings may yet be walked back.</p>

<h4>Do tetraneutrons exist?</h4>



<p>Scientists have been on the hunt for six decades. Now for the first time they may have spotted an elusive quartet: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tetraneutron-four-neutron-cluster-physics-nuclear-forces">a cluster of four neutrons called a tetraneutron</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/22/22</em>). These clumps seem to last for a fleeting instant, less than a billionth of a trillionth of a second in an experiment reported this year. Studying the clusters could be a boon to researchers who want to know how neutrons behave within atomic nuclei. But disagreements among various theoretical calculations leave some experts unconvinced that tetraneutrons even exist.</p>

<h4>Is a mystery monkey a hybrid?</h4>



<p>An odd-looking primate spotted some six years ago <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-monkey-hybrid-borneo-habitat">in Borneo might be a rare hybrid</a>. But researchers won’t be sure until they can collect animal droppings for genetic analysis (<em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 11</em>). Photographs suggest that the primate’s mother is a silvered leaf monkey (<em>Trachypithecus cristatus</em>), its father a proboscis monkey (<em>Nasalis larvatu</em>s). If true, it’s a concerning coupling. Mating across genera suggests the two species are under extreme pressure, probably from the deforestation for oil palm plantations that’s fragmenting the habitat the monkeys share along the Kinabatangan River.</p>

<h4>Did humans arrive early in Europe?</h4>



<p>Humans may have migrated to Europe as early as 56,800 years ago, scientists reported based on discoveries at a rock-shelter in southern France. Those finds would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-humans-europe-migration-earlier-france-rock-shelter">put <em>Homo sapiens</em> on the continent about 10,000 years earlier</a> than previously thought and long before Neandertals died out (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 9</em>). The disappearance of the Neandertals, the work suggests, may have been a more complex and drawn-out process than had been realized. The researchers suggest that <em>H. sapiens</em> not only traded off occupation of the site with Neandertals, but also took survival tips. Still, the evidence rests on a single human tooth and tools that other researchers say could have been made by Neandertals.</p>

<h4>Has a &#8216;photon ring&#8217; been detected?</h4>



<p>Remember that stunning first picture of a black hole, unveiled in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope team? It showed the shadow of galaxy M87’s black hole on its swirling ring of hot matter. Well, astrophysicists announced this year that they had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disputed-photon-ring-supermassive-black-hole-image-eht">teased out a ring within a ring</a> in M87, identifying the thin circle of light created by the orbiting photons that are flung around the black hole before they fly toward Earth (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 8</em>). This “photon ring” would offer a new way to test what we think we know about gravity, but some researchers are critical of the methods used to identify the ring. A clear detection of the photon ring might have to wait for space telescopes to join the black hole–imaging effort.</p>
