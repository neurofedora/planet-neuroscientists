<p>A Taylor &amp; Francis journal has retracted a widely-read paper linking cardiac-related mortality to COVID-19 vaccines after an unsuccessful legal attempt by the lead author to block the withdrawal. That author says he is considering further legal action against the publisher.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21645515.2023.2230828">Risk of all-cause and cardiac-related mortality after vaccination against COVID-19: A meta-analysis of self-controlled case series studies</a>,”&nbsp;drew swift criticism when it was published in <em>Human Vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics</em> in August 2023. At the time, critics and sleuths were quick to challenge the data and methods used in the paper, which now has more than 143,000 views on the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?AllField=Risk+of+all-cause+and+cardiac-related+mortality+after+vaccination+against+COVID-19%3A+A+meta-analysis+of+self-controlled+case+series+studies+">Taylor &amp; Francis website</a> and has been cited 15 times, including by two letters to the editor of the journal and a response from the authors, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21645515.2023.2230828">posted online January 16</a>, states the retraction resulted from concerns that arose about the methodology of the study and the integrity and availability of the data. The authors provided a full response to the queries; however, the publisher determined the validity of the findings remained in question, the notice states. It continues:</p>



<span id="more-133958"></span>



<p><em>In addition, after publication, a major dataset that formed a central part of the evidence presented in the paper has been removed from public access by the issuing government authority; therefore, key portions of the published analysis are unverifiable using publicly available data.</em></p>



<p><em>As verifying the validity of published work is core to the integrity of the scholarly record, we are, therefore, retracting the article. The corresponding author listed in this publication has been informed. The Editor and Publisher confirm that there is no allegation of research misconduct on the part of the authors.</em></p>



<p>The publisher’s decision was informed by its editorial policies and COPE guidelines, the notice states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction follows a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gov.uscourts.azd_.1468733.17.0-Dec-11-decision.pdf">December 11 decision</a> by a federal court in Arizona rejecting a request for a temporary restraining order against the publisher by lead author Greg J. Marchand. The author pursued the order to prevent Taylor &amp; Francis “from causing irreparable harm” to his “professional reputation by improperly retracting his published and peer-reviewed research article in breach of the parties’ contract and T&amp;F’s duties of care as a publisher,” according to his <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gov.uscourts.azd_.1468733.2.0-Nov-24-2025-complaint.pdf">November 2025 complaint</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona found Marchand was unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim, and declined to “impose restraints on a publisher’s editorial discretion,” which the court said would violate the publisher’s First Amendment rights. The court decision was <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/15/court-refuses-to-block-medical-journals-retraction-of-covid-vaccine-study-that-had-150k-views/">first reported</a> by Eugene Volokh.<br><br>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Institute-Comment-on-Retraction-16-JAN-2026.pdf">a statement</a> sent to Retraction Watch, Marchand said he and his team stand behind the paper’s findings as well as “the methods used, which were appropriate to the data and tools available at that time.” Marchand is a gynecologic surgeon and managing director of Marchand Institute for Minimally Invasive Surgery, a non-profit research corporation based in Mesa, Arizona.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the meta-analysis, Marchand and his coauthors included data from The Ladapo report, an analysis by Florida Attorney General Joseph Ladapo, according to Marchand’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Second-Requested-Response-Full-Thesis-in-Defense-of-Findings.pdf">33-page defense</a> of the paper. The report, released in October 2022, addressed vaccine safety and <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/FLDOH/bulletins/3312697#:~:text=This%20analysis%20found%20that%20there,%2C%20please%20visit%20FloridaHealth.gov">led to guidance</a> from Ladapo advising against COVID-19 vaccines for men aged 18 to 39 because of a purported higher risk of cardiac-related death.<br><br>Data from Ladapo’s report has since been removed from the Florida Department of Health’s servers, said Marchand, who noted that, in accordance with COPE guidelines, it’s “acceptable to retract a meta-analysis under these circumstances.” He wasn’t pleased, however, with the wording in the retraction notice, which he said gives the impression a COPE standards review was performed.</p>



<p>“There was no COPE-compliant query that took place, and no evidence of any invalid finding,” he said in the emailed statement. “All questions were answered to absolute resolution, and no further concerns were raised by the editors or outside reviewers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marchand said he is considering legal action for libel for the publisher’s ambiguous wording, “which could portray authors and their considerable work on this paper in a negative light.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Taylor &amp; Francis said the publisher had no comment beyond the details in the retraction notice. &#8220;The retraction decision was made and communicated to the authors before the legal action, and therefore the legal action did not affect the decision to retract,&#8221; they added.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The Marchand paper evaluated a self-controlled case series, a novel study design “uniquely equipped to ethically quantify the safety of vaccination,” according to the abstract. The authors say they found three such case series, totaling about 750,000 patients.</p>



<p>The researchers found no significant association of COVID-19 vaccination with all-cause mortality, but concluded there was an increased risk of cardiac-related mortality linked to the vaccine. A subgroup analysis purported to show “the male gender is significantly associated with an increased incidence of cardiac-related deaths.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/23/officials-note-likely-association-between-covid-19-vaccines-and-rare-heart-condition-in-young-people/">Other studies have shown</a> that myocarditis is a rare but possible side effect of the vaccines. Vinay Prasad, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently called for stricter regulations of new vaccines after claiming that the COVID-19 vaccine was linked to the death of at least 10 children, according to a leaked memo <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/29/covid-vaccine-deaths-fda-memo-vinay-prasad/">reported by STAT</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after the <em>Human Vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics </em>paper was published in 2023, critics and sleuths began poking holes in the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an August 2023 <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645515.2023.2253959">letter to the editor</a>, independent researcher Borja Somovilla Del Saz of Valencia, Spain, raised concerns that authors relied on data from the Ladapo paper, which was not a peer-reviewed study. In addition, “sensitivity analyses were lacking, undermining result robustness, particularly in gender-specific outcomes,” Del Saz wrote in his letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645515.2023.2290173#d1e220">Another letter to the editor</a>, this one by Tyler Black of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, highlighted “significant methodological, important omissions … and errors in data extraction” in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper also became the source of much discussion on X, where sleuth Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz wrote a lengthy thread about what he called a “clear error” with the meta-analysis. Meyerowitz-Katz, a research fellow at the University of Wollongong in Australia and a coauthor on Black’s letter, explained the authors used two types of meta-analyses for the two different models: a random-effects model, and a fixed-effects model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A fixed-effects model assumes the studies are essentially identical, while a random-effects model assumes the studies are different, and the differences are distributed in somewhat random ways, he explained in the <a href="https://x.com/GidMK/status/1688371513668562944">August 2023 post</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To me, this is an obvious error,” Meyerowitz-Katz wrote. “The correct thing to do in this situation would be to report both the fixed and random-effects models, because their results conflict, and discuss which one would potentially be more important to consider.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, it appears the main finding rested on a single, “arbitrary decision” about which statistical model to use for each analysis, Meyerowitz-Katz wrote.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Similar concerns were raised by Taylor &amp; Francis in emails sent to Marchand by Jade Boyd, journals portfolio manager for the publisher, according to correspondence seen by Retraction Watch. In an email dated March 14, 2024, Boyd told Marchand the publisher sent his article for “confidential post-publication review to an independent expert, as is common in cases like this.”<br><br>In subsequent email exchanges that went on for more than a year, Boyd questioned Marchand about various aspects of the research, including queries about hazard ratios, and the sensitivity analysis, according to <a href="https://marchandinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Taylor-and-Francis-All-communications-Full-Email-Thread-with-Ms-Boyd.pdf?referrer=grok.com">the email communication</a> provided by Marchand.<br><br>The email exchanges indicate Marchand and his coauthors were responsive to the publisher’s investigation – which the retraction notice affirmed – sharing additional information, answering questions, and at one point, sending a corrected manuscript with new figures requested by Taylor &amp; Francis for a correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corrected article never went forward however, and the back-and-forth stalled. On November 12, 2025, the publisher sent Marchand an email stating that some of the major concerns with the paper remained unaddressed and Taylor &amp; Francis intended to publish a retraction notice, according to a timeline in Marchand’s <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.1468733/gov.uscourts.azd.1468733.2.0.pdf">legal complaint</a>. He sued the publisher on November 24, 2025, alleging breach of contract by Taylor &amp; Francis, among other claims. Marchand claimed the publisher’s acceptance and publication of the article, its policies, and the journal’s adherence to COPE guidelines formed a contract between the publisher and Marchand, and that retraction would breach the contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>District Judge Diane J. Humetewa disagreed, writing that while the Court recognizes the importance of contract enforcement in commercial transactions, “here Marchand has failed to sufficiently identify the enforceable terms of any agreement between the parties.”</p>



<p>In their 33-page response, Marchand and his coauthors address the criticisms against the paper, including their characterization of the Ladapo report as “a peer-reviewed publication” and concerns with the fixed- and random-effect models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The characterization of the Ladapo report was “thorough, transparent, and justified, prioritizing scientific merit over external controversies,” according to the defense. The authors also contend the handling of the fixed- and random- effects models was “transparent, consistent with our pre-specified criteria, and aligned with established guidelines.”<br><br>“The sensitivity analyses and re-analysis under random effects validate the stability of our findings, and the critique&#8217;s alleged overturning relies on disputed data adjustments rather than a flaw in our model application,” they said. “No substantive deviation occurred, and our conclusions remain supported.”</p>



<p>When reached by Retraction Watch, Meyerowitz-Katz said it’s “a good thing” the study was retracted.&nbsp;“It was a very poorly-done meta-analysis that differed significantly from its own pre-registration without any discussion of why,” he told us. “In addition, the entire finding – that COVID-19 vaccines may increase cardiac mortality – was predicated on a single, openly political paper…. Had the authors only considered high-quality, peer-reviewed studies, they would similarly have not found an effect.”<br><br>Marchand has authored other recent research purporting to show harms related to vaccines, including a research collaboration with Peter McCullough about a <a href="https://marchandinstitute.org/dr-peter-mccullough-and-dr-greg-marchand-publish-the-definitive-analysis-of-rsv-vaccine-safety-in-pregnancy/">connection between RSVpreF vaccines</a> and pregnancy and preterm birth. The Wellness Company, where McCullough is chief scientific officer, sells an “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wellness-Company-Nattokinase-Bromelain-Gluten-Free/dp/B0DRLJF3XF">Ultimate Spike Detox</a>” aimed at treating purported vaccine-induced spike proteins that linger in the body after vaccination for $89 per bottle.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2026/01/21/attention-authors-updated-endorsement-policy/">Attention Authors: updated endorsement policy</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv has </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated our endorsement policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of January 21, 2026, arXiv will no longer accept institutional email addresses (i.e., an email address associated with an academic or research institution) as the sole qualifier of endorsement for new authors. This policy update is being made to support the arXiv community (authors, readers, volunteer moderators, and staff) by stemming the flood of low-quality, non-scientific submissions to </span><a href="http://arxiv.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arxiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endorsement for new submitters in all categories will now follow two paths. The first path requires </span><b>both</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1) an institutional email address from an academic/research institution </span><b>and</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2) previous authorship on an existing paper which has been accepted to the arXiv <em>“endorsement domain”<strong>*</strong></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they wish to submit to (see </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper ownership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). New submitters who cannot meet these requirements can pursue the second path, which is </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html#who-can-endorse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking personal endorsement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly from an established arXiv author in the same endorsement domain.</span></p>
<p><b>I have questions about this policy update / getting endorsed. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a significant change for many arXiv authors. You can read below for more about why arXiv has made this update and how this will affect your submission. If you still have questions, comments, or concerns after reading, please fill out our </span><a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9mBSosmZCoHNmFE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endorsement Policy Feedback Form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv staff cannot waive endorsement requirements or provide a personal endorsement for authors. </span><a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9mBSosmZCoHNmFE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feedback form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the best way to get in contact with arXiv about endorsement issues.</span></p>
<p><b>What does this update mean for researchers wishing to submit to arXiv?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors who were previously endorsed to submit to a particular category will still be endorsed in that category. This policy update will mostly affect new submitters — arXiv authors who are submitting to a category for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because new submitters to an arXiv category need both an institutional email address </span><b>AND</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previous authorship on an existing paper in the endorsement domain of the category they wish to submit to, the following are best practices for new authors hoping to get endorsed via the first endorsement path:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are affiliated with an academic or research institution, make sure your arXiv account is connected to your academic or research email.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have co-authored a paper or papers that have been accepted to arXiv, </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html#to-claim-a-paper"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim ownership of your paper(s)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For automatic endorsement, the paper(s) you own must be in the endorsement domain that the category you wish to submit to is in. If you have co-authored several papers, it is recommended that you claim ownership of all of them and keep your arXiv account as up-to-date as possible.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a new submitter who meets </span><b>BOTH</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the requirements of the first endorsement path, you will likely be able to submit without taking any further action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a new submitter who does not meet </span><b>BOTH</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the requirements, you must follow the second path and seek personal endorsement. </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our help pages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go into detail on how to seek personal endorsement from an advisor, colleague, or arXiv author with endorsement privileges. arXiv staff are not able to personally endorse arXiv authors.</span></p>
<p><b>What is endorsement and why is arXiv updating the endorsement policy?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endorsement (in one form or another) has always been a requirement to submit to arXiv. arXiv’s mission is to advance science by providing a place for the scientific community to freely and quickly share and discover relevant scientific research, and arXiv authors are expected to be scientists with expertise in their field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endorsement is how arXiv determines that a potential arXiv author is a research scientist and has relevant research to share. When arXiv was small, all endorsements were personal endorsements &#8211; one scientist personally vouching for another. As we grew, most arXiv sections automatically endorsed first-time submitters as long as they had an affiliation to an academic or research institute. arXiv felt this was a fair way to allow new researchers to submit to arXiv while still preserving the corpus and maintaining a standard of scientific integrity. However in recent years, arXiv has received an unsustainable increase in the number of non-scientific submissions, increasing the rejection rate and requiring excessive moderation and staff effort. Because of this, we have determined that institutional email addresses are no longer a sufficient credential for determining minimum research competence or endorsement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv first rolled out a similar endorsement update across the arXiv Math section in December 2025, </span><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/12/10/updated-endorsement-policy-for-arxiv-mathematics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which you can read about in our previous blog.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv was built for scientists, by scientists, and endorsement is not a guarantee. Endorsement is reserved for members of the scientific community with expertise in their field. Endorsement can also be revoked if an author violates arXiv policies or the arXiv code of conduct.</span></p>
<p><b>How can I help first-time authors submit to arXiv?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arXiv endorsement process ensures a sustainable and fair way for scientists to help arXiv determine who is a member of good standing in the scientific community by vouching for the scientific work of first-time submitters. Want to know how you can help by endorsing new authors in your field? </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html#who-can-endorse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about endorsement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how to find out if you have endorsement privileges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to our scientific community for supporting us in this policy update. We rely on you to help us keep arXiv open and free, and to help us make sure submissions to arXiv are scientifically rigorous and of interest to the community.</span></p>
<h6><em><strong>*</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Endorsement domains” are high-level subject areas or related categories on arXiv. Endorsement domains have been chosen to reflect related subject areas and ensure that it will be easy for people to seek personal endorsement from authors in their field. M</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ost high-level subject areas (e.g., hep-th, cond-mat, q-bio) are currently endorsement domains, with the notable exception of physics, in which individual subject classes (e.g., phys.acc-phys, phys.med-ph) are endorsement domains.</span></em></h6>

<p>At wit’s end after a publisher ignored her repeated requests for a correction, Ursula Bellut-Staeck took the extreme step of issuing her own retraction. But is that even a thing?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bellut-Staeck, an independent researcher from Berlin, Germany, submitted a paper to <em>SCIREA Journal of Clinical Medicine </em>last spring after receiving an invitation from the journal. The article, about mechanotransduction and the impact of infrasound and vibrations, was <a href="https://www.scirea.org/journal/PaperInformation?PaperID=12440">published June 16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when Bellut-Staeck realized her affiliation as listed on the article needed changing, she contacted <a href="https://www.scirea.org/journal/CM">the journal</a> to request a correction. The problem, she said, was linguistic. Because she didn’t realize “affiliation” has a different meaning in German than English, she had mistakenly listed herself as being at an institution she has since left.</p>



<span id="more-133946"></span>



<p>Receiving no response to three correction requests, she finally asked the journal to retract the paper. Frustrated when she <em>still</em> didn’t hear back, Bellut-Staeck said, she performed an “unilateral author-initiated retraction” on November 27. </p>



<p>She documented the self-retraction <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Unilateral-Retraction-Statement_-SCIREA_Journal_of_Clinical_Medicine_b_DOI_b_10_54647_cm321372/30731816?file=59891903">on Figshare</a>, writing she “unilaterally retracts” the article for “persistent non-responsiveness of the publisher for more than five weeks to repeated legitimate requests for correction of a critical affiliation error” and for “evidence of absence of meaningful peer review.”</p>



<p>“Since its publication on June 16, 2025, the behavior of the editors of the <em>Journal of Clinical Medicine</em> has been a major source of stress,” Bellut-Staeck told us in an email. “In any case, it damaged my credibility during this period, which I was only able to restore by unilaterally retracting a scientific article that had been the result of a great deal of work.” She believes the self-retraction “fully complies with COPE Retraction Guidelines for cases of publisher non-responsiveness and predatory practices.”</p>



<p>Published online by SCIREA – which <a href="https://www.scirea.org/">publishes 25 journals</a> in total – the <em>Journal of Clinical Medicine</em> is not a COPE member. On its website, the journal calls itself an “international, scientific peer-reviewed open access journal” that provides “rapid publication” and “high visibility.” The journal boasts being “indexed in the Google Scholar and other databases.” It is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science, but MDPI’s identically named <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm"><em>Journal of Clinical Medicine</em></a> is. </p>



<p>While Bellut-Staeck says she’s following COPE’s guidelines in her unusual move, in fact those standards do not address self-retraction in cases of non-responsive publishers. <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines">The guidelines</a> state authors who become aware of potential errors, ethical issues or misconduct must raise these issues to the journal’s editor and with the institution, but that “the decision to correct or retract an article is made by the editor.”</p>



<p>“There is no such thing as ‘self-retract,’” said Jodi Schneider, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specializes in information quality, biomedical informatics and controversies in science. </p>



<p>If the journal is a COPE member and is not responding to correspondence, authors can reach out to the group to issue a complaint, Schneider said. If the journal is not a COPE member, authors can check whether they participate in other professional associations that might take an interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If professional organizations and DOI registrars cannot help, the author does not have any obvious remedies,” she told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Bellut-Staeck detailed for Retraction Watch the extraordinary path her paper took her down. She originally submitted it to another journal, she said, where it was rejected. Around the same time, she received the submission invitation from <em>SCIREA Journal of Clinical Medicine. </em>She reviewed the journal’s profile, but “apparently not thoroughly enough,” she said. </p>



<p>After many failed attempts to reach the publisher about the correction, and before resorting to posting her own retraction notice, Bellut-Staeck had an idea. She transmitted a new “submission” through the journal’s submission portal. Instead of sending an article, she sent a request to contact her about the correction. </p>



<p>After nine days, the “submission” was accepted as if it were an article, according to Bellut-Staeck and correspondence we have seen. She then received a payment request for $460. When she didn’t respond, the journal sent <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Discount_Offer_Bellut-Staeck_Screenshot.png">a second, discounted offer of publication for $99</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For me, this meant that the publisher had finally crossed a red line, and it strengthened my resolve to unilaterally withdraw the work,” she told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher eventually corrected the affiliation error without communicating with Bellut-Staeck, she said. However, the researcher still wants a retraction because she has ethical concerns with the journal now and wants to protect her credibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the affiliation issue, Bellut-Staeck said the content of her paper is scientifically correct and remains fully valid. She hopes to reintegrate the important results of her work into a new publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an attempt to get the journal’s side of the story, we sent emails to the <a href="https://www.scirea.org/contact">four email addresses listed</a> on <em>SCIREA’s Journal of Clinical Medicine’s</em> contact page. Two of the messages were undeliverable because the addresses could not be found. No one responded from the other two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal has no editor-in-chief listed on its website, and no one named as a contact for the publication. The site does list <a href="https://www.scirea.org/journal/EditorialBoard?JournalID=32000">more than 90 members</a> on its editorial board from institutions across the world. Few board members returned messages by Retraction Watch seeking comment, and those who did respond said they were not affiliated with the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer researcher Bene Akromaa Ekine-Afolabi, for example, told us she is not a member of the board and only learned she is on the journal’s website when we contacted her. Ekine-Afolabi is listed as affiliated with an institution at which she had a role 15 years ago, the University of East London School of Health, Sport and Bioscience. She has since contacted the journal, asking it to remove her name.</p>



<p>Cardiologist Nassir Azimi also told us he’s not affiliated with the journal. He learned he is included on the journal’s purported board when we&nbsp; contacted him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to routes for researchers unhappy with a publisher’s response – or lack thereof – authors can always formally update their views on an earlier work and try to bring attention to the changes. Authors can, for instance, write or share a new document online or in an editorial, said Schneider. But the updates can be challenging to publicize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These commentaries about a publication — whether in an online post or an editorial — can be difficult to find unless the original publisher makes similar links,” she said. “Readers would have to search specifically for such documents.”</p>

<p>MDPI has retracted a study about vaping that one expert said seemed “like a joke” almost two years after the publisher received a complaint about the flawed work.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2035-8377/14/2/37">paper</a>, published in <em>Neurology International</em> in 2022, reported e-cigarette users had a higher risk of early stroke than traditional tobacco users. It has been cited 22 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10177441/E-cigarette-users-15-likely-suffer-stroke-middle-age-regular-smokers.html">covered in the media</a>, featured in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240318124219/https:/www.undo.org/exposed/big-tobacco-fantasyland">a public campaign against vaping</a> and included in a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9E38A75C420D1F19DA0D48C37FA8D8?utm_source=Firefox&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Firefox">contested</a><a href="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/EVIDoa2300229?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">meta-analysis</a>.</p>



<p>But the study contained critical errors, as we reported in 2024 in a story for <em>Science</em> that investigated paper mill-like <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">businesses dangling quick-and-dirty publications</a> for international medical graduates looking for residency positions in the United States.</p>



<span id="more-133936"></span>



<p>The corresponding author, Urvish Patel, is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240328141542/https:/researchupdate.org/team/urvish-patel/">founder and director</a> of one such outfit, the Texas-based <a href="https://researchupdate.org/">Research Update Organization</a>. Several or all of his coauthors were international medical graduates who paid to be part of the program. The paper did not mention this fact, but instead misrepresented Patel as being affiliated with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.</p>



<p>At the time of our <em>Science</em> story, Patel defended his publication, telling us it “described very well [the] methodology, data, every single thing.” But experts we consulted were not impressed. Biostatistician and epidemiologist Miguel Hernán of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, for example, told us the “paper seems like a joke” and said no “self-respecting journal should have published this.”</p>



<p>The journal’s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2035-8377/17/12/207">retraction notice</a> from December 18 states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding several major errors in the data analysis, raising concerns about the validity of the findings.</p>



<p>Adhering to our complaint procedure, an investigation was conducted by the Editorial Office and Editorial Board. Although the authors initially cooperated, they were unable to provide satisfactory explanations or supporting material to resolve the issues identified.

<p>The authors did not agree to the retraction, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patel told us by email he had “a lot to say as usually it won’t take 3.5” years for “3 multivariate” regression models and “10-12 chi-square tests to be proven wrong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But there is no meaning in talking with either faustian or hypocrite person,” he wrote. “I wish I would not choose this topic for research.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The anti-vaping campaign featuring the study was how it first caught the attention of Gal Cohen and Floe Foxon, both of whom work for companies that provide contract research and have ties to e-cigarette maker Juul Labs. Cohen is Head of Scientific Affairs at the Rose Research Center, and Foxon is a data scientist at Pinney Associates. In late 2023 and early 2024, the two sent several emails to Patel asking about his work, but did not receive any helpful information in reply.</p>



<p>On March 4, 2024, Cohen and Foxon submitted a comment to <em>Neurology International</em> describing all of their concerns, which included a glaring error in the sample size reported in the paper, insufficient stroke observations and a lack of information on whether the strokes occurred before or after vaping began.</p>



<p>In May of that year, following the publication of our <em>Science</em> story, the journal told Cohen and Foxon that instead of publishing their comment, it would initiate an investigation into Patel’s work, according to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1F118DC9A92A4FC13507BB5448462D#2">a PubPeer comment</a> from March 2025 in which the pair laid out the problems with the paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To date,” they wrote, “the only public action taken by <em>Neurology International</em> has been to quietly remove the ‘Editor’s Choice’ badge from the article.”</p>



<p>Finally, on December 18, an MDPI employee told Foxon the publisher had “investigated the article of concern. As a result, our Editorial Board and the Editor in Chief determined that there were too many scientific flaws and decided to retract this article.”</p>



<p>MDPI did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s reassuring to see the journal take necessary action on such flawed research, and they do deserve some credit for that,” Foxon told us.</p>



<p>“Of course, there is the fundamental question of how this article was published in the first place,” he added. “It seems there are so many errors that anyone remotely familiar with this dataset and these methods should have spotted the issues a country mile away.”</p>

                For decades, Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been viewed as a disorder of the brain. This perspective was shaped by the presence of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates throughout the brain, combined with the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Collectively, these dysfunctions drive the devastating motor symptoms, speech difficulties, and cognitive decline that characterise PD. However, recent research challenges this brain-centric view. Alpha-synuclein has been identified to appear in the...

<p>In a new memoir, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kangaroo-Dreams-Prof-Tuan-Nguyen/dp/1965142613"><em>Kangaroo Dreams</em></a>, Tuan V. Nguyen, D.Sc., Ph.D., provides a unique perspective on medical research. Nguyen escaped Vietnam in 1981 as part of the mass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people">“boat people”</a> exodus of refugees, taking to dangerous waters just a few months after his older brother attempted the same and disappeared. Making his way to Australia through grit and luck in 1982, Nguyen started his new life as a dishwasher before steadily building a career in science, ultimately specializing in bone research.</p>



<p>Nguyen is now distinguished professor of predictive medicine and director of the Center for Health Technologies at the University of Technology Sydney and adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales. He’s also a Leadership Fellow of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and a member of the Order of Australia. Dedicated to the memory of his lost brother, <em>Kangaroo Dreams</em> weaves Nguyen’s personal journey with a thoughtful examination of contemporary medical research. We interviewed him in writing to learn more. (Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.)</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: You were co-author on </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/367284a0"><strong>a 1994 <em>Nature</em> paper</strong></a><strong> subsequently </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/387106a0"><strong>corrected in 1997</strong></a><strong> which reported individuals with a particular vitamin D receptor gene benefitted from relatively high bone mineral density. When the research team made this finding, you write, “A nagging unease, however, bothered me. The results, while undeniably impressive, seemed almost too good to be true.” The team published the findings only to discover – after a <em>Nature</em> reader challenged the results – that a lab member who was ill likely contaminated samples, skewing the results. Did you regret not having pushed harder on your initial doubts? What held you back?</strong></p>



<span id="more-133901"></span>



<p>Nguyen: I come from a cultural background, particularly in Vietnam, where respect for teachers and senior colleagues is considered an ethical obligation rather than a matter of courtesy. This principle strongly shapes how junior scientists engage in professional discourse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In retrospect, I sometimes wish I had expressed my reservations more directly. At the time, however, as a junior member of the team, my response was shaped by a strong cultural and professional norm of deference to senior colleagues, limited experience, and a good-faith expectation that the results would be independently validated through subsequent work anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This experience became an important lesson for me in the need to actively insist on rigorous validation, particularly when findings appear unusually strong.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Why did it take three years to publish a correction</strong>?</p>



<p>Nguyen: The reader’s question prompted a careful re-examination of thousands of original samples. Investigating the matter, including confirming the likely source of sample contamination and re-running the analyses, required time and thoroughness. This process was followed by internal discussions and coordination among the co-authors to ensure a shared understanding of the findings. The journal’s correction procedures also contributed to the overall timeline. Importantly, after the analysis was completed, the main conclusions of the study remained unchanged, which was a considerable relief for all of us. Once the evidence was clear and fully documented, we proceeded with the correction.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Tell us briefly about the “experiment” you conducted which validated your suspicion about bias against papers authored by people with Vietnamese names.</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: At the time, I was running two research labs, one in Australia and one in Vietnam. In Vietnam, I had established a large, population-based prospective study with the support of many dedicated physicians and scientists. As this work progressed, I observed a recurring pattern: manuscripts from my Vietnamese lab received reviews that I regarded as unfair and unprofessional. Some were distinctly patronizing and, in certain cases, intimidating in tone. In some instances, reviewers raised statistically incorrect criticisms, even though I have extensive expertise in this area, having served as a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics and as a statistical editor for three medical journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, some submissions were desk rejected with little or no explanation. Sometimes, the stated reason was that the work “added little to the literature,” despite the fact that these studies were genuinely novel. I also observed instances in which conceptually similar studies conducted in Western populations were subsequently published, while our previous work in Vietnam addressing the same questions with more rigor was deemed insufficiently original.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This prompted me to explore whether factors such as author affiliation or name recognition might be influencing editorial decisions. To do this, we submitted essentially similar manuscripts to the same journal, varying only the authorship. In the initial submission, all authors were based in Vietnam, and the manuscript was desk rejected. Several months later, a closely comparable version, now including my name and that of an Australian colleague, was submitted and was sent out for external review. At that point, we withdrew the manuscript and informed the editors of what we had done.</p>



<p>Although this was not a formal study, the outcome was consistent with my own experience and with broader discussions in the literature regarding unconscious bias in peer review, particularly as it relates to authors and institutions from lower-resource countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RW: We frequently report on paper mills, citation cartels and the like, and these often are located in developing nations. Do you think our reporting is adding to the bias, and what would you advise?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: I have followed Retraction Watch with great interest for many years, as its reporting consistently reflects issues I have encountered firsthand in practice. Drawing in part on insights from your reporting, I have for 20 years raised concerns about research and publication ethics in Vietnam through the popular press and books written in Vietnamese.</p>

<p>I consider that your reporting is essential in uncovering genuine misconduct and in safeguarding the integrity of scientific research, irrespective of geography. That said, there is a possibility that sustained emphasis on particular regions may unintentionally reinforce certain perceptions or stereotypes, especially if comparable issues elsewhere receive less attention. For example, researchers in economically advanced countries also publish in predatory or questionable journals and engage in a range of questionable research practices, such as salami publication or <em>p</em>-hacking. Highlighting these issues across diverse settings can help ensure a more balanced and contextualized understanding of research integrity challenges.</p>



<p>So, my suggestion would be to continue this important work. At the same time, it may be helpful to place greater emphasis on the broader, systemic drivers of misconduct, such as publication pressure and incentive structures that operate across all research systems. Where possible, including more cases from high-income settings would add valuable context. Taken together, this broader coverage can help ensure that the focus remains on practices and structures, rather than on geography alone.</p>



<p><strong>RW: In your book, you explore the dangers of narcissism to science. What do you think academics should do when they spot narcissism in a potential collaborator? In a detractor? In a mentee?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: Over the course of my career, I have encountered many individuals with strong narcissistic traits in science. They can be intellectually stimulating colleagues, and some are undoubtedly highly talented. At the same time, these traits can present challenges in collaborative and mentoring contexts.</p>



<p>For potential collaborators, it is sensible to proceed with some caution. Reviewing their track record for equitable credit-sharing, collegiality, and ethical conduct can be helpful. If concerns arise, such as excessive self-promotion or a history of difficult collaborations, it may be wise to limit the scope of engagement or, if necessary, decline involvement.</p>



<p>For detractors, maintaining professionalism is the key. I find it helpful to focus discussions strictly on data, methods, and evidence, while documenting interactions and avoiding personal escalation. This approach helps keep disagreements constructive and protects one’s own position.</p>



<p>For mentees, early and thoughtful mentoring is particularly important. Setting clear expectations, modeling humility, and encouraging self-reflection can help channel ambition toward productive, collaborative outcomes. When left unaddressed, these traits can be detrimental not only to individuals but also to research groups and institutions.</p>



<p><strong>RW: It has been very challenging to stop bad behavior in the sciences, partly because of the problem of self-interested institutions, as you note in your book. Do you suppose there should be some system for weeding out or at least being vigilant about problem personalities in the sciences? And if so, what would that look like?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: I would be cautious about any formal mechanism designed to “weed out” individuals, as such approaches risk misuse and unnecessary punishment. A more constructive approach is to focus on systems and institutional culture, rather than on labeling people.</p>



<p>For example, institutions could strengthen anonymous and well-protected channels for reporting bullying or misconduct. They could provide regular training in research ethics and professional conduct. Broader forms of feedback, such as 360-degree evaluations, could also be incorporated into promotion and leadership decisions. In addition, greater transparency around conflicts of interest, particularly for reviewers and editors, would help build trust in the system.</p>



<p>In addition, I think professional societies and funding agencies can play an important role. They can recognize and reward behaviors that promote collegiality, integrity, and mentorship, rather than focusing exclusively on narrow performance metrics. In my view, lasting improvement is more likely to arise from sustained cultural change and shared accountability than from purely punitive approaches.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Is there a role for overtly teaching humility in scientific training?</strong></p>



<p>Nguyen: Yes, but it should be framed as a professional skill essential to scientific rigor, rather than as a moral trait.</p>



<p>In my cultural background, modesty and humility are considered professional and social norms. In other settings, however, humility may be interpreted as weakness, while overconfidence is sometimes rewarded as a sign of competence. In science, this inversion is problematic: overconfidence increases the risk of bias, discourages serious engagement with uncertainty, and can lead to premature or overstated conclusions.</p>



<p>For this reason, there is a strong case for giving humility more explicit attention in scientific training, alongside technical and methodological skills. Science advances through collective effort, and progress depends on recognizing uncertainty, fallibility, and the contributions of others. Humility, in this sense, underpins good judgment, reproducibility, and collaboration.</p>



<p>Early in my career, my institute director, a widely respected figure in DNA research, regularly reminded us to be modest and to share credit. This advice shaped my own approach to mentorship and is something I consciously pass on to my students.</p>



<p>Humility can also be addressed through structured training. In Vietnam, I have led workshops and seminars on research ethics and facilitated discussions of historical cases in which overconfidence or unrecognized bias led to serious scientific error. These settings allow trainees to see humility not as self-effacement, but as a safeguard against flawed reasoning.</p>



<p>That said, mentorship plays a central role in shaping scientific values. I was fortunate to train under a physician–scientist of exceptional integrity, who consistently modeled openness to critique, respect for replication, and a willingness to revise conclusions in light of new evidence. When demonstrated in practice, these principles are often absorbed more deeply than through formal instruction alone.</p>



<p>Thus, by treating humility as a core professional competency, essential to methodological rigor, we can strengthen both scientific outcomes and research culture.</p>
