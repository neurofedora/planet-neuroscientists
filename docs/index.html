                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Deepak Panday will talk about his paper in the presentation entitled &quot;CEPS: An Open Access MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Analysis of Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Background: We developed CEPS as an open access MATLAB® GUI (graphical user interface) for
the analysis of Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals (CEPS), and demonstrate
its use with an example data set that shows the effects of paced breathing (PB) on
variability of heart, pulse and respiration rates. CEPS is also sufficiently adaptable to
be used for other time series physiological data such as EEG (electroencephalography),
postural sway or temperature measurements. Methods: Data were collected from a convenience
sample of nine healthy adults in a pilot for a larger study investigating the effects on
vagal tone of breathing paced at various different rates, part of a development programme
for a home training stress reduction system. Results: The current version of CEPS focuses
on those complexity and entropy measures that appear most frequently in the literature,
together with some recently introduced entropy measures which may have advantages over
those that are more established. Ten methods of estimating data complexity are currently
included, and some 28 entropy measures. The GUI also includes a section for data pre-
processing and standard ancillary methods to enable parameter estimation of embedding
dimension m and time delay τ (‘tau’) where required. The software is freely available
under version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3) for non-commercial
users. CEPS can be downloaded from Bitbucket. In our illustration on PB, most complexity
and entropy measures decreased significantly in response to breathing at 7 breaths per
minute, differentiating more clearly than conventional linear, time- and frequency-domain
measures between breathing states. In contrast, Higuchi fractal dimension increased during
paced breathing. Conclusions: We have developed CEPS software as a physiological data
visualiser able to integrate state of the art techniques. The interface is designed for
clinical research and has a structure designed for integrating new tools. The aim is to
strengthen collaboration between clinicians and the biomedical community, as demonstrated
here by using CEPS to analyse various physiological responses to paced breathing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urinary-tract-infection-pain-uti">Here’s why pain might last after persistent urinary tract infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>Urinary tract infections are painful, inconvenient and incredibly common. For decades, doctors haven’t had any leads on why, even after several rounds of antibiotics, UTI pain can linger. Now they do.</p>



<p>Nerve growth from <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adi5578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune responses to the infection might be to blame</a>, researchers report March 1 in <em>Science Immunology. </em>Understanding immune and nerve responses to persistent UTIs, the team says, could possibly lead to new, antibiotic-free forms of treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749018/#:~:text=Around%2050%E2%80%9360%25%20of%20women,causes%20UTIs%20in%20most%20patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over half of women will have a UTI</a> in their life, and around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502976/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quarter of infections come back within six months</a>. The pain from these infections can be quite difficult to treat, says Marcus Drake, a neurological urologist at Imperial College London. “It’s a ‘<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heartsink situation</a>’ for the patients, and it’s a heartsink situation for the doctors, because there isn’t much that you can do.”</p>



<p>Puzzled by why pain persisted after UTI-related bacteria were wiped out, immunologist Soman Abraham of Duke University and colleagues collected urine samples from women with recurring infections. Compared with samples of women without recurring UTIs, these showed signs of nerve activation.</p>



<p>To better understand what was happening at the tissue level, the team induced multiple UTIs in mice. Compared with uninfected mice, “we saw a tremendous growth of nerves,” Abraham says. But that only confirmed what the team suspected about humans. The researchers still wanted to know what spurred the nerves to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abraham knew that when the urinary tract is infected, one of the bladder’s first defenses is to shed a tissue layer to remove bacteria. But in this process, nerves are sloughed off, which jolts nerve-growing immune cells into action. A close look at the bladder tissue of the mice with repeat UTIs revealed an abundance of two kinds of immune cells.</p>



<p>Specifically, there were high levels of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/role-change-mast-cells-show-anti-inflammatory-side">mast cells</a>, which are stored in bladder tissue and produce a substance called nerve growth factor (<em>SN: 9/5/07</em>). And there were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/not-so-dispensable-spleen">monocytes</a>, blood-based immune cells that rush to the site of infection to produce even more nerve growth factor (<em>SN: 7/30/09</em>). Similar to respiratory infections, the more often the body has to fight off bladder infections, the better it gets at it; monocytes and mast cells get faster at their job with each UTI. “The unfortunate part is [it becomes] an overzealous response,” Abraham says.</p>



<p>Pain continues because nerve growth factor doesn’t just generate nerve growth; it also lowers the threshold at which nerve pain and pressure receptors activate. Even after no infection-related bacteria remained, the mice in the study had frequent urination and showed signs of lingering pain. “The slightest, innocuous volume of urine was enough to trigger the voiding response,” Abraham says. But with antihistamines and blockers of nerve growth factor, the mice were able to feel some relief.</p>



<p>Right now, persistent pain in UTIs in humans is usually treated with anti-inflammatory or other pain-reducing drugs, including antihistamines, but all of these are a bit unsatisfactory, Drake says. The researchers hope that understanding how nerves grow with recurrent UTIs can lead to more effective pain relief treatments in the future.</p>

<p>A cardiologist in Pakistan has been selling coauthorship of his research papers to scientists, particularly medical students, who were not involved in the work, Retraction Watch has learned. Several of his articles were published after the journal learned of his underhand activities.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jahanzeb-malik-61ba36159_i-will-be-giving-a-talk-on-international-activity-6971470075463634944-5IZX?trk=public_profile">Jahanzeb Malik</a>, of the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, publishes in a variety of journals, including <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em> and <em>Cardiology in Review</em>, with a number of co-authors on each study. </p>



<p>However, not all of these authors contributed to the work. Malik, who is also a member of the <a href="https://archive.fo/pdj0L">Cardiovascular Analytics Group</a>, an international network of researchers, runs a WhatsApp messaging group titled &#8220;Research Associates,&#8221; where he posts about articles he is working on and offers authorship &#8220;slots&#8221; in exchange for money, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.05-PM.jpeg">messages</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.06-PM.jpeg">shown</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.07-PM-1.jpeg">to</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.07-PM.jpeg">Retraction</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.08-PM.jpeg">Watch</a> reveal. He has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/533203374144644/posts/1514936009304704/">advertised on the “United States Medical Licensing Examination Pakistan” Group Facebook page</a>, writing that he runs the group to &#8220;help students and other doctors in doing medical research and writing research papers.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going by the username &#8220;Darklord&#8221; on WhatsApp, Malik charges up to $300 for a first-author position. Less prominent positions on the manuscript can be bought for around $150. Malik has since changed his username to &#8220;Dr. Jahanzeb Malik&#8221; on the app.</p>



<span id="more-128848"></span>



<p>Asked about his response to these allegations, Malik told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are not selling author positions; all my coauthors are contributing according to the ICMJE criteria. Junior authors write all papers so they can learn and move ahead in manuscript writing. We only share funding when opting for an open-access journal. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>This type of group, known as a &#8220;paper mill,&#8221; has become increasingly common as academics and medical students have faced pressure to publish. A six-month Retraction Watch investigation <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">published last month</a> suggested the dean of the faculty of health sciences at Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias in Spain, Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas, bought his way onto nearly all of the papers he published last year.</p>



<p>Among more than 40 of the scientific articles advertised in Malik’s WhatsApp group over the past year, at least 13 have been published. The researcher appears as a coauthor on more than half of these, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014628062300542X?via%3Dihub">Safety and Efficacy of Ferric Carboxymaltose in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Iron Deficiency</a>; <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em></li>

</ul>



<p>A source who requested anonymity to avoid potential backlash from the authors in the papers learned about the group through a friend. After joining, the source reported Malik&#8217;s behavior to the editor-in-chief of <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em>, Hector O. Ventura, as well as its publisher Elsevier on October 15, 2023. Josie Liu, an associate publisher at Elsevier, wrote back saying the team took the concerns seriously and asked to allow &#8220;some time to closely investigate the issue.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, however, Malik has published four papers in the Elsevier title <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em>. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0146280623005820">One of them</a> matches a paper “Darklord” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-15-at-2.58.11-PM-1-1.jpeg">advertised on WhatsApp</a>.</p>



<p>Liu told the whistleblower on January 15 that Elsevier&#8217;s ethics team has been investigating the case and would &#8220;flag Dr. Jahanzeb Malik in the submission system.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked for comment, an Elsevier spokesperson told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are aware of the situation and our ethics and research integrity teams are indeed investigating. It is our policy to not comment on on-going investigations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also reached out to Ventura, the editor of <em>Current Problems in Cardiology,</em> but did not receive a response.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dune-planet-climate-plausible-science-sandworms">The desert planet in ‘Dune’ is plausible, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frank Herbert’s science fiction novel <em>Dune</em> has been praised for its worldbuilding. Herbert created complex societies, religions and economic systems all with rich histories.</p>



<p>Most famous of Herbert’s worlds is the desert planet Arrakis, nicknamed Dune, with its harsh climate and giant sandworms. The planet is the setting for most of the novel and movies based on the book. The second installment of the latest imagining from director Denis Villeneuve, <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, opens in theaters March 1.</p>



<p>Not only did Herbert create a rich fantasy world, he also built a plausible planet, says Alexander Farnsworth, a climate modeler at the University of Bristol in England.</p>



<p>A few years ago, Farnsworth and colleagues made <a href="https://theconversation.com/dune-we-simulated-the-desert-planet-of-arrakis-to-see-if-humans-could-survive-there-170181" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a computer simulation of the climate on Arrakis</a>. People could live on the desert planet, the team concluded, but Herbert probably should have relocated his cities closer to the equator than the poles.</p>



<p>As for the giant sandworms that can swallow mining equipment whole, they push the boundaries of what biology might achieve, says vertebrate paleontologist Patrick Lewis, of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> asked the experts what life on Arrakis might really be like and whether humans living on the planet would need to worry about being eaten by a giant worm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Building Arrakis</h2>



<p>For their Arrakis climate simulation, which you can <a href="https://climatearchive.org/dune.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore at the website Climate Archive</a>, Farnsworth and colleagues started with the well-known physics that drive weather and climate on Earth. Using our planet as a starting point makes sense, Farnsworth says, partly because Herbert drew inspiration for Arrakis from “some sort of semi-science of looking at dune systems on the Earth itself.”</p>



<p>The team then added nuggets of information about the planet from details in Herbert’s novels and in the <em>Dune Encyclopedia.</em> According to that intel, the fictional planet’s atmosphere is similar to Earth’s with a couple of notable differences. Arrakis has less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than Earth — about 350 parts per million on the desert planet compared with 417 parts per million on Earth. But Dune has far more ozone in its lower atmosphere: 0.5 percent of the gases in the atmosphere compared to Earth’s 0.000001 percent.</p>



<p>All that extra ozone is crucial for understanding the planet. Ozone is a powerful greenhouse gas, about 65 times as potent at warming the atmosphere as carbon dioxide is, when measured over a 20-year period. “Arrakis would certainly have a much warmer atmosphere, even though it has less CO<sub>2</sub> than Earth today,” Farnsworth says.</p>



<p>In addition to warming the planet, so much ozone in the lower atmosphere could be bad news. “For humans, that would be incredibly toxic, I think, almost fatal if you were to live under such conditions,” Farnsworth says. People on Arrakis would probably have to rely on technology to scrub ozone from the air.</p>



<p>Of course, ozone in the upper atmosphere could help shield Arrakis from harmful radiation from its star, Canopus. (Canopus is a real star also known as Alpha Carinae. It’s visible in the Southern Hemisphere and is the second brightest star in the sky. Unfortunately for <em>Dune</em> fans, it isn’t known to have planets.)</p>



<p>If Arrakis were real, it would be located about as far from Canopus as Pluto is from the sun, Farnsworth says. But Canopus is a large white star calculated to be about 7,200° Celsius. “That&#8217;s significantly hotter than the sun,” which runs about 2,000 degrees cooler, Farnsworth says. But “there&#8217;s a lot of supposition and assumptions they made in here, and whether those are accurate numbers or not, I can&#8217;t say.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A livable yet inhospitable world</h2>



<p>The climate simulation revealed that Arrakis probably wouldn’t be exactly as Herbert described it.</p>



<p>For instance, in one throwaway line, the author described polar ice caps receding in the summer heat. But Farnsworth and colleagues say it would be far too hot at the poles, about 70° C during the summer, for ice caps to exist at all. Plus, there would be too little precipitation to replenish the ice in the winter. High clouds and other processes would warm the atmosphere at the poles and keep it warmer than lower latitudes, especially in the summertime.</p>



<p>Although Herbert’s novels have people living in the midlatitudes and close to the poles, the extreme summer heat and bone-chilling −40° C to −75° C temperatures in the winters would make those regions nearly unlivable without technology, Farnsworth says.</p>



<p>Temperatures in Arrakis’ tropical latitudes would be relatively more pleasant at 45° C in the warmest months and about 15° C in colder months. On Earth, high humidity in the tropics makes it far warmer than at the poles. But on Arrakis, “most of the atmospheric moisture was essentially removed from the tropics,” making even the scorching summers more tolerable. The poles are where clouds and the paltry amount of moisture gather and heat the atmosphere.</p>



<p>But the tropics on Arrakis pose their own challenges. Hurricane force winds would regularly sandblast inhabitants and build <a href="https://theconversation.com/dune-how-high-could-giant-sand-dunes-actually-grow-on-arrakis-171902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dunes up to 250 meters tall</a>, the researchers calculate.</p>



<p>It doesn’t mean people couldn’t live on Arrakis, just that they’d need technology and lots of off-world support to bring in food and water, Farnsworth says. “I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a very livable world, just a very inhospitable world.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s hard to be a giant sandworm</h2>



<p>While humans could possibly get by with some help, the planet would probably not be survivable for its most famous residents: the gargantuan sandworms. “It&#8217;s hard to envision such a species with thermal tolerance [to live] in such a climate in such an ecosystem,” Farnsworth says.</p>



<p>Gigantic sandworms would also have other problems, says Lewis, the vertebrate paleontologist at Sam Houston State. At up to 400 meters long, the sandworms would be nearly 10 times the length of the biggest dinosaurs. That would be unusual for an animal with a long body, like a worm or snake. “The worm body plan is really common. It has evolved many times over the last 600 million years,” Lewis says. “But none of them have ever been very big.”</p>



<p>For invertebrate worms, the problem is oxygen, Lewis says. Worms often absorb oxygen through their skin to permeate their bodies. The larger the animal, the harder it would be to get oxygen to their internal organs.</p>



<p>Lewis figures that Dune’s giant sandworms must be vertebrates <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.25321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like <em>Zygaspis</em> worms from sub-Saharan Africa</a>. The species that he studies are considerably smaller: about 20 to 30 centimeters long and up to 7 millimeters thick. But that didn’t stop him from imagining what a <em>Dune</em>-sized vertebrate worm might be like.</p>



<p>Worms with bones and muscles could be bigger and stronger than invertebrates, Lewis says, but they would be limited by gravity. Whales can be big because they live in water, where buoyancy can do a lot of the heavy lifting. “But if you&#8217;re going to be on the surface, then you have to be able to fight gravity,” Lewis says. To reach more than about 150 meters long, “you would basically have to be a big ball of bone to keep from crushing under your own weight.”</p>



<p>Perhaps if Arrakis’ worms had skeletons made of superlight material that’s unknown on Earth, they could grow to such enormous size. But that poses a problem for moving around. “The bigger you get, the relatively weaker the muscles are, and so you&#8217;d need monstrously strong muscles” and “unbelievably thick bones” to attach them to, Lewis says. And muscles generate a lot of heat.</p>



<p><em>Zygaspis </em>worms can tolerate 45° C temperatures in the Kalahari Desert because they are small and have lots of surface area relative to their tiny size to shed heat, he says. But a giant sandworm wouldn’t be able to dump heat so readily: The bigger an animal is, the more volume it has to generate and store heat relative to the surface area it has to cool it. Combine the geometry problem with the weather and that spells trouble for colossal worms. “If you&#8217;re a giant worm, a hot climate is not your friend,” Lewis says.</p>



<p>If you’re a <em>Dune</em> fan contemplating the realities of life on Arrakis, you’re in luck. The planet would be a feasible, if harsh, place for humans to live. And the bonus is that you probably wouldn’t have to worry about getting eaten by a giant sandworm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tortoise-migration-galapagos-invasive-trees">Giant tortoise migration in the Galápagos may be stymied by invasive trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>After trudging upslope for weeks, a giant tortoise slows its hundreds of cumbersome kilograms to a stop. Dense woods defended by barbed wire–like blackberry bushes block its path. After a brief foray into the painful prickles, the tortoise backs out and plods on, searching for a way out of the woods.</p>



<p>These blackberry-lined forests of Spanish cedar trees (<em>Cedrela odorata</em>) are invasive in the tortoise’s island home in the Galápagos. If they can, these titanic turtles <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay clear of the new, troublesome habitats</a> on their seasonal uphill treks to find food, researchers report in the February <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>. If the <em>Cedrela</em> forests one day manage to block the shelled reptile’s migration altogether, the consequences for the tortoises and the surrounding island ecosystem could be dire, researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wildlife biologist Stephen Blake and his colleagues have been studying the movements of Western Santa Cruz tortoises (<em>Chelonoidis niger porteri</em>) since 2009. Tracking the reptiles’ positions with GPS tags and other mobile instruments previously revealed that some tortoises embark on weeks-long migrations to the highlands of Santa Cruz Island — as much as 400 meters above sea level over two to four weeks — and back. These traveling tortoises tend to be large and thus potentially vulnerable to food shortages: They lumber uphill during the dry season to feed on the higher-elevation vegetation that flourishes under a moist cloud bank.</p>



<p>“They’re basically doing the same thing that Serengeti wildebeest or Canadian elk do,” says Blake, of Saint Louis University in Missouri. “They follow the green.”</p>

<p>Years into the tortoise tracking project, Blake noticed that the reptile’s migration corridors appeared to line up with gaps in the highly invasive Spanish cedars that were visible in satellite images on Google Earth. The next logical question: Were the forests a problem for the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/9026/82777132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critically-endangered</a> tortoises?</p>



<p>The researchers analyzed about 10 years of migration data from 25 tagged adult tortoises, and overlaid 140 migration routes atop a map of Spanish cedar forests on the island. Most tortoises favored funneling into small gaps between <em>Cedrela</em> stands, one of which is only about 140 meters wide at its narrowest and two others around a kilometer and half a kilometer wide each. This is fairly slim compared with the island’s 40-kilometer width, especially when considering how thousands of &nbsp;tortoises might converge on these strips between July and November each year to march uphill. Only 12 trips made by three tortoises went through large patches of forest, and five tortoises consistently stopped their migration either right inside or at the blackberry border of a forest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve seen a few tortoises sort of bludgeon their way in through these thick patches of blackberry and can’t move,” Blake says. Some turn around and walk back out. For those that make it through, the cedar forest interior is well shaded, which Blake and his colleagues think makes it harder for the tortoises to stay warm. There’s also little food in there. “It&#8217;s just not an environment that they want to be spending a week trying to walk through,” he says.</p>

<p>This map shows 140 migratory paths (gray and black tracks) taken by Western Santa Cruz tortoises in the southwestern corner of Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos over 10 years. Most of the tortoises avoided cedar forests (green patches): Gray paths show segments walked outside of the forests and black mark segments walked within the forest. Tortoises mainly traveled through three small gaps (A, B and C) in the forest.</p>

<p>It’s still unknown if the available corridors through cedar patches could be closed by the trees’ spread. But if migration routes are choked off, the tortoises might be forced to eat a suboptimal diet, which could hurt the animals’ growth, health and reproduction, Blake says. The tortoises also spread seeds, turn up soil, bulldoze vegetation and create microhabitats wherever they shamble. Disrupting their travels may constrain their ecological influence.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be the first time invasive species <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-ant-lion-dinner-trees-ecosystem">precipitated reverberations throughout an ecosystem</a> (<em>SN: 1/25/24</em>). Specifically, plant invasions can have major impacts on animal behavior, says Peter Stewart, an ecologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland who published <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a literature review</a> of these effects in 2021. Invasive plants can alter “the ways that animals communicate, where they build their nests and lay their eggs, how they hunt for prey or avoid their own predators, and more,” Stewart says. “These behavioral changes can have some quite profound consequences for the animal species, as well as for the wider ecosystem and for people.”</p>



<p>Countering the <em>Cedrela</em> invasion is a thorny task. Removing the trees could just allow a sea of blackberries to take their place, Blake points out, creating new problems. Additionally, the trees’ high-value timber is important to the local economy. Somewhat paradoxically, the invasive trees are considered <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/32292/68080590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerable to extinction</a> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in their native ranges in Central America, the Caribbean and much of mainland South America.</p>



<p>The trees now grow throughout the Galápagos and are generally “devastating” to native ecosystems, Blake says. More research on where and how fast the cedars are spreading — and if they can be effectively removed — is crucial.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/obesity-1-billion-people-world">More than 1 billion people worldwide are now estimated to have obesity</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s no secret that global obesity rates have been rising over the past few decades. But a new analysis quantifies the upsurge.</p>



<p>More than <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02750-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion people worldwide were living with obesity</a> as of 2022, researchers report February 29 in the <em>Lancet</em>. That’s about one-eighth of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/world-population-8-billion-humans-earth">global population</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>11/15/22</em>). For comparison, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32129-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 800 million people had obesity in 2016</a>, according to the World Health Organization, or WHO.</p>



<p>Obesity is “defined by the presence of excess body fat that impairs health,” says obesity expert Arya Sharma of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who was not involved in the study. The chronic disease can raise the risk for conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-obesity-risk-factor">vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19</a>, and can also limit mobility and negatively affect mental health (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>Global health researcher Majid Ezzati and colleagues examined more than 3,600 population-based studies published over the last several decades encompassing 222 million participants across nearly 200 countries and territories. The researchers divided each participant’s reported weight by their height squared to find their body mass index, or BMI.</p>



<p>Analyzing the trends suggested that in 2022, almost 900 million adults worldwide had a BMI of 30 or above, classifying them as having obesity. In children and adolescents ages 5 to 19, nearly 160 million were estimated to have the chronic disease, defined as BMI above a certain point on the <a href="https://www.who.int/tools/growth-reference-data-for-5to19-years/indicators/bmi-for-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHO&#8217;s growth reference curves</a>, which account for age and sex.</p>



<p>From 1990 to 2022, the prevalence of obesity <a href="https://www.ncdrisc.org/double-burden-paper-media-link-A1h31/obesity-prevalence-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly doubled in women, tripled in men</a> and <a href="https://www.ncdrisc.org/double-burden-paper-media-link-A1h31/obesity-prevalence-map-ado.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quadrupled in children and adolescents</a>. At the same time, global rates of those who were underweight fell. “We shouldn’t be thinking about [underweight and obesity] as two separate things, because the transition from one to the other has been very rapid,” says Ezzati, of Imperial College London.</p>



<p>The estimated obesity rates should raise alarms, he says. “Governments and societies need to deal with this” through prevention and medical care. Despite <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023">new anti-obesity medications</a> like Wegovy showing incredible results, Ezzati adds, their high costs and lack of incorporation in worldwide medical guidance will make them inaccessible to most people for the near future (<em>SN: 12/13/23</em>).</p>



<p>Ezzati notes that one of the biggest driving factors of obesity’s increased prevalence is limited access to and the unaffordability of healthy foods. Sharma adds that societal-level lifestyle changes — such as getting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americans-are-sleeping-less-they-were-13-years-ago">less sleep</a>, increased stress levels and spending less time at home — can also lead to eating more <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-ultraprocessed-food-weight-gain-nutrition-studies">processed foods</a> and overconsumption (<em>SN:</em> <em>12/21/18</em>;<em> SN: 5/16/19</em>).</p>



<p>“When you look at appetite, there’s a complex biology behind it,” Sharma says. “And that biology is affected by environmental changes.”</p>

<p><em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em> is excited to announce that it has expanded its scope to include animal studies! Animal models in infectious diseases serve as invaluable tools, allowing scientists to bridge the gap between the laboratory and the complex realities of human infections. Understanding and treating infectious diseases hinges upon the crucial role of animal models in unravelling host-pathogen interactions, predicting human responses, and exploring therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p><strong>A new collection: Animal models in infectious diseases</strong></p>
<p>In celebration of this scope expansion, <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em> has launched a new Collection &#8220;Animal models in infectious diseases&#8221;. This Collection aims to spotlight the significance of animal models in infectious diseases research, providing a platform for comprehensive exploration across various disciplines.

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>. The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. This is the third blog in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=einstein-awards-program">5-part series</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Global South, comprising a majority of the world&rsquo;s population, lives in knowledge production ecosystems which are not fully captured in formal institutions. Universities are not necessarily at the heart of knowledge creation in the South. Academic institutions often suffer from political capture, limited academic freedom, resource constraints and little access-to-networks to develop long term research expertise. Much of the knowledge mobilization happens outside the academe&ndash;through actors like nonprofits, think tanks, activists, local communities, and social movement activists. Much of this knowledge remains disaggregated, inaccessible and anecdotal. The net result then is its unrecognized potential for building general models for understanding the world, and longer gestation period for existing models to translate into policy action.</p>



<p>If one considers for instance, informal markets. More than 90 percent of Indian workforce is informal in nature, and yet, the modern economics is built around the assumption of formal contract and property rights in place, with informal contracts relegated to some footnotes, rendering invisible much of what the Global South studies experiences in their day-to-day experience. Consider another instance of programs for economic reform and debts. The bulk of the university or institutional top down research tends to focus on macroeconomic implications and ignore household debts. For many borrowers, loan recovery is done through the full force of criminal laws, something expressly prohibited under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. Yet countries as diverse as India, Nigeria and Egypt all lean on similar approaches to debt recovery&ndash;with women being particularly disadvantaged. A third example includes knowledge production around Climate Change. It is an intensely political subject in some Global North contexts such as the USA; and globally, Climate Change is enmeshed with democratic and other social movements. . Studying its effects, therefore, cuts across disciplines, and the formal and informal divide of where knowledge is located. The absence of frameworks to holistically understand the Global South experiences leads to knowledge production models and systems with hugely inefficient outcomes. Focusing solely on the the university-centric model, &nbsp;therefore, gives us an incomplete picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our project studies and aims to offer a comprehensive global platform and network to unify some of the different sites through which knowledge is produced, mobilized and disseminated in the South. Academics in the South wear multiple hats &ndash; they work in traditional research spaces but also practice and connect with local knowledge centers, activists and community actors and organizations, and even governments. The overlaps and exchanges between these actors generate knowledge, mobilize it, and drive calls to action. These knowledge stakeholders could be called as scholactivists. They innovate models of knowledge production and mobilization by integrating or strengthening the links between formal knowledge and the tacit knowledge gained through experience of actors on the ground.</p>



<p>We propose to work through a range of methods to build knowledge/data from the ground up through the local/informal sites of knowledge production and connect them to formal institutional networks.&nbsp;There is a need to introduce diverse and plural perspectives into the mainstream and dominant knowledge models. The dominant model of knowledge creation has indeed been built around assumptions about a simple transfer from North to South. This approach pushes formal models that work in the North, into the South for reform projects without taking into consideration context, culture, history and politics. The Global South, therefore, provides fertile grounds to study how we can unify knowledge systems and make them more resilient in larger and real-world contexts.&nbsp;The project is therefore about recognizing the plural sites of knowledge production, something that will integrate and transform knowledge globally.</p>



<p>The project has two components, namely (a) curation (with online repository, regulatory mapping, and resources for scholars at risk), and (b) research component (with global and regional workshop and supporting communities within and outside academia). One of our hopes is that this project helps build legacies and shapes alternative futures. In the Global South, where we are claiming knowledge resides in the intersection of overlapping, dynamic and often informal fields, legacy building becomes challenging. Knowledge is neither systematized, nor institutionalized, or carried forth.&nbsp;Building knowledge systems takes generations and the task ahead of us is intergenerational to build knowledge commons and reinforce the power of community.</p>

<p>A recent review article whose authors included two assistant professors at universities in the United States was written by a physician in India who is running a paper mill, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/13/10/926">Current Status and Emerging Trends in Colorectal Cancer Screening and Diagnostics</a>” appeared last year in a special issue of <em>Biosensors</em>, an MDPI title. The article came to our attention because <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/23/exclusive-mayo-florida-profs-among-authors-of-article-tied-to-indian-paper-mill/#comments">it matched an ad</a> posted by the Indian paper mill iTrilon, as we reported earlier this year;&nbsp; some of the author names appeared on other iTrilon publications as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two assistant professors – <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/liu-yuguang-ph-d/bio-20503555">Yuguang Liu</a> of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and <a href="https://floridapoly.edu/directory/faculty/ajeet-kaushik.php">Ajeet Kaushik</a> of Florida Polytechnic University in Lakeland – have not previously been tied to paper-mill publications and denied any knowledge of the ad.</p>



<span id="more-128846"></span>



<p>According to MDPI, the link between the review and iTrilon was too weak to warrant investigation – a stance the publisher has since revised. New evidence we obtained and shared with MDPI shows the paper’s first author, <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-shreya-singh-60a4331a8">Shreya Singh Beniwal</a>, is no stranger to the seedy haunts of scholarly publishing. (Beniwal lists her affiliation as Lady Hardinge Medical College, in Delhi, on her papers, although <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dr._Shreya_Singh_-_Lady_Hardinge_Medical_College_-_Bayern_Tyskland_LinkedIn_-_2024-02-25_21.36.31-scaled.jpg">her LinkedIn page</a> states she left the school in 2021.)</p>



<p>As evidenced by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RPReplay_Final1708765610.mp4">a video</a> shared with us by an anonymous tipster, Beniwal manages a sprawling network of groups and communities on the messaging platform WhatsApp. There, she and a colleague peddle author slots on research papers for between $50 and $500 each.</p>



<p>On Dec. 18, 2023, for instance, Beniwal posted an ad for “Paper 301” to one of her WhatsApp communities – “Research Projects: Review Articles, systematic Review And Meta-analysis Community 1” –&nbsp; promising acceptance in a Scopus-indexed journal within a month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authorship of the article, which was titled “Assessment of effects on cardiovascular system in systemic hepatocellular carcinoma therapy: A meta analysis,” came with a price tag of 38,000 Indian rupees (about $460) for the first position, dropping to 29,000 Indian rupees ($350) for the tenth.</p>



<p>The paper mill operation seems tied to a murky, fee-based membership organization called <a href="http://web.archive.org/save/https:/www.thegara.co.in/">The Global Achievers Research Academy</a> (GARA), which is also managed, at least in part, by Beniwal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a document shown in the video, members get access to support and training related to research, networking and scientific writing. Some apparently are eligible for an upgrade with extra perks. In an announcement posted to her WhatsApp community “Research Ambassadors,” Beniwal congratulated “Our Ambassadors Who Have Reached Team Milestones!” and invited them to join the community where the ad for “Paper 301” appeared.</p>



<p>Beniwal, who goes by the username “Dr.” on the messaging app, also welcomed the “research ambassadors” to a network called “ExquisiteGARA: The Gateway to Advanced Research and Analysis.” Participation came with such benefits as “designations like ‘Senior Ambassador’ or ‘Coordinator’” and “free participation and potential authorship for recruiting new members.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She proceeded to list “Our Recent Publications,” which counted the <em>Biosensors</em> review and <a href="https://archive.fo/aON4t">an earlier paper</a> of hers that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">precisely matched an iTrilon ad</a> and has since been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/25/journal-pulls-papers-following-retraction-watch-investigation/">quietly withdrawn</a>, as we reported in January.</p>



<p>In a notice posted later to the community where the ad for “Paper 301” appeared, Beniwal explained that “Participants at ExquisiteGARA” would need to pay two separate fees: a non-refundable “participation fee” as well as publication charges to be “equally shared among all members involved in the project.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we embark on various exciting research projects at ExquisiteGARA, it is crucial for all participating members to clearly understand the financial aspects associated with these projects,” the notice stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beniwal deactivated the community featuring the “Paper 301” ad in January, shortly before the publication of a six-month Retraction Watch investigation in <em>Science</em> that focused on how iTrilon and other paper mills had <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.zrjehzt">infiltrated journals across the globe</a>. But she and a colleague with the WhatsApp handle “Education” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Beniwal-replay-2.mp4">continue the authorship trade</a> elsewhere on the platform.</p>



<p>In WhatsApp and email exchanges with Retraction Watch, Beniwal denied selling authorship. “And there was not any selling regarding my [<em>Biosensors</em> review] paper. All authors worked ethically and we have worked on it for months. There must be some misunderstanding regarding it,” she told us.</p>



<p>She said of her and her coauthors:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We connected with each other with the help of LinkedIn and WhatsApp groups with friends and colleague&#8217;s [sic] help and connections&#8230;&#8230; also I have got connections with corresponding author in the same way. Most of the paper was written by me including few figures and initial 5 sections and remaining task was handled by corresponding author by adding other members&#8230;.. as they also contributed in writing some parts and final revisions were done after that depending upon revision related comments by journal. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>ExquisiteGARA, Beniwal added, is not a “platform to sell the papers. That is for workshops.” In the video we received “the good things are hidden and are being misinterpreted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked about her affiliation with Lady Hardinge Medical College, Beniwal dodged the question and responded angrily, “Why I am even talking to you here. I am not answerable to your silly questions.”</p>



<p>A representative of MDPI told us on behalf of <em>Biosensors’</em> editorial office:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Thank you for providing us with further details. We have also conducted a comprehensive investigation internally via our Research Integrity department. As a result, we have identified and confirmed Dr. Shreya Singh Beniwal involvement in certain unethical activities and situations related to paper mills and authorship selling activities. The published article is presently under investigation as well, and in terms of future actions, we will keep adhering to COPE guidelines and recommendations. Each submission will be meticulously evaluated on a case-by-case basis, employing standard checks and screening procedures. We will maintain high level of vigilance, particularly when dealing with suspicious activities associated with paper mills that have been previously identified through online records. We will engage in thorough discussions with the journal&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief and members of the Editorial Board to address this matter effectively.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-soil-hurricane-land-brown-ocean-effect">Waterlogged soils can give hurricanes new life after they arrive on land</a></h4>

              
                <p>Once a hurricane makes landfall, it’s usually the beginning of the end for the storm. But a <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/104ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/440195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tropical cyclone passing over warm, waterlogged ground</a> can get a jolt of energy that refuels its fury, researchers reported in January at the American Meteorological Society’s meeting in Baltimore.</p>



<p>This phenomenon, called the brown ocean effect, mimics how the ocean fuels tropical cyclones by giving the storms a ready supply of water and heat. Understanding this effect, researchers say, could help forecasters warn residents that an inland hurricane might counterintuitively strengthen.</p>



<p>Using satellite measurements of wind speeds, rainfall and soil moisture, geologist Dev Niyogi and colleagues examined how this effect was at play for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-climate-change-fueling-hurricane-florence">Hurricane Florence, a relatively weak storm when it made landfall</a> in the Carolinas in September 2018 (<em>SN: 9/13/18</em>). The data revealed a powerful feedback mechanism: As Florence passed over already-soaking soil, its rains intensified, ultimately leading to record-breaking rainfall and flooding.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s one of the first observational confirmations of this long-hypothesized phenomenon, says Niyogi, of the University of Texas at Austin. The brown ocean effect can also help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-hurricanes-landfall-lingering-longer-staying-stronger">some storms stay strong longer</a> as they travel over land, he says, allowing them to penetrate deeper inland before dissipating (<em>SN: 11/11/2020)</em>.</p>



<p>The idea of the brown ocean effect was described in 2013 by atmospheric scientist Marshall Shepherd and geographer Theresa Andersen, prompted in part by the very strange evolution of Tropical Storm Erin in 2007. The storm was weak and disorganized when it made landfall, but as it drifted northwest toward Oklahoma, it encountered flooded ground due to heavy rains that year. The storm suddenly strengthened, puzzling scientists as it even formed an eye for the first time.</p>



<p>Computer simulations have long suggested that wetter soils can intensify monsoon rains as well as cyclones. “Water evaporates from the ocean as water vapor, but when it gets into hurricanes, it condenses,” says Shepherd, of the University of Georgia in Athens. As the water changes from gas to liquid, it also releases heat — a jolt of storm-strengthening energy.</p>



<p>In Anderson’s dissertation work at the University of Georgia, she identified at least a dozen storms between 1997 and 2008, including Tropical Storm Erin, that were probably strengthened by this effect post-landfall.</p>



<p>And now, Shepherd says, there’s a growing body of scientific studies hunting for — and finding — the fingerprints of this effect in specific storms. “Tropical storms are not intelligent,” he says. “They don’t know the difference between wet soils, oceans and wetlands” as sources of energy.</p>



<p>The new study is among that body of work. Niyogi and colleagues used high-resolution satellite data on soil moisture, temperature and changes in rainfall before, during and after Hurricane Florence’s arrival on land. “As the storm system was moving, you could trace the source of moisture, see rainfall maxima,” Niyogi says.</p>



<p>The data revealed a powerful positive feedback between bursts of intense rain and soil moisture, the team found. How long the soils were wet before the storm passed over them also made a difference, they calculated: The heaviest rains occurred over soil that had already been saturated for about three days. That’s about how long evaporation from the soaked soil helped keep the atmosphere just above the ground nice and humid — ideal for feeding energy to a storm.</p>

<p>Saturated soil isn’t the only criterion — soil temperature was also key, the team determined. When the soil reaches a certain threshold temperature — one that’s yet to be determined, Niyogi says — the conditions are especially right to spin up a storm. The team’s findings <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were also reported in 2023 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em></a>.</p>



<p>Shepherd coauthored a separate study, also presented at the American Meteorological Society’s January meeting, that detailed how the effect contributed to <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/104ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/433146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flash floods inundating Texas during 2015’s Tropical Storm Bill</a>.</p>



<p>And perhaps the most striking recent case of this effect came in 2021, when Hurricane Ida roared ashore in Louisiana, at almost the same location as 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. However, <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/103/10/BAMS-D-21-0240.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ida lingered much longer</a> before dissipating — probably fueled by days of rain soaking the ground and increasing the humidity ahead of its landfall, researchers reported in 2022 in the <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</em>.</p>



<p>What these data show, Niyogi says, is that “the brown ocean effect exists, if you look for it.”</p>



<p>Shepherd agrees: These studies confirm that the brown ocean effect “is real,” and that computer weather models need to incorporate the influence of land as well as ocean and atmosphere on tropical storms. That’s particularly important when it comes to forecasting the danger these storms might pose to inland residents, he says. “If a storm moves inland, the model needs to capture that there’s wet soil there.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Reinoud Maex will talk about his work in the presentation entitled &quot;An analytical model of the energy of ion mixing in the brain&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neurons store energy in the ionic concentration gradients they build between their cell
interior and the extracellular space. They can subsequently use this energy to do work,
such as charging their membrane capacitor, transporting metabolites across their cell
membrane, etc. During hyperactivity or energy deprivation the ions mix and the neurons
swell. In this presentation I will show how a single principle, namely that neurons try to
maximize the energy stored, can explain three unrelated phenomena: a) why extracellular
space occupies a volume fraction of about 20%, b) why neurons swell during energy
deprivation, and c) why calcium ions are so heavily buffered.</p>

<p>Erick Jones, the dean of engineering at the University of Nevada in Reno, appears to have engaged in extensive plagiarism in the final report he submitted to the National Science Foundation for a grant, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1939762&amp;HistoricalAwards=false"> $28,238 grant</a> partially supported a three-day workshop that Jones and his wife, Felicia Jefferson, held for 21 students in Washington, DC, in April 2022 titled “Broadening Participation in Engineering through Improved Financial Literacy.” Jefferson received<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1939739&amp;HistoricalAwards=false"> a separate award for $21,757</a>.</p>



<p>Jones submitted his final report to the agency in May 2023. Retraction Watch obtained a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1939762-Final.pdf">copy of that report</a> through a public records request to Jones’s previous employer, the University of Texas at Arlington, and identified three published sources of extended passages he used without citation or quotation marks.</p>

<p>Jones, who<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/11/engineering-deans-journal-serves-as-a-supply-chain-for-bizarre-articles/"> has been criticized</a> for publishing “bizarre” and “incoherent” articles in the journal he founded, the <em>International Supply Chain Technology Journal</em>, did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, a student at his university launched a petition to <a href="https://thisisreno.com/2024/02/unr-faculty-students-call-for-engineering-deans-resignation/">demand his resignation</a> which has now garnered more than 200 signatures.</p>



<p>The report to NSF also mentioned the forthcoming publication of a book by Jones and two coauthors titled “Broadening Participation of Financial Literacy in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM),” which Retraction Watch was unable to locate.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Under the National Science Foundation’s grant<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/pappg_12.jsp#:~:text=RESEARCH%20MISCONDUCT%20means%20fabrication%2C%20falsification,research%20results%20funded%20by%20NSF."> policies</a>, “fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing or performing research funded by NSF, reviewing research proposals submitted to NSF, or in reporting research results funded by NSF” is considered a form of research misconduct.</p>



<p><a href="https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/mitchelo/">Olivia Mitchell</a>, an economist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, whose work was cut and pasted into Jones’s grant report called his borrowing “unbelievable” after she was made aware of it by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>“He has directly copied my words written in a published article with my coauthor and he presented the paragraph verbatim, and without attribution, as his own work without my permission,” she wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. “I condemn this practice and consider it to be a breach of academic integrity.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odysseus-moon-mission-lunar-lander-end">Odysseus’ historic moon mission comes to an end, for now</a></h4>

              
                <p>Odysseus has exceeded engineers’ expectations during its odyssey on the moon. NASA confirmed that the spindly solar-powered robotic lander, built and operated by the Houston-based&nbsp;private U.S. company Intuitive Machines, has been alive and collecting data since it touched down, and toppled over, on the lunar surface on February 22.</p>



<p>“What a magnificent job that lander did,” said Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus during a NASA news briefing on February 28. “So much data and information and science. It&#8217;s just an incredible testament to how robust that little spacecraft is, so we&#8217;re really happy with that.”</p>

<p>The spacecraft, which carried payloads from universities, industry and NASA, was the first American spacecraft<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-odysseus-moon-landing"> to perform a soft landing</a> on the moon in more than 50 years (<em>SN: 2/22/24</em>). Odysseus, or Odie as it’s nicknamed, is slowly running out of power, and scientists expect to put it into sleep mode February 28, after roughly six days on the lunar surface. They will try to reawaken Odie in about three weeks when the sun hits the lander’s solar panels again.</p>



<p>Much like its namesake, the epic hero from the Greek classic <em>The Odyssey</em>, the spacecraft Odysseus underwent trials and tribulations in its journey. Its autonomous landing system’s laser range finder malfunctioned, causing engineers to scramble for a solution that involved two extra hours in orbit and reconfiguring a couple backup lasers on a NASA payload. After a nail-biting descent, Odysseus’s landing gear caught on the sloped ground or possibly a crevice, breaking the gear and sending the spacecraft gently tipping over on its side.</p>



<p>Despite the mishap, “our navigation system landed us with precision and the shock absorbers took the load,” Altemus said. “The landing gear did what it was supposed to do and protect the lander as it landed on the surface.”</p>



<p>The spacecraft was originally supposed to operate for about a week, though during a Feb. 23 briefing with reporters mission director Tim Crain, chief technology officer of Intuitive Machines, said that under the best case scenario it might last for nine to 10 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, after six days on the moon, the lander was expected to run out of power. “We&#8217;re going to tuck Odie in for the cold night of the moon,” Crain said during the Feb. 28 briefing. “We are going to leave the computers and the power system in a place where we can wake it up … once it gets power again.”</p>



<p>The main limiting factor to whether Odysseus comes back online will be its batteries; their chemistry-based technology will struggle with the extreme temperature plunge of lunar night. “We&#8217;re confident that when the sun comes back up, the solar arrays will energize and they&#8217;ll send power,” said Crain. “The real question is, ‘Are the batteries there to receive that power and pass it on?’”</p>



<p>Odysseus, which stands about 4 meters tall and 1.5 meters wide, came down at a site roughly 300 kilometers away from the lunar south pole on the slope of a crater called Malapert A. Astronauts with NASA’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-mission-new-diverse-crew-astronauts-moon"> crewed Artemis</a> program may land at a similar site or nearby in the coming decades (<em>SN: 12/1/22</em>).</p>



<p>Some of the spacecraft’s various payloads have had their own little adventures during the mission. For instance, a camera built by students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla., was supposed to detach during descent and take pictures as the spacecraft touched down. Due to the problems with landing, the camera, known as EagleCam, was not deployed, but Crain said he and others are working on getting it ready for ejection.</p>

<p>But the International Lunar Observatory Association, a private company based in Kamuela, Hawaii, has received images from a telescope it sent on Odysseus named ILO‐X. The instrument is a precursor to a larger telescope the company hopes to deploy at Malapert A in the future and is intended to conduct scientific observations of the Milky Way from the moon. The association confirmed that ILO-X was able to snap images during the mission, which show portions of the lunar landscape, the sun and the Odysseus lander. The images are expected to be released February 29.</p>



<p>All of the NASA instruments that Odysseus carried have been transmitting useful data, said Sue Lederer, project scientist for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Engineers were able to troubleshoot initial problems with the spacecraft’s antenna that prevented full transmission, and have since received a flood of data.</p>



<p>“We went from basically a cocktail straw of data coming back to a boba-tea-sized straw of data,” Lederer said. “We&#8217;ve gotten over 15 megabytes of data.” This will be useful for understanding the spacecraft’s touchdown sequence as well as informing future missions to the moon and Mars, she said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-parasite-humans-apes-tail-loss-evolution">A genetic parasite may explain why humans and other apes lack tails</a></h4>

              
                <p>A genetic parasite may have robbed humans and other apes of their tails.</p>



<p>Around 25 million years ago, this parasite, a small stretch of repetitive DNA called an Alu element, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07095-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended up in a gene important for tail development</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 29 <em>Nature</em>. The single insertion altered the gene <em>Tbxt</em> in a way that seems to have sparked one of the defining differences between monkeys and apes: Monkeys have tails, apes don’t.</p>



<p>“It was like lightning struck once,” says Jef Boeke, a geneticist at New York University Langone Health, and ape behinds ultimately became bare.</p>



<p>The genetic tweak may also give insight into why some babies are born with spinal cord defects such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/database-provides-peek-human-embryo-first-weeks">spina bifida</a>, when the tube that holds the cord doesn’t close all the way (<em>SN: 12/6/16</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alu elements are part of a group of genetic parasites known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-genes-play-big-role-what-makes-us-human">transposons or jumping genes</a> that can hop across genetic instruction books, inserting themselves into their hosts’ DNA (<em>SN: 5/16/17)</em>. Sometimes, when the gene slips itself into a piece of DNA that is passed down to offspring, these insertions become permanent parts of our genetic code. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Transposons, including more than 1 million Alu elements, are found throughout our genome, says geneticist and systems biologist Bo Xia of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Researchers once thought of transposons as genetic garbage, but some have central roles in evolution. Without transposons, the placenta, immune system and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-retrovirus-myelin-speedy-nerves-evolve">insulation around nerve fibers</a> may not exist (<em>SN: 2/16/24</em>).</p>



<p>And humans might still have tails.</p>



<p>To find out how apes lost their tails, Xia, then at NYU Langone Health, Boeke and colleagues analyzed 140 genes involved in vertebrate tail development. The team found that in monkeys, including baboons and rhesus macaques, the <em>Tbxt</em> gene was missing a chunk of DNA that’s found in humans, chimpanzees and other apes. It was a “eureka moment,” Boeke says. The insertion may have appeared around the time apes diverged from African and Asian monkeys, around 25 million years ago.</p>



<p>But the missing chunk was in a part of the gene called an intron, a bit of genetic material that isn’t made into proteins. “So why would that even matter?” he asks. A close look at the gene’s structure provided a plausible explanation: The missing bit tweaked <em>Tbxt </em>so that the gene makes a different form of the protein in apes than in monkeys.</p>



<p>Experiments in mice seemed to confirm the hypothesis. Mice, like monkeys, make normal versions of the Tbxt protein and have full-length tails. But when genetically engineered to make shortened versions of the Tbxt protein like apes do, the mice had shorter tails or none at all. Some mice also had spinal cord defects similar to spinal bifida, suggesting that there may be drawbacks to tail loss.</p>

<p>Other genes may also be involved in tail loss. Many more Alu elements are scattered among human introns that could have yet-to-be-known effects on other aspects of human evolution, Boeke and Xia say.</p>



<p>The new findings do begin to unravel how apes lost their tails, says Gabrielle Russo, a biological anthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York. But why it happened, she says, is a much harder question to answer. Research from the early 1900s linked tail loss to muscle changes that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">helped human bodies move upright</a>, but shifts in posture, as well as learning to walk on two feet, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-steps-book-bipedalism-human-evolution-anatomy-behavior">didn’t happen until millions of years later</a> (<em>SN: 9/15/21; SN: 4/14/21</em>). So, it’s unlikely the new findings will shed light on these human traits, Russo says.</p>



<p>A natural next step, Russo says, is exploring whether the genetic underpinnings of tail loss in apes also happened in other mammals with shortened tails or none at all such as koalas, capybaras and bears.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-large-language-model-understanding">Why large language models aren’t headed toward humanlike understanding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Apart from the northward advance of killer bees in the 1980s, nothing has struck as much fear into the hearts of headline writers as the ascent of artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>Ever since the computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, humans have faced the prospect that their supremacy over machines is merely temporary. Back then, though, it was easy to show that AI failed miserably in many realms of human expertise, from diagnosing disease to transcribing speech.</p>



<p>But then about a decade ago&nbsp;or so, computer brains — known as neural networks — received an IQ boost from a new approach called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep learning</a>. Suddenly computers approached human ability at identifying images, reading signs and enhancing photographs — not to mention converting speech to text as well as most typists.</p>



<p>Those abilities had their limits. For one thing, even apparently successful deep learning neural networks were easy to trick. A few small stickers strategically placed on a stop sign made an AI computer think the sign said “Speed Limit 80,” for example. And those smart computers needed to be extensively trained on a task by viewing numerous examples of what they should be looking for. So deep learning produced excellent results for narrowly focused jobs but couldn’t adapt that expertise very well to other arenas. You would not (or shouldn’t) have hired it to write a magazine column for you, for instance.</p>



<p>But AI’s latest incarnations have begun to threaten job security not only for writers but also a lot of other professionals.</p>



<p>“Now we’re in a new era of AI,” says computer scientist Melanie Mitchell, an artificial intelligence expert at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. “We’re beyond the deep learning revolution of the 2010s, and we’re now in the era of generative AI of the 2020s.”</p>



<p>Generative AI systems can produce things that had long seemed safely within the province of human creative ability. AI systems can now answer questions with seemingly human linguistic skill and knowledge, write poems and articles and legal briefs, produce publication quality artwork, and even create videos on demand of all sorts of things you might want to describe.</p>



<p>Many of these abilities stem from the development of large language models, abbreviated as LLMs, such as ChatGPT and other similar models. They are large because they are trained on huge amounts of data — essentially, everything on the internet, including digitized copies of countless printed books. Large can also refer to the large number of different kinds of things they can “learn” in their reading — not just words but also word stems, phrases, symbols and mathematical equations.</p>



<p>By identifying patterns in how such linguistic molecules are combined, LLMs can predict in what order words should be assembled to compose sentences or respond to a query. Basically, an LLM calculates probabilities of what word should follow another, something critics have derided as “autocorrect on steroids.”</p>



<p>Even so, LLMs have displayed remarkable abilities — such as composing texts in the style of any given author, solving riddles and deciphering from context whether “bill” refers to an invoice, proposed legislation or a duck.</p>



<p>“These things seem really smart,” Mitchell said this month in Denver at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>



<p>LLMs’ arrival has induced a techworld version of mass hysteria among some experts in the field who are concerned that run amok, LLMs could raise human unemployment, destroy civilization and put magazine columnists out of business. Yet other experts&nbsp;argue that such fears are overblown, at least for now.</p>



<p>At the heart of the debate is whether LLMs actually understand what they are saying and doing, rather than just seeming to.&nbsp;Some researchers have suggested that LLMs do understand, can reason like people (big deal) or even attain a form of consciousness. But Mitchell and others insist that LLMs do not (yet) really understand the world (at least not in any sort of sense that corresponds to human understanding).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor.”</p><cite>Melanie Mitchell</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In a new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08955" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted online</a> at arXiv.org, Mitchell and coauthor Martha Lewis of the University of Bristol in England show that LLMs still do not match humans in the ability to adapt a skill to new circumstances. Consider this letter-string problem: You start with abcd and the next string is abce. If you start with ijkl, what string should come next?</p>



<p>Humans almost always say the second string should end with m. And so do LLMs. They have, after all, been well trained on the English alphabet.</p>



<p>But suppose you pose the problem with a different “counterfactual” alphabet, perhaps the same letters in a different order, such as a u c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t b v w x y z. Or use symbols instead of letters.&nbsp;Humans are still very good at solving letter-string problems. But LLMs usually fail. They are not able to generalize the concepts used on an alphabet they know to another alphabet.</p>



<p>“While humans exhibit high performance on both the original and counterfactual problems, the performance of all GPT models we tested degrades on the counterfactual versions,” Mitchell and Lewis report in their paper.</p>



<p>Other similar tasks also show that LLMs do not possess the ability to perform accurately in situations not encountered in their training. And therefore, Mitchell insists, they do not exhibit what humans would regard as “understanding” of the world.</p>



<p>“Being reliable and doing the right thing in a new situation is, in my mind, the core of what understanding actually means,” Mitchell said at the AAAS meeting.</p>



<p>Human understanding, she says, is based on “concepts” — basically mental models of things like categories, situations and events. Concepts allow people to infer cause and effect and to predict the probable results of different actions — even in circumstances not previously encountered.</p>



<p>“What’s really remarkable about people, I think, is that we can abstract our concepts to new situations via analogy and metaphor,” Mitchell said.</p>



<p>She does not deny that AI might someday reach a similar level of intelligent understanding. But machine understanding may turn out to be different from human understanding. Nobody knows what sort of technology might achieve that understanding and what the nature of such understanding might be.</p>



<p>If it does turn out to be anything like human understanding, it will probably not be based on LLMs.</p>



<p>After all, LLMs learn in the opposite direction from humans. LLMs start out learning language and attempt to abstract concepts. Human babies learn concepts first, and only later acquire the language to describe them.</p>



<p>So LLMs are doing it backward. In other words, perhaps reading the internet might not be the correct strategy for acquiring intelligence, artificial or otherwise.</p>

<p>A prolific Saudi pharmacy professor published over 200 papers in the last four years, but in recent months the quality of these papers has come into question.</p>



<p><a href="https://nalhakamy.kau.edu.sa/CVEn.aspx?Site_ID=0010395&amp;Lng=EN">Nabil Alhakamy</a>, a dean of research and higher education at King AbdulAziz University’s Faculty of Pharmacy, has had more than <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dAlhakamy%252c%2bNabil%2bA">20 articles retracted</a> — the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332224000817">most recent of which</a> came on January 30 in <em>AAPS PharmSciTech</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal analyzed the images and figures in the article and found three had been <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14756366.2021.1901089">published previously </a>and that an outside lab used to collect some of the data had “made a mistake by sending images of other work in the service lab,” according to the retraction notice. </p>



<span id="more-128829"></span>



<p>Alhakamy’s spate of retractions started in November 2022 after PubPeer users <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/14F69176B9AA3FA580A72B5AA9438D#1">started</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/CB62D82C5446DEB33E2B9A037E4F15">commenting</a> on Alhakamy’s papers from 2020. Many of his articles <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1208/s12249-023-02614-8">overlapped significantly</a> with previously published work or <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1208/s12249-023-02591-y">included duplicated photos and figures</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the following weeks, the blog <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/11/18/schneider-shorts-18-11-2022-race-to-the-bottom/#saudi">For Better Science</a> published a story about fraudulent researchers that&nbsp; mentioned Alhakamy and his prolific publishing. The Saudi scientist has published 219 papers since 2020, for a rate of more than an article per week since 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabil-alhakamy-pharmd-ms-phd-082796a4/?originalSubdomain=sa">LinkedIn</a> page, Alhakamy founded the Drug Research and Pharmaceutical Industries Center at King AbdulAziz University in 2020. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>



<p>One of Alhakamy’s frequent co-authors is his KAU colleague Usama Fahmy, whose publishing record also includes several retractions. Retraction Watch was unable to reach Fahmy or any other co-authors on these retracted papers.</p>



<p>Alhakamy had published four articles in <em>AAPS PharmSciTech</em>. Three have been retracted, all for image issues. Robert Williams III, the <em>AAPS PharmSciTech</em> editor-in-chief, declined to answer questions about whether the journal would publish articles by Alhakamy in the future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/joined-up-thinking-the-science-of-collective-intelligence-and-its-power-to-change-our-lives">Joined Up Thinking: The Science of Collective Intelligence and Its Power to Change Our Lives</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Carly Hood reviews Hannah Critchlow's <em>Joined Up Thinking</em>, a book designed to push us to question intelligence as a concept, explore the benefits of community and cooperation, and even to chastise those that are behaving selfishly. </strong></p>
<blockquote><strong>"Intelligence... is limiting to some and damaging to others"</strong></blockquote><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_72439af32efc485087547a88196e32aa~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_720,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>IQ is on the decline, and society is distressed about it. In the opening pages of <em>Joined Up Thinking: The Science of Collective Intelligence and Its Power to Change Our Lives</em>, Neuroscientist and science communicator Hannah Critchlow explains that the reason for such distress is that, in society, intelligence is generally valued as a marker for individual success. She promptly subverts this thinking, calling attention to intelligence as a biased measure, one that is ‘limiting to some and damaging to others’. Though Critchlow does not delve into the contentious history of IQ, she does use this assertion as a springboard to call for its reconsideration as an evolved strategy that should be used by everyone to achieve outcomes that benefit the majority.  </p>
<blockquote><strong>"With a shift to collective intelligence...we will be able to overcome the limitations of the individual brain"</strong></blockquote>
<p>The Jungian concept of collective intelligence, or in more concrete terms effective cooperation, is an evolutionary strategy - as individuals, we are vulnerable, and our effective cooperation with others reduces this vulnerability. Critchlow begins by linking this central thesis to the neurodiversity affirming movement. In present society, some diagnoses, such as ADHD and autism, may prevent individuals from achieving conventional success. With a shift to collective intelligence, where certain characteristics and alternative ways of seeing the world are conferred as strengths, ‘we will be able to overcome the limitations of the individual brain and drive innovation and solve problems.’ </p>

<p>As a researcher with experience in the neurobiology of decision-making, Critchlow proceeds to describe interesting research on effective cooperation within different relationship contexts, from the family unit to the workplace, in a digestible manner. Though sparse in detail, as in all pop-science books, the research used in service of her argument is surprising and entertaining. She describes topics ranging from brain synchronicity between parents and their babies, to how paracetamol affects the ability to think as a group, and to how adjusting the office thermostat can boost group productivity and performance. </p>

<p>Ostensibly, though our social intelligence is evolved, our collective reasoning is open to bias, influenced by emotion, and peer pressure, rooted in natural responses to fear. This is the double-edged nature of our collective intelligence. Critchlow offers various interventions to this, grounded in empathy, communication and awareness of the self and of others. In this way, it is possible to build an appreciation of how individuals contribute unique skill sets and how this can then be leveraged to work, collectively, to benefit everyone. Though initially the book described several pragmatic take-aways (complete with exercises at the end of each chapter that are reminiscent of self-help books), the further into the narrative, the more radically removed the suggestions became – examples included the potential for pharmaceutical interventions to stimulate empathy circuits in the brains of psychopaths, and the use of a ‘super brain cloud’. </p>

<p>Despite this, her main message is clear. To face current challenges in a rapidly changing world, it is crucial to move away from individual-centric attitudes towards intelligence and lean into means of effective cooperation that advance the collective good. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazilian-flea-toad-smallest-vertebrate-amphibian">The Brazilian flea toad may be the world’s smallest vertebrate</a></h4>

              
                <p>A Brazilian flea toad’s head is too tiny to bear its many crowns.</p>



<p>Scientists have bestowed the frog — which is native to Brazil but is neither a flea nor a toad — with two titles: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/zsc.12654" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The world’s smallest known amphibian and smallest known vertebrate</a>. From snout to rump, one <em>Brachycephalus pulex</em> measures just under 6.5 millimeters, herpetologist Mirco Solé and colleagues report February 7 in <em>Zoologica Scripta</em>. That’s roughly half a millimeter shorter than the previous record holder and small enough to sit comfortably on a pinkie fingernail.</p>



<p>Solé, of the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz in Ilhéus, Brazil, and colleagues discovered the diminutive male amphibian among 46 adult Brazilian flea toads — 24 males and 22 females. On average, males measure about 7 millimeters long and females measure about 8 millimeters, the team reports. Their predecessor, male <em>Paedophryne amauensis</em> frogs from Papua New Guinea, averages about 8 millimeters long.</p>



<p>Frogs this minuscule have big changes to their bodies compared with their larger counterparts. For instance, Brazilian flea toad feet have just two toes instead of the typical five, Solé says. Some other small <em>Brachycephalus </em>frogs have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">oddly shaped inner ear tubes</a>, making them clumsy jumpers (<em>SN: 6/15/22</em>). Brazilian flea toad ears haven’t been tested, Solé says, but the animals seem to be decent hoppers.</p>



<p>With many of Earth’s nooks and crannies still unexplored, there are likely even tinier vertebrates waiting to be discovered, Solé says. Anything smaller than about six millimeters long “would really challenge morphology and physics,” he says. “But who knows.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snake-venom-toxins-antivenom-synthetic-antibody">Snake venom toxins can be neutralized by a new synthetic antibody</a></h4>

              
                <p>The antivenom for a black mamba’s bite could one day work for a slew of other snakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have developed an antibody that shuts down paralyzing toxins in the venom of black mambas, king cobras and dozens of other sharp-toothed serpents. The antibody — a single protein manufactured in the lab —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adk1867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protected mice from otherwise lethal doses of venom</a>, protein engineer Joseph Jardine and colleagues report in the Feb. 21&nbsp;<em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. That antibody “will be a critical component of an eventual antivenom,” says Jardine, of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif.</p>



<p>Venomous snakes generally rely on just a handful of toxin families. If scientists could mix together antibodies targeting each of those types, Jardine says, they could potentially create “one vial of antivenom that works against any snake in the world.”&nbsp;Such a universal antivenom might still be many years away, he says. But “theoretically, this is possible.”</p>



<p>Scientists have tallied hundreds of venomous snake species across the globe. In North America, a person might stumble upon a western diamondback; in Africa, a puff adder; in South Asia, a saw-scaled viper. A bite from any one of these snakes can maim or kill. Venomous snakebites&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/snakebite-envenoming#:~:text=Key%20facts,2.7%20million%20cases%20of%20envenomings." target="_blank" rel="noopener">kill up to about 140,000 people each year,</a>&nbsp;according to the World Health Organization. Lifesaving antivenoms exist, Jardine says, but they’re “built with 100-year-old technology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That technology involves injecting animals like horses or sheep with snake venom and harvesting the venom-targeting antibodies that their immune systems churn out. A snakebit patient would then get an infusion of horse or sheep antibodies — if doctors have them in stock.&nbsp;</p>

In experiments in mice, treatment with a synthetic antibody protected against the venom.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3137137">Kartik Sunagar</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The process has major drawbacks, Jardine says. Each animal produces antibodies for just one type of venom. Currently, bites from a yellow-bellied sea snake, cottonmouth or inland Taipan would all require different treatments. Another issue is the health effects of the antivenom itself. “You’re putting a whole bunch of horse antibodies into a person,” Jardine says. People can get sick or even go into anaphylactic shock.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His team’s approach could glide past those problems. In a collection of more than 60 billion lab-made antibodies, the team hunted for ones that target a particularly vicious venom component used by some snakes: long-chain three-finger alpha-neurotoxins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These molecules look like a small hand with three fingers, says biotechnologist Andreas H. Laustsen-Kiel of the&nbsp;Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. When delivered into a person’s bloodstream via snakebite, the hand literally gives victims the finger. The toxin’s middle finger pokes into a protein needed for movement, shutting down muscles and paralyzing the body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Antibodies that grasp the finger can block its toxic touch, Laustsen-Kiel says. Last year, his group reported several new antibodies, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36393-4#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a human antibody that neutralizes three-finger toxins</a>&nbsp;like the one in Jardine’s study. But the new antibody “looks like it’s even better than ours,” Laustsen-Kiel says. It appears to grab a wider array of toxins and with a tighter grip, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In mice given venom from a black mamba and an Indian spitting cobra, injecting the antibody saved the rodents’ lives, Jardine’s team reports. The researchers are now working to develop antibodies that target other venom toxins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, the idea of creating a single, universal antivenom may not be entirely realistic, Laustsen-Kiel says. “It simply doesn’t make sense from a product perspective,” he says. Instead, Laustsen-Kiel envisions antivenoms that are tailored for use in specific regions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever the formulation of these future antivenoms,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snake-bite-venom-cheap-innovative-treatments-save-thousands-victims">research on&nbsp;snakebites</a>&nbsp;— considered a neglected tropical disease — is underfunded, Jardine says (<em>SN: 9/19/20</em>). Though millions of cases occur in rural India and Africa, there’s relatively little money available for improving treatments, he says. (Jardine has funding from the London-based global health charity the Wellcome Trust.) Snakebites just aren’t considered a medical priority, Jardine says. But for people whose families and livelihoods depend on their ability to farm, he says, losing life or limb to snakebite is devastating.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-neuroscience-behind-imagination">The Neuroscience Behind Imagination</a></h4>

              
                <p>From the visualisation and construction of narratives in our minds to the recall of familiar objects, imagination is a fundamental aspect of the human experience. By bridging historical theories with contemporary neuroscience, we can understand the phenomenon of imagination, identifying the brain regions and networks involved and their intricate interactions. This exploration promises a deeper insight into the nature of imagination and its significance.</p>
<h3>Historical Perspectives on Imagination</h3>
<p>In ancient Greece, Plato conceptualised the world in two realms—'being' and 'becoming.' Within this framework, imagination manifests in two forms: 'being' imagination, involving perfect and unchanging ideas, and 'becoming' imagination, linked to personal experiences and beliefs. Plato's ideas lay the foundation for understanding the various facets of imagination. His theories introduce the notion of mental visual imagery formed through past experiences and knowledge, but also recognise the influence of our personal beliefs and “inner world.” Philosopher Immanuel Kant expanded on these ideas, proposing that imagination is not just limited to the representation of objects but also aesthetics, morality, and cognition.</p>

<p>Examining these historical theories reveals the complex and abstract nature of imagination, with ideas of mental visual imagery, and the impact it has on our experiences in life. The recognition of imagination taking place in our brains then sets the stage for exploring the concept from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience. </p>
<h3>Neural networks and brain regions</h3>
<p>In 1980, Kosslyn introduced the 'quasi-pictorial' theory, suggesting that mental imagery involves imperfect representations, or 'quasi' pictures, constructed in a specific brain locus known as the "visual buffer." This theory highlights the overlap between the visual buffer and the brain's visual system, emphasising key brain structures like retinotopic maps and the occipital cortex. While these early investigations shed light on mental visual imagery, recent research also suggests alternative systems involved in imagination.</p>
<h4>Imagery neural system</h4>
<p>For instance, Agnati and colleagues (2013) distinguish between imagery and imagination, with the former using neural structures already engaged in established functions (e.g., the motor system) and the latter creating entirely new mental images from the "inner world." Their theory suggests the tinkering of existing perceptual information to form imaginative ideas, utilising existing functional modules within the brain. These functional modules are suggested to reorganise and reassemble themselves in a variety of ways to result in the creation of new mental ideas, which are also being shaped by our inner world. The default mode network (DMN), a network active during passive rest, may also play a role in imagining future events. </p>

<p>They also dive into the possible involvement of mirror neurons in mental imagery and, therefore, imagination. When an animal observes another animal acting, mirror neurons activate to replicate that action in the brain as a form of mental visual imagery. Their involvement in imagination, however, is suggested by the fact that some are active even without sensory input. The authors suggest that the perceived motor activity is a new image created from the “inner world” of an animal, rendering the process more creative than just representing an image physically seen in the brain. Overall, imagination is proposed to be a more creative process of developing new ideas, while mental imagery is just a clear representation following perception.</p>
<h4>The Hippocampus, Episodic Memory, and the 'Imagination Network'</h4>
<p>In an fMRI study, Addis <em>et al.</em> (2007) discovered right hippocampal engagement in tasks related to "future event construction," indicating an overlap with systems engaged in episodic memory. Hassabis <em>et al.</em> (2007) further identified such brain regions using an fMRI paradigm when investigating the neural basis of episodic memory. Participants were asked to imagine made-up experiences, and the researchers determined which brain regions may be involved in the process of generating the scene and visualising the spatial context. They found activation across brain regions like the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex. From these findings, they suggest that scene construction makes use of processes seen in both episodic memory and imagination. They also suggest that more brain regions may also be recruited into this network to support processes like episodic memory.</p>
<h3>Imagination as Dreaming</h3>
<p>Imagination extends into different states of consciousness, particularly during sleep. When we are asleep, we often experience mental imagery and creativity in the form of dreams. Our dreams can include a mixture of past experiences and influences from our inner world to produce a unique story that we do not experience when we are awake. Vyshedskiy (2019) investigated the mechanism of imagination when dreaming, contrasting it to the mechanism of imagination when we are awake. He found that, when awake, the internal imagery in our minds is controlled by the lateral prefrontal cortex. He theorised that because this area is in charge of our executive control, the functions of reasoning and strategising can be used to pull together different memories into new combinations, forming our imagined stories.</p>

<p>When looking into the dreaming that occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, he found that the lateral prefrontal cortex was inactive while the posterior cortex was active. He suggested that if the usual executive control function was inactive during this time, then the novel combinations being formed in the posterior cortex would now be unexpected and ultimately different from the usual, allowing us to imagine in a way that is not possible when awake. He deemed dreaming to be a bottom-up mechanism and the imagination built by the lateral prefrontal cortex to be a top-down mechanism.</p>
<h4>Prefrontal synthesis</h4>
<p>In line with this, Vyshedskiy proposes top-down mechanisms of imagination involving the spatial combination of objects stored in memory. The Hebbian model of ‘neurons that fire together, wire together', also known as 'binding by synchrony,' is used to explain the creation of novel conscious perceptions. The Hebbian rule describes the perception of objects that we have previous knowledge of, but Vyshedskiy proposes that it can also apply to novel perception. </p>

<p>Neuronal ensembles that code the sensory components of objects exist in the posterior cortex of our brains and are active when we recall an object we have seen. Ensembles that encode each sensory component are activated in synchrony, allowing us to consciously perceive the full object. To produce novel objects in our imagination, he suggests that ensembles that do not relate to each other begin to fire in synchrony, building up a new conscious perception. When the synchronisation is driven by the lateral prefrontal cortex, this is named ‘pre-frontal synthesis.' When this process is driven from the back, however, this is now dreaming or hallucination. There is not much experimental evidence to directly support this theory, however. </p>

<p>Further ideas proposed include the existence of modifiers in our brains. When we recall an object we know, like a book, we can imagine that book in different colours. Vyshedskiy states that by doing this, we are modifying which neuronal ensembles are being activated for the simulation of the object. Furthermore, we can imagine something like a lamp with a missing bulb. In this way, we are now performing desynchronisation - the ensemble that encoded a specific component is no longer firing with the rest to produce the gap in our imagery.</p>
<h4>Bottom-Up Mechanisms of Imagination</h4>
<p>During REM sleep, communication between the neocortex and hippocampus is disrupted by high levels of acetylcholine. Vyshedskiy suggests that the waves specific to REM sleep lead to neuronal ensembles activating spontaneously, resulting in imagination. Dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area may also be involved in increasing or decreasing the intensity of our dreams at this stage. When the ensembles activate in synchrony, a whole and novel image is formed; if they activate asynchronously, separate objects are perceived. If ensembles that are completely different from each other activate in synchrony and by accident, then they will appear as a “novel hybrid object.” Through these suggested mechanisms, the number of hybrid and novel images that can be perceived during REM sleep is unlimited. Direct evidence, however, is needed to provide support for these theories.</p>
<h3>Imagination Beyond Memory and Visualisation</h3>
<p>Through these studies, we can begin to see the depth of imagination; however, the topics explored only cover it as a form of creating images in our minds. Is there a role beyond that? For example, it could help us empathise with and act kindly towards others, adding value to these situations. Referencing evidence of memory, imagination, and empathy interacting with each other, Gaesser (2013) aimed to promote research in the direction of looking at how imagination can influence empathy.</p>

<p>As we have previously discussed with future episodic memory, memory can play a role in imagining the future. This involves the use of already-stored memories being reassembled to form new imaginative situations. This ability may help simulate different versions of the future and test them out to help us plan our next actions by seeing how our behaviour might play out. If this is true, then imagination may have a role beyond just visualising objects and spatial memory; it may also have the adaptive function of helping us plan out the future and see the possible value of different behaviours.</p>

<p>Moreover, Gaesser examined work showing that participants whose minds simulated an experience repetitively in their minds were more likely to have these imagined experiences. The neural basis for these effects is not yet well established, but there is a suggested role for the precuneus.</p>
<h3>Conclusions and Future Directions</h3>
<p>Overall, imagination emerges as a multifaceted phenomenon, weaving through historical perspectives, early neuroscience theories, and contemporary research. From the distinctions between mental imagery and imagination to the exploration of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms, the complexity of the topic becomes apparent. While hypotheses abound, direct research is essential to validate these theories and deepen our understanding of the neural basis of imagination. Understanding this is crucial - not only for unravelling the intricacies of memory but also for comprehending human behaviour and decision-making as we navigate the dynamic interplay between simulation and reality.</p>

                <p>The All of Us Research Program, whose mission is to &#8220;to accelerate health research and medical breakthroughs, enabling individualized prevention, treatment, and care for all of us&#8221;, recently published a flagship paper in Nature on &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06957-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genomic Data in the All of Us Research Program</a>&#8220;. This is a review of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06957-x/figures/2">Figure 2 from the paper</a> (referred to below as AoURFig2).</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>The first U.S. Census that commenced on August 2, 1790 included a record of the race of individuals. It used three categories: &#8220;free whites&#8221;, &#8220;all other free persons&#8221;, and &#8220;slaves&#8221;. Since that time, racial categories as defined for the U.S. Census have been a recurring controversial topic, with <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/race/MREAD_1790_2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">categories changing many times over the years</a>. The category &#8220;Mulatto&#8221;, which was introduced in 1850, shockingly remained in place until 1930. Mulatto, which comes from the Spanish word for mule (the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey), was used for multiracial individuals of African and European descent. In the most recent decennial census in 2020, the race categories used were determined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and were &#8220;White&#8221;, &#8220;Black or African American&#8221;, &#8220;American Indian or Alaska Native&#8221;, &#8220;Asian&#8221;, &#8220;Native Hawaiian&#8221; or &#8220;Other Pacific Islander&#8221;, and a sixth category &#8220;Some Other Race&#8221; for people who do not identify with any of the aforementioned five races. Separately, the 2020 census included standards for ethnicity which were first introduced in 1977 as part of <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/populations/bridged-race/directive15.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OMB Directive No. 15</a>. Two ethnicity categories were introduced: &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; and &#8220;Not Hispanic or Latino&#8221;. The OMB was specific that race and ethnicity are distinct concepts: an ethnically Hispanic or Latino person can be of any race.</p>

<p>While race and ethnicity are social constructs, ancestry is defined in terms of geography, genealogy, or genetics. The relationship between these three types of ancestry is complex, and can be nonintuitive. <a href="https://gcbias.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graham Coop</a> has a great series of blog posts illustrating the subtleties around the different types of ancestry. For example, in &#8220;<a href="https://gcbias.org/2013/11/11/how-does-your-number-of-genetic-ancestors-grow-back-over-time/">How many genetic ancestors do I have?</a>&#8221; he illustrates the distinction between the number of genetic vs. genealogical ancestors: </p>

<p>AoURFig2 utilizes the concept of genetic ancestry groups. These do not have a precise accepted definition, but analysis of how the term is used reveals that genetic ancestries labels such as &#8220;European&#8221; are based on genetic similarity between present day individuals. This is explained carefully and clearly in an important paper by Coop: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genetic similarity versus genetic ancestry groups in as sample descriptors in human genetics</a>.</p>



<p>In AoURFig2 the ancestry groups used are &#8220;African&#8221;, &#8220;East Asian&#8221;, &#8220;South Asian&#8221;, &#8220;West Asian&#8221;, &#8220;European&#8221; and &#8220;American&#8221;. In their Methods section, the authors claim these are based on labels used for the Human Genome Diversity Project, and 1000 Genomes, which specifically they explain in the methods are: African, East Asian, European, Middle Eastern, Latino/admixed American and South Asian (in the figure legend they have renamed &#8220;Latino/admixed American&#8221; as &#8220;American&#8221; and &#8220;Middle Eastern&#8221; as &#8220;West Asian&#8221;). For each of these labels, obtained via self identified race and ethnicity by participants in the 1000 genomes project, the authors collated their genetic data to obtain genetic ancestry groups. Inherent in these groupings is an assumption of homogeneity, which is of course not true, because the individuals may vary in their genetics and their self identified race and ethnicity may be based on genealogy or geography, which could be at odds with their genetic relatedness to other individuals in their artificially constructed &#8220;genetic ancestry group&#8221;. Coop makes this point eloquently in his summarizing a key point of <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/?page_id=15070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his paper</a>:</p>

<p>In summary, there are three notions crucial to understanding AoURFig2: race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry, each of which is distinct from the others. Individuals who self identify with a particular ethnicity, for example Hispanic or Latino, can self identify with any race. Individuals self identifying with a specific race, e.g. &#8220;Black or African American&#8221; can be genetically related to a different extent with the six groups of genetic ancestry, and a genetic ancestry group is neither a race nor an ethnicity, but rather a genetic average computed over a set of (mostly genetically similar but also somewhat arbitrarily defined) individuals. </p>



<p>AoURFig2 is shown below. In the following sections we discuss each of the panels in detail.</p>

<p><strong>The figure legend</strong></p>



<p>We begin with the figure legend, which lists Race, Ethnicity and Ancestry. Race and Ethnicity refer to the self identified race choices for participants (based on the OMB categories). Ancestry refers to the genetic ancestry groups discussed above. While these three concepts are distinct, the Ancestry colors are the same as some of the Race and Ethnicity colors:</p>

<p>This is problematic because the coloring suggests a 1-1 identification between certain races and ethnicities, and genetic ancestry groups. In reality, there is no such clear cut relationship, as shown in the admixture panels in AoURFig2 (more on this below). Ideally, the distinct nature of the concepts of race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry, would be represented by distinct color palettes. The authors may have been confused on this point, because in the paper they write &#8220;Of the participants with genomic data in All of Us, 45.92% self-identified as a non-European race or ethnicity.&#8221;&nbsp;This makes no sense, because none of the race categories are &#8220;European&#8221;, and &#8220;European&#8221; is also not an ethnicity category. Therefore &#8220;non-European&#8221; does not make sense as either a race or ethnicity category. The authors seem to have assumed that White = European as indicated by their color scheme, and therefore &#8220;non-European race&#8221; is non-&#8220;White&#8221;. But by that logic &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; = &#8220;American&#8221; would mean that &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; is not &#8220;European&#8221; which implies that &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; is not White, contradicting the specific definition of race and ethnicity categories by the OMB. An individual&#8217;s ethnic self identification is independent of their race self identification, and someone may self identify as White and Hispanic or Latino. Clearly the authors would benefit from reading <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26902/using-population-descriptors-in-genetics-and-genomics-research-a-new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the NASEM report on the use of population descriptors in genetics and genomics research</a> and the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/nih-style-guide/race-national-origin">NIH style guide on race and national origin</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The ancestry analysis</strong></p>



<p>Panel c) of AoURFig2 presents an ancestry analysis consisting of running a program called Rye on to assign, to each individual, a fraction of each of the genetic ancestry groups. The panel with its subfigures is shown below:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>There are several problems with this figure. First, it has no x- or y- axes. The caption describes it as showing &#8220;Proportion of genetic ancestry per individual in six distinct and coherent ancestry groups defined by Human Genome Diversity Project and 1000 Genomes samples&#8221; from which it can be inferred that each row in each panel corresponds to an individual, and the horizontal axis divides an interval (width of the plot) into proportions of the six ancestry groups. In principle the panels could be in the transpose, with columns corresponding to individuals, but a clue that this is not the case is, for example, the ancestry assignment for Black or African American individuals, presumably none of which turn out to have an assignment 100% to European. That&#8217;s just a guess though. It&#8217;s best to label axes.</p>



<p>A second problem with the figure is that the height of each panel is the same, thereby not reflecting the number of individuals of each self-reported race and ethnicity. For instance, there are only 237 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander individuals versus 125,843 Whites. The numbers are there, but the height of the panels suggest otherwise. Below is a bar plot showing the number of people self identifying with each race in the data used for panel c) of AoURFig2:<br></p>

<p>The All of Us Research Program (henceforth referred to as All of Us) lists as a <a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/about/diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</a> goal:&nbsp;&#8220;Health care is more effective when people from all backgrounds are part of health research.&nbsp;<em>All of Us</em>&nbsp;is committed to recruiting a diverse participant pool that includes members of groups that have been left out of research in the past.&#8221; That is an admirable goal, and while All of Us is to be commended on the relatively large number of self identifying Black or African American participants recruited in comparison to previous cohorts, it&#8217;s worth noting that in this analysis White still wins (by a lot).</p>



<p>A third problem with the figure is the placement of the &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; ethnicity in the middle of panels assigning ancestry groups to individuals by race. As discussed previously, self identification of ethnicity is orthogonal to race. There is therefore ambiguity in the figure, namely it is unclear whether some of the individuals represented in the Hispanic or Latino plot appear in other panels corresponding to race. The juxtaposition of an ethnicity category with race categories also muddles the distinction between the two.</p>



<p>The ancestry analysis is based on a program called <a href="https://github.com/healthdisparities/rye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rye</a>, which was published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/8/e44/7079633">Conley et al., 2023</a>. The point of Rye is runtime performance: unlike previous tools, the software scales to UK Biobank sized projects. Indeed, it&#8217;s runtime performance is impressive when compared to the standard in the field, the program <a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1655.short">ADMIXTURE</a>:</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t benchmarked these programs myself, but geneticists have some experience with ADMIXTURE which was published in 2009 and has been cited more than 7,000 times. The Rye program, from two groups associated with All of Us, has been cited twice (both times by the authors of Rye who are members of the All of Us consortium; one of the two citations is the paper being discussed here). Of course, one shouldn&#8217;t judge the quality of a paper by the number of citations. A paper cited twice could be describing a method superior to a paper cited more than 7,000 times. But I was discomfited by the repeated appearance of a p-value = 0 in the paper (see below for one example among many). It reminded me of <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/pondering-p-values-for-breakfast/">pondering p-values before breakfast</a>.</p>

<p>Also R<sup>2</sup> is the wrong measure here. The correct assessment is to examine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_correlation_coefficient">concordance correlation coefficient</a>. Finally, and importantly, the Rye paper describes results based on inference not with the high-dimensional datatypes but rather a projection to the first 20 principal components. Notably the All of Us paper, and in particular the results reported in AoURFig2, use 16 principal components. There is no justification provided for the use of 16 principal components, no description of how results may differ when using 20 principal components, nor is there a general analysis describing robustness of results to this parameter.</p>



<p>In any case, setting aside feelings of being left Rye and dry and taking the admixture results at face value, it is evident that individuals self reporting ethnicity as &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; are highly admixed between European and American (the latter label meaning Latino/Admixed American). This stands in contrast to the coloring scheme chosen, with Hispanic or Latino colored purely &#8220;American&#8221; implying individuals self identifying with that ethnicity are not European. It also is at odds with the UMAP displays in panels a) and b) of AoURFig2.</p>



<p><strong>UMAP nonsense</strong></p>



<p>The AoURFig2 presents two UMAP figures, shown below. The UMAP is the same in both figures; in the top subplot (a) it is colored by race, and in the bottom subplot (b) it is colored by ethnicity.</p>

<p>The first thing to note about this plot is that it has axes when it shouldn&#8217;t. There is no meaning to UMAP 1 and UMAP 2, and the tick marks (-20, -10, 0, 10, 20) on the y axis and (-10, 0, 10, 20) on the x-axis are meaningless because UMAP arbitrarily distorts distances. Somehow the authors managed to put axes on plots which shouldn&#8217;t have them, and omitted axes on plots that should. Furthermore, by virtue of plotting points by color resulting in an overlay of one color over another, it&#8217;s difficult to see mixture of colors where it exists. <a href="https://x.com/lpachter/status/1692310130229166172?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This can be very misleading</a> as to the nature of the data.</p>



<p>More concerning than the axes (which really just show that the authors don&#8217;t understand UMAP), are the plots themselves. The UMAP transform distorts distances, and in particular, as a result of this distortion, is terrible at representing admixture. The following illustrative example was constructed by <a href="https://x.com/SashaGusevPosts/status/1760156864229122428?s=20">Sasha Gusev</a>: </p>

<p>But one doesn&#8217;t have to examine simulations to see the issue. This problem is evident in panel c) of AoURFig2. Consider, for example, the Hispanic or Latino ancestry assignments shown below: </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-17.png"><img loading="lazy" width="556" height="262" data-attachment-id="15057" data-permalink="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/all-of-us-failed/image-17/" data-orig-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-17.png" data-orig-size="556,262" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-17" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-17.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-17.png?w=490" src="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-17.png?w=556" alt="" class="wp-image-15057" style="width:308px;height:auto" srcset="https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-17.png 556w, https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-17.png?w=150 150w, https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-17.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>The admixture stands in start contrast to the UMAP in b), which suggests that the Hispanic or Latino ethnicity is almost completely disjoint from European (which the authors identify with White via the color scheme). This shows that UMAP can and does collapse admixed individuals onto populations, while creating a hallucination of separation where it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>I recently published a paper with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tara-chari-6387722a8/">Tara Char</a>i on UMAP titled &#8220;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011288">The specious art of single-cell genomics</a>&#8220;. It methodically examines UMAP and shows that the transform distorts distances, local structure (via different definitions), and global structure (again via several definitions). There is no theory associated to the UMAP method. No guarantees of performance of any kind. No understanding of what it is doing, or why. Our paper is one of several demonstrating these shortcomings of the UMAP heuristic (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471223002090">Wang, Sontag and Lauffenberger, 2023</a>). It is therefore unclear to me why the All of Us consortium chose to use UMAP, especially considering that they (in particular one of the authors of Rye and a member of the All of Us consortium) were <a href="https://x.com/lpachter/status/1632829539310260226?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warned of the shortcomings of UMAP a year ago</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Scientific racism</strong></p>



<p>The misuse of the concepts of race, ethnicity and genetic ancestry, and the misrepresentation of genetic data to create a false narrative, is a serious matter. I say this because such misrepresentations have been linked to terror. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Buffalo_shooting">Buffalo terrorist</a> who murdered 10 black people in a racist rampage in 2022 wrote that </p>

<p>These plots show the projection of genotypes to two dimensions via principal component analysis (PCA), a procedure that unlike UMAP provides an image that is interpretable. The two-dimensional PCA projections maximize the retained variance in the data. However PCA, and its associated interpretability, is not a panacea. While theory provides an understanding of the PCA projection, and therefore <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the limitations of interpretability of the projection</a>, the potential for misuse makes it imperative to include with such plots the rationale for showing them, and appropriate caveats. One of the main reasons not to use UMAP is that it is impossible to explain what the heuristic transform achieves and what it doesn&#8217;t, since there is no understanding of the properties of the transform, only empirical evidence that it can and does routinely fail to achieve what it claims to do.</p>



<p>The pseudoscientific belief that humans can be genetically separated into distinct racial groups is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism">scientific racism</a>. Such pseudoscience, and its spawn of racist policy, has roots in many places, but it must be acknowledged that some of them are in academia. A few years ago I wrote about the <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/james-watson-in-his-own-words/">depravity</a> of <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/the-perfect-human-is-puerto-rican/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Watson&#8217;s scientific racism</a>, but while his (scientific) racism has been publicly documented due to his fame, scientific racism is omnipresent and frequently overlooked. The ideas that the Buffalo terrorist and that Watson promulgated are reinforced by sloppy use of terms such as &#8220;race&#8221; and &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; in academia, along with misrepresentations of the genetic similarity between individuals. Many of the concepts in population genetics today are problematic. Coop&#8217;s eloquent critique of genetic ancestry groups is but one example. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/223/3/iyad002/7006477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The concept of admixture is also rooted in racism and relies on unscientific notions of purity</a>. With this in mind, I believe it is insufficient to merely relegate AoURFig2 to <a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karl Broman&#8217;s list of worst graphs</a>. The numerous implications of AoURFig2, among them the authors&#8217; claim that individuals identifying ethnically as Hispanic or Latino are genetically not European and therefore not racially White (see section on ancestry analysis above for an explanation of why this is incorrect), are scientific racism. The All of Us authors should therefore immediately post a correction to AoURFig2 that includes a clarification of its purpose, and corrections to the text so the paper properly utilizes terms such as race, ethnicity and ancestry. All of us need to work harder to sharpen the rigor in human genetics, and to develop sound ways to interpret and represent genetic data.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgment</strong></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-thistle-cool-thermoregulation">On hot summer days, this thistle is somehow cool to the touch</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the mountains of southern Spain, one type of thistle plant seems to have built-in air conditioning.</p>



<p>The flowers of the thistle <em>Carlina corymbos</em>a are, on average, <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.4268" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 3 degrees Celsius cooler than the surrounding air</a>, ecologist Carlos Herrera reports February 13 in <em>Ecology</em>. The most extreme cooling — sometimes up to 10 degrees C — occurs during the hottest part of the day. This means when the air temperature reaches a sweltering 45° C, the plant’s flowers can remain close to a relatively cool 35° C.</p>



<p>“Those are substantial coolings relative to the air next to it,” says Christopher Still, an ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis who was not involved in the work. “It’s a nice, careful study.”</p>



<p>In Spain’s Sierra de Cazorla mountain range, scorching summers leave many plants dead, dried out or dormant. This brown sea is intermittently broken by bursts of yellow, as <em>C. corymbosa </em>improbably peeks its flowers above the vegetation. When Herrera, of the Spanish National Research Council in Sevilla, touched one of the flower heads during the peak of the day’s heat on a recent trek, he found it pleasantly cool.</p>



<p>Herrera was there to study the relationship between the region’s plants and their pollinators. He bent to touch the thistle because he “was checking for the presence of nectar in the flower head,” he says, and then became curious about why the flower felt chilled.</p>



<p>Using an electric thermometer, he measured the temperatures of seven different thistles across two sites and multiple days per flower. He found the flowers consistently cooled down as the day grew hotter.</p>



<p>Many plants cool down by passively allowing water to evaporate through pores, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/closed-pores-mean-more-fresh-water">a process called transpiration</a> that is analogous to humans beating the heat by sweating (<em>SN: 2/27/06</em>). Most research has focused on how leaves keep cool, but in many cases, leaves don’t get colder than the surrounding air. When they do, Herrera reports, the difference in temperature is less drastic than seen in the thistle flowers.</p>



<p>There’s probably some truth to the idea that the thistle cools itself down more than leaves, but because flowers and leaves are measured differently, it’s hard to say for sure, Still says.</p>



<p>Because the thistles started cooling down at the hottest part of the day, it’s possible that the plants are actively turning a self-refrigerating mechanism on and off.</p>



<p>The idea that plants might be controlling their internal temperatures <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0098847288900597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took off in the late 1980s</a>, and is known as “limited homeothermy.” However, this is a rare skill among plants, Still says. A 2022 study he led <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2205682119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found no evidence</a> that leaves in forest canopies across North and Central America were cooler than the air around them.</p>



<p>Both Herrera and Still think that something about the thistle flower’s shape and structure enables it to cool off so effectively.</p>



<p>Herrera suspects that as water within the thistle evaporates, it takes heat with it, and because of the flower’s physical form, that heat isn’t being replaced by the sun’s warmth. This might allow the plant to cool below the air temperature. Herrera dubs this the “botijo effect,” because “it is the same principle by which porous sweating pitchers” — called botijos in Spanish — &#8220;cool themselves in dry, hot air.” This idea needs to be tested, however.</p>



<p>Herrera and Still are both curious to know if being cooler than the surrounding air provides any benefit to the thistle, such as by attracting pollinators trying to escape the oppressive summer heat. Herrera plans to see if other thistles in southern Spain show the same cooling effect and has also mapped out an experiment to probe how limiting the plant’s access to water may influence its cooling ability.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of value in old-fashioned naturalism,” Still says. “This one study could lead to lots of cool follow-on work.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arithmetic-progressions-math-order-combinatorics">How two outsiders tackled the mystery of arithmetic progressions</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Consider this sequence of numbers: 5, 7, 9. Can you spot the pattern? Here’s another with the same pattern: 15, 19, 23. One more: 232, 235, 238.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Three equally spaced things,” says Raghu Meka, a computer scientist at UCLA. “That’s probably the simplest pattern you can imagine.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet for almost a century, mathematicians in the field of combinatorics have been puzzling out how to know whether an endless list of numbers contains such a sequence, called an arithmetic progression. In other words, is there a way to be mathematically certain that a set contains a sequence of three or more evenly spaced numbers, even if you don’t know much about how the numbers in the set were selected or what the progression might be?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Progress on the question has been slow, even plodding. But last year, Meka and Zander Kelley, a Ph.D. computer science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, surprised mathematicians <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05537" data-type="URL" data-id="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by making an exponential leap</a>. The researchers are outsiders in combinatorics, which is concerned with counting configurations of numbers, points or other mathematical objects. And the duo didn’t set out to tackle the mystery of arithmetic progressions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kelley and Meka were instead investigating abstract games in computer science. The pair sought a mathematical tool that might help them understand the best way to win a particular type of game over and over again. “I’m super-interested in a collection of techniques that fall under this umbrella called structure versus randomness,” Kelley says. Some of the earliest progress on arithmetic progressions relied on such techniques, which is what led Kelley and Meka to dive into the topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mystery of whether arithmetic progressions will show up is just one of many mathematical questions related to order versus disorder in sets of objects. Understanding order — and when and where patterns must emerge — is a recurring theme in many branches of math and computer science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another example of order in objects says that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/party-numbers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/party-numbers">any group of six people</a> must contain either a group of at least three mutual acquaintances (all three know each other) or a group of at least three complete strangers (no one knows another). Research has shown that it doesn’t matter who they are, where they are from or how they were selected. There’s something powerful, maybe almost spooky, about the fact that we can say this — and make other similar claims about structure in sets — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdiL-ADRTxQ" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdiL-ADRTxQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with mathematical certainty</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solving the mystery of arithmetic progressions might open doors to investigating more complex relationships among numbers in a set — gaps that change in more elaborate ways, for instance. “These are more sophisticated versions of the same theorems,” says Bryna Kra, a mathematician at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “Typically, once you see arithmetic progressions … you see other patterns.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After publishing their work on arithmetic progressions, Kelley and Meka, with Shachar Lovett of the University of California, San Diego, imported techniques from their investigations of arithmetic progressions into a different context. The researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12451" data-type="URL" data-id="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solved a question in communication complexity</a>, a subfield of theoretical computer science concerned with transmitting data efficiently between parties who have only partial information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, knowing that certain mathematical structures have to appear in certain situations can be useful in real-world communication networks and for image compression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Potential applications aside, researchers who study arithmetic progressions — or other facets of purely theoretical mathematics — are often motivated more by sheer curiosity than any practical payoff. The fact that questions about such simple patterns and when they appear remain largely unanswered is, for many, reason enough to pursue them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are arithmetic progressions?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Let’s take a moment to get our hands on some sets of numbers and the arithmetic progressions those sets contain, starting with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-we-care-riemann-hypothesis-math-prime-numbers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-we-care-riemann-hypothesis-math-prime-numbers">prime numbers, perennial favorites of math enthusiasts</a>. A prime number is any whole number divisible only by itself and by 1; the first 10 primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29. Within those numbers, we can find a few arithmetic progressions. The numbers 3, 5 and 7 form a three-term arithmetic progression with a gap of two. But the numbers in a progression don’t have to follow each other immediately within the larger set: The numbers 5, 11, 17, 23 and 29 form a five-term arithmetic progression with a gap of six.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within a finite set of numbers, it’s straightforward to determine whether there are any arithmetic progressions. It might be tedious depending on the set, but it’s not mysterious. For infinite sets of numbers, though, the question gets interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primes go on forever, and mathematicians have asked many — and answered some — questions about arithmetic progressions within them. Is there a longest possible arithmetic progression, a cap on the number of terms, in the primes? Or, can you find a progression of any finite length if you look long enough? In 2004, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/primal-progress-pattern-hunters-spy-order-among-prime-numbers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/primal-progress-pattern-hunters-spy-order-among-prime-numbers">mathematicians proved that the latter is true</a>. But questions including how far along the number line you have to look to find an arithmetic progression with a given number of terms or a given gap size remain active areas of research, for the primes and for other sets.&nbsp;</p>

</div>



<p>The primes contain infinitely many arithmetic progressions, but some infinite sets contain none. Consider the powers of 10: 1, 10, 100, 1,000…. The gaps between consecutive terms get bigger fast — 9, 90, 900…. And none of them are the same. Playing around with the numbers a bit, you can convince yourself that no two powers of 10, whether consecutive or not, have the same gap as any other pair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that context, we now approach a question at the heart of this research: Why do some sets have arithmetic progressions while others don’t? One big difference between the primes and powers of 10 is that there are a lot more primes than powers of 10. Sort of. Both sets are infinite, but if you pick any arbitrary number as a cutoff and look at how many primes or powers of 10 there are below that number, the primes win every time. There are four primes from 1 to 10, versus only two powers of 10. There are 25 primes from 1 to 100 and only three powers of 10. The primes don’t just win every time, they win by a lot, and the amount they win by keeps increasing. In this way, the primes are “denser” — in an intuitive and technical sense — than the powers of 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A sparse enough set of numbers can have gaps arranged in ways that manage to avoid arithmetic progressions. Too dense, though, and the set can’t avoid having gaps that match up. In the 20th century, mathematicians settled on a way to measure that density. They are now looking for the density above which arithmetic progressions must appear.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Density in infinite sets</h2>



<p>The study of arithmetic progressions in sets of whole numbers began in earnest in 1936, when Hungarian mathematicians Paul Erdős and Pál Turán posited that any set of whole numbers that is dense enough must contain arithmetic progressions of any desired length.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For finite sets, it’s easy to understand what density is. In the set of whole numbers between 1 and 10, the primes have a density of 4/10, or 0.4. But if we want to understand the density of the entire unending collection of prime numbers within the entire unending collection of the whole numbers, we need to find a way to make sense of infinity divided by infinity, or ∞/∞.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mathematicians use a concept called asymptotic density to wrangle with the density of an infinite set of whole numbers. The basic idea is to choose some number as a cutoff point, N, and see what happens as N increases. If the density tends toward some fixed number, that is the set’s asymptotic density.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s return to the powers of 10, whose density decreases across the number line. As you go out farther and farther, the proportion of whole numbers that are powers of 10 approaches zero — so the set has an asymptotic density of zero. Other sets have a positive asymptotic density, and some never settle down into an asymptotic density at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Erdős and Turán proposed is that any set of numbers with positive, rather than zero, asymptotic density must contain at least one arithmetic progression. For some sets, it’s obvious (the even numbers have an asymptotic density of 0.5 and definitely contain arithmetic progressions). But proving it for any arbitrary set of numbers turned out to be a challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It wasn’t until 1953 that German-British mathematician Klaus Roth proved the conjecture, opening the door to a more nuanced understanding of the role density plays in arithmetic progressions. He showed that any set with positive asymptotic density <a href="https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1112/jlms/s1-28.1.104" data-type="URL" data-id="https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1112/jlms/s1-28.1.104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must contain at least one three-term arithmetic progression</a>, or 3-AP. His argument relied on proving that dense enough pseudorandom sets — those that might not truly be chosen randomly but have the general properties of random sets — must contain arithmetic progressions. Then he developed a way to zoom in on parts of non-pseudorandom sets and show that, if the initial set is dense enough, these zoomed-in areas must be structured in ways that guarantee the presence of an arithmetic progression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In early 2021, Kelley and Meka were investigating a problem in complexity theory called parallel repetition of games. Don’t think Monopoly or chess; the “games” the researchers were thinking about won’t be making Hasbro money any time soon. “We have a tendency to call anything a game if it has turns,” says Kelley. In the typical games Kelley and Meka were looking at, the players have access to different information and have to work together to find an answer to a question. But they can’t communicate during the game, so they must decide on a strategy beforehand. Kelley and Meka sought to determine how to maximize the chances that the players win many games in a row.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not quite a hop, skip and a jump from parallel repetition of games to arithmetic progressions, but Kelley and Meka got there fairly quickly. “Maybe in a month we were at the 3-AP problem,” Meka says. Previous research on parallel repetition of games had used structure versus randomness arguments. Because Roth’s work on arithmetic progressions was the first to use such a technique, Kelley and Meka were interested in that work in its original habitat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In theoretical computer science, people are looking outward to math for some tools that they could use, and unless you’re ready to get yourself into some serious trouble, usually you see if you can use the tools, and then if you can’t, you move on,” Kelley says. “You don’t try to go open them up and see what they’re like.” But he and Meka did just that, knowing that they might go down a deep rabbit hole and end up with nothing to show for their time and effort. They dug into Roth’s arguments — as well as more recent research on the same subject — to see if they could push the work further. And so they found themselves staring down arithmetic progressions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reaching new limits&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Roth’s contribution was more powerful than just showing that any set with positive asymptotic density must contain a 3-AP. He also proved that some sets with asymptotic density of zero, if the density tends toward zero slowly enough as you go out along the number line, must also contain at least one 3-AP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of the density as having to pass beneath a limbo bar. If a set gets sparse too slowly, it can’t make it under and it must contain an arithmetic progression. But a set that approaches a density of zero quickly enough ducks under. For that set, anything goes: It may or may not have such a progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roth’s initial proof found an upper limit to where the limbo bar must be. He showed that any set whose density approaches zero at a rate similar to or slower than the expression 1/log(log(N)) must contain at least one arithmetic progression. Log means to take the logarithm, and remember that N is the number chosen as the arbitrary cutoff in an infinite set. We’re considering what happens as N increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Logarithms grow slowly, roughly akin to the number of digits a number has. The logarithm of 1 is zero, of 10 is 1, of 100 is 2, of 1,000 is 3, and so on. But taking the logarithms of those logarithms gives much more sluggish growth. To nudge log(log(N)) from zero to 1, we have to move N from 10 to 10 billion. Dividing 1 by this double log, as appears in Roth’s work, we get a density that just plods toward zero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several years earlier, in 1946, mathematician Felix Behrend had investigated the lower limit of the limbo bar. He developed a recipe for cooking up sets without 3-APs, showing that any such set must be extremely sparse indeed. His limit was a density that goes to zero at approximately the same rate as 1/e<sup>(log(N))^½</sup>. That expression might not look familiar, but there’s an exponential function in the denominator. The log and ½ power slow things down a bit, but the whole expression goes to zero much faster than the double log Roth later found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the last few decades, researchers have been attempting to close the gap between Roth-style estimates of the sparsest sets that must contain a 3-AP and Behrend-style estimates of the densest sets that do not contain one. In 2020, mathematicians Thomas Bloom of the University of Oxford and Olof Sisask of Stockholm University <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03528" data-type="URL" data-id="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke what had come to be known as the logarithmic barrier</a> for the Roth-style upper limit of the limbo bar, showing that any set with a density that goes to zero more slowly than 1/log(N) must contain at least one 3-AP. The work was seen as a breakthrough in the field, though the upper limit was still closer to the previous best-known upper limit than to Behrend’s lower limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kelley and Meka pushed the upper limit down dramatically. Their result was a rate that goes to zero at approximately the same rate as 1/e<sup>(log(N))^1/11</sup>. That formula looks eerily similar to Behrend’s lower limit. For the first time ever, the upper and lower limits are within shooting distance of each other. Closing that gap would reveal the specific location of the limbo bar and thus give a clear answer to which sets must contain at least one 3-AP.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Headed to zero</h3>



<p>How quickly a set’s density approaches zero as you move far out along the number line (insets) can reveal whether that set must contain an arithmetic progression. In 2023, computer scientists Zander Kelley and Raghu Meka showed that if the density approaches zero at a rate roughly similar to or slower than the black line above, the set must contain a progression. This upper limit is dramatically lower than “the logarithmic barrier” (broken in 2020 and shown in red), but it is still a long way from the lower limit (identified by Felix Behrend decades ago).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s next?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When Kelley and Meka started on the 3-AP problem, they thought they would probably just poke around to identify the barriers to moving the upper limit down. A year later, the two were writing a paper about their breakthrough. “I think one thing that kept us going was it never felt like we were completely hitting a wall,” Meka says. “It always felt like we were either learning something useful, or we were actually making progress.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meka describes their overall approach, based on Roth’s early techniques, as exploiting a “wishful dichotomy” between randomness and structure. They developed a definition of pseudorandomness for their work and showed that for this definition, any dense enough pseudorandom set must contain at least one arithmetic progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After handling the pseudorandom case, the team considered more structured sets of numbers and showed that those sets too had to exhibit the desired patterns. Finally, Kelley and Meka expanded from these types of sets to all large enough sets of numbers, proving that those sets must have the properties of either the pseudo­random or the structured sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft" style="border-style:none;border-width:0px;border-radius:0px"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Three equally spaced things. That’s probably the simplest pattern you can imagine.&#8221;</p><cite>Raghu Meka</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The most remarkable thing about Kelley and Meka’s work is that they were able to make such dramatic progress without developing a new approach to arithmetic progressions. Though they brought new insights and established new connections to previous work, they did not create new machinery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It just seemed completely intractable to push those techniques through,” Sisask says, “until this paper by Kelley and Meka landed in my inbox.” He and Bloom, who had previously broken the logarithmic barrier, “spent a while digesting the paper and talking about it until we understood it in our own language,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mathematicians and computer scientists tend to use some different notation and terminology, but Sisask, Bloom and other experts in the field quickly recognized the work as solid. After digesting the arguments, Sisask and Bloom wrote an explanation of the work, with some subtle technical improvements, geared toward other researchers in combinatorics. Several months later, the team coaxed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07211" data-type="URL" data-id="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the upper limit down a tiny bit more</a>, getting a new bound of 1/e<sup>(log(N))^1/9</sup>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combinatorics researchers are still trying to figure out how low they can go. Will they be able to push the upper limit all the way down to the best known lower limit, or will there always be a little gap where our knowledge is incomplete? Kelley and Meka are using the tools they honed on arithmetic progressions to continue work on problems in complexity theory and other areas of theoretical computer science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked Meka how two computer scientists made such a big advance on a mathematics problem that had stumped combinatorics experts for years, he said he isn’t sure. He thinks maybe their edge came from being fresh to the challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The problem has been around for a long time and progress seemed pretty stuck,” he says. In fact, after he and Kelley were well on their way to publishing, Kelley says he ran across a <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/more-on-the-cap-set-problem/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/more-on-the-cap-set-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post from 2011</a> that outlined exactly why mathematicians were pessimistic about the very approach that the two had eventually used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People thought that these techniques couldn’t push beyond existing barriers,” Meka says, “but maybe we didn’t know that the barriers existed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the past 14 years, a cardiac surgeon in Italy has been trying to blow the whistle on a study written by his former colleagues that has been the subject of several investigations – with two of them finding problems with the data. And despite defeating three defamation lawsuits, two&nbsp; which were brought by authors of the paper, he&#8217;s not giving up yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2006 paper, <a href="https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(06)00308-4/fulltext">‘Relationship between atrial histopathology and atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery’</a>, written by several of cardiac surgeon Vittorio Mantovani’s colleagues at the Ospedale di Circolo in Varese, was published in the <em>Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery</em>. To date, the paper – which has been cited 57 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – has been investigated by at least two institutions as well as the journal. None have resulted in a retraction, despite one university finding that only a little more than half of the patients in the dataset could be matched unambiguously with biopsy samples. One university is also waiting on the journal to act before it considers reopening its own investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Mantovani, the red flags started appearing in 2010, when he came across a minor discrepancy between two other papers written by him and his colleagues. He thought it was odd that in one dataset, patients were identified by name, but in the other, they were identified using numbers. </p>



<span id="more-128817"></span>



<p>Mantovani asked Giuseppe Cozzi, an author of the 2006 paper and first author of both of the other papers, for a list of the patients’ names. He received no reply, and Cozzi has not responded to our request for comment on this story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mantovani says Cozzi not answering a “simple question” led to him losing confidence in his colleagues and their published work. He made efforts to have the 2006 paper investigated by the institutions involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings of the first institutional investigation into the paper came from Umeå University in 2012 – where lead author of the paper, Giovanni Mariscalco, had completed the study as part of his PhD thesis. Their report, written in Swedish and Italian, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Umea-Investigation.pdf">found several inconsistencies in the dataset</a>, but ultimately concluded that there were no reasons to suspect scientific dishonesty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things had taken a turn for the worse in the Varese hospital once Mantovani voiced his skepticism of his colleagues’ published work. In a complaint to police,<strong> </strong>he accused his colleagues of workplace harassment. They were cleared of the charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mantovani was also sued for defamation by two of the paper’s authors — Mariscalco and Andrea Sala, plus a third from Cesare Beghi, the head of cardiac surgery at Varese hospital. He won <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20230715-assoluzione-vs-Beghi.pdf">all</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cassazione-Sala.pdf">three</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cassazione-Mariscalco.pdf">cases</a>. Beghi has not responded to requests for comment, and Sala could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Being honest is expensive,” Mantovani said. “But what is the alternative?”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Part of Umeå’s investigation relied on the hospital in Varese verifying the authenticity of the data. In response to questions from the university, Cesare Beghi, the head of cardiac surgery at the hospital, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Beghi-Letters.pdf">wrote two letters verifying that the data was accurate</a>, and effectively put an end to the investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of the police involvement in the previous allegations at the hospital, they had been wiretapping conversations among the staff.<strong> </strong>Police wiretaps from November 2012 – which the University of Insubria would later include in an appendix to an investigation report – revealed that the letters Beghi wrote were drafted with Mariscalco, the lead author of the 2006 paper and one of the subjects of Umeå’s inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in September 2017, the University of Insubria – the home institution for several of the paper’s authors – published the results of its own investigation into the paper. It found that the paper was not randomized as it had claimed, that only 41 patients out of the 70 could be matched unambiguously with each biopsy slide, and that eight patients were enrolled before the approval of the ethics committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uv94fM8ks8U3IjvTnrdi3S6JUOqjnp1U/view?usp=sharing">final report</a> of the investigation, Mariscalco told the investigators he had requested the folders with the collected data from the hospital, but the folders were found empty. Sala, one of the coauthors, told the committee that the patients were not randomized to protect their health. The report concluded that the committee had “doubts as to the collection of the data and the complete correctness of the research analysis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Mariscalco wrote that he was neither the principal investigator nor the one responsible for data histological storage, documentation or analysis. “I must point out that the overarching evidence around the study and its conclusions have never been questioned by the several investigations that have taken place,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He adds: “Despite some discrepancy across different datasets have been raised, these were largely anticipated in view of the temporal gap (more than 15 years) between the period when the study was conducted and the time when the clarifications were requested.”</p>



<p>In October 2017, Insubria sent the translated copy of its findings to Umeå University and then-editor of the <em>Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,</em> Richard D. Weisel, who declined to comment for this story. The journal has not taken any visible action on the paper.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Umeå University revisited the issue in 2018 and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Begaranomprovning-FS2.7.2-10-18.pdf">according to a letter (in Swedish)</a> written by the University’s legal representative, Chatarina Larson, and Patrik Danielson, the dean of the faculty of medicine, they decided not to act on the findings of Insubria’s investigation. They wrote that if the <em>Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery </em>took action against the article, Umeå University would have reason to review the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Larson explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>…in Swedish Administrative Law (1985:223) (today Swedish Administrative Law (2017:900)); A Swedish authority may change a decision it has pronounced if it is incorrect. But regardless of such incorrectness it is not allowed to change such a decision if the decision by its nature is favorable to any individual party. In such case it must not be changed to that individual´s disadvantage, unless the inaccuracy is due to the party having provided incorrect or misleading information…</p>



<p>Umeå University is an administrative authority of the state of Sweden and obliged to comply with Swedish law. According to the clause of the Swedish Administrative law referred to above Umeå University was not allowed to reconsider the matter from 2012 unless its former decision was found to be incorrect &#8211; and if so &#8211; the incorrect decision was based upon incorrect or misleading information deliberately provided by the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Umeå University’s decision from 2012 was a decision by its nature favorable to the party concern. The Italian report did not draw any conclusions in the matter of whether the data inconsistencies were intentional or negligent. Thus, there were no circumstances that showed that Umeå University&#8217;s decision in that regard was incorrect.</p>



<p>In other words there was no legal possibilities, or obligations, for the university to reconsider its earlier decision in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Danielson, Umeå University contacted the journal to ask whether they would take action based on the findings of the investigation and received no response. Mantovani himself has contacted the journal several times to follow up on whether they would be taking action on the paper, and says he has received no reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, the current editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, </em>G. Alexander Patterson, wrote that he hadn’t been aware of the issue until our email in January and consulted the previous editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said that the journal’s ethics committee did an internal investigation “with appropriate due diligence”, and decided not to retract. “I understand that the matter was also before the Italian courts,” he wrote. “We are not aware of their deliberations or decisions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no indication of the internal or external investigations into the paper on the journal’s website. “Maybe they have a good reason not to retract the paper or not to put a notice of warning,” Mantovani says. “The rest of the scientific world should know that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his response to our questions, Mariscalco wrote that the paper had been subject to several investigations, including a UK investigation he declined to share, which “cleared me from any allegations, including research misconduct.” He then threatened to sue if we published a story about this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given those evidence, and given the long list of attacks around the same matters I have been subjected over the years, I will consider harassment and defamation any article that reports these incredibly old allegations without giving great relevance to the conclusions of all the following investigations that have cleared my name from any allegations/charges. Please be advised that I could pursue legal actions to the appropriate Authorities to protect my reputation, and this may include seeking damages for the harm caused.</p>

                An idea derived from string theory suggests that dark matter is hidden in an as-yet-unseen extra dimension. Scientists are racing to test the theory to see if it holds up.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-trees-irreplaceable-habitats-mountain-pines">Ancient trees’ gnarled, twisted shapes provide irreplaceable habitats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s oldest, knotted and scarred pine trees are a boon for forest life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These old mountain pines (<em>Pinus uncinata</em>) offer food and shelter for lichens and insects not just because they’re old, but also <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317866121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of what’s allowed them to grow so old in the first place</a>, researchers report February 5 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.&nbsp;The findings highlight the broader importance of big, old trees, and suggest threats to their survival from development, fire or climate change could deliver irreparable harm in certain ecosystems.</p>



<p>Old growth trees <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-african-baobabs-are-dying-and-no-one-knows-why">continue to decline</a> around the world (<em>SN</em>: 6/18/18).&nbsp;In Europe, the remaining patches of forest with plentiful old trees constitute just 0.7 percent (or just under 3.5 million acres) of the continent’s forested area. This paper and others like it “are really good, because they show how important old growth is,” says Joseph Birch, an ecologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing who wasn’t involved with the research.&nbsp;This line of work serves as a reminder that we need to have a long-term perspective on old growth trees. “We need to be managing and conserving the forests that we have now, even if they&#8217;re younger, so that our descendants in a few hundred or even thousand years can have more old growth on the landscape,” Birch says.</p>

<p>While the pines’ old age, potentially hundreds of years old, was intriguing to plant physiologist Sergi Munné-Bosch and ecophysiologist Ot Pasques, both at the University of Barcelona, they have also been curious how aging and tree decay affect the broader forest ecosystem, with different life and decay stages providing differing habitat needs to plant, animal and lichen species.</p>



<p>Prior studies tended to look at how individual trees aged. So Munné-Bosch and Pasques decided up the ante. They studied young, adult and extremely old mountain pines in five different areas of the Spanish Pyrenees mountains. The duo calculated the trees’ ages based on tree trunk girth. (The two traits are correlated, eliminating the need to bore a sample out of the trunk to count tree rings). The team also weighed and measured needles, buds and shoots, analyzed the trees’ tissues for biochemicals linked to stress, decay and growth and noted age-related physical traits in the trees — such as exposed roots, fissured bark and lightning scars. Data on other species living in or on the trees were also recorded.</p>



<p>The results show that the oldest trees no longer spend a lot of energy on reproduction, ramping down the production of cones and buds, slowing their growth considerably and prioritizing stress tolerance and long-term durability. Ancient trees also allow parts of their bodies to die and decay alongside living sections. These are adaptations for staying alive hundreds of years, and they make the oldest trees knotted, scarred and full of large, dead sections, which are exploited by other forest life.</p>



<p>Ant colonies and plants like mountain houseleek (<em>Sempervivum montanum</em>) live in these dead and decaying sections. Trees with biochemical changes associated with decline and decay also tended to host more lichen, and the bigger, older trees had a higher diversity of lichen living on them. “Lichens look for very specific microhabitats for survival in high mountains,” Munné-Bosch says. Wolf lichen (<em>Letharia vulpina</em>), for instance, is rare in this part of Europe, and when the team encountered it, it was growing mostly on ancient pines.</p>

<p>Younger pines, which don’t have the unique physical and physiological features of ancient trees, can’t support forest life like ancient trees do. This makes ancient trees’ ecological role “irreplaceable,” Munné-Bosch says.</p>



<p>“For a lot of people who work with old trees, this is something that we intuitively knew. But it hadn’t necessarily been presented in this way and with such a compelling body of evidence to support it,” Birch says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These results are only for a single tree species, he notes. In giant sequoias, which live thousands of years, aging doesn’t cause the tree to contort in shape as dramatically as the stunted mountain pines that grow at high elevations, so ancient sequoias’ influence on biodiversity might look different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Branching out to study other tree species is the team’s next step, Munné-Bosch says.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A recent study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Ecology and Evolution</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> explores the pathology of theropods &#8211; bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs &#8211;  finding evidence of non-injurious pathologies and suggesting that abelisaurids may have been prone to osteomyelitis.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using CT scans and bone histology analysis, researchers examined the remains of three theropod species, suggesting new insights into the paleopathologies for non-tetanuran theropods.  Among the specimens studied, several anomalies were uncovered, including fused vertebrae indicative of congenital disorders and signs of inflammatory arthritis. In one specimen, a theropod exhibited irregular bone formation in its tibia, presenting a rare indication of disease in a weight-bearing bone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the exact causes of these ancient afflictions remain uncertain, the study provides a glimpse into the health challenges faced by theropods and offers valuable clues about their evolutionary adaptations. By improving our understanding of paleopathology and unravelling the secrets buried within fossilized remains, researchers continue to piece together the fascinating history of prehistoric life on Earth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Navigating the complex landscape of ethics in healthcare is no easy feat, especially when it comes to addressing the diverse moral perspectives over what ‘good care’ actually involves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although clinical ethics support (CES) instruments play an important role in aiding healthcare professionals and organisations, current tools fail to adequately address the complexities of moral pluralism and intersectional aspects of diversity and social justice issues. However, a recent study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Medical Ethics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> showcases the recently developed Diversity Compass, designed to address this gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Developed through participatory methods, the Diversity Compass offers a groundbreaking approach to navigating complex moral dilemmas in healthcare settings. By providing practical guidance tailored to the diverse needs of patients and stakeholders, this innovative instrument empowers healthcare professionals to make ethically sound decisions that respect the values and rights of all individuals. With the Diversity Compass at their disposal, healthcare teams can chart a course toward greater inclusivity, understanding, and ethical excellence in patient care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The recognition of domestic violence experiences in men, young people, and children has long been overlooked, leaving a critical gap in support services. Whilst initiatives such as IRIS (Identification and Referral to Improve Safety) have made strides in addressing the needs of women experiencing domestic violence, there is a growing need to extend this support to other vulnerable populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">IRIS+ is an intervention developed to specifically cater to the needs of men and children/young people experiencing domestic violence, without diminishing the support and responses of affected women. In a study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Primary Care</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, researchers evaluate the feasibility of implementing the adapted IRIS+ intervention in England and Wales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The IRIS+ intervention includes several components, including clinical training for primary care teams, a direct referral pathway for patients to advocate editors, individualized advocacy support, and referral to specialized group programs. The results demonstrated the accessibility and feasibility of the IRIS+ intervention, marking a significant step forward in addressing domestic violence across diverse demographics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the findings are promising, they also underscore the need for further research to explore the implementation of IRIS+ on a larger scale. By advocating for inclusive and tailored interventions like IRIS+, we can begin to  address the gap in domestic violence identification and support, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of gender or age, receive the care and assistance they need.</span></p>

Human encroachment has led to extensive habitat fragmentation and the construction of roads, severely disrupting the natural landscape and threatening the survival of the species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Zoology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, researchers utilized next-generation sequencing techniques on golden takin muscle samples collected across three geographical locations (Niubeliang, Zhouzhi, and Foping) in order to assess the population genetic diversity. The findings revealed inbreeding within the population and low levels of genetic diversity, largely attributed to the habitat fragmentation caused by human interventions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Genetic diversity is crucial in order for species to adapt to changing environmental conditions and avoid the detrimental effects of inbreeding. With the environment continuing to evolve rapidly due to ongoing human activities, urgent conservation efforts are imperative to safeguard the future of the golden takin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This research highlights the importance of implementing innovative conservation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation and bolster genetic diversity.  The authors propose several conservation initiatives, including the construction of ecological corridors to connect the existing meadow habitats, supporting genetic exchange with different populations. Implementing tourism management measures could also help to reduce the impact of human disturbance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By prioritizing these efforts, we can strive to ensure the long-term survival and resilience of this endangered species in its natural habitat.</span></p>

<p>When the American Society of Anesthesiologists last October announced the receipt of a $2.5 million donation from a drug company – “to advance education and innovation for our members”&nbsp; – the news could have been dismissed with a shrug. After all, such gifts from industry to medical societies are commonplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What makes this case noteworthy is that until the donation, the ASA and the drug maker, Pacira BioSciences, were better known as adversaries embroiled in a bitter lawsuit over <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00604-3/abstract">three articles</a> about the company’s flagship product the society had published in 2021 in its main scientific journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers, which questioned the effectiveness of Exparel, an anesthetic intended for the treatment of patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and other procedures. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/14/drug-company-withdraws-court-motion-requesting-retraction-of-papers-critical-of-its-painkiller/">we reported in May 2021</a>, as part of a larger suit against the ASA, Pacira demanded in legal filings that the ASA and its journal, <em>Anesthesiology</em>, retract the papers, which it considered libelous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company didn’t hold that stance long, however. We wrote then:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128797"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The company asked the court for a preliminary injunction to retract two papers and an editorial about Exparel that Anesthesiology published in February. But on May 7,&nbsp; Pacira withdrew the motion, about a week after the ASA filed its own motion calling for a quick hearing on the merits of the company’s motion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also noted at the time ASA was taking a hard line against Pacira. The society said then:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Although Pacira started this lawsuit, ASA will not shy away from refuting Pacira’s claims and from exposing the important issues with Pacira’s controversial drug.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pacira may have backed down from its demands for retraction, but it didn’t quit the case – even after the the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCOURTS-njd-2_21-cv-09264">ruled in February 2022</a> the drug maker “fail[ed] to state a claim for trade libel against any defendant.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pacira appealed that decision. And lost again, in March 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Praising the appellate court’s ruling, the ASA issued a statement quoting its then-president, Michael Champeau:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This affirmation of the district court’s dismissal is an important victory for ASA as well as for the scientific process and free speech. … This decision makes clear that pharmaceutical companies are not free to intimidate the scientific process by filing meritless lawsuits.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What a difference seven months makes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2023, the ASA posted a <a href="https://www.asahq.org/about-asa/newsroom/news-releases/2023/10/asa-announces-new-industry-supporter-pacira-biosciences">press release</a> highlighting Pacira’s beneficence. The statement reads, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As an Industry Supporter, Pacira is helping to establish a strong, mutually beneficial relationship with the anesthesiology community, strengthen collaboration between physician anesthesiologists and industry, and add to the value the Society provides to patients and the public, while providing invaluable year-round support of ASA programs and priorities related to non-opioid alternatives and postsurgical care.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release does not mention the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Evan Kharasch, the top editor of <em>Anesthesiology</em> when the Exparel case began and a named defendant in Pacira’s initial suit, told us he had “no knowledge other than the ASA press releases” of the circumstances around Pacira’s donation to ASA and would not speak to its propriety. However, he said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I’m pleased and grateful that the ASA chose to defend the journal and the authors in this case.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kharasch, who wrote an article for the <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00604-3/abstract"><em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em></a> this month about the lawsuit’s implication for academic freedom, added the fact the company lost its suit “speaks to the fact that courtrooms are not the place to debate science.”&nbsp;<br />Pacira did not respond to a request for an interview. But a <a href="https://investor.pacira.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-society-anesthesiologists-announces-new-industry">joint press release</a> with ASA, dated Oct. 12, 2023, quotes Dave Stack, the CEO and board chair of the company, saying:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Pacira is pleased to support ASA and we look forward to collaborating in our efforts to improve patient outcomes through opioid-minimizing strategies. … Our organizations share a common interest in advancing education and innovation for the anesthesia community and the patients we serve. We believe that working together, Pacira and the ASA can effect significant change in the best interest of patients.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release notes Pacira’s grant puts it in rarified company:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Launched in 2010, ASA’s Industry Supporter Program is limited to 10 organizations at any time. Participation is intended for companies who want to stand apart by showcasing high-level commitment to the education of physician anesthesiologists, the anesthesia care team and advancement of the specialty.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ASA president Ronald L. Harter told Retraction Watch that “the grant is not related to the lawsuit, which concluded long before the grant was ever discussed.” &nbsp;(The lawsuit concluded at the end of March 2023. The grant was announced in October 2023.)</p>



<p>Harter continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have moved forward and are pleased with the grant from Pacira to advance the medical specialty of anesthesiology and the perioperative, pain medicine and critical care our members provide; facilitate best-in-class clinician education; and improve patient care.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Harter declined to say exactly how much the legal fees totaled, but said they “were substantially in excess of the grant amount. As noted, the two are unrelated.”</p>



<p>James Eisenach, an author of one of the Exparel papers and a named defendant in the Pacira suit, declined to comment on the donation. However, Eisenach praised ASA for paying for the legal defenses of himself and the other defendants, and called the outcome of the case: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>a resounding success for science. … I was really pleased; I think it’s precedent-setting.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But word of the donation has displeased some anesthesiologists, who did not want to be identified because of their connections with the ASA. One person familiar with Pacira’s gift called the payment “blood money,” adding: “I question the ethics” of the arrangement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another leading anesthesiologist told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The larger academic community was appalled by the implications of the Pacira legal maneuvers that challenged academic freedom of journals and societies, not to mention individual authors.&nbsp; So the strong defense by ASA and the fact that ASA prevailed was a major win.&nbsp; I was not happy to see this current bit of news. If it had been up to me,&nbsp; I would have told them exactly where to deposit their donation!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Asked about these concerns, Harter said<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We recognize that it’s possible there are varying opinions across our membership of 57,000, but we believe that in general our members are looking forward to the progress that can be made through this support and understand the importance of working together with industry to achieve critical goals such as enhancing care and optimizing patient outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Cancer drugs by computer</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/searching-cancer-drugs-computer"><em>Science News</em></a>, February 23, 1974</p>



<p>Chemists often need to sort a large number of compounds according to whether or not they possess a given property.… [Researchers] have been working on a technique of getting computers to teach themselves how to solve such problems. The most recent experiments indicate that the technique [based on pattern recognition] may be useful in finding cancer drugs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Modern computers can do more than sift through known compounds. With advanced artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-crowdsources-data-speed-drug-discovery">computers are helping scientists</a> design novel molecules and predict how those compounds will react with proteins in the body, possibly leading to new cancer treatments (<em>SN: 10/18/18</em>). The technology is promising but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03172-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still in its early days</a>. Ultimately, most drug candidates will still falter in people, some scientists caution. In 2021, the international biotech company Exscientia launched the <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/exscientia-to-start-world-first-clinical-trials-of-ai-designed-immuno-oncology-drug/?cf-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first trial of an AI-developed cancer drug</a>. But the company <a href="https://endpts.com/exscientia-ends-cancer-study-as-it-focuses-on-other-trials-of-ai-driven-drug-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shelved the drug</a> in 2023 after it proved to be ineffective. Other AI cancer drugs are in various stages of testing.</p>
