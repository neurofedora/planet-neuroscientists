<p>Pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/01/22/clare-francis-scores-a-bullseye-journal-of-cell-biology-paper-retracted-for-image-manipulation/">flagged thousands of papers</a> over the years, so they rarely see something new. But an email from Frontiers about an upcoming retraction on a paper Francis originally flagged offered just that: The option to be acknowledged in the retraction notice.</p>



<p>After years of publishers not routinely – or even often – naming sleuths despite <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/data-sleuths-work-thankless-they-must-get-credit-retractions">many asking for their often unpaid</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/04/08/journals-acknowledge-that-a-critical-reader-has-a-name-elisabeth-bik/">risky work</a> to be acknowledged, the trend of acknowledging who identified issues in papers may be gaining momentum. Frontiers is one of several publishers developing such policies, and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) plans to release new guidelines in August that would recommend this practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frontiers began offering acknowledgements last year, a spokesperson for the company told Retraction Watch. “Once investigations are complete, the third party is informed of the outcome and, if a retraction is to be published, offered the option to be recognized in the notice with a standardized statement,” they said.</p>



<span id="more-132452"></span>



<p>In the email Francis received, they were offered the option to be thanked by name, or as “the concerned reader.” (Francis chose the latter.)</p>



<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2022.939224">retraction published in March</a> gave a shout-out to another sleuth familiar to our readers: “Frontiers would like to thank Alexander Magazinov for contacting the journal regarding the published article.”</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2025.1673270/abstract">some</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1575634">retractions</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1642419">now</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1548141">contain</a> this standardized statement, the publisher uses it only when the investigation originated from a third party raising concerns, the spokesperson told us.</p>



<p>Other publishers plan to follow suit. Both Springer Nature and Wiley representatives told us they are working on policies to acknowledge third parties across their journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are a number of important areas that we believe need careful consideration,” Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity, resolutions, for Springer Nature told us, “including potential legal risk to those who are named in notices, permanence of records of investigations, thresholds for inclusion, an effective process for opting in or out of recognition, and a process for launching it across over three thousand journals.”</p>



<p>For Wiley journals, “if the concern was shared with us in confidence, we will only include the source&#8217;s name if they have provided permission, and if the journal’s editor also agrees,” a spokesperson told us. As this process varies by journal, “we are working toward a more standard approach across our portfolio.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We asked Francis, as well as sleuths Alexander Magazinov, David Bimler, and Dorothy Bishop, for their thoughts on new policies to name third parties in retraction notices. All four favored this type of policy because it increases transparency into the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ideally publishers should link to a PubPeer thread and contributors&#8217; pseudonyms, if they were notified through public channels,” said Bimler, a retired perceptual psychologist from Massey University in New Zealand.</p>



<p>He and the others noted that giving credit should not come at the expense of offering anonymity. “It is extremely important not to disclose the third party&#8217;s name if they don&#8217;t explicitly consent to that,” said Magazinov, a software engineer in Kazakhstan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sleuths emphasized that getting credit was secondary to the main goal, “decontamination of the scientific literature,” as Magazinov put it.</p>



<p>“It might also help forge a more positive relationship between sleuths and publishers,” said Bishop, an emeritus professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. These relationships have been strained in the past, partially due to policies explicitly denying sleuths credit. Thomas Tischler, a senior editor at Springer Nature, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/data-sleuths-work-thankless-they-must-get-credit-retractions">told sleuths last year</a> that “by policy, we do not mention how the case came to us and do not acknowledge any external parties.”</p>



<p>The Frontiers spokesperson said the initiative “has been positively received by third parties and the broader publishing community.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>COPE Chair Nancy Chescheir told <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/45157_06-2025_corrections-and-retractions-study-committee-meeting-1#sectionWebFriendly">a committee of the National Academy of Sciences </a>in June her group would be revising its guidelines for retractions later this summer. “If concerns about the article are raised by a third party, their name could be included in the retraction notice, if relevant, with permission,” she said at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holden Thorp, Editor-in-Chief of the <em>Science </em>family of journals, told the same committee that <em>Science </em>would prefer to acknowledge sleuths, but institutions and authors “are often very hostile to the idea of including the sleuths.” He said he was happy to hear about the new policy because “if we can fall back on a COPE guideline that allows us to put that in there, we’ll definitely start doing it.”</p>



<p>Sleuths aren’t the only ones receiving credit under the new guidelines. “If concerns were raised by an institutional investigation, this information should be included,” Chescheir told the National Academies committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A COPE spokesperson said the updated retraction guideline is being finalized and requires trustee approval, but they expect it to launch in August.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://bjoern.brembs.net/2025/07/edgewise/">Edgewise</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>I have been involved in the open science movement for nearly 20 years now. By now,  it seems to me the problems have been clearly recognized and formulated, the experts agree on the necessary technical solutions (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.230206">replacing the journals</a>) and the funding is available. And yet, academia keeps trying to put band-aids on an unfixable, FUBAR system, despite all the obvious signs of decay, the counter-productive effects of the band aids and the waste of it all. Being merely a science nerd, I lack the word-smithing abilities to put my frustration into prose. In my helplessness, I described how I perceived the situation to an LLM &#8211; it&#8217;s about language, after all &#8211; and asked it to write a short story. I can&#8217;t say anything about the quality of the writing, English is not my first language and the author is only an LLM after all, but in a weird and funny, yet somewhat melancholic way, it does capture the, to me at least, most important aspects. But that&#8217;s probably just because I recognized my idea in the story, and no-one else will. No matter,  it works for me. In my experience, Dr. Blenkinsop (no intended relation to any potentially existing persons with this name) is only all too representative:</em></p>



<p><br /></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“Edgewise”</strong></h2>



<p><strong>By Roger T. Blenkinsop, PhD</strong><br /><em>Plenary Speaker, Fellow of the Anthropocentric Perimeter Institute, Vice Chair of the Committee on Edge-Event Forecasting (EEF)</em></p>



<p>Look, all I’m saying is: if people <em>could</em> fall off the edge of the Earth—and let’s be honest, it still hasn’t been definitively proven that they <em>couldn’t</em>—then wouldn’t we all feel like jackasses for not having built the fence?</p>



<p>That’s what I asked Marcy last week at the airport, and she gave me that look. The one that means, <em>Roger, you’re being embarrassing in public again.</em> But I stand by it. Because really, what’s more embarrassing: speaking up for human survival in the face of complex and evolving geospatial paradigms, or just sitting back and doing nothing while toddlers in the Global South toddle ever closer to the lip of the abyss?</p>



<p>And yes, I <em>have</em> read the new data. I’ve seen the satellite images, the curvature metrics, the whole shebang. But that doesn’t negate twenty years of evidence-based policymaking. It just… reframes it. In light of new parameters. Which is <em>exactly</em> what science is supposed to do.</p>



<p>I mean, we were never dogmatists. That was always the Flat-Earther’s problem, ironically. <em>We</em> were empirical. Rational. Willing to adapt. And if the Earth happens to be a sphere—or spheroid, technically—then the fence just needs to be reconceptualized as a <strong>Circumglobal Perimeter Awareness System</strong>. Which, by the way, is something I’ve already proposed in draft form to the European Regional Advisory Sub-Cluster. (Pending feedback.)</p>



<p>Besides, by now it’s not just about the edge. It’s about <em>fence equity</em>. About <em>geoboundary justice</em>. About reminding people that some of us tried to do something, even if it was, strictly speaking, based on a misapprehension of topological fundamentals. The <em>intent</em> was sound. The funding mechanisms were transparent. And the symposium sandwiches were, in many cases, quite reasonable.</p>



<p>Anyway, we board in twenty minutes. I need to work on my plenary slides. I’m calling it <strong>“From Edge to Embrace: Toward a Holistic Model of Horizon-Responsive Infrastructure.”</strong> Marcy says that sounds like I’m giving up. I say it sounds like tenure.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>



<p>We arrived in Oslo to light sleet and heavy guilt. The &#8220;Global Summit on Terminal Geography&#8221; was hosted in a former ski lodge now serving as a climate-neutral academic retreat. The building had no corners. Only curves. Symbolic, they said.</p>



<p>The plenary panel was titled <strong>“Flattening the Curve: Ethics and Optics in a Post-Flat World.”</strong> I was slotted between a geo-anthropologist from Stanford and a behavioral economist from Zurich who had developed a fence-cost calculator app called “FallStop,” which predicted potential edge casualties in developing nations based on altitude, GDP, and media coverage.</p>



<p>After my presentation—modestly received, some light clapping, two nods from the Norwegian delegation—I was approached by Dr. Lubna Al-Fajr, who had once chaired the now-defunct “Wall Subcommittee.” She looked worn.</p>



<p>“Roger,” she said, “we’ve got to let it go. The fence. The grants. The think pieces. All of it.”</p>



<p>“Lubna,” I said, gently, “we’re not building a fence. We’re building <em>confidence</em>. A global sense of spatial dignity. Even if the Earth <em>is</em> round—”</p>



<p>“Which it is.”</p>



<p>“—the fence was always metaphorical. An organizing principle. A boundary against chaos.”</p>



<p>She looked at me like I was trying to sell her expired milk.</p>



<p>“Roger,” she said, “they found a paper you co-authored in 2007 that describes the Earth as an ‘inverted lasagna of potential descent vectors.’”</p>



<p>“Well,” I coughed, “metaphor.”</p>



<p>“You also used Comic Sans for the footnotes.”</p>



<p>I had no defense for that.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>



<p>Back in my room, I opened the minibar, took out a tiny gin labeled <em>Arctic Botanicals</em>, and began revising my proposal for the rebranded initiative: <strong>Fence 2.0: Reclaiming the Edge in a Borderless World<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong>.</p>



<p>I used more passive voice this time. Phrases like <em>stakeholder decoupling</em> and <em>post-linear safety affordances</em>. I added a diagram shaped like a Möbius strip and an appendix featuring testimonials from communities who said the fence &#8220;made them feel safe,&#8221; even though it didn’t exist yet and never would.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>



<p>Later that night, during the networking sauna, I found myself beside Dr. Sijuwade from Lagos, who was studying the psychological effects of cartographic overcertainty.</p>



<p>“Maybe,” he said, sweat streaking his glasses, “we build the fence anyway. As art. A kind of memorial. For all the things we feared but never happened.”</p>



<p>I nodded slowly. &#8220;A fear monument.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A <em>Hope-fence</em>,&#8221; he said, eyes glinting.</p>



<p>It sounded ridiculous. Then it sounded like funding.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>



<p>As I write this, I&#8217;m en route to Kyoto for the “Third Workshop on Post-Factual Infrastructures.” The turbulence is mild. The sky is clear. The Earth, curiously, continues to curve beneath us, like some old betrayal we can’t stop loving.</p>



<p>And somewhere down there—perhaps along a forgotten fault line in the Altiplano, or the ghost of an edge we once imagined—we will plant the ceremonial first post of the fence-that-will-never-be, and call it progress.</p>

<p><em>Nature </em>has issued an editorial expression of concern on a paper published 27 years ago — and nearly nine years after learning of an “irregularity” in a figure.</p>



<p>According to the June 18 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09239-w">statement</a>, a figure in the 1998 paper showed duplicated control lanes, with one of them flipped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis flagged the issue on PubPeer in 2016, and reported the problem to the journal at the same time, Francis told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132443"></span>



<p>The 1998 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/29093">paper</a> has been cited 333 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, 32 of which were after 2016 when the image issue was first flagged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/ethel-cesarman">Ethel Cesarman</a>, a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, told us she learned of the issue with the figure from the comment on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C540D0FE29B0D75B4F44F6A0DF4DAC#null">PubPeer,</a> although she did not learn about it until 2018, “when a ‘Claire Francis’ contacted my institution and collaborators, who then reached out to me.”</p>



<p>“We have procedures to assess the claims and for the institution to conduct an investigation, which in this case found an issue related to the use of cropped gels leading to an inadvertent image duplication on negative control lanes,” Cesarman told us. She said she contacted the journal about the paper after the conclusion of the investigation in 2021. “After reviewing the institution’s report, the journal makes their own decision regarding informing their readers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Weill Cornell Medicine confirmed the institute investigated the paper, and that the wording of the notice “reflects the findings of our evaluation through institutional processes.”</p>



<p>All the authors except one, for whom the journal could not obtain current contact information, agreed with the journal’s decision.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Nature</em> did not address our question about when they first heard about the problem with the figure.</p>



<p>“Given the age of the article and the fact that the authors no longer have the original raw data for the figure, we determined in consultation with the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group that issuing an Editorial Expression of Concern (EEoC) was the most appropriate course of action,” the spokesperson said. “This allows us to alert readers to interpret the results with caution while acknowledging that the concern could not be fully resolved.”</p>



<p>Cesarman has one previous retraction with different coauthors. Published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Medicine</em>, the 2004 paper earned a correction in 2006 and was retracted in 2021 ”due to multiple instances of splicing and the image manipulation to remove background gel artifacts” following an investigation by Weill Cornell Medicine, according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.2003146702062021r">retraction notice</a>. Including this retraction and a correction, Cesarman has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Ethel+Cesarman">14 papers</a> with comments on PubPeer.</p>

                For too long, biomedical studies have favoured male subjects, leaving gaps in our understanding of how diseases affect women. A new review in Communications Biology explores the past, present, and future of sex-inclusive preclinical research and why it’s essential for better science and safer treatments.

<p>The publisher Frontiers has begun retracting a batch of 122 articles across five journals after an investigation found a network of authors and editors engaged in “unethical actions” such as manipulating citations and reviewing papers without disclosing conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher&#8217;s research integrity team has identified more than 4,000 articles linked to the network in journals owned by seven other companies, according to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/07/29/frontiers-research-integrity-team-uncovers-peer-review-manipulation-network">a company statement</a>. The team said it is willing to share details and the methodology of their investigation with other publishers upon request. The company is a member of the STM Hub, a platform publishers use to share such information.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132423"></span>



<p>As the publishing industry comes to grips with its <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">paper mill</a> problem, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">many</a> firms have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/exclusive-plos-one-to-retract-more-than-100-papers-for-manipulated-peer-review/">issued</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/02/sage-retracts-more-than-200-papers-from-journal-for-compromised-peer-review/">retractions</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">in bulk</a>. Frontiers retracted a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/08/frontiers-retracts-nearly-40-papers-linked-to-authorship-for-sale/">batch of 40</a> in 2023, and a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/01/11/frontiers-retracts-a-dozen-papers-many-more-expected/">dozen</a> the year before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest tranche of retractions began to appear July 28. By our count, at least 25 were posted that day. According to one of the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/energy-research/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2025.1674607/abstract">notices</a>, which are identical for each paper, the publisher’s investigation “identified this article as one for which the integrity of the peer review process has been undermined, resulting in the loss of confidence in the article&#8217;s findings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation “was not able to determine whether all authors, editors, or reviewers were aware of or involved in the misconduct, but this misconduct was significant enough to determine that the scientific integrity of the article cannot be guaranteed,” the notices state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frontiers-mass-retractions-July-2025-Google-Sheets.pdf">list of the forthcoming retractions</a> Frontiers provided us names one paper from <em>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</em>, six from <em>Frontiers in Public Health, </em>29 from <em>Frontiers in Energy Research</em>, 33 from <em>Frontiers in Environmental Science</em>, and 53 from <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. Most were published in 2022. </p>



<p>The investigation began after a reader noted undisclosed conflicts of interest in the peer review of a single paper, according to the statement. PubPeer user “Desmococcus antarctica” has posted comments on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/68DA1131B4B7B9121ADE6B0E59899B">some</a> of the papers to be retracted, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C4E349B3C0DA5B657C1AE351771426">identifying</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6394AEA709E5043763916708FA33F4">instances</a> in which an author and reviewer had previously coauthored a paper together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the first tip, the research integrity team began investigating all the authors’ previous submissions, publications, and coauthor networks, the publisher’s statement said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the investigation proceeded, it became clear that a broad and sophisticated network of about 35 authors were potentially colluding over a very large number of journals and published papers, a fraction of which were published by Frontiers,” according to the statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frontiers has an artificial intelligence review system for submitted manuscripts, which now includes verification of the reviewers’ and handling editors’ conflict of interest statements, the company said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Desmococcus antarctica’s <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6394AEA709E5043763916708FA33F4">comments</a> on PubPeer pertains to “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/energy-research/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2022.830286/full">Households’ Perception and Environmentally Friendly Technology Adoption: Implications for Energy Efficiency</a>,” published in 2022 in <em>Frontiers in Energy Research</em>. The user pointed out that reviewer <a href="https://cyjj.ujs.edu.cn/info/1061/1372.htm">Muhammad Mohsin</a>, an associate professor in the school of finance and economics at Jiangsu University in China, had previously coauthored a paper with one of the authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mohsin also served as an editor for the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/23204/the-future-of-energy-efficiency-in-post-covid-19-era/magazine">collection</a> in which the paper appeared. Many papers from the collection, which Frontiers calls a “Research Topic,” have been retracted, and Mohsin is listed as the handling editor on several. He did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this paper, the first author (Mahendra Kumar Trivedi, also
 known as “Guruji” on the Divine Connection website) makes extraordinary
 and unvalidated claims about his ability to change the state of matter –
 and the mental and physical health of human volunteers – via 
transmission of his thoughts (described as “blessing” throughout the 
manuscript). A peer-reviewed journal that accepts such declarations 
without incontrovertible scientific evidence, which was never provided, 
has compromised its scientific reputation. Furthermore, the study’s 
design is flawed and much of the data contained in the paper is 
  implausible and inauthentic.</p><p>. . .</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Time flies<br />Time crawls</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">–ibid</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Six months later (<span class="epub-date">24 January 2025), the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgf2.773" target="_blank">issued a retraction</a> based on my concerns.</span><sup><b><span style="color: #800180;">1</span></b></sup>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="epub-date">&nbsp;</span></p><p><b></b></p><blockquote><p><b>RETRACTION</b>: M.

informed, however, the explanation and the partial raw data provided

 lost confidence in the presented data and consider the results and

                Are rising diagnoses a sign of progress  or a medical misstep? In The Age of Diagnosis, neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan explores the surge in conditions like autism and ADHD, but her clinical lens raises urgent questions about language, inclusion, and whose voices are truly being heard. This article examines the impact of outdated terminology and the importance of respecting the neurodivergent communities at the heart of the conversation.

<p>The University of Toronto has quietly published the results of an inquiry into the Canadian National Breast Screening Study that began in 2022 and, it seems, concluded in March 2024.</p>



<p>The panel, tasked with evaluating new allegations about the trial’s randomization, found the evidence it reviewed did not affect the results of the trials, which called into question the value of mammography in women ages 40-59.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imaging scientist Martin Yaffe of the University of Toronto has long been a critic of the CNBSS, a pair of randomized clinical trials of mammography conducted in the 1980s. In April, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/28/guest-post-university-of-toronto-canadian-national-breast-screening-study/">we published a guest post</a> in which Yaffe detailed the history of the trial and his critiques of it, as well as new evidence that clinical staff may have unwittingly influenced randomization. He reported this to the Canadian Cancer Society in 2021, and to the university.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132412"></span>



<p>According to Yaffe’s timeline, the university convened an external panel in June 2022 to review this evidence. After being interviewed by the panel, Yaffe was told the review would be complete in March 2024. But the university did not release a report at that time, and “We have heard nothing since,” Yaffe wrote in the April 2025 post.</p>



<p>Last week, the university published <a href="https://research.utoronto.ca/media/1336/download?inline">the March 2024 report</a>, written by panel chair Mette Kalager of the University of Oslo. It details the group’s process and findings, and redacts names of several of the witnesses and omits interview transcripts. The 275-page report has a single-sentence conclusion: “The new information does not have a credible scientific impact on the reliability of the CNBSS.”</p>



<p>The other two committee members did not sign on to that report. “We are unable to endorse it in its current form,” Isabelle Boutron of the Université Paris Cité and Peter Jüni of the University of Oxford wrote in <a href="https://research.utoronto.ca/media/1337/download?inline">a separate statement</a> dated June 20, 2025. But the panel members came to a similar conclusion as Kalager, stating the evidence put forth in the complaint “could have had only a trivial effect on the study findings.”</p>



<p>The report and statement appeared last week on an undated page on the university’s website. In response to questions on why the University of Toronto didn’t release the report in March 2024, and when the reports were actually made public, a spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We <a href="https://research.utoronto.ca/expert-panel-review-canadian-national-breast-screening-study-cnbss">posted the materials</a> from the expert review panel on July 17, 2025, once we received the full reporting of the panel, and informed participants who were interviewed. The university appreciates the thoughtful process used by the panel to report its outcome. The members of the panel reached similar conclusions.</p>



<p>The final materials of the expert review panel are now public, and the panel’s service has concluded. Peer-reviewed journals provide an important scholarly forum that is available for discussion of cancer screening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kalager, Boutron and Jüni did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Yaffe said he plans to write a rebuttal to the review. “The sense I get in reading it is that [it] is more of an attempt to defend this trial than to impartially review the two main concerns: subversion of randomization and inclusion of women with already known symptoms in the trial,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>

<p>An early-career researcher who discovered a nearly identical version of her manuscript published by the researcher who reviewed — and recommended rejecting — the work for another journal is still awaiting a resolution 10 months after reporting her concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shafaq Aftab, now a lecturer at the University of Central Punjab in Pakistan, learned of the published study last fall in an alert from ResearchGate. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sres.3076">The paper</a>, published in <em>Systems Research and Behavioural Science </em>(<em>SRBS</em>) in September 2024<em>, </em>was not only similar to research she completed during her Ph.D. coursework, it was the exact work she had submitted to another journal in late 2023, Aftab told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An email exchange she had with the editor of that journal, <em>Information Development</em> (<em>IDV</em>), confirmed the author of the published study was a reviewer of Aftab’s manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132400"></span>



<p>Social scientist Davood Ghorbanzadeh of Islamic Azad University of Tehran North Branch in Iran denies he plagiarized any portion of Aftab’s work and said his study was based on independent research of “the highest ethical standards.”</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh had two papers retracted in December and January for significant overlap with other researchers’ work.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes <em>SRBS</em>, confirmed the publisher is still investigating the claims, which Aftab raised to the journal in September 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The discovery of the <em>SRBS</em> study was “deeply upsetting, both personally and professionally,” Aftab said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In November 2023, Aftab submitted a manuscript to <em>IDV</em>. The paper came from work she did as part of her doctoral research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two rounds of revisions, the article was rejected on Aug. 24, 2024, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh’s paper was submitted to <em>SRBS </em>on Jan. 26, 2024, and published on Sept. 18, 2024. A comparison of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ghorbanzadeh_study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the published study</a> with a copy of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Aftab_Manuscript_to_IDV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the manuscript</a> Aftab provided to us reveals several similarities. The article’s data structure, analysis, and text are markedly similar to Aftab’s original work, including frequent verbatim paragraphs. For example, the text and citations in the introductions of both papers are identical. </p>



<p>The data do differ, however. The <em>SRBS</em> study, for instance, states the primary data were collected “from 340 employees from firms located in the industrial hub of a developing economy using a simple random technique” and “analysed using Smart-PLS 3 from the manufacturing sector.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aftab collected data “from 260 employees from firms located in the industrial hub of a developing economy using a simple random technique” and analyzed them “using Smart-PLS 4 from the manufacturing sector.”</p>



<p>The text of Ghorbanzadeh’s study conclusion is identical to that of Aftab’s conclusion.</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh told us by email, “I categorically deny these allegations.” He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I did not review Ms. Aftab’s manuscript for the Journal of Information Development (IDV), nor did I suggest its rejection, as has been claimed. These accusations are entirely unfounded and appear to be an attempt to discredit my work. My study is the result of original research conducted with academic integrity, and I have not accessed or utilized any part of Ms. Aftab’s manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IDV_Email_Response.pdf">a </a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IDV_Email_Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sept. 22, 2024 email</a> Aftab shared with us, Stephen Parker, then-editor of <em>IDV</em>, told her Ghorbanzadeh was a reviewer of both versions of Aftab’s manuscript for <em>IDV</em>, and the same reviewer who recommended it be rejected.</p>



<p>“We cannot be held accountable for this behavior from reviewers,” Parker wrote in the email. “However, we can provide proof that Ghorbanzadeh reviewed this manuscript for us. It seems to us that Wiley should start an investigation with these authors and they might consider sending a complaint to these authors&#8217; institutions.”</p>



<p>Juan D. Machin-Mastromatteo, who took over as editor of <em>IDV </em>in January, declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley confirmed the editorial office at <em>SRBS</em>, as well as Wiley’s research integrity team, are aware of the concerns. Wiley initiated an investigation in September 2024, soon after receiving the complaint, the spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The authors of the article, including Davood Ghorbanzadeh, have been contacted as part of our investigation,” the spokesperson said in an email. “We have also been in contact with the other publisher involved. We expect a final outcome soon, which we will then share directly with the involved parties.”</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Wiley_Email_Reponse_to_Aftab.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Oct. 16, 2024 email</a> to Aftab and shared with us, Max Owen Williams, associate research integrity auditor for Wiley, wrote that an inquiry by the company had confirmed “there is indeed a large degree of overlap between the text and the figures presented in the two manuscripts.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ghorbanzadeh told us “any perceived similarities” between the two works “would be purely coincidental and not indicative of plagiarism.” He has been “fully cooperating” with Wiley’s investigation and has provided all relevant documentation, data, drafts, and correspondence, to support the originality of his work. He said he trusts Wiley will “thoroughly examine the matter and reach a fair conclusion.”</p>

<p>Ghorbanzadeh has had two studies retracted for plagiarism in recent months. A 2024 study in Emerald’s <em>Journal of Health Organization and Management</em>, titled “Empirical nexus of corporate social responsibility, service quality, corporate reputation and brand preference: evidence from Iranian healthcare industry,” was retracted in January because “a large portion of this article is taken, without attribution from an earlier, unpublished original work” by other coauthors, according to the <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jhom-10-2024-0409/full/html">retraction notice</a>. The notice also states all coauthors besides Ghorbanzadeh “would like it to be noted that they were not aware of this situation.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the December <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-07223-7">retraction notice</a> for a paper in <em>Current Psychology</em> stated the article “significantly overlaps with a previously published article with a largely different authorship,” with one of the authors stating “they were unaware of the submission of this article.”<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh’s coauthors of the <em>SRBS </em>study did not return our messages seeking comment.<br><br>Aftab said she reached out to all the authors of the <em>SRBS</em> study, and that she heard back from coauthor Juan Felipe Espinosa Cristia. Espinosa Cristia indicated he had no knowledge of any unethical actions or related to the study, and said he was not privy to the initial data collection.<br><br>Aftab said she hopes her experience leads to changes and creates more awareness for early-career researchers about protecting their work.</p>



<p>“It raises serious concerns about the peer review system,” she said. “If such actions go unaddressed, it sets a precedent that anyone in a review position can misuse their access to original work without consequence.”</p>
