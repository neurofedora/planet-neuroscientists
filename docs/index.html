<p>A university vice president has received his first retraction – and disagrees with it, according to the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction for <a href="https://profiles.ucla.edu/jaydutt.vadgama">Jaydutt Vadgama</a>, the Vice President for Research and Health Affairs at the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, comes after a <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1">commenter on PubPeer</a> noted similarities between data in two papers from the same group. Similar comments have led to corrections to two other papers by Vadgama, who is also professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles.</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-017-4211-y">A83-01 inhibits TGF-β-induced upregulation of Wnt3 and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells</a>,” appeared in <em>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</em> in 2017. It has been cited 38 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-024-07371-1">notice</a>, published this month, states:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129284"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>After publication, concerns were raised regarding image overlap with the authors&#8217; earlier article [1] and highly similar bands in the western blot images presented in the figures. Specifically:</p>



<ul>
<li>Figure 1d Twist, E-Cadherin and β-actin blots appear highly similar to the same proteins in Fig. 3a of [1];</li>



<li>Figure 3d α-Tubulin blot appears highly similar to the same protein in Fig, 4c of [1];</li>



<li>A number of bands in Figs. 1d, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3d, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5d and S2 appear to be duplicated.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, in Fig. 5b, the 4 h images for pSmad3 and pSmad3/DAPI don&#8217;t seem to correspond to the same area, and two nuclei in the pSmad3/DAPI image appear highly similar.</p>



<p>The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#1">April 2023</a>, PubPeer user “Actinopolyspora biskrensis” raised concerns about “possible data reuse between papers, as well as possibly duplicated signals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#2">responded</a>, and posted photos of what they said were the original gels:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for your interest in our research and being critical of the figures. We wish to reassure the commentator that there is NO data reuse between the two papers identified, even though the loading controls β-actin and α-Tubulin look similar under each blot. The first author is the primary lead investigator who conducted the studies, while the last author is the senior author and PI whose grants have funded this study. All of our data presented in the papers were produced several times by different individuals in the lab. We made sure that the data were reproduced with accuracy and reproducibility.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Actinopolyspora <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#3">responded once again</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am unable to locate the published bands in these images, with one exception.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors didn’t respond to this comment, also from April 2023. The paper’s retraction came over a year later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vadgama has not responded to our request for comment, nor has first author <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/cancer/members/yanyuan-wu">Yanyuan Wu</a>. Both did “not agree to this retraction,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of Vadgama’s other papers have <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=vadgama">comments on PubPeer</a> questioning the validity of images, which commenters have claimed appear to be repeated, overlaid, or superimposed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some PubPeer comments on Vadgama’s articles have spurred corrections. The journal <em>Cancers </em><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/1/7">issued a correction</a> last April to a paper after first author Pranabananda Dutta said “an <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/132BE5039FDCBCA817485CE574858E">inadvertent error</a>” resulted in the same image being used twice with slightly altered brightness. In another case, after Actinopolyspora biskrensis raised concerns of image splicing, horizontal stretching, and duplication, study author Nalo Hamilton admitted the image was “<a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/6E1F7DB052E59C511B3F21EDDD65A0#10">inadvertently duplicated</a>” and the <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/5/2579">issued a correction</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vadgama and a coauthor admitted mistakes or said they were looking into the issues raised for <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/B175BBC425CDDCF05F123580FE112D#2">two</a> <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/F26738B524F3162E9E389DEA6C94E4#3">other</a> papers, which have yet to be corrected.</p>

<p>The dean of science at the University of Sydney is reassessing a series of review papers after commenters on PubPeer pointed out each cited several retracted articles, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people.html">Marcel Dinger</a> and his coauthors will submit addendums to the journals noting the retracted references, he told Retraction Watch, and work with editors to determine whether the reviews should be retracted. </p>



<p>Dinger, who also is a professor of genome biology, is a middle author of four review articles and last author on one more that sleuths using the <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a> flagged as referencing retracted articles. The articles have been cited nearly 100 times altogether, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guillaume Cabanac, who developed the screener, commented on one of the papers in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B47EC3FFB2E6C1A4BB71778D3857BB#1">August 2022</a>: </p>

<p>Readers should reassess the reliability of this paper as its bibliography includes several questioned references that are likely to be unreliable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Responding to Cabanac, one of the authors, Mohammad Taheri of the Institute of Human Genetics at Jena University Hospital in Germany, who has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Mohammad+Taheri">many more papers flagged on PubPeer</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B47EC3FFB2E6C1A4BB71778D3857BB#2">wrote</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The retracted papers cited by us were retracted one or two years after our publication, not before. When writing a review paper, it is not feasible to evaluate all 200 original papers that you intend to cite.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(Helping scientists with this problem was one of the reasons we created the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx">Retraction Watch Database</a>, now <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/">part of Crossref</a>: Researchers using Zotero, Endnote and other software can automate checking their references for retracted articles.)</p>



<p>Dinger told us he and his coauthors had cited the problematic papermill articles unwittingly, and have begun assessing the damage to their work:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Most of these comments relate to a series of review papers &#8211; they were part of a cataloguing effort of noncoding RNAs in various disease contexts – the underlying work in these literature curation efforts had been intended to inform an update to the long noncoding RNA database (a project I led a number of years ago, but has since fallen out of date – (see <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/10/20/nar.gku988.long">Quek et al</a>, <em>Nucleic Acids Research</em>, 2015).</p>



<p>In an effort to be comprehensive, we erred on the side of inclusivity in terms of the literature cited in each of the specific disease contexts. What we were unaware of at the time was that this coincided with the emergence of the so-called “Chinese papermills”, which ended up contaminating the peer-reviewed literature with 1000s (or even 10,000s or 100,000s) papers that were in essence completely fraudulent. Regrettably, a number of these papers were cited in some of the review articles.</p>



<p>I am in contact with the co-authors of the affected papers at the moment and we are now undertaking a review of the papers to assess the impact of these citations to now-retracted publications (I should note the publications were not retracted at the time the papers were published). We will then put together addendums to the journals to highlight those publications that were cited that are retracted. We will also assess the overall impact to the content/commentary/conclusions in the papers. If the impact is potentially significant, we will work with the respective editors to determine if the entire paper should be retracted also.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The five flagged articles are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/666626C7935DE03E753E96AB010DD1#1">another post</a> on PubPeer questioning the ethics approval of a research paper, “<a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/human-antibodies/hab220004">HLA alleles and haplotype frequencies in Iranian population</a>,” Dinger said his co-authors have the correct approvals for the work. He has asked them to respond on PubPeer “to clear the record on this matter.”</p>

<p>A well-known content creator and former lab technician at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas admitted taking “several shortcuts” in work that has been found to contain falsified data funded by the National Institutes of Health, according to a U.S. government watchdog.</p>



<p>Darrion Nguyen, who has more than a half-million followers on his TikTok account “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lab_shenanigans">lab_shenanigans</a>,” engaged in research misconduct while working at Baylor by “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly falsifying and/or fabricating experimental data and results” of several research records, two manuscript figures, a research progress report, a poster, and a presentation, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-nguyen-darrion">said</a>.</p>



<span id="more-129267"></span>



<p>The ORI’s findings primarily concern the research report, “Illuminating GABAergic Signaling in Neurodevelopmental Disorders,” submitted to the NIH in July 2021. The report contained fabricated data of the number of mice used, their interactions, as well as enhanced mice brain measurements and symptom severity, according to the agency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was in a lab environment where I was mentally struggling, and I took several shortcuts to produce more data. This stemmed from the fear of my [principal investigator], the pressure to meet expectations to keep my job as a technician, and my personal struggles to keep up with the demands of that lab,” Nguyen told <em>Retraction Watch</em>. He said his situation underscores the dangers of the &#8220;publish or perish&#8221; culture prominent in academia.</p>



<p>Nguyen has been posting online videos and TikToks since 2019. While working as a lab technician, he often found himself meshing “late nights into creative sessions,” according to his <a href="https://www.labshenanigans.com/">website</a>. He left Baylor in September 2020 and is now a science communicator who “makes fun, easily digestible science content.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s findings concern grants funded for more than $1 million. <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/hsiao-tuan-chao-19229">Hsiao-Tuan Chao</a>, the principal investigator on the grants to Baylor, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nguyen agreed to have his research supervised for three years, and must submit supervision plans and certification of evidence if he is to be involved with any research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the NIH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Upon the launch of this investigation, I immediately stepped forward and maintained complete transparency throughout the process. I take full accountability for my mistakes and recognize the importance of owning up to them,” Nguyen said.</p>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We’ve all heard of HeLa cells, and the incredible research performed on them, but where did they come from and whose cells were they? Naomi Thorne reviews Rebecca Skloot’s </strong></span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</strong></span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>, to shine a light on the ethical disaster that Lacks and her family were victims of.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As scientists, how many of us use cell culture on a daily basis? The use of immortal cell lines is a fundamental methodology in 21st century biology that we would struggle to do research without. Thanks to the development of human cell culture, we are able to understand the mechanics of our cells better than ever before. This has allowed for the creation of vaccines, the progression of therapeutic drugs to clinical trials, and countless biological discoveries. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In the 1950s, the invention of the first immortal human cell line, HeLa, provided a low-cost way to conduct experiments on living human cells for the first time. One of the most significant advantages was that this new approach helped mitigate the need for direct human experimentation in early-stage research, greatly reducing the widespread ethical concerns around this practice. The cells provided a ground-breaking and accessible model, and the scientists who had obtained the cells were celebrated as pioneers. But what about the real person whose cells enabled this breakthrough in preclinical research? Who was she, and why was she so important? </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Her name was Henrietta Lacks, and her story has finally been told in the book “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” - a powerful read that raises questions about the ethics of this scientific discovery.</span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_02c00d398ac04055884e49ad845ad351~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_200,h_288,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Henrietta Lacks"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The author, Rebecca Skloot, first learned about Henrietta Lacks when Lacks was mentioned, fleetingly, in a school biology lesson and briefly acknowledged as the origin of the HeLa name: “He” from Henrietta, and “La” from Lacks. But that is all she was – a name. People knew the story of the cells, but what was </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">her </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">story? From that moment on, Rebecca felt compelled to discover more about Henrietta. She found that, contrary to assumption, Henrietta Lacks did not voluntarily donate her cells to science. Unearthing a huge ethical debate, this book follows Skloot on her journey to ascertain how Henrietta’s cells came to be in the hands of scientists, and whether her living family even knew the extent of her contribution to modern science. Over 10 years, the author built a relationship with Henrietta’s family, particularly with her daughter, Deborah, who was also in pursuit of information about her mother. Together, they spoke to the extended Lacks family, as well as friends, doctors and scientists to build a picture of Henrietta’s life. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman, born in 1920 to a family of tobacco farmers in Roanoke, Virginia. She married, had children, and then moved with her husband to Maryland in 1941. Shortly after the birth of her fifth child, she was hospitalised at Johns Hopkins – the only facility in the area that offered care for black patients – for an extremely aggressive form of cervical cancer. Despite several treatment attempts, the cancer was stubborn and Henrietta passed away in August of 1951, aged just 31. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As her family grieved, they were unaware that scientists had taken some of Henrietta’s malignant cells without permission. They began to culture these cells in the lab and attempted to establish a cell line for experimental use. Without Henrietta’s knowledge or consent, several biopsies had been taken from her cervical tissue, both in life during treatments, and in death during autopsy. Her tissue was passed on to a cancer researcher, and her rapidly dividing cancer cells enabled him to create the, now world-renowned, HeLa cell line. Horrifyingly, her family did not discover this until decades later. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>

Taken by Ellie Pipe for Bristol 24/7"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What had started as an inquisition for Skloot became a 10-year-long search, first for answers and then for justice, as she learned about the range of ethical concerns relating to Henrietta’s cells. Not only had the cells been taken without consent, but they had subsequently been commercialised – bought and sold across the world, while the Lacks family struggled to afford healthcare. In addition, Skloot found that the family’s medical records had been published without their knowledge, as metadata, to help scientists understand more about the HeLa line and its origin. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Within the book, Skloot also discusses the absence of communication with the Lacks family, and finally gives them the tools to understand the science behind </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">why </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Henrietta’s cells are so important and how, and why, they are still alive today. In addition to the discussions surrounding concerns directly relating to Henrietta’s case, the book highlights wider issues experienced by other members of the Lacks family, such as racism and abuse within the healthcare system. At times the accounts are difficult to hear, but are extremely important even today, years later, to understand the hardship experienced by Henrietta and her family over the years and contextualise the cell line’s continued use.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_55f67e1abaf744bbae9d63747f61b128~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_193,h_293,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Overall, the book tells the truly compelling story of Henrietta Lacks, humanising her from a mere name in a science textbook to a real person, with a family looking for justice. Packed with information, it completely rewrote my understanding of how cell culture began. Like many people, I had previously assumed that most cell lines were derived from tissue donations, by voluntary donors after giving informed consent, and that their anonymity and privacy would be ensured. This book questioned these idealistic thoughts and raised topics I had never considered, such as the past and present ethical and legal guidelines surrounding patient tissue donation. Aside from the scientific explanations, it tactfully and empathetically told the story from the Lacks family’s viewpoint, allowing me to understand and appreciate what the family went through and how they are still impacted, to this day, by reverberations from the creation of the HeLa cell line. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Thanks, in part, to this book, people are finally beginning to acknowledge and recognise the role of Henrietta in the development of cell culture. I would highly recommend reading, or listening, to this book, and I urge anybody that works with cell lines to take the time to hear Henrietta’s story, about the contribution she unknowingly made to the biological technique we use every day.</span></span></p>

<p>Numbers are everywhere in retraction land lately: A record <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8">10,000-plus retractions in 2023</a>. 19 journals <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/academic-studies-research-paper-mills-journals-publishing-f5a3d4bc">shut down at Wiley</a>. Now here’s another.</p>



<p>Readers who have checked the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">Retraction Watch leaderboard</a> lately may have picked up on something notable: One researcher, Joachim Boldt, has now been credited with 210 retractions – making him the first author (to our knowledge) with more than 200 retractions to his name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boldt’s new tally – representing about half of his roughly <a href="https://typeset.io/authors/joachim-boldt-4jt8xm9emj">400 publications</a> – admittedly is an accounting change rather than new problems being identified. Some journals have only now come around to acting on the corrupt articles. In that sense, it reflects both progress and a frustrating lack of concern-slash-urgency on the part of the journals that have taken more than a decade to resolve the case.</p>



<span id="more-129263"></span>



<p>As we and others <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/10/28/top-german-anesthesiologists-cardiac-surgery-paper-retracted-over-very-serious-misrepresentations/">have reported</a>, the Boldt saga began about 14 years ago with emails to Steve Shafer, then the editor-in-chief of <em>Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia</em>, pointing out suspicious data in a study the German anesthesiologist had published in the journal in late 2009. (<em>The BMJ</em> has a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/187846?path=/bmj/346/7900/Feature.full.pdf">helpful timeline</a> about the case, including a bright line linking Boldt’s fraudulent research to potential harm to patients.)</p>



<p>Shafer, who is now a member of the board of directors of the Center For Scientific Integrity, our parent non-profit organizaztion, eventually became dissatisfied with Boldt’s responses, and then lack of responses, to his questions about the data, and helped trigger an initial institutional investigation into the researcher’s work. Anesthesiology’s recognition that there were problems in the literature – which came earlier for the field than for the vast majority of others – is likely responsible for the fact that so many anesthesiology researchers are among the authors with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">the most retractions in the world</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/05/driving-open-science-adoption-with-a-global-framewo/">Driving Open Science adoption with a global framework: the Open Science Monitoring Initiative</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Veronique Kiermer and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz </em><br><br>Earlier this month the Open Science Monitoring Initiative <a href="https://open-science-monitoring.org/official-release-of-the-open-science-monitoring-initiative-website-and-starting-point-of-a-worldwide-consultation/">shared a draft of Open Science monitoring principles</a>, launching a worldwide consultation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re proud to have collaborated on the draft, drawing from our experience developing Open Science Indicators and building upon our participation alongside other nonprofit Open Science advocates, research organizations and policy-makers in a workshop hosted by UNESCO <a href="https://open-science-monitoring.org/news-n1/">last December</a> that initiated this effort. We are excited to see this important effort move forward in a forum that invites the participation of the broadest range of stakeholders from the scholarly community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any organization that promotes Open Science, like PLOS, needs to be able to monitor the adoption of Open Science practices. Context is important. Research is a global enterprise supported by a vast network of academic institutions, service and infrastructure providers, funders, and policy-making groups. The solutions we build have to be able to address the priorities and answer the questions each of those groups are asking. So far, this has led to the emergence of a variety of monitoring solutions that are not comparable. This limits the utility of data collected in different contexts and importantly it risks creating misalignments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our efforts to drive Open Science forward, we have <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">first-hand experience</a> of the barriers researchers face when the bodies that govern research culture and practice lack alignment. This is why the work of this group is so important: it will take a multi-stakeholder collaboration to drive context-specific but comparable monitoring solutions to support pathways to Open Science adoption for diverse communities.</p>



<p><strong><br></strong><strong>A shared foundation accelerates progress for all</strong></p>



<p>UNESCO&rsquo;s comprehensive <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about">recommendation on Open Science</a> is an important milestone towards a shared understanding and vision for Open Science that enables each of us to work in our own ways towards the same goal. How we implement this recommendation will also require the ability to monitor its adoption in ways that honor its principles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the Open Science monitoring initiative is focusing on collaboration and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. Despite the disparate needs or motivations an institution in Kenya, a funder in the UK, and a policy-making body in France may have for monitoring Open Science, adopting common principles will help provide a global understanding of progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more that we are able to share and learn from each other and study new aspects of the prevalence and effects of Open Science, the better-equipped we will be to see patterns which point to significant barriers for researchers, systemic challenges, structural inequities and potential biases. With a common set of principles for monitoring, we are one step closer to establishing equitable paths to Open Science.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Open Science monitoring for better Open Science practice</strong></p>



<p>When we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">envisioned Open Science Indicators</a> in 2022, it was with the recognition that we could not achieve our goal of advancing Open Science adoption without knowing where we were starting from, and how effectively our experimental solutions were driving us forward.</p>



<p>It felt important at the time to establish our own <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21640889.v1">underlying principles</a> to guide our future development, communicate what we were trying to do as transparently as possible and to help others understand and use our tools and data responsibly. The same reasoning that animated us then informed our input into the Open Science Monitoring initiative.<br></p>



<p>The data we are gathering through OSIs gives us a better understanding of the landscape of Open Science practices today, and that helps us see where interventions and solutions could be effective&ndash;or not so effective. Since implementing OSIs, we&rsquo;ve been able to look more closely at the regional differences in Open Science behaviors, as well as differences by discipline, and we&rsquo;re developing a better understanding of the effect of policies and solutions on influencing these behaviors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example we were able to see code-sharing rates at <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/code-policy-interview/">rose from 53% to 87%</a> in the first year after implementing our mandatory code-sharing policy, signaling that authors in this community were willing to make a bolder move towards this Open Science practice. We are also tracking the impact of making it easier for authors to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/open-science-by-discipline/">share preprints</a>, and incentives that could promote better <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">data-sharing practice and usage</a>.</p>



<p>But journal policy is far from the only mechanism to change research-sharing norms. By the time a researcher is ready to share their work, many of their choices have already been made. They are influenced by their own context and circumstances: Does their national research body support sharing more components of the research? Will their institution recognize efforts to be more transparent? Is there funding and infrastructure to make it easy for them to do so? Do the solutions available fit the aims of the research itself?</p>



<p>We share our dataset and our findings publicly, hoping they may be helpful to others, and are always open to <a href="mailto:community@plos.org">feedback </a>and additional context-specific interpretations.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Working together to build a path forward</strong></p>



<p>There are numerous routes researchers can take to make their work more open. Part of what we want to achieve at PLOS is to support multiple pathways to Open Science by understanding what the academic landscape looks like and the motivations for researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know from our <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/z4py9">own research</a> that Open Science monitoring is a need we share with many organizations, and we have <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/03/collaboratively-seeking-better-solutions-for-monitoring-open-science/">been collaborating</a> to understand how monitoring needs align and differ between funders, institutions, and publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This collaborative work with funders and institutions, and in particular <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/2023/12/15/reflections-on-ukrn-open-research-indicators-work-so-far/">our work with the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) </a>to develop open research indicator pilots for institutions, illustrates that measuring the <em>prevalence </em>of Open Science practices is not enough. We also need to be measuring the <em>effects or qualities </em>of those practices to achieve the aims of greater transparency, integrity, and inclusion which are at the core of Open Science. We believe that Open Science is better science, and effective monitoring &ndash; and rigorous meta-research &ndash; can provide more evidence for this.</p>



<p>A systemic challenge requires a systemic solution. Figuring out how we do that must be a multistakeholder endeavor. It has to create a feedback loop between funders, policy-makers, institutions, infrastructure providers, researchers and publishers. Importantly, the diversity of perspectives is critical not only across sectors but also across disciplines, regional and economic contexts.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>The Open Science monitoring principles are for everyone, and we need your perspective</strong></p>



<p>We encourage all organizations that support Open Science, everywhere, to engage with the Open Science Monitoring Initiative&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eepqGt62NTdgy22jGp-nEsVC8zIvFZvexyIAVj3RdNA/edit#heading=h.yzcbfhb49wsk">draft principles</a>. A robust set of principles, informed by the broadest possible range of stakeholders, will be an essential asset for responsibly measuring the successes (and, where necessary, failures and unintended consequences) of all of our efforts.</p>

<p>An interdisciplinary journal says it will take “corrective actions” on a paper following a thorough investigation on a paper for which one author used ChatGPT to update the references.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Krithika Srinivasan, an editor of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/ENE"><em>Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space</em></a> and a geographer at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland, confirmed to <em>Retraction Watch</em> her journal is finalizing what actions need to be taken. After the probe concluded, Srinivasan says she submitted her recommendations to Sage, the journal’s publisher, who will take actions in line with their policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s clear from the probe, she says, is that “none of the incorrect references in this paper were ‘fabricated’ in the sense of being made up or false.” She notes that the original manuscript was submitted to the journal with the correct references but “the errors were generated when one of the other authors (without the knowledge of the submitting author) used chatGPT (instead of regular referencing software) to insert the citations and reference list.”</p>



<span id="more-129251"></span>



<p>On April 1, <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/rnr/people/profiles/collier.php">Bret Collier</a>, a wildlife ecologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, wrote to Srinivasan and others, informing them the March 2024 study, titled “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25148486241235821">Breeding distrust: The biopolitics of chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer</a>,” contained several non-existent citations, one to a paper referred to as being published in 2026.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This manuscript was brought to my attention as there are a variety of citations to Wildlife Society journals listed in the literature cited that are incorrectly cited, abjectly false, or obviously manufactured for use in this manuscript,” Collier wrote to the journal and the study authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I cannot speak to the accuracy of other citations nor to the quality of the content presented in the paper, but my brief evaluation indicated that several areas that I checked citations on are also either incorrect or blatantly false,” he added.</p>



<p>The study’s corresponding author, <a href="https://envst.utah.edu/news/faculty_highlight_matt_fry.php">Matthew Fry</a>, a geographer at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, replied to Collier’s email on the same day, noting that he already reported the issue to the journal on March 25 and provided them with the correct references.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Last week we learned that prior to submitting the manuscript to EPE nearly one year ago, the lead author used chatGPT to update the references,” Fry wrote in the email. “I and the other co-author were not aware of this at the time and, unfortunately, never checked those references.”</p>



<p>Fry noted the manuscript drew on the thesis of the lead author, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/-zachtabor-/">Zach Tabor</a>, a former master’s student at the University of North Texas in Denton. “[T]he references in his thesis are correct and accurate,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Fry and Tabor for comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collier wrote in his email: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The use of incorrect or manufactured citations has duplicative impacts on science, in that it restricts our ability to provide the foundational logic to our works, which can lead to the questioning of integrity of scientists across the world.&nbsp; Additionally, manufactured citations impact journal rating metrics and our ability to ensure that readers are getting quality scientific content.</p>

These essential pollinators directly and indirectly support several of the United Nation&#8217;s <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>, from &#8220;<a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/sdg-programme/sdg2">SDG 2: Zero Hunger</a>&#8221; to &#8220;<a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/sdg-programme/sdg15">SDG 15: Life on Land</a>&#8220;. However, largely due to human activities, bee populations are declining worldwide. Almost 35% of invertebrate pollinators, including many bee species are facing extinction. Recognising their importance, the United Nations has designated May the 20th as <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/bee-day">World Bee Day</a>, urging everyone to help protect bees. In response to the call to raise awareness, we highlight research from across the BMC Series.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The insecticide Calypso SC480, which contains the active substance thiacloprid, is used on crops to control insect pests. However, it can be lethal to bees at high concentrations. The European Union (EU) has conducted risk assessments to evaluate the toxicity of insecticides, focusing on the exposure level at which half of the tested bees die. This has led to the development of EU guidelines for pesticide use. However, there has been a lack of research on the sub-lethal effects of lower exposure levels on bees. Lotta Kaila, a doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, conducted a study published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> to investigate the impact of thiacloprid concentrations used in Finnish agriculture on the learning and memory abilities of bumblebees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Learning performance and memory were tested in a ten-colour test in which a bumblebee had to learn to identify the five colours that rewarded it with sugar water. Oral exposure to thiacloprid residues equivalent to concentrations found in honeybee collected pollen and nectar from Finnish fields where thiacloprid was used according to commercial pesticide instructions impaired the bees&#8217; learning performance compared to untreated controls.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The study shows that even small doses of pesticides, which are considered less harmful, can still impact the learning ability of bumblebees and potentially weaken their populations over time. Therefore, it&#8217;s not enough to only look at lethal doses when studying the effects of pesticides on pollinating insects. Sub-lethal doses can also affect the ability of pollinators to find food, which may weaken populations long term. These findings emphasize the need for a better understanding of pesticide residues in the environment and their impact on pollinators. This information can help the scientific community and policymakers improve the sustainable use of pesticides.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Plant Biology </em></strong><em>&#8211; </em><a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-023-04564-6">Global warming impairs the olfactory floral signaling in strawberry</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changes in the scent of flowers, such as those induced by global warming, can impact how appealing plants are to pollinators. Bees rely on their antennae&#8217;s odour sensors to decipher volatile signals released by flowers, helping them locate flowers and assess the quality of their pollen and nectar. A study conducted by Guaraci Duran Cordeiro and Stefan Dötterl from the University of Salzburg, published in </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BMC Plant Biology</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, explores whether changes in the floral scent of strawberry plants due to temperature shifts impacts their attractiveness to bee pollinators.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The researchers used gas chromatography to analyse volatile organic compounds in scent samples and electroantennography to measure the detection of volatiles perceived by the antennal olfactory apparatus of bees to test whether temperature-induced shifts in the floral scent of strawberries affect their attractiveness to bees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>, <em>Bombus terrestris</em>, <em>Osmia </em></span><em>bicornis</em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">). They found that strawberry flowers grown under optimum temperatures (mean 20 °C) released 10.4 ng/flower/hour of scent compounds. However, the flowers did not emit any detectable scent in warmer conditions (mean 25 °C). In behavioural experiments, the bees </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">were attracted</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by the scents emitted under the optimum temperature scenario.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The findings suggest that changes in floral scent emissions due to global warming could potentially impact pollination, adversely affecting ecosystem functioning and crop productivity. The study highlights the need for further research into the influence of temperature-induced changes in floral scent on plant-pollinator chemical communication.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Genomics</em> &#8211; </strong><a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-023-09143-5#Sec1">Differential bumble bee gene expression associated with pathogen infection and pollen diet</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The gut parasite, <em>Crithidia bombi</em>, is commonly found in the bumblebee species <em>Bombus impatiens</em>. This protozoan pathogen is spread among colonies through flowers and is prevalent in Europe, Australasia, and the Americas. While benign in favourable conditions, <em>Crithidia bombi</em> can significantly affect bumblebee health, including reduced colony reproduction and fitness, impaired cognitive abilities, and altered foraging behaviour when combined with other stressors. Recent studies have shown that consuming sunflower pollen (<em>Helianthus annuus</em>) can lessen the severity of the pathogen in <em>Bombus impatiens</em>. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this therapeutic effect are not fully understood.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To help elucidate the medicinal effect, the authors of a study in <em>BMC Genomics</em> analysed the transcriptomes of bumble bee workers to understand the physiological response to sunflower pollen consumption and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">C. bombi </span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">infection. Workers were exposed to parasite cells or control and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">were fed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> either</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> sunflower or wildflower pollen. The gene expression profiles from their entire abdomens were then sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 technology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sequencing data analysis found that sunflower pollen boosts the expression of genes expressed by immune cells, such as serine proteases and Toll receptors, as well as the transcript encoding the anti-microbial peptide hymenopteran in <em>Crithidia bombi </em>infected bees. Additionally, sunflower pollen upregulates genes associated with detoxification and the maintenance of gut health in both infected and uninfected bees. Further research into understanding host responses that drive the medicinal effect of sunflower pollen in bumble bees may open new avenues for managing bee pathogens.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>BMC Research Notes</strong></em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-023-06495-9">The first ITS2 sequence data set of eDNA from honey of Malaysian giant honeybees (<em>Apis dorsata</em>) and stingless bees (<em>Heterotrigona itama</em>) reveals plant species diversity</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bees gather genetic traces of many organisms belonging to the same community while visiting flowers to collect honey. The authors of a study in <em>BMC Research Notes</em> have generated sequencing datasets to analyze the environmental DNA (eDNA) found in honey collected by two native Malaysian bee species, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apis dorsata</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Heterotrigona itama</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The datasets provide valuable insights into the plant species visited by these bees, shedding light on </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">important</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> plant-pollinator interactions within Malaysian forests. Additionally, investigators can use the datasets to determine the geographical and botanical origins of the honey.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fueled by recent technological advances, researchers are beginning to unlock genetic information in honey for various uses. Using honey as a source of eDNA can help evaluate community composition and answer many questions regarding biotic interactions within ecosystems. For example, eDNA datasets from honey or pollen found on the body of pollinators can help determine plant-pollinator interactions, monitor bee and plant health and detect pathogens and parasites. Such data is also helpful in ascertaining the geographical origin of honey to combat food fraud.</span></p>

We are pleased to present an excerpt about the Macchiarini case from&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Thinking+about+Science%3A+Good+Science%2C+Bad+Science%2C+and+How+to+Make+It+Better-p-9781683674344"></a><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324065500">The Occasional Human Sacrifice: Medical Experimentation and the Price of Saying No</a><em>&nbsp;by Carl Elliott published by W. W. Norton, May 2024.</em></p>



<p>One incident illustrates just how determined the leaders of the Karolinska Institute were to protect Paolo Macchiarini. In November of 2014, a leaked copy of the whistleblowers’ report came into the hands of the New York Times, which published an article titled “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/world/leading-surgeon-is-accused-of-misconduct-in-experimental-transplant-operations.html">Leading Surgeon Is Accused of Misconduct in Experimental Transplant Operations</a>.” The article detailed several of the most serious allegations against Macchiarini: that he had never obtained ethical permission to conduct his experiments, that his <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61715-7/fulltext">2011 study in The Lancet</a> had misrepresented the outcome of Beyene’s implant, and that of the three patients at the Karolinska Institute that Macchiarini had given synthetic implants, only Beyene had signed a consent form— and the form was dated two weeks after his surgery. The publicity generated by the article all but forced the Karolinska Institute to act. Anders Hamsten, the vice-chancellor, said he would ask for an external inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retaliation against the whistleblowers came quickly. According to Simonson, the whistleblowers were told that they had violated patient privacy and would be fired immediately. That didn’t happen, but in December the Karolinska Institute informed the whistleblowers that the head of the cardiothoracic clinic would deliver a formal warning, the last step before an employee is terminated.</p>



<p>The Karolinska Institute also reported the whistleblowers to the police. “I was called down to the police and put in a room with no windows, with a tape recorder and a lawyer and a policeman in front of me, and interrogated. That was pretty scary,” Matthias Corbascio, a cardiothoracic surgeons says. “It was exactly what it’s like on television. And you know, it’s hard to be a tough guy in that room.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129207"></span>



<p>The accusations were baseless; the whistleblowers had anonymized all the identities in their report, and Corbascio had applied in advance for ethical permission to access patient records. “I wrote that ethics application because I knew that they were going to try to fire us,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the spring of 2015, the external inquiry Hamsten had promised was completed. Dr. Bengt Gerdin, an emeritus professor at Uppsala University Hospital, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/28/misconduct-found-in-7-papers-by-macchiarini-says-english-write-up-of-investigation/">concluded</a> that Macchiarini was guilty of scientific misconduct. The inquiry didn’t address any potential abuses of human subjects, but the result of the inquiry was clear. Macchiarini had falsified his research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even an external corroboration of misconduct didn’t deter the Karolinska Institute leaders. It took months for them to respond, and when they finally came to a conclusion, they called a press conference. “We asked if we could attend the press conference, and they said no,” Simonson says. “They then called our boss at the time and said that they were hiring guards to stop us from attending.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accompanied by members of the Nobel Committee, Hamsten disavowed Gerdin’s external inquiry and proclaimed his confidence in Macchiarini. The whistleblowers were stunned. Macchiarini responded with gratitude. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/science/paolo-macchiarini-researcher-cleared-of-scientific-misconduct-charges.html">To have been falsely accused of such serious misconduct is every researcher’s nightmare</a>,” he said. The Lancet applauded the decision with an editorial titled “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00118-X/fulltext">Paolo Macchiarini Is Not Guilty of Scientific Misconduct</a>.”</p>



<p>Grinnemo remembers this entire period as a very dark time. The stress was overwhelming. “I mean, I couldn’t sleep. I was always thinking of this next strategic move,” he says. People he considered friends stopped returning his calls and emails. He could not concentrate on his research. He found it hard to give his children the attention they needed. “It was also hard doing surgery, to be standing there focusing on the operation,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thought that he might have sacrificed his career for a futile cause sent him into a panic. Corbascio felt the same way. The hostility at work was palpable. He says, “I think that Kalle and I were like the two most hated people at Karolinska, and I’ve no doubt about that.”</p>

<p>In the late afternoon at a conference in Cartagena last year, a team of Swedish researchers <a href="https://www5.shocklogic.com/client_data/ccsa/uploads/2023%20ISPRM/001_Programa%20ISPRM%202023%20Sin%20Time%20Table_compressed.pdf">presented their work</a> on a technique that uses machine learning to translate the body&#8217;s own electric signals used to move a limb. They had tested it on a minor recovering from a stroke.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/C-2024-0495-EOK-rapport.pdf">Documents from an internal investigation</a> shared by Chalmers University have now revealed, however, that this case study was part of a series of regulatory lapses and suspicious research practices at the Centre for Bionics and Pain Research (CBPR) where the clinical research was conducted. The researchers seem to have conducted the study before Max Ortiz-Catalán, the center’s founder and former manager, had secured regulatory approval from the relevant Swedish agency. </p>



<p>Chalmers, the Centre’s home, has now <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/research-at-the-centre-for-bionics-and-pain-research-is-suspended-and-deficiencies-are-reported-to-regulatory-authorities/">suspended it</a> after also suspecting that its data and research participants seemed “systematically selected” so that treatments appeared effective, and excluded data when treatments caused health problems. The investigation also uncovered the center had no person responsible for compliance, which is a <a href="https://www.lakemedelsverket.se/sv/medicinteknik/tillverka/person-med-ansvar-for-att-regelverket-efterlevs#hmainbody1">requirement under Swedish law</a>, and that personal data had been handled poorly. </p>



<span id="more-129236"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This isn’t the first time CBPR has come under scrutiny for questionable research practices. Two years ago, a divided committee absolved several of its researchers from charges of misconduct after a local newspaper pointed out serious omissions in a published paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2022, <em>Forskning &amp; Framsteg</em> <a href="https://fof.se/artikel/har-ar-armen-forskarna-ville-glomma/#klarna:486a61ba-fd4c-5fac-91c5-65c3478bda93">reported that researchers</a> affiliated with CBPR, again including Ortiz-Catalán, had excluded the life-threatening complications — such as sepsis and infection — experienced by a patient who had received a prosthetic arm. The paper, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1917537?query=featured_home">‘Self-Contained Neuromusculoskeletal Arm Prostheses’</a> published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, had <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/30/mind-controlled-prosthetic-arm-patients-feel-objects/">generated buzz</a> for its advances in ‘mind-controlled’ prosthetic limbs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CBPR had conducted the research in collaboration with Swedish prosthetics company, Integrum. When the deficiencies in the paper were first reported, Integrum CEO Rickard Brånemark said the omissions were “regrettable” and that the authors’ intention was not to hide information, since the complications had been reported at conferences. A month later, in October 2022, the authors published a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMx220013">lengthy correction</a> explaining the patient’s adverse events.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But when the correction was published, an investigation into alleged falsification was still underway. Chalmers University had submitted a case to Sweden’s national board for research misconduct one day after the newspaper’s report, followed by the University of Gothenburg submitting the same suspicions to the board a month later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors argued that the patient who experienced the life-threatening complications had received a different kind of prosthetic arm, and that they had intended to publish the medical complications in a subsequent paper, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Decision-in-case-3.1-22-0118_0137_web.pdf">according to the board&#8217;s decision</a> published in June 2023. The authors also claim the Journal’s editor wanted the patient to be included, despite the team’s initial plan to exclude them from the paper because of issues with follow-up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The board found the authors not guilty of research misconduct, though three members dissented, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When the article was ready for publication, the authors knew about the complications that affected Patient 4. However, the reasons why Patient 4, who is mentioned in several places in the article, was excluded are not made clear and the context in which complications arose is not knowable either…</p>



<p>We consider it was gross negligence not to report the complications that arose in one of the few research participants included in the study described in the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ortiz-Catalán left CBPR while an internal investigation was being carried out due to “issues in his leadership,” media relations manager Henrik Dahlberg wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. “I won’t go into any detail here,” he added. Ortiz-Catalán has since moved to Australia, where he works at the Bionics Institute in Melbourne.&nbsp; He has not responded to several requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">New information about operational issues at CBPR came from a staff tip-off in March 2024, prompting the latest internal investigation at Chalmers that has resulted in the center’s suspension. “The ethics committee decided that they needed to investigate, since what had been revealed indicated irregularities in the research that had been carried out at CBPR,” Dahlberg wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigators examined 50 publications that were published between 2020 and 2024 which include Ortiz-Catalán as an author. They found a large number of ethical permits, but only one regulatory permit since the CBPR was formed — dated several weeks after researchers had presented their clinical case study at the conference in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also noted a lack of legal agreement between Integrum, the company that collaborated in the 2020 study, and Chalmers University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is our assessment that the activities at CBPR violate the law regarding regulatory permits.” the investigators wrote, noting that this carries a maximum imprisonment of two years according to Swedish law. “In addition, there is a suspicion that they do not comply with the European regulations for medical devices and do not live up to the Declaration of Helsinki,” the report continues. The investigators also found issues with security in the management of personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While the investigation focused on whether permits were in place for the work, the report suggests that data was selected to appear favorable to the treatments. Chalmers and the other collaborating institutions — the University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital — agreed to suspend CBPR’s operations and have asked Swedish research authorities to review work from the group dating back to 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to questions about whether this affects research produced collaboratively between Integrum and CBPR, Integrum CEO Rickard Brånemark wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The NEJM article you refer to has already been thoroughly re-examined, after which a correction was published on November 1, 2022. Moreover, an academic research evaluation confirmed that no misconduct had been committed. I feel confident that everything in that paper is correct and balanced. To my current knowledge, there are no reasons to correct or retract any of the other articles I have co-authored with researchers at CBPR. Should the evaluation following the closure of CBPR find any inconsistencies in any publication, we will of course make sure to correct these.</p>
