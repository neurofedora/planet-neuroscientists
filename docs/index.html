                <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="785" height="485" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132899" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi.jpg 785w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi-300x185.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oday-Al-Owaedi-768x474.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Oday A. Al-Owaedi</figcaption></figure>



<p>A professor of physics in Iraq was permanently dismissed last week after a government investigation found he orchestrated a massive fraudulent publishing scheme involving hundreds of thousands of dollars paid into his bank account by unwitting researchers, documents obtained by Retraction Watch show.</p>



<p>The scam included a deal between a prominent association of Iraqi academics and a predatory publisher, as well as the creation of a fake journal website and bogus acceptance letters purporting to be from reputed journals.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ministerial-order-with-translation_Redacted.pdf">ministerial order</a> dated September 9 and obtained by Retraction Watch, the physicist,<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0721-0409"> Oday A. Al-Owaedi</a>, who also goes by several other names, defrauded “researchers by collecting money from them under the pretext of publishing their papers in reputable international journals as promised, while in fact falsifying and forging publication in fake websites.”</p>



<span id="more-132898"></span>



<p>The document also stated Al-Owaedi falsified “the scientific content of research papers, knowingly, by inserting his name and his scientific works as references in these allegedly published papers.”</p>



<p>An Iraqi scholar close to the matter told us “hundreds” of budding researchers had been caught in the scam. That has put their careers at risk, because master’s and Ph.D. students in Iraq <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf">are required to publish papers</a> in indexed journals before they can obtain their degrees, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.</p>



<p>“Many graduate students and researchers relied on these conference acceptances for thesis defenses, academic promotion, publication requirements, or graduation,” the source added. “Now, they face academic uncertainty or setbacks due to decisions beyond their control.”</p>



<p>We contacted Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research to confirm Al-Owaedi’s termination, which has not been officially announced, and ask if the ministry will take steps to help the victims. We have not heard back. The order permanently removes Al-Owaedi from his position at the University of Babylon in Hilla, a public institution, adding that he committed “acts that render his continuation in state service harmful to the public interest.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Al-Owaedi nor his former employer responded to requests for comment. But on September 17, the day after we emailed him about the evidence we had obtained, Al-Owaedi<a href="https://www.facebook.com/oday.aljubory/posts/pfbid0MBvpX82ffYUHbwnwxYttvuYNnu3GaVjGA1Hh6zGUFFuH5uc1sHrRFHr1uGMsbH1Ml"> announced his dismissal</a> on Facebook (in Arabic) and said he was “innocent of the charges” against him. Al-Owaedi is<a href="https://www.facebook.com/prof.odai.jubori?rdid=btNiLLLlxjY0lFLo&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F17JQR2KLQE%2F"> also a politician</a> and is running in Iraq’s parliamentary election in November.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Al-Owaedi’s publishing scheme centered on<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250917134132/https:/iraqiacademics.iq/events/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A/"> a conference that was organized by a prominent association</a> of Iraqi academics and was slated to take place in Baghdad this month. According to its website, the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250912213012/https:/iraqiacademics.iq/events/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A/"> 7th International Conference of the Iraqi Academics Syndicate for Sciences</a> (ICIASS-2025) offered participants a chance to publish their research in<a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp"> AIP Conference Proceedings</a> or one of several “highly respected and peer-reviewed journals from renowned Dutch publishing house Elsevier.” (In correspondence we obtained, AIP Publishing denied having “an agreement in place to publish the proceedings of this conference.”)</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="758" height="926" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132884" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg 758w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier-246x300.jpg 246w" sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A message from Telegram shows El-Owaedi claimed he made a deal with Elsevier to publish hundreds of papers.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In messages posted to the conference’s now-deleted Telegram group, Al-Owaedi, who chaired the organizing committee for the event, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Owaedi-claims-deal-with-Elsevier.jpg">claimed he had made a deal with Elsevier</a> to publish hundreds of papers at discounted prices.</p>



<p>Authors were required to pay “publication fees” after receiving a preliminary acceptance notice from the conference, but before publication, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Telegram_Al-Owaedi.jpg">Al-Owaedi explained</a>. These fees varied by journal, but typically amounted to US$650 – or some $100 more than<a href="https://shafaq.com/en/Economy/Iraq-s-average-salary-ranks-modest-globally-eighth-in-Arab-world"> Iraq’s average monthly salary</a> – according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supporting-journals.pdf">a list the conference supplied</a> of more than two dozen journals from Elsevier, AIP and another publisher.</p>



<p>After payment, the works would be sent to “the publishing house,” which would edit it and submit it to one of the journals on the list, Al-Owaedi wrote.</p>



<p>In reality, the ”publishing house” referred to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250909065240/https:/acadiapulse.org/"> Acadia Pulse</a>, which in May <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Contract-Acadia-Pulse.pdf">signed an agreement</a> with Al-Owaedi to assist his organization in publishing a “total of 400 academic papers in peer-reviewed Scopus Q2 indexed journals.”</p>



<p>Acadia Pulse<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250916111616/https:/acadiapulse.org/resources/"> describes itself</a> as a New York-based “international consultancy offering students, researchers, and corporations the opportunity to publish in PubMed and Scopus indexed journals.” But no records of a business called Acadia Pulse exist in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s<a href="https://www.edgarcompany.sec.gov/servlet/CompanyDBSearch?page=main"> EDGAR company database</a>. Meanwhile, the operation’s website has<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/"> several hallmarks of a full-fledged paper mill</a>, such as<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250909065240/https:/acadiapulse.org/"> promising</a> ”guaranteed publications in our flagship journals.”</p>



<p>One of these “flagship” publications is the <em>International Journal of Scientific Studies and Qualitative Research</em>, which<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250916112638/https:/www.ijssqr.org/about-us"> lists as its editor-in-chief</a> Gunnar Möller.<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/466/m%C3%B6ller-gunnar"> A physicist at the University of Kent</a> in the UK, Möller told us he had never heard of the journal.</p>



<p>The company did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acceptance-emails-from-IAS_Redacted.pdf">emails</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A-proof-of-payment_Redacted.pdf">bank receipts</a> we obtained, authors at the conference were required to pay the publication fees directly into Al-Owaedi’s personal bank account. In at least one case, the required payment – 950,000 Iraqi dinars, or about US$725 – exceeded the “publishing cost” provided in the journal list by more than US$50.</p>



<p>On July 8, Al-Owaedi<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1613437808723201/permalink/24006494742324188/?rdid=i01arQxgVcbZ95Ls"> announced on Facebook</a> that the first research from the conference had been published in Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Vocational Behavior</em>. He included what he described as a link to the paper:<a href="https://link-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR4RLJMmnFLy3SymurdrUkj4bvluMMPbdQmDDH2kVjuNYhcH_Y9lvStV1RhJ4A_aem_KO7ezPppFRm5d1G4dabv8g"> https://link-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213</a>. When the link was still functional (we archived it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250908083304/https:/links-doi.org/11.1230/j.jvb.2025.178213">here</a>), it sent readers to a near-perfect sham version of the journal’s website. The site displayed a complete article, titled “Holland&#8217;s Characteristics of personality Traits and Their Influence in Impression Management” and written by two real Iraqi scholars.</p>



<p>But the Digital Object Identifier link was forged – real DOI prefixes<a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/doi-basics"> always start with “10,”</a> not “11” – and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Al-Sultani-Al-Saidi-fake-publication.pdf">the paper</a> had never been published. We reached out to the two authors, but one told us he was sick and the other never replied.</p>

<p>Similarly, some authors began receiving purported <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fake-acceptance-letter_Applied-Mathematics.jpeg">acceptance letters</a> from the journals, as well as what appeared to be login information allowing them to access Elsevier’s Editorial Manager system to track their submissions, according to videos we have seen.</p>



<p>But Elsevier told us the letters had not been issued by their publications, adding, “The matter is still under investigation, but so far, we have no evidence that Editorial Manager was compromised.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The ministerial order dismissing Al-Owaedi states he handed over the money received from the researchers to his wife, “without authorization from the [Iraqi Academics Syndicate] and without disclosure thereof.”</p>



<p>The Iraqi Academics Syndicate has not responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>In his September 17 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A32yxmqPa/">Facebook</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1C93mL4p8U/">posts</a>, Al-Owaedi stated the money he received had “been transferred by the conference to the publishing company.” As proof, he attached pictures of two purported bank transaction slips listing amounts of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oday-receipt-money-1.jpg">$54,000</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oday-receipt-money-2.jpg">$150,000</a>, respectively.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Letters-from-Acadia-Pulse.pdf">Correspondence</a> from Acadia Pulse addressed to “Iraqi Universities” suggests the forgery did not go unnoticed, and the company attempted damage control through obfuscation.</p>



<p>In a section titled “Reasons Why Journals Declare Acceptance Letters Fake and Papers Non-Existent,” a letter signed by a “Henry Davis” stated, “Journals have strict terms and conditions that authors must follow. One of these is that authors must not contact the journal directly before publication. If an author violates this condition, the journal may deny any connection to the manuscript because such contact undermines the confidentiality of the editorial process and affects their business model.”</p>



<p>Another message addressed questions about the strange DOI prefix of the forged conference publication. “We would like to clarify that the assignment of DOI prefixes is entirely determined by the respective journal or publisher,” the letter stated. ”Each publisher is registered with CrossRef (or another DOI registration agency) and may receive a different prefix based on their allocation.”</p>



<p>The Iraqi scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity said some students had not been awarded their degrees because they presented the fake journal acceptance letters at their thesis defense.</p>



<p>“There have been attempts to blame students and researchers for making payments or not recognizing the fraud,” the source told us. “This is unfair. The participants received what appeared to be formal, official conference acceptance letters. They were acting in good faith, based on institutional trust, and should not be penalized for the failure of oversight bodies.”</p>



<p>The source also criticized the government for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICSAI-2025-Al-Owaedi-chair-of-preparatory-committee_arabic.jpg">making Al-Owaedi chair</a> of yet <a href="https://www.icsai-2025.alzahu.edu.iq/#">another conference</a> organizing committee two weeks after the investigation against him began, and for keeping the probe under wraps while conference participants continued submitting papers and paying publication fees to the physicist.</p>



<p>“This delay directly enabled the harm done to researchers and students,” the source said.</p>

<p>The publisher Taylor &amp; Francis is investigating concerns raised on PubPeer about a paper claiming to find DNA contamination in COVID-19 vaccines beyond regulators’ recommended amounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move comes as the U.S. body tasked with making recommendations for vaccine use is scheduled to consider the safety of COVID-19 shots, and two of the study’s authors say their findings will be discussed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08916934.2025.2551517">paper</a> at issue was published September 6 in the journal <em>Autoimmunity</em>, a Taylor &amp; Francis title. Scientific sleuth Kevin Patrick soon posted concerns on PubPeer, which he forwarded to the ethics department of the publisher. </p>



<span id="more-132874"></span>



<p>On September 8, Laura Wilson, Taylor &amp; Francis’ Head of Research Integrity &amp; Ethics, thanked Patrick for raising the concerns and said the company would “investigate in accordance with the COPE guidelines and our Editorial policies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher added a pop-up notification to the article to alert readers to the ongoing investigation after we asked if they would do so. Taylor &amp; Francis <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/25/publisher-adds-temporary-online-notifications-to-articles-under-investigation/">began using such notices</a> last year.</p>



<p>Jennifer McMillan, a spokesperson for Taylor &amp; Francis, confirmed the publisher’s Ethics and Integrity team “are aware of the comments made on PubPeer and are investigating the article in question.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the investigation is in its very early stages we cannot make any further comment,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paolo Casali, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/iaut20/about-this-journal#editorial-board">editor-in-chief</a> of <em>Autoimmunity</em>, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 19, a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf">meeting</a> of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will include presentations on “COVID-19 vaccine safety.”<br><br><a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/retsef-levi">Retsef Levi</a>, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge and chair of the ACIP <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/our-work/index.html#heading-uuf6nwjsay">work group</a> on COVID-19 vaccines, will introduce the session. The work group’s activities include reviewing and summarizing “gaps in the existing knowledge regarding potential impurities (e.g., DNA contamination and endotoxins) in existing immunization products and their health impacts to inform immunization recommendations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Study coauthor Kevin McKernan of the Beverly, Mass.-based company Medicinal Genomics said in <a href="https://anandamide.substack.com/p/dna-contamination-entered-into-the">a Sept. 14 post</a> on Substack he had been “contacted by the ACIP committee to go over our paper.” A <a href="https://x.com/JesslovesMJK/status/1965925999968919815">post on X</a> by another coauthor, independent researcher Jessica Rose, stated the committee will be considering their paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her own Substack <a href="https://jessicar.substack.com/p/new-published-study-shows-theres">post</a>, Rose wrote Senator Ron Johnson (R &#8211; Wisconsin) had submitted the study as evidence in a hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations September 9.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also included a prediction: “they will try to retract our work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The authors of the paper — Rose, McKernan, and David J. Speicher of the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada — describe using two different methods to measure the amount of DNA remaining in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna due to their <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/COVID-19-mRNA-Vaccine-Production">manufacturing processes</a>. Speicher, the corresponding author, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McKernan was also an author on a July <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202507.2155/v1">preprint</a> about “Synthetic mRNA Vaccines and Transcriptomic Dysregulation” that was withdrawn on Sept. 11 after sleuths <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2025/07/25/preprint-claiming-that-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cause-transcriptomic-dysregulation-is-deeply-flawed/">Elisabeth Bik</a> and <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/2025/07/28/no-mrna-vaccines-do-not-cause-transcriptomic-chaos/">Reese Richardson</a> documented problems with the manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using one method, fluorometry, the authors of the <em>Autoimmunity </em>paper said they found amounts of DNA in all their samples of various vaccine lots that were higher than guidelines from the U.S. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/characterization-and-qualification-cell-substrates-and-other-biological-materials-used-production">Food and Drug Administration</a> and <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/biologicals/documents/trs_978_annex_3.pdf">World Health Organization</a> recommend. Using the other method, qPCR, they said three samples were over the limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On PubPeer, Patrick, who uses the pseudonym “Actinopolyspora biskrensis,” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C23A5E23F520A727E80FCBD4015A05#1">pointed out</a> that the regulators’ recommendations were set for qPCR tests, not fluorometry. “Applying that regulatory threshold to fluorometry values is misleading, since regulators do not recognize fluorometry as the standard,” he wrote. Fluorometry also picks up mRNA, <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/addressing-misinformation-about-excessive-dna-mrna-vaccines">according to Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration</a>, so it does not correctly measure DNA amounts in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In subsequent comments, Patrick also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C23A5E23F520A727E80FCBD4015A05#2">questioned</a> the authors’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/16/exclusive-journal-bans-drug-safety-database-papers-as-they-flood-the-literature/">use of data</a> from the FDA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, and the appropriateness of several of the documents the authors cited. One <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08916934.2025.2551517#references-Section1">reference</a> consisted of <a href="https://www.porthedland.wa.gov.au/council-meetings/special-council-meetings/special-council-meeting-11-october-2024/247/documents/attachments_scm_11102024.pdf">the attachments</a> to a meeting agenda for the town council of Port Hedland, Australia, which included a report referencing a 2023 preprint from the paper’s coauthors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the questionable references Patrick identified, Retraction Watch found the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/chemistry-manufacturing-and-control-cmc-information-human-gene-therapy-investigational-new-drug">FDA guidance</a> the researchers cited was issued for gene therapies, and explicitly stated it “does not apply to vaccines for infectious disease indications.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other commenters on PubPeer added technical critiques of the paper as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have no idea how this paper could have made it through peer review,” Patrick told us. “Sadly, we almost never find out what happens behind the scenes.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites, and the anatomical connectivity between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviors of brain circuits in health and disease. However, the inherent complexity of these biological processes makes the construction and reuse of biologically detailed models challenging. A wide range of tools have been developed to aid their construction and simulation, but differences in design and internal representation act as technical barriers to those who wish to use data-driven models in their research workflows. NeuroML, a model description language for computational neuroscience, was developed to address this fragmentation in modeling tools. Since its inception, NeuroML has evolved into a mature community standard that encompasses a wide range of model types and approaches in computational neuroscience. It has enabled the development of a large ecosystem of interoperable open-source software tools for the creation, visualization, validation, and simulation of data-driven models. Here, we describe how the NeuroML ecosystem can be incorporated into research workflows to simplify the construction, testing, and analysis of standardized models of neural systems, and supports the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, thus promoting open, transparent and reproducible science.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Proposed Policy Options</h3>



<p>We recognize NIH&rsquo;s aim to maximize the value of taxpayer funds and increase the efficiency of research funding. However, the proposed approach of capping or limiting allowable publication costs will not achieve this goal and risks creating unintended consequences. To advance NIH&rsquo;s mission, enabling open science should be at the core of any policy consideration, particularly increased transparency and access to all research outputs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Article processing charge (APC) caps are not an effective cost control mechanism. A fundamental driver of journal choice is the research assessment system, not author cost sensitivity. The current research assessment and incentive systems rely on numbers: the number of articles published and the Journal Impact Factor (or journal names/&rsquo;prestige&rsquo;), contributing to a hypercompetitive environment that rewards quantity and prestige (or falsely equates it with quality). Data, code, protocols and other important outputs are not shared and valued to the same extent as articles, and researchers who make them accessible are by and large not rewarded. To address the fundamental issue, efforts such as<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27520/rethinking-researcher-assessment-and-incentives-at-us-academic-institutions"> </a><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/rethinking-researcher-assessment-and-incentives-at-u-s-academic-institutions-a-workshop">Rethinking Researcher Assessment and Incentives at U.S. Academic Institutions</a> should be supported.</li>



<li>Per-unit pricing models, such as APCs, entrench inefficiencies. Models that tie value to &ldquo;per article&rdquo; charges restrict flexibility, discourage sharing of diverse outputs (data, code, protocols) and embed the article as the primary research artifact of value. NIH should instead support models that move beyond articles and beyond APCs and reinforce open science.</li>



<li>Imposing caps will likely encourage publishers to set publishing fees at the maximum allowable level, rather than reduce costs. This risks replicating the <a href="https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/31330/1/CBP-8151%20_Redacted.pdf">experience of capped higher education tuition fees in the UK</a>, where nearly all institutions charged the maximum allowable amount. This will further fuel a research &ldquo;volume business&rdquo; as publishers continue to push for article growth, increasing profits and exacerbating the existing pressure on researchers to publish. The article growth economy is unhelpful for science, unhelpful for openness and entrenches the article as the primary valuable research artifact.&nbsp;</li>



<li>A better alternative would be to fund institutions and libraries to secure open access publishing services, enabling system-level efficiency and reducing reliance on APCs and APC-driven models. These funds should be considered in tandem with the considerable institution and library spend already allocated to paywalled publication access via subscriptions.</li>
</ul>



<p>NIH&rsquo;s proposal to limit allowable publishing costs should also be evaluated against the Nelson memo&rsquo;s stated aim to &ldquo;provide free, immediate (without embargo), and equitable access to research that is federally funded.&rdquo; to avoid unintentionally hindering its aims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In sum, rather than capping costs at the article level, NIH should encourage research assessment reform and collective funding to support business models that incentivize openness and quality across all outputs. Such approaches more closely reflect the values of transparency, accessibility, and equity that define open science.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Available Evidence Related to Publication Costs and Proposed Options</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Distribution of research spending. Roughly 80% of scholarly publishing expenditure remains in subscription access; only 20% supports open access fees. Yet that 20% unlocks more than 50% of publications for open availability (<a href="https://www.deltathink.com/news-views-market-sizing-update-2024-has-oa-hit-a-peak">DeltaThink</a>). Focussing only on cost management via APCs and associated caps risks pushing research back behind paywalls, raising total costs for taxpayers. While preprinting is proposed as a solution to this <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/07/theres-more-to-research-than-citations-understanding-knowledge-sharing-practices-with-open-science-indicators/">uptake remains low</a> and they are not routinely reviewed.</li>



<li>Limitations of preprints without review<strong>.</strong> PLOS supports preprints because they have the potential to accelerate the dissemination of new research. However, while valuable, preprints are not a substitute for peer-reviewed outputs. These limitations highlight that, without appropriate funding, preprints remove an important element of research validation. PLOS&rsquo;s <a href="https://plos.org/gates-foundation-partnership/">own experiment </a>shows that preprint review has associated cost and requires funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Evidence on open access value. Studies show open access articles are read, downloaded, and cited more. PLOS analysis of<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/"> French Open Science Monitor data</a> demonstrated an 8.6% citation increase for OA articles, with additional benefits for data, code, and preprint sharing.</li>
</ul>



<p>NIH&rsquo;s reliance on DOAJ averages for setting APC limits raises important questions. It is not clear whether NIH-funded researchers typically publish in the journals analyzed, whether they meet NIH quality and licensing criteria, or whether they publish at sufficient scale. The approach appears to work backwards from what the average journal in DOAJ charges, rather than reflecting the actual costs of the services NIH seeks to support. Not all DOAJ journals, for example, offer the required CC0 license, and standards vary significantly. Using this as the sole basis for policy may risk undervaluing quality and integrity.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Peer Review Compensation</h3>



<p>Peer review is an essential part of the research process, but paying reviewers directly creates unintended consequences and perverse incentives:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Unintended consequences<strong>.</strong> Compensating reviewers could increase publication costs overall (publishers may pass on costs) and risk lowering quality if reviewers accept assignments outside their expertise to earn payments.<br></li>



<li>Better alternatives. Recognition of peer review as a core part of research activity is more effective. Reviews should be published (with consent) and credited to reviewers, making them visible in research assessment exercises.<br></li>



<li>Transparency. Peer review should, where possible, be conducted transparently and shared in line with open science goals. Transparent peer review strengthens accountability and ensures reviewers receive recognition for their contributions. See PLOS&rsquo; commentary on<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/09/what-we-learned-by-publishing-peer-review-history/"> </a><a href="https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/">publishing peer review history</a>.<br></li>



<li>Evidence<strong>.</strong> The<a href="https://publons.com/community/gspr"> Publons Global State of Peer Review (2018)</a> shows that recognition and career incentives have a greater impact on efficiency than direct payments.<br></li>



<li>Training. Investment in peer reviewer training demonstrably improves review quality. NIH support for recognition and training would be a more sustainable policy direction.</li>
</ul>



<p>Promoting recognition of peer review aligns with the principles of open science: transparency, accountability, and equitable credit for contributions beyond the published article. See PLOS&rsquo; commentary on<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/acknowledging-reviewers/">peer review recognition</a>.</p>



<p>NIH&rsquo;s calculation ($1,000 extra per article) underestimates the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/02/plos-price-transparency-update-2024/">cost</a> of multiple review rounds and undervalues the seniority of many peer reviewers. This calculation risks creating unrealistic expectations and confusion in implementation.</p>



<p>And consideration must be given to the overall costs of publishing which extend beyond peer review. Essential services include research integrity checks, assessment of methodological rigor, editorial oversight, production, dissemination, and long-term archiving. Any cost framework that focuses too narrowly risks overlooking these necessary quality assurance and stewardship functions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Publishing Best Practice</h3>



<p>The NIH&rsquo;s proposed policy risks reinforcing a narrow focus on the article as the sole marker of academic and research value. This undermines the benefits of an open science ecosystem, which recognizes the importance of diverse outputs such as data, code, protocols, and preprints as integral to transparency and progress. In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/leap.2006">&ldquo;Rethinking how we publish to support Open Science&rdquo;</a>, we discuss the need to move beyond the article and beyond the APC:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Beyond the article<strong>.</strong> Ascribing both academic and economic value only at the point of article publication entrenches legacy costs and discourages the sharing of other important outputs. Evidence such as the<a href="https://www.digital-science.com/resources/portfolio-reports/state-of-open-data-2024-special-report/"> <em>State of Open Data 2024: Special Report</em></a> shows that lack of credit remains a primary barrier to wider data sharing.<br></li>



<li>Alignment with open science<strong>.</strong> Business models should incentivize sharing the form of output most appropriate to the research, not just the article&rsquo;s Version of Record. PLOS has been moving away from APC-based <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/agreements/community-action-publishing/">business</a> <a href="https://plos.org/libraries/agreements/global-equity/">models </a>since 2021, including through our project to <a href="https://plos.org/redefining-publishing/">redefine publishing</a> &ldquo;Beyond the Article and Beyond the APC.&rdquo; PLOS supports the position that for open science practices to be adopted widely, research outputs must be linked, discoverable, and credited in their own right, not just the article Version of Record.<br></li>



<li>Benefits of openness. A knowledge-sharing ecosystem based on open science principles increases visibility, collaboration, and efficiency. Studies including an<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04021-w"> assessment of Springer hybrid journals</a> and<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/"> data from the French Open Science Monitor</a> demonstrate citation and usage advantages for open access and for practices such as sharing data, code, and preprints.</li>
</ul>



<p>Incorporating best practices ensures that taxpayer investment supports high-quality, trustworthy, and openly available science across all research outputs, not simply the cheapest or most traditional option. PLOS regularly shares updates on publishing innovations on our<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/"> blog</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Other Comments</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Implementation timeline. NIH&rsquo;s proposed effective date of January 1, 2026 leaves only three months after the consultation for preparation. By contrast, UKRI had a multi-year consultation and implementation timeline for their new OA policy. NIH should extend the timeline to allow institutions and researchers to adapt.<br></li>



<li>Extended consultation<strong>.</strong> Given the potential scale of impact, NIH should allow more time to gather feedback, engage stakeholders, and avoid confusion among researchers.<br></li>



<li>Systemic reform. The fundamental challenge is not APC pricing but the academic credit system. Reforming research assessment, such as <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/rethinking-researcher-assessment-and-incentives-at-u-s-academic-institutions-a-workshop">through initiatives by the National Academies</a>, would be more effective at controlling costs and incentivizing openness.<br></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> NIH&rsquo;s goal to maximize taxpayer value will not be met by APC caps. A more effective approach is to support systemic reform in research assessment, enable collective funding mechanisms, and promote publishing practices aligned with open science, research integrity and transparency. PLOS urges NIH to adopt policies that advance the mission of <strong>open science for all</strong>, ensuring taxpayer-funded research is widely accessible, equitable, and maximally beneficial to society.

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/09/the-promise-and-perils-of-ai-use-in-peer-review/">The promise and perils of AI use in peer review</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Author: </strong>Renee Hoch, Head of Publication Ethics, PLOS</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is having an outsized influence on many industries, including scholarly publishing. The theme for this year&rsquo;s <a href="https://peerreviewweek.net/">Peer Review Week</a> explores how we can rethink Peer Review in the AI Era. Publishers like PLOS are carefully considering how AI can enhance peer review without undermining research integrity.</p>



<p>The current standard in the scholarly publishing community is that authors may use generative AI (genAI) in preparing submissions, (with some caveats; see this <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/cope-position/authorship-and-ai-tools">COPE position statement</a> and the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-artificial-intelligence-tools-and-technologies">PLOS policy</a>). However, there are tight reins on AI use in peer review. Many journal policies specify that editors and reviewers must not upload submission content to genAI tools, and some either forbid genAI use in peer review altogether (e.g. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/page/peer-review-science-publications">Science</a>), or allow select AI use cases, such as to translate or edit one&rsquo;s own review comments (e.g. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-AI-in-peer-review">PLOS</a>, <a href="https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/tools-and-resources/review-confidentiality-policy.html">Wiley</a>).</p>



<p>Why this different standard? Policies restricting or prohibiting AI in peer review mitigate risks that genAI use by editors or reviewers could introduce, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Breach of confidentiality for unpublished content and sensitive data</li>



<li>Loss of rigor and specificity in the assessment process</li>



<li>Fraudulent misrepresentation of genAI outputs and peer review contributors</li>



<li>Enablement &amp; acceleration of peer review manipulation (e.g. by paper mills)</li>
</ul>



<p>It may then seem paradoxical or even hypocritical that journals and publishers are exploring options for in-house AI usage in peer review. A key difference between in-house use (by journal staff) and external use (by academic editors and reviewers) is that a journal can deploy in-house tools in a controlled technology environment that protects data security, so that confidential content is not ingested into training sets which affect other users&rsquo; outputs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When data security measures are in place, AI can help improve the consistency with which journals enforce their standards and policies. For example, AI can detect and produce review reports querying issues such as incomplete, unverifiable, or retracted references, problematic statistical analyses, and non-adherence to data availability and pre-registration requirements. Human reviewers are inconsistent in the degree to which they address these types of issues which can directly impact integrity and reproducibility.</p>



<p>Although there are several good use cases for AI in <em>supporting</em> peer review, humans remain indispensable for providing rigorous content assessment. Whereas genAI detects and averages preexisting content, humans innovate and evaluate. We introduce new ideas and perspectives, bring creativity, curiosity, and intellect, and are able to synthesize, contextualize, interpret, and critique based on knowledge that spans multiple domains. In short, machines are a long way from being able to replicate human cognition, and so humans can engage in peer review and scientific discourse in a way that machines cannot. In practical terms, this means that people can identify issues that would not be evident to a machine reader or algorithm, and which can be crucial to scientific validity and integrity.</p>



<p>With that said, moving toward a hybrid human+AI peer review model could mitigate known pain points in peer review, including the heavy burden peer review places on academics and longer-than-ideal peer review timings. If AI covers technical aspects of the assessment, then perhaps we can use fewer reviewers to cover aspects of peer review that require uniquely human executive functioning capabilities. As a proof-of-concept for this model, a talk at the 2025 Peer Review Congress discussed a &lsquo;Fast Track&rsquo; peer review offering by NEJM AI in which decisions are issued within one week of submission based only on the editors&rsquo; evaluation of the manuscript and two AI-generated reviews.</p>



<p>While one-week turnaround times are enticing, there are several reasons to include at least two human experts in peer review, whether as editors and/or reviewers. Authors and articles benefit from evaluations reflecting different (human) perspectives; it often requires multiple individuals to cover the subject matter and methodological expertise needed for a rigorous assessment. Importantly, having two or more humans involved in peer review also increases the likelihood that any major scientific and integrity issues will be identified, and lends greater credibility overall to publications and journals. It also affords a degree of protection for authors, journals, and the broader community against issues that could compromise peer review, such as personal biases, competing interests, poor quality assessments, and unethical (mis)use of peer review for personal gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI era may be here to stay, and publishers and researchers will continue to explore its uses, but caution and careful consideration must be given in every step of the peer review process. And, at the end of the day, it will never replace a person&rsquo;s expertise and judgement.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Marc Halushka, a pathologist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio,&nbsp; came across a review titled simply “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091674917315932">MicroRNA</a>,” an unusually short title in a big field. Looking deeper into the review, published in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology </em>in 2018, Halushka found it had been cited more than 2,000 times. He thought this number “shockingly high,” given the article’s brevity and content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(04)00045-5">Other</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(09)00008-7?cc=y&amp;mobileUi=0">older</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02871">reviews</a> on <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0804549105">microRNA</a> from leaders in the field have been cited far more often, some even tens of thousands of times. But when searching “microRNA” on Google Scholar, the review with that single term as its title is the first result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Halushka doesn’t think anything in the paper is wrong or out of date. But the citation was among those in a paper he was asked to review that he thought “was clearly a paper mill paper,” he told Retraction Watch. He suspects when people “who know nothing about microRNAs because they are just in the paper mill business” need to cite a review on the topic, they just use the top search result.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132825"></span>



<p>Such a scenario is a strong possibility. An analysis by David Robert Grimes, one of Retraction Watch’s first <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/27/meet-the-first-two-retraction-watch-sleuths-in-residence/">Sleuths in Residence</a>, found that of the 2,046 papers citing the “MicroRNA” review in Elsevier&#8217;s Scopus database, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/microRNA-citingpapers-Retracted-upload.pdf">18 of them</a> have been retracted. Many of the retraction notices describe recycled data and peer review concerns as reasons for the decision, which publishers often use to suggest paper mill activity. Six retractions came from Hindawi, an open-access publisher Wiley bought, then <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/06/wiley-to-stop-using-hindawi-name-amid-18-million-revenue-decline/">shut down</a>, after it became clear <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">paper mills</a> had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">run amok in its journals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/12/authors-admit-they-published-the-paper-without-completely-studying-their-work/">covered the retraction</a> of one of the papers that cited the review. “The authors stated that they published the paper without completely studying their work,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The microRNA literature is a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/21/12058/6880717">hotspot for paper mill activity</a>, and researchers have quantified <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420092122">higher rates of retraction</a> for <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(24)00076-X">papers on microRNA</a> than related topics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marc Rothenberg, director of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio, and the corresponding author of the review, declined to comment for this story.&nbsp;He is an associate editor of the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Grimes also analyzed the journals in which papers citing the “MicroRNA” review appeared. Most citations – 52 – came from articles in the <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em>, an MDPI title. The journal with the next most papers citing the review, 39, was <em>Bioengineered</em>, a Taylor &amp; Francis title which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/08/web-of-science-clarivate-delist-bioengineered-paper-mill-cleanup/">lost its standing</a> in Clarivate’s Web of Science index earlier this year amid <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21655979.2025.2542668">struggles to purge</a> paper mill content from its pages. The journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21655979.2025.2525650">suspended new submissions</a> in July.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining journals in the top five titles citing the “MicroRNA” review are all from the open-access publisher Frontiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Grimes’ analysis of the affiliations of the authors citing the review, he found the 20 most frequent universities were all located in China. Just over 80 percent of the citations came from authors based at Chinese research centers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to the authors of 20 papers citing the review to ask why they had done so. Only one responded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We included it because it is a concise, widely-read overview of microRNA biology in the context of immune and allergic diseases, which we felt would be helpful as a background primer for readers less familiar with the field,” Bailin Niu, of Chongqing University, told us. He and his colleagues had cited it in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661825000210">review</a> of the role of microRNAs in liver damage from sepsis published earlier this year in <em>Pharmacological Research</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jennifer Byrne, director of biobanking for New South Wales Health in Australia and a paper mill researcher, told us entities churning out scientific papers for pay could have incorporated a citation to the review into a reusable template, but “it’s difficult to be sure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a citation to the review has been included in a template, the papers that cite it may have unexpected similarities, or there could be many papers citing the review in which “the citation seems unjustified,” she said.</p>



<p>Because the review is “quite technical,” citations would seem more relevant “when justifying experimental methods or discussing possible limitations of results,” Byrne said, not as a general overview of microRNA research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That said, if authors are simply opportunistically selecting this review as an accessible example of a miRNA review, we might also expect to see tangentially relevant citations, outside of any involvement of paper mills,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In a new study now available as a preprint on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20747">arXiv,</a> we explore the link between open science practices and citations for all publications with French authors over a 3-year period. The results of our analysis offer promising results with national importance: open science practices such as sharing data, code and preprints are linked to increased citations.</p>



<p>The study is co-authored by our own Director of Open Research Solutions, Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Open Research Manager, Lauren Cadwallader and Professor Giovanni Colavizza of the University of Copenhagen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our work to advance open science, we&rsquo;re committed to driving meaningful change by ensuring the solutions we design and promote are useful to the communities we serve. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/07/theres-more-to-research-than-citations-understanding-knowledge-sharing-practices-with-open-science-indicators/">Open Science Indicators</a> are one tool we&rsquo;ve developed to help us to measure trends and progress in open science behaviors, but we also take on <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">deeper investigations</a> to understand the needs, motivations, and <em>impact</em> of open science practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>France has a progressive national policy on open science and has been a leader in aspects of monitoring that policy. This made for a promising cohort to measure the effects of open science practices</p>



<p>The following announcement was published by the <a href="https://frenchopensciencemonitor.esr.gouv.fr/">The French Committee for Open Science</a> highlighting the importance of these findings to stakeholders in the region. Read the original post<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/for-the-first-time-on-a-scale-of-a-country-france-a-study-demonstrates-that-open-science-could-increase-the-chances-for-researchers-to-be-cited/"> here.</a></p>



<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For the first time on a scale of a country, France, a study demonstrates that Open Science could increase the chances for researchers to be cited</strong></h2>



<p><em>The authors chose to study France, a leading country in monitoring Open Science, and to use data from the French Open Science Monitor, that covers the entire country since 2018.</em></p>



<p>Public policies promoting open science aim to develop the circulation of knowledge across all levels of society. They seek to strengthen the international influence of academic research while promoting transparency, cumulative growth and reproducibility in research. By sharing research methods, materials and results, these policies encourage the wider dissemination of knowledge beyond the academic world to society, communities and the economic sector. These policies are implemented at the global (UNESCO), continental (European Union) and national (France) levels.</p>



<p>Measuring the impact of these open science policies is a major challenge in assessing the consequences of public policies and adapting future initiatives. Several studies have already established the impact in terms of citations for open science practices, although these studies often remain domain-specific.</p>



<p>For the first time, an international research team has conducted a comprehensive study covering an entire country and all disciplines. The authors, Giovanni Colavizza (Denmark), Lauren Cadwallader (United States) and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz (United States), chose to study France, a leading country in monitoring Open Science, and to use data from the French Open Science Monitor, that covers the entire country since 2018.</p>



<p>The study covers a considerable corpus of over 500,000 scientific articles. It reveals that each open science practice seems to be associated with an increase of the number of citations of the articles concerned. The results show that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An article published in open access is linked to 8.6% increase in citations compared to an article that is not open access.</li>



<li>An article sharing source code is linked to 13.5% increase in citations.</li>



<li>An article sharing data is linked to 14.3% increase in citations.</li>



<li>An article published as a preprint is linked to 19% increase in citations.</li>
</ul>



<p>These results vary considerably across disciplines and represent the average of diverse specific situations. For example, in medical research, data sharing is associated with a 34.9% increase in citations. In basic biology, publishing a preprint is associated with a 25.3% increase in citations. In the social sciences, sharing code related to a publication is associated with a 38% increase in citations.</p>



<p>This study does not close the book on open science research. The impact of open science needs to be assessed in many other fields, particularly beyond the academic world. However, it is a crucial first step and offers promising results regarding the academic impact of open science practices.</p>

<p>Starting around 2023, a curious trend took hold in papers on drug safety monitoring. The number of articles published on an individual drug and its link to specific adverse events went from a steady increase to a huge spike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data source in most of those articles was largely the same: The FDA Adverse Events Reporting System, or FAERS. In 2021, around 100 studies mining FAERS for drug safety signals were published. In 2024, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28%22case%2Fnon-case%22+OR+%22case-non-case%22+OR+%22case%2Fno-case%22+OR+%22Disproportionality%22+OR+%22Information+Component%22+OR+%22Reporting+Odds+Ratio%22+OR+%22Proportional+Reporting+Ratio%22+OR+%22multi-item+gamma+Poisson+shrinker%22+%29+AND+%28+%22FAERS%22%29&amp;sort=date">that number was 600</a>, with more than that already published this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two journals in particular published the bulk of these papers, <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em> and <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety</em>. In response to the flood, Frontiers started to require independent validation of studies drawing on public datasets. And <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>decided in late July to stop accepting submissions altogether that use the FAERS database for this particular type of study.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132828"></span>



<p>“By presenting mere statistical associations as ‘safety signals’, these publications can generate unjustified alarms with considerable impact on healthcare provider practices and patient behaviors,” Charles Khouri, a pharmacologist at Grenoble Alpes University Hospital in France, and colleagues <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17116885">wrote in a preprint</a> posted Sept. 14 that looks at the spike in pharmacovigilance studies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="496" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x496.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132830" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x496.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-300x145.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-768x372.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1536x744.png 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A bibliometric analysis of pharmacovigilance studies in PubMed, sorted by the adverse event repository used in the study, shows FAERS accounts for a large portion of the recent spike in studies. <br><em>Source: <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17116885">C. Khouri et al. 2025</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The work comes on the heels of sleuths identifying FAERS as one of several publicly available datasets being exploited by paper mills, pumping hundreds of often meaningless and sometimes misleading papers into the scientific literature.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">An open database,  <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers">FAERS</a> contains 31.8 million records voluntarily submitted to the FDA by healthcare professionals, patients and consumers on adverse events and medication errors related to drugs and biologics. While the database is useful flagging adverse events from newly approved drugs, it can be misused as a research tool.</p>



<p>“You can imagine in a large database with maybe millions of different drugs, millions of different adverse events, you can perform an infinite number of statistical analyses,” Khouri told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>FAERS is a voluntary reporting system, so “only an unknown proportion of all adverse events are reported,” Khouri said. And factors like a drug’s novelty or media attention can affect whether people report adverse events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That same selectivity and voluntary reporting structure affects the data in the <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html">Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System</a>, or VAERS, jointly managed by the FDA and CDC. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/15/rfk-jr-remarks-vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system-vaers-changes-indiana-maha/">vowed to overhaul VAERS</a>, even as those campaigning against the use of vaccines publish papers — often <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/19/paper-claiming-extensive-harms-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-be-retracted/">retracted</a> — using it. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-covid-vaccine-child-deaths-data-cdc-meeting-rcna230849">News outlets</a> have reported that Trump administration officials plan to present VAERS data later this week linking COVID-19 vaccines to at least 25 deaths in children who received the shots. As with FAERS data, raw reports in VAERS are unconfirmed, and any associations between an injury and a vaccine may be coincidental.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FAERS papers flooding the journals are a type of study called a disproportionality analysis, which can identify previously unknown side effects to drugs following their approval. “Maybe 60 to 70 percent of modifications in label information after the commercialization of drugs are coming from a pharmacovigilance database like FAERS,” Khouri said.</p>



<p>Khouri pointed to <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/34/6/1369/27208/Assessing-the-Association-of-Pioglitazone-Use-and">a disproportionality analysis</a> of a diabetes drug called pioglitazone that found a possible increased risk of bladder cancer. Further studies corroborated the risk and ultimately led to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-updated-fda-review-concludes-use-type-2-diabetes-medicine-pioglitazone">labeling changes</a> for the drug.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">From 2019 to 2022, <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>published single- to low double-digit numbers of these studies. That began to change in 2023 and exploded in 2024, when the journal published 174 disproportionality studies using FAERS, nearly 60 percent of the total papers it published that year – and as many papers as they had published in total in 2021.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>The number of disproportionality studies submitted to the journal “rose significantly,” a Taylor &amp; Francis spokesperson told us. “Even after we had put additional resource[s] in place to handle the journal’s pre-review assessments, this had become a challenging situation to manage,” the spokesperson said. “While disproportionality studies can make a useful contribution to the scholarly literature, such papers can include methodological problems, which led to the journal having a rejection rate of over 80%.”</p>



<p>In late July, Taylor &amp; Francis and the journal’s editor-in-chief, <a href="https://psychiatry.utoronto.ca/faculty/roger-mcintyre">Roger McIntyre</a>, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, decided “the journal will no longer consider unsolicited disproportionality studies using [FAERS] or similar spontaneous reporting databases,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ieds20/about-this-journal#aims-and-scope"> journal’s website now states</a>, “Such studies will only be considered when specifically invited by the journal&#8217;s editorial team.”</p>



<p>Two requests for interviews sent to McIntyre’s university email address were answered by Taylor &amp; Francis spokespeople. McIntyre, who is also the head of the Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology Unit at Toronto’s University Health Network, is a coauthor on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=AllField&amp;text1=FAERS&amp;field2=Contrib&amp;text2=mcintyre%2C+roger+s&amp;field3=AllField&amp;text3=disproportionality&amp;SeriesKey=ieds20&amp;SeriesKey=ieds20">five articles</a> in <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>that draw on data from FAERS. They include analyses of associations between <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2024.2361300">insomnia</a> drugs, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2024.2368827">ketamine</a> or <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2023.2295397">GLP-1 agonists</a> and suicide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August the journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/14740338.2024.2416243?needAccess=true">retracted a paper</a> based on FAERS for including a coauthor on the paper without his consent. “While no other disproportionality studies are currently under investigation by our Publishing Ethics &amp; Integrity team, we are conducting further checks on several articles in the journal,” the spokesperson said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><em>Frontiers in Pharmacology </em>also contributed to the flood of published studies drawing on FAERS. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28%28%22Frontiers+in+Pharmacology%22%5BJournal%5D%29+AND+%28%28%22case%2Fnon-case%22+OR+%22case-non-case%22+OR+%22case%2Fno-case%22+OR+%22Disproportionality%22+OR+%22Information+Component%22+OR+%22Reporting+Odds+Ratio%22+OR+%22Proportional+Reporting+Ratio%22+OR+%22multi-item+gamma+Poisson+shrinker%22+%29%29%29+AND+%28FAERS%29&amp;sort=date">The journal published</a> about 30 such studies in 2023 — and more than 120 in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2025, Frontiers introduced a policy across all of its journals requiring “independent external validation of all health-dataset studies,” Elena Vicario, head of research integrity at Frontiers, told us. The move followed a July 2024 policy requiring that validation for submissions using Mendelian randomization methods.  “The concern is not the use of FAERS itself but the risk of redundant analyses that add little new scientific understanding,” Vicario said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Frontiers in Pharmacology </em>has since updated its <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/about#about-scope">About page</a> to reinforce this policy, Vicario said. “Since July 2024, 739 FAERS submissions to <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology </em>have been rejected, with 9 published since the updating of the author guidelines in 2025.”</p>



<p>The bolus of newly published FAERS papers have some notable characteristics, Khouri has found, in collaboration with computer scientist and sleuth Cyril Labbé, also at Grenoble Alpes University, Emanuel Raschi from the University of Bologna, Alex Hlavaty from the University of Grenoble, and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, nearly 80 percent of these studies published in <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>between 2019 and 2025 are from authors affiliated with institutions in China. “Chinese authors were totally absent from the field before 2021,” Khouri said.</p>



<p>An analysis of the papers in <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>revealed a few authors on multiple articles. At the top of the list is Bin Wu of Sichuan University in Chengdu, who has published <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28Wu%2C+Bin%5BAuthor%5D%29+AND+%28faers%29&amp;sort=date">27 disproportionality studies</a> based on FAERS, seven of which appear in <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety</em>. Li Chen, also of Sichuan University, has <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chen%2C+Li?startPage=&amp;SeriesKey=ieds20">six papers</a> in the journal, and Wei Liu of Zhengzhou University, is a coauthor on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Liu%2C+Wei?startPage=&amp;SeriesKey=ieds20">at least four</a> studies. Neither Wu, Chen or Liu responded to emailed requests for comment on their field of study, or particular interest in the FAERS database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the recent papers use multiple statistical methods for the disproportionality analysis, whereas researchers typically use only one method, because multiple tests are redundant. Other similar features across recent papers include a flow chart showing how data were selected, and a mirror plot showing “time to onset.” “We never saw that before,” Khouri said. “The information is quite useless to be twice plotted in the same figure.”</p>

Neither typically appears in pharmacovigilance studies.</figcaption></figure>



<p>And another shared feature of the recently published disproportionality analyses: “There is no research question,” Khouri said.</p>



<p>Many of the studies also reflect a lack of understanding of the drugs and conditions being described. As an example, Khouri pointed to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13533">a paper</a> finding a link between sildenafil and pulmonary hypertension as an adverse event — when in fact the drug is prescribed for that very condition.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Open databases like FAERS paired with the rise of generative AI have opened up a new era of automated paper generation by paper mills, posits Matt Spick, a lecturer in data analytics at the University of Surrey in England. In a July 9 preprint posted to <a href="http://medrxiv.org">MedrXiv.org</a>, he and colleagues recently identified five databases with anomalies in publishing rates that might indicate paper mill exploitation. Among them: FAERS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That analysis built on an earlier study Spick did that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/low-quality-papers-are-surging-exploiting-public-data-sets-and-ai">showed a rapid rise</a> in single-association studies published between 2021 and 2024 that drew on another open data source, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. While the analysis cannot attribute the increase to paper mills specifically, it offers a case study of a strategy paper mills may use, the authors wrote in a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003152">paper published</a> in May in<em> PLOS Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Once NHANES went online, as a paper mill, you were no longer being slowed down by your ability to acquire data, or copy images. You could download as much data as you wanted,” Spick told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The flood of papers coming out of these open databases, and FAERS in particular, can waste research dollars if investigators launch studies to validate the signals generated in these studies, Khouri said. And, importantly, these studies can also influence doctors and patients.&nbsp; “We know that when there are safety warnings disseminated in the literature, patients can stop the drugs,” he said. “Prescribers can be influenced by this kind of result, presenting a lot of adverse events for the drugs.”</p>



<p>Aside from the August retraction, only <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/9914931">one other paper</a> based on FAERS data has been <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/9842578">retracted</a>. The disproportionality analysis had appeared in <em>BioMed Research International </em>and was pulled as part of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">Wiley’s cleanup</a> of suspected paper mill activity and manipulated peer review in Hindawi journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That statistic wasn’t surprising to Khouri. “It&#8217;s very difficult to retract these articles for fraud, because there is no fraud,” he said. “The results are nonsense, there is p-hacking and high risk of false results. It&#8217;s useless papers, but they are not fake,” he said, quickly adding: “Probably.”</p>



<p>Khouri’s next steps are to dig further into patterns across these papers to see if they can identify common features. And Spick has been working on picking apart precisely how paper mills might use modern technology, including LLMs, to scrape open databases like FAERS and churn out papers at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It will be hard to force retractions for a lot of these, and then it becomes a whole philosophical thing for meta-scientists,” Spick said: “Should we allow all science to be published, even if it&#8217;s meaningless?”</p>
