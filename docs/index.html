              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/open-science-advocacy-and-capacity-building-for-leadership-in-african-higher-education-institutions/">Open Science Advocacy and Capacity Building for Leadership in African Higher Education Institutions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Association for African Universities (AAU), the Public Library of Science (PLOS), and the Training Centre in Communication (TCC Africa) are pleased to share the results of the first two of <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/expanding-globally-listening-locally-open-science-in-africa/">four regional policy workshops</a> that we are hosting with Presidents, Vice Chancellors, Rectors, Deputy Vice Chancellors, Directors of Research and Libraries in African&nbsp;Higher&nbsp;Education Institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshops aimed to increase education and awareness on the benefits of&nbsp;<strong>Open Science</strong>, to support development and implementation of Open Science policies, and adoption of Open Science&nbsp;and Open Access practices and publishing in African Higher Education Institutions</p>



<p>Workshop programmes included both global and local perspectives on Open Science and its adoption and implementation in institutions, including support and speakers from UNESCO, DORA, University of Leiden, NRF and the African Open Science Platform.</p>



<p>After the workshops, we conducted surveys with attendees to understand progress towards workshop outcomes and potential next steps in the implementation of Open Science policies in universities.</p>



<p><strong>Eastern Africa:</strong></p>



<p>The University of Dar-es-salaam in Tanzania hosted the East African regional workshop, and we had over 150 participants in person and online. After the workshop 97.53% of the workshop respondents had a good understanding of Open Science, and 2.47% had a moderate understanding.</p>



<p>When asked about their plans to support Open Science mandates within their institutes, respondents highlighted they would work with/across institutional leadership in the following ways (percentages area approximate):</p>



<ul><li>19.75% will encourage the integration of OA journals in the university&rsquo;s journal selection strategy</li><li>19.75% will collaborate with library services to promote awareness on Open Science</li><li>18.52% will work on the adoption of professional incentives for academics who employ Open Science-based outputs</li><li>16.05% will work with the Department of Information, Communication, and Technology to assist researcher profiling with Open Software and Hardware</li><li>13.58% will work&nbsp; with the Vice Chancellors&rsquo; Office&nbsp; in supporting the process of&nbsp; the adoption of Open Science in the&nbsp; University with the objective of improving university rankings&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>12.35% will encourage the Directorate of&nbsp; Research to implement the adoption of Open Data and&nbsp; Open Evaluation in the academic&nbsp; writing&nbsp; process</li></ul>



<p><strong>Northern Africa:</strong></p>



<p>The British University in Egypt hosted the North African regional workshop, attracting over 400 participants in person and online. Over 200 took part in the survey and, after the workshop, 85.98% of participants had a better understanding of Open Science and&nbsp; 12.33% had a moderate comprehension.</p>



<p>When asked about their plans to support Open Science mandates within their institutes, respondents highlighted they would work with/across institutional leadership in the following ways (percentages are approximate:</p>



<ul><li>20.49% will collaborate with library services to promote awareness on Open Science</li><li>19.41% will encourage the integration of OA journals in the university&rsquo;s journal selection strategy</li><li>16.80% will work with the Department of Information, Communication, and Technology to assist researcher profiling with Open Software and Hardware</li><li>16.33% will encourage the Directorate of&nbsp; Research to implement the adoption of Open Data and&nbsp; Open Evaluation in the academic&nbsp; writing process</li><li>15.72% will work on the adoption of professional incentives for academics who employ Open Science-based outputs</li><li>11.25% will work&nbsp; with the Vice Chancellors&rsquo; Office&nbsp; in supporting the process of&nbsp; the adoption of Open Science in the&nbsp; University with the objective of improving university rankings&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The workshops were successful in gathering the range of stakeholders necessary to implement change at an institutional level. They show that there is a growing understanding of Open Science among university leaders, with many keen to take proactive steps to support its adoption within their institutes. There is always more to do, and the results highlight the need for continued efforts to build capacity in this area. With more workshops planned across the continent this year, and further activities in development, we are excited to continue our progress towards Open Science adoption in African HE institutions.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">Bird flu can jump to mammals. Should we worry?</a></h4>

              
                <p>An uncomfortable truth is that there is another influenza pandemic in humankind’s future. Whether it will be a relative of the lethal avian flu strain currently wreaking havoc in bird populations around the globe is anyone’s guess.</p>



<p>Because the virus, called H5N1, can be deadly to birds, mammals and people, researchers closely monitor reports of new cases. Worryingly, a new variant of H5N1 that emerged in 2020 has not only spread <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-ebola-monkeypox-mpox-polio-hepatitis-bird-flu-2022">farther than ever before among birds</a>, but has also spilled over into other animals, raising the specter of a human outbreak (<em>SN: 12/12/22</em>).</p>





<p>The variant was linked to <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/recent-increase-seal-deaths-maine-linked-avian-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seal die-off in Maine</a> last summer. In October, there was an <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.3.2300001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H5N1 outbreak on a mink farm in Spain</a>, researchers reported in January in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. (It’s unclear how the mink were exposed, but the animals were fed poultry by-products.) Sea lions off the coast of Peru and wild bears, foxes and skunks, which prey upon or scavenge birds, in the United States and Europe have also tested positive for the virus.</p>



<p>Globally, hundreds of millions of domestic poultry have been culled or died from the new variant. It’s also likely that millions of wild birds have died, though few governmental agencies are counting, says Michelle Wille a viral ecologist at the University of Sydney who studies avian influenza. “This virus is catastrophic for bird populations.”</p>



<p>A handful of human cases have also been reported, though there’s no evidence that the virus is spreading among people. Of seven cases, six people recovered and one person from China died. In February, health officials in China <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/china-reports-new-h5n1-avian-flu-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported an eighth case</a> in a woman whose current condition is unknown.</p>



<p>What’s more, four of the reported human cases — including <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2022-2023/avian-flu-highly-pathogenic.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a U.S. case from Colorado</a> and <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.8.2300107#abstract_content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two workers linked to the Spanish mink farm</a> — were in people who didn’t have any respiratory symptoms. That leaves open the possibility that those people were not truly infected. Instead, tests may have picked up viral contamination, say in the nose, that the people breathed in while handling infected birds. </p>



<p>The impossibility of predicting which avian influenza viruses might make the jump to people and spark an outbreak is in part related to knowledge gaps. These bird pathogens don’t typically easily infect or circulate among mammals including humans. And scientists don’t have a full grasp on how these viruses might need to change for human transmission to occur.</p>



<p>For now, it’s encouraging that so few people have gotten infected amid such a large outbreak among birds and other animals, says Marie Culhane, a food animal veterinarian at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. Still, experts around the globe are diligently watching for any signs the virus may be evolving to spread more easily between people.</p>



<p>The good news is that flu drugs and vaccines that work against the virus already exist, Wille says. Compared with where the world was when the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic came on the scene, “we are already ahead of the game.”</p>





<h4>How the virus would need to change to spread among people is a big unknown</h4>



<p>This new iteration of bird flu is what’s called a highly pathogenic avian influenza, one that is particularly lethal for both domestic and wild birds. Aquatic birds such as ducks naturally carry avian flus with no or minor signs of infection. But when influenza viruses shuffle between poultry and waterfowl, variants with changes that make them lethal to birds can emerge and spread.</p>



<p>Avian viruses can be severe or even deadly for people. Since 2003, there have been 873 human cases of H5N1 infections <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2023-DON445#:~:text=On%2023%20February%202023%2C%20the%20IHR%20NFP%20of%20Cambodia%20notified,treatment%20at%20a%20local%20hospital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported to the World Health Organization</a>. A little less than half of those people died. In February, an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia died after she developed severe pneumonia from an avian flu virus, the country’s first reported infection since 2014. Her father was also infected with the virus — a different variant than the one behind the widespread outbreak in birds —though he has not developed symptoms. It’s unknown how the two people were exposed.</p>



<p>Some of what scientists know about H5N1’s pandemic potential comes from <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/second-two-blocked-flu-papers-released">controversial research on ferrets</a> done more than a decade ago (<em>SN: 6/21/13</em>). Experiments showed that some changes to proteins that help the virus break into cells and make more copies of itself could help the virus travel through the air to infect ferrets, a common laboratory stand-in for humans in influenza research.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>While researchers know these mutations are important in lab settings, it’s still unclear how crucial those changes are in the real world, says Jonathan Runstadler, a disease ecologist and virologist at Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in North Grafton, Mass.</p>

<p>Viruses change constantly, but not all genetic tweaks work together. A change may help one version of the virus transmit better, while also hurting another variant and making it less likely to spread.</p>



<p>“We’re not sure how critical or how big a difference or how much to worry about those mutations when they happen in the wild,” Runstadler says. “Or when they happen five years down the road when there are other changes in the virus’s genetic background that are impacting those [original] mutations.”</p>



<p>That doesn’t stop researchers from trying to pinpoint specific changes. Runstadler and his team look for viruses in nature that have jumped into new animals and work backward to figure out which mutations were crucial. And virologist Louise Moncla says her lab is trying to develop ways to scan entire genetic blueprints of viruses from past outbreaks to look for signatures of a virus that can jump between different animal species.</p>



<p>“There’s a ton that we don’t know about avian influenza viruses and host switching,” says Moncla, of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses of H5N1 circulating on the mink farm in Spain, for instance, revealed a change <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JVI.02642-09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known to help the virus infect mice and mammalian cells</a> grown in the lab. Such a change could make it easier for the virus to spread among mammals, including people. There could have been mink-to-mink transmission on the farm, the researchers concluded, but it remains unclear how much of a role that specific mutation played in the outbreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a numbers game for when influenza viruses with the ability to transmit among mammals might make the jump from birds, Runstadler says. “The more chances you give the virus to spill over and adapt, the higher the risk will be that one of those adaptations will be effective [at helping the virus spread among other animals] or take root and be a real problem.”</p>



<h4>The ongoing outbreak is still a big problem for birds</h4>



<p>Irrespective of our inability to forecast human’s future with H5N1, it’s clear that many species of birds — and some other animals that eat them — are dying now. And more species of birds are dying in this outbreak than previous ones, Culhane and Wille say.</p>



<p>“We have seen huge outbreaks in raptors and seabirds, which were never really affected before,” Wille says. It’s possible that genetic changes have helped the virus to spread more efficiently among birds than previous versions of H5N1, but that’s unknown. “There are a number of studies underway to try and figure it out,” Wille says.</p>

<p>Historically, these deadly avian flus have not been a persistent problem in the Americas, Moncla says. Sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 variants are typically limited to places such as parts of Asia, where the virus has circulated in birds since its emergence in the late 1990s, and northern Africa.</p>



<p>North America’s last big avian flu outbreak was in 2015, when experts <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/2014-2015-hpai-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detected more than 200 cases of a different bird flu virus</a> in commercial and backyard poultry across the United States. The poultry industry culled more than 45 million birds to stop that virus’s spread, Culhane says. “But it didn’t go away from the rest of the world.”</p>



<p>The latest version of H5N1 arrived on North American shores from Europe in late 2021, first popping up in Canada in Newfoundland and Labrador. From there, it spread south into the United States, where so far <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-flu-summary.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tens of millions of domestic poultry</a> have been culled to prevent transmission on farms where the virus has been detected. By December 2022, the virus had made it to South America. In Peru, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bird-flu-kills-sea-lions-thousands-pelicans-perus-protected-areas-2023-02-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tens of thousands of pelicans and more than 700 sea lions</a> have died since mid-January.</p>



<p>It’s important to understand exactly how nonbird animals are getting exposed, Culhane says. Highly pathogenic avian influenzas infect every organ of a bird’s body. So, a fox chowing down on an infected bird is exposing its own mouth, nose and stomach to a lot of virus as it eats its meal. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, experts are keeping an eye on infected animals to raise the alarm early if H5N1 starts transmitting among mammals.</p>



<p>“I do think that the mink outbreak, and then the sea lion outbreak, is a wake-up call,” Moncla says. “We should be doing our very best to implement all the science we can to try and understand what’s happening with these viruses so that if the situation does change, we are better prepared.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/shock-waves-shaking-universe-first">Astronomers spotted shock waves shaking the web of the universe for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have caught a glimpse of shock waves rippling along strands of the cosmic web — the enormous tangle of galaxies, gas and dark matter that fills the observable universe.</p>



<p>Combining hundreds of thousands of radio telescope images <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade7233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the faint glow cast as shock waves send charged particles</a> flying through the magnetic fields that run along the cosmic web. Spotting these shock waves could give astronomers a better look at these large-scale magnetic fields, whose properties and origins are largely mysterious, researchers report in the Feb. 17 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Finally, astronomers “can confirm what so far has only been predicted by simulations&nbsp;— that these shock waves exist,” says astrophysicist Marcus Brüggen of the University of Hamburg in Germany, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>At its grandest scale, our universe looks something like Swiss cheese. Galaxies aren’t distributed evenly through space but rather are clumped together <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/new-image-reveals-structure-cosmic-web">in enormous clusters connected by ropy filaments</a> of dilute gas, galaxies and dark matter and separated by not-quite-empty voids (<em>SN: 10/3/19</em>).</p>



<p>Tugged by gravity, galaxy clusters merge, filaments collide, and gas from the voids falls onto filaments and clusters. In simulations of the cosmic web, all that action consistently sets off enormous shock waves in and along filaments.</p>



<p>Filaments make up most of the cosmic web but <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/filament-cosmic-web-set-aglow">are much harder to spot than galaxies</a> (<em>SN: 1/20/14</em>). While scientists have observed shock waves around galaxy clusters before, shocks in filaments “have never been really seen,” says astronomer Reinout van Weeren of Leiden University in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study. “But they should be basically all around the cosmic web.”</p>



<p>Shock waves around filaments would accelerate charged particles through <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetic-fields-between-galaxy-clusters">the magnetic fields that suffuse the cosmic web</a> (<em>SN: 6/6/19</em>). When that happens, the particles emit light at wavelengths that radio telescopes can detect&nbsp;— though the signals are very weak.</p>

Vazza, D. Wittor and J. West</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A single shock wave in a filament “would look like nothing, it’d look like noise,” says radio astronomer Tessa Vernstrom of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Crawley, Australia.</p>



<p>Instead of looking for individual shock waves, Vernstrom and her colleagues combined radio images of more than 600,000 pairs of galaxy clusters close enough to be connected by filaments to create a single “stacked” image. This amplified weak signals and revealed that, on average, there is a faint radio glow from the filaments between clusters.</p>





<p>“When you can dig below the noise and still actually get a result&nbsp;— to me, that’s personally exciting,” Vernstrom says.</p>



<p>The faint signal is highly polarized, meaning that the radio waves are mostly aligned with one another. Highly polarized light is unusual in the cosmos, but it is expected from radio light cast by shock waves, van Weeren says. “So that’s really, I think, very good evidence for the fact that the shocks are likely indeed present.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this computer simulation, gas falling onto the cosmic web (blue) heats and expands, setting off shockwaves that ripple through the hot, expanded gas (red) and throughout the vast network of galaxy clusters and filaments that fills our universe. These shockwaves interact with magnetic fields (green) in the cosmic web to create radio signals that astronomers can observe.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The discovery goes beyond confirming the predictions of cosmic web simulations. The polarized radio emissions also offer a rare peek at the magnetic fields that permeate the cosmic web, if only indirectly.</p>



<p>“These shocks,” Brüggen says, “are really able to show that there are large-scale magnetic fields that form [something] like a sheath around these filaments.”</p>



<p>He, van Weeren and Vernstrom all note that it’s still an open question how cosmic magnetic fields arose in the first place. The role these fields play in shaping the cosmic web is equally mysterious.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s one of the four fundamental forces of nature, right? Magnetism,” Vernstrom says. “But at least on these large scales, we don&#8217;t really know how important it is.”</p>

<p>Two journals have dismissed allegations of research misconduct leveled against a&nbsp; political scientist at Harvard in an anonymous memo that labeled his work “pseudoscience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Enos-allegations.pdf">2018 memo</a> signed by “Social Scientists for Research Integrity” – which does not have an internet presence that we could find –&nbsp; makes claims of academic misconduct against <a href="https://www.gov.harvard.edu/directory/ryan-d-enos/">Ryan Enos</a>, who denies any wrongdoing. The journals that published two of Enos’ papers singled out in the memo decided to let the articles stand after investigating the charges. A committee at Harvard University, where Enos is a professor of government and director of the Center for American Political Studies, also reviewed the claims and dismissed them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The allegations primarily concerned purported manipulation of data in Enos’ 2015 article, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12156">What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior</a>,” published in the <em>American Journal of Political Science</em> <em>(AJPS)</em>. The paper has been cited 120 times, according to Clarivate’s <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000367842600010">Web of Science</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126643"></span>



<p>The article explores the theory of racial threat in the context of public housing demolitions in Chicago that displaced more than 25,000 African Americans between 2000 and 2004. He found that before the demolitions, white voters in neighboring communities had turned out in higher numbers and voted more conservatively. The observed effect was related to their proximity to the public housing and the size of the African American population that lived in the developments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The anonymous memo alleged the data had been manipulated, and claimed, “due to these distortions, every single analysis reported in the article… was impacted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enos told Retraction Watch the allegations are untrue and were made in bad faith. “I’m perfectly happy to talk to anybody about it,” he said. “That’s my obligation as a researcher is to answer questions that anybody has about my research and to be fully transparent about it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The allegations were brought to Harvard’s chief research compliance officer in August 2018, according to correspondence shared by Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokesperson. The chair of the Committee on Professional Conduct, Peter Marsden, responded in October 2018, dismissing the case because the allegations “do not fall within the purview of the Standing Committee for Professional Conduct” according to Harvard’s research misconduct policy and procedures.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Dane referred to reports of the allegations on several Substacks, adding:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This has been reported in the media, and we do not consider any of this newsworthy. Further, we have nothing more to say and consider the matter closed, as we have, for some time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She declined to share the identity of the author of the memo, citing limitations under The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) – a law that protects the privacy of student education records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Enos, the memo was written by somebody with a personal grievance who is a former student at Harvard.He said the same person brought the allegations before the Harvard Committee on Professional Conduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked&nbsp;Claudine Gay, Dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences who will become the university&#8217;s president on July 1, about what steps had been taken to address the allegations but received no response.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The same memo appears to have resurfaced four years later after being sent to Chris Brunet, who <a href="https://karlstack.substack.com/p/exclusive-leaked-report-shows-harvard?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web">wrote about it on his blog</a> in March 2022, as did <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/how-not-to-cover-a-social-science">Jesse Singal</a> several days later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors at <em>AJPS</em> said they were first made aware of the allegations in March 2022, but received an “actual complaint” from a member of the political science community in June 2022. The complainant alleged Enos’ data was inconsistent with official election results.</p>



<p>The complaint triggered a formal investigation which found “no credible evidence to support the allegation of academic fraud”, co-editors-in-chief Jennifer Lawless and Kathleen Dolan told Retraction Watch in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails between the journal and Enos seen by Retraction Watch, the editors deemed his explanation of the data discrepancy “sufficient to address the complaint.” However, they requested that he draft a memo “addressing the potential implications of the slippage between your data set and the official voter file,” citing “the amount of attention and traction this discrepancy has received.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6549177&amp;version=3.0">four page memo</a> was eventually published on the journal’s dataverse, responding to the criticism that Enos’ replication files include fewer registered voters and a lower voter turnout than the official Chicago records. Enos wrote that the data contains measurement error.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In a call with Retraction Watch, Enos added he has no reason to believe the measurement error would lead to bias in the article’s inferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s absolutely 100% not evidence of fraud and I don’t see how anybody could conclude that,” he said. “Anybody that’s familiar with the data would know there’s going to be discrepancies between voter files and official results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enos later <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/officialresultsmemoenosajps2016.pdf">published another memo</a> on his website responding to the criticism that the number of voter precincts don’t match official records. In short, he explained some of the precincts changed over time, rendering them incomparable in his analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To make that apples to apples comparison, to compare the same place at different points in time, I had to only include the precincts that hadn’t changed,” he said. “A number of precincts are eliminated because of that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other allegations that weren’t explicitly addressed by Enos in his addenda were regarding the purported non-compliance with the <em>AJPS</em> replication policy, the inclusion of people below the age of 17 in the data, and differences with older versions of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The replication files that were made available were ones that matched to the replication policy at the time,” Enos said. The current <em>AJPS</em> Replication and Verification Policy was announced in March 2015, according to the<a href="https://ajps.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ajps-replic-and-verif-policy-2-27-18.pdf"> <em>AJPS</em> website</a> – a month after the journal published Enos’ paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Enos, the inclusion of registered voters below the age of 17 boils down to “a lot of administrative error in these data sets.”</p>



<p>And the differences between the published paper and older iterations of the work were largely because how Enos included people in the dataset changed. He broadened the dataset from&nbsp; January 2000 to October 2000, to include up until the last day that voters could register. “Otherwise I’d be throwing people out of the dataset that could have voted in that election,Enos said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Contrary to what it says in the memo, that didn’t result in any great changes in the paper.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The anonymous memo singled out another one of Enos’ papers, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1317670111">Causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes</a>,” which was published in 2014 by the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em> and has been cited 146 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The paper examined how the views on immigration of mostly suburban whites changed after coming into contact with Spanish speakers on a train.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The anonymous memo republished an online comment that criticized the generalizability of Enos’ results and pointed out inconsistencies in the wording of a survey question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/14/political-scientist-asks-for-correction-gets-flip-flop/">we reported in 2018</a>, Enos attempted to set the record straight with the journal after becoming aware of the “mistakenly recorded” survey question in the paper. It eventually resulted in a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1903207116">correction</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, Chris Brunet <a href="https://karlstack.substack.com/p/exclusive-leaked-report-shows-harvard">has alleged on his blog</a> that the whole paper “stinks” because of irregular IP addresses, the presence of infants in the dataset and the removal of the IP addresses from the replication files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research was conducted near Boston but some of the IP addresses are from outside Massachusetts. Enos pointed to the inaccuracy of IP addresses to explain the inconsistencies, and also addressed why he removed the IP addresses from the dataset in <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/ip_geocodes_pnas.pdf">this memo published on his website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to the point that there appear to be infants in the dataset,&nbsp; Enos said the age categories in Qualtrics are recoded into an ordinal variable, meaning a one in the dataset would represent an 18.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I was committing research fraud, why on earth would I have toddlers in the data?” Enos said. “The idea that anybody would be stupid enough to fake data by putting toddlers in, it is absolutely ridiculous.”</p>



<p>When asked about the allegations, a spokesperson for <em>PNAS</em> wrote in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In March 2022, PNAS was notified of concerns regarding this article. After conducting an internal review, the journal concluded that no further action was required. We consider this matter resolved unless new information relating to the PNAS article is brought to our notice.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-louisiana-shoreline-stability">The Deepwater Horizon oil spill ruined long-term shore stability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the marshy shores of the Gulf of Mexico were still feeling the effects of the disaster. Marsh grass retained plant-smothering oil, and the soil continued to crumble away at a faster rate than before the spill, causing the shoreline to retreat more rapidly than it would otherwise, a new study shows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following an explosion in April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon rig <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-extent-simulation">pumped nearly 800 million liters of oil</a> into the sea (<em>SN: 2/12/20</em>). The disaster killed dozens of humans and untold sea life. And the oil and its by-products were <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/five-years-deepwater-horizon-oil-spills-impact-lingers">catastrophic for the Gulf ecosystem</a>, both underwater and along the shore (<em>SN: 4/3/15</em>).</p>





<p>But the oil also caused <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123001537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural damage to the shoreline by killing the marsh plants</a> crucial to holding soil in place, researchers report January 25 in <em>Environmental Pollution</em>. That’s making the coast more vulnerable to tropical storms that may be increasing in intensity due to climate change.</p>



<p>“If the plants are compromised in any way, shape or form, you’re going to lose a lot of land,” says Giovanna McClenachan, an ecologist at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, La.</p>



<p>McClenachan was working on her Ph.D. at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge when the disaster happened. She and her supervisor, coastal ecologist Eugene Turner quickly set up research plots in the marshy coast of south Louisiana. Three times a year for the next eight years, they conducted tests on the soil strength with a sheer vane, a common tool farmers use to test soil strength, and analyzed the amount of oil it contained.</p>



<p>They also examined satellite images from 1998 to 2021 to analyze what marsh vegetation looked like before, during and after the spill over a much longer 23-year period.</p>



<p>The field test revealed that, immediately after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the oil concentration of some of the most volatile components of oil, called aromatics, in marsh soil jumped from an average of 23.9 nanograms per gram of sediment before the spill to  17,152 nanograms per gram of sediment in 2011. By 2018, average levels had dropped to 247 nanograms per gram of sediment — but were still more than 10 times higher than before the spill.&nbsp;</p>

When oil kills the grass, the roots die (as seen here) and the soil loosens up.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122205">Giovanna McClenachan</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Soil strength also declined by half after the spill. Before the spill, the average strength of the top 30 centimeters of soil was 26.9 kilopascals, which measures pressure in physics. The soil strength dropped down to 11.5 kilopascals at a low point in 2011. While the strength then began to recover at a rate of 5 percent per year, it still wasn’t fully recovered by 2018, the last year of the field study, when it had climbed back to 16.4 kilopascals.</p>



<p>This is partly due to the strong storms that have come through in the years since the spill. McClenachan says the initial oil spill killed a lot of plants on what was then the marsh shore. Once those died, the soil retained by the marsh grass roots was loosened and washed away. But the oil remained in the water and got pushed farther into the marsh, where it killed more plants.</p>





<p>“The soil strength hasn’t recovered because there is still oil in the marsh, and that’s causing these really strong erosion events during storms that weren’t occurring prior to the oil spill,” McClenachan says.</p>



<p>Analysis of the satellite images showed that marsh loss rate doubled after the spill. The shoreline along the study area was already receding at 0.8 meters on average per year before the spill due to a combination of natural shifting of the marsh levels and human-caused factors like sea level rise. But that loss increased to nearly 1.7 meters on average per year afterward, although in the 12 months after Hurricane Isaac struck Louisiana in 2012, the marsh receded roughly 2.5 meters.</p>



<p>Some research has questioned whether it’s the oil spill affecting shoreline erosion rather than storms over the past decade. But Hurricane Katrina, which slammed into the Louisiana coast in 2005, years before the oil spill, did not cause nearly the same level of shore loss as much weaker storms after the oil spill, McClenachan’s satellite analysis shows. That suggests it’s not an either/or question; rather the enduring effects of the oil spill made the shoreline more vulnerable to storm damage.</p>



<p>The new study is unique in that it also shows the spill’s effect on the stability of the soil itself, says Scott Zengel, an environmental scientist with Research Planning Inc., a private research consultancy in Tallahassee, Fla., that often analyzes the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p>



<p>“It substantiates the idea that there really was an erosion effect,” he says, adding that the length of the study complements previous research showing oil has played a role in changes to the marsh.</p>



<p>These changes can be mitigated to some extent. Zengel’s work shows that techniques like replanting marsh grass <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18102-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can help decrease the rate of shoreline erosion</a>. For boosting soil retention, he says, “it really points at the plants as being one of the key factors.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-chernobyl-dogs-revealed">What the first look at the genetics of Chernobyl’s dogs revealed</a></h4>

              
                <p>For generations of dogs, home is the radioactive remains of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.</p>



<p>In the first genetic analysis of these animals, scientists have discovered that dogs living in the power plant industrial area are genetically distinct from dogs living farther away.</p>



<p>Though the team could distinguish between dog populations, the researchers <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not pinpoint radiation</a> as the reason for any genetic differences. But future studies that build on the findings, reported March 3 in <em>Science Advances,</em> may help uncover how radioactive environments leave their mark on animal genomes.</p>





<p>That could have implications for other nuclear disasters and even human space travel, says Timothy Mousseau, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. “We have high hopes that what we learn from these dogs … will be of use for understanding human exposures in the future,” he says.</p>



<p>Since his first trip in 1999, Mousseau has stopped counting how many times he’s been to Chernobyl. “I lost track after we hit about 50 visits.”</p>



<p>He first encountered Chernobyl’s semi-feral dogs in 2017, on a trip with the Clean Futures Fund+, an organization that provides veterinary care to the animals. Not much is known about how local dogs survived after the nuclear accident. In 1986, an explosion at one of the power plant’s reactors kicked off a disaster that lofted vast amounts of radioactive isotopes into the air. Contamination from the plant’s radioactive cloud largely settled nearby, in a region now called the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.</p>



<p>Dogs have lived in the area since the disaster, fed by Chernobyl cleanup workers and tourists. Some 250 strays were living in and around the power plant, among spent fuel-processing facilities and in the shadow of the ruined reactor. Hundreds more roam farther out in the exclusion zone, an area about the size of Yosemite National Park.</p>

<p>During Mousseau’s visits, his team collected blood samples from these dogs for DNA analysis, which let the researchers map out the dogs’ complex family structures. “We know who’s related to who,” says Elaine Ostrander, a geneticist at the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Md. “We know their heritage.”</p>



<p>The canine packs are not just a hodgepodge of wild feral dogs, she says. “There are actually families of dogs breeding, living, existing in the power plant,” she says. “Who would have imagined?”</p>





<p>Dogs within the exclusion zone share ancestry with German shepherds and other shepherd breeds, like many other free-breeding dogs from Eastern Europe, the team reports. And though their work revealed that dogs in the power plant area look genetically different from dogs in Chernobyl City, about 15 kilometers away, the team does not know whether radiation caused these differences or not, Ostrander says. The dogs may be genetically distinct simply because they’re living in a relatively isolated area.</p>



<p>The new finding is not so surprising, says Jim Smith, an environmental scientist at the University of Portsmouth in England. He was not part of the new study but has worked in this field for decades. He’s concerned that people might assume “that the radiation has something to do with it,” he says. But “there’s no evidence of that.”</p>



<p>Scientists have been trying to pin down <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/some-birds-adapt-chernobyls-radiation">how radiation exposure at Chernobyl has affected wildlife</a> for decades (<em>SN: 5/2/14</em>). “We’ve been looking at the consequences for birds and rodents and bacteria and plants,” Mousseau says. His team has found animals with elevated mutation rates, shortened life spans and early-onset cataracts.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to tease out the effects of low-dose radiation among other factors, Smith says. “[These studies] are so hard … there’s lots of other stuff going in the natural environment.” What’s more, animals can reap some benefits when humans leave contaminated zones, he says.</p>



<p>How, or if, radiation damage is piling up in dogs’ genomes is something the team is looking into now, Ostrander says. Knowing the dogs’ genetic backgrounds will make it easier to spot any radiation red flags, says Bridgett vonHoldt, an evolutionary geneticist at Princeton University, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“I feel like it’s a cliffhanger,” she says. “I want to know more.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-worlds-earliest-horseback-riders">The Yamnaya may have been the world’s earliest known horseback riders</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — The tale of the first horseback riders may be written on the bones of the ancient Yamnaya people.</p>



<p>Five excavated skeletons dated to about 3000 to 2500 B.C. show clear signs of physical stress that hint <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these Yamnaya individuals may have frequently ridden horses</a>, researchers reported March 3 at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting and in <em>Science Advances</em>. That makes the Yamnaya the earliest humans identified as likely horseback riders so far.</p>





<p>Five thousand years ago, the <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">Yamnaya migrated widely</a>, spreading <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-how-migrations-shaped-south-asian-language-farming">Indo-European languages</a> and altering the human gene pool across Europe and Asia (<em>SN: 11/15/17; SN: 9/5/19</em>). Their travels eventually stretched from modern-day Hungary to Mongolia, roughly 4,500 kilometers, and are thought to have taken place over only a couple of centuries.</p>



<p>“In many ways, [the Yamnaya] changed the history of Eurasia,” says archaeologist Volker Heyd of the University of Helsinki.</p>



<p>Horse <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-evidence-rewriting-domestication-origin-stories">domestication</a> became widely established around 3500 B.C., probably for milk and meat (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>). Some researchers have suggested the <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/horse-domestication-traced-ancient-central-asian-culture">Botai people in modern-day Kazakhstan</a> started riding horses during that time, but that&#8217;s debated (<em>SN: 3/5/09</em>). The Yamnaya had horses as well, and archaeologists have speculated that the people probably rode them, but evidence was lacking.</p>



<p>But the oldest known depictions of horseback riding are from about 2000 B.C. Complicating efforts to determine when the behavior emerged, possible riding gear would have been made of long-decayed natural materials, and scientists rarely, if ever, find complete horse skeletons from that time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_mp_horseback-rider_inline2.jpg" alt="A photo of a limestone relief showing someone bareback riding on a horse while others complete a variety of tasks." class="wp-image-3122451" srcset="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_mp_horseback-rider_inline2.jpg 680w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_mp_horseback-rider_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122451">The earliest depictions of horseback riding date to about 4,000 years ago, although a new study suggests some Yamnaya people were riding horses around 1,000 years earlier. This limestone relief, from the Horemheb tomb in Egypt constructed around 1300 B.C., depicts a bareback style of riding the Yamnaya may have used.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122451">Museo Civico Archeologico di Bologna</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Heyd and colleagues weren’t seeking evidence of horsemanship. They were working on a massive project called the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/the-yamnaya-impact-on-prehistoric-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yamnaya Impact on Prehistoric Europe</a> to understand every aspect of the people’s lives.</p>



<p>While assessing over 200 human skeletons excavated from countries including Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, bioanthropologist Martin Trautmann noticed that one individual’s bones carried distinct traits on the femur and elsewhere that he’d seen before. He immediately suspected horseback riding.</p>





<p>“It was just kind of a surprise,” says Trautmann, also of the University of Helsinki.</p>



<p>If it were a one-off case, he says he would have dismissed it. But as he continued analyzing skeletons, he noticed that several had the same traits.</p>



<p>Trautmann, Heyd and colleagues assessed all the skeletons for the presence of six physical signs of horseback riding that have been documented in previous research, a constellation of traits dubbed horsemanship syndrome. These signs included pelvis and femur marks that could have come from the biomechanical stress of sitting with spread legs while holding onto a horse, as well as healed vertebrae damage from injuries that could have come from falling off. The team also created a scoring system to account for the skeletal traits’ severity, preservation and relative importance.</p>



<p>“Bones are living tissue,” Trautmann says. “So they react to any type of environmental stimulus.”</p>



<p>The team deemed five Yamnaya male individuals as frequent horseback riders because they had four or more signs of horsemanship. Nine other Yamnaya males probably rode horses, but the researchers were less confident because the skeletons each displayed only three markers.</p>

<p>“Hypothetically speaking, it’s very logical,” says bioarchaeologist Maria Mednikova of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, who was not involved in the new study. The Yamnaya were very close to horses, she says, so at some point, they probably experimented with riding.</p>



<p>She now plans to check for the horse-riding traits in the Yamnaya skeletons she has access to. “The human skeletal system is like a book — if you have some knowledge, you can read it,” Mednikova says.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Ursula Brosseder, who also was not involved in the work, warns not to interpret this finding as equestrianism reaching its full bloom within the Yamnaya culture. Brosseder, formerly of the University of Bonn in Germany, sees the paper’s discovery as humans still figuring out what they could do with horses as part of early domestication.</p>



<p>As for Heyd, he says he has long suspected that the Yamnaya rode horses, considering that they had the animals and expanded so rapidly across such a large area. “Now, we have proof.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-spacex-problem-space-pollution">Half of all active satellites are now from SpaceX. Here’s why that may be a problem</a></h4>

              
                <p>SpaceX’s rapidly growing fleet of Starlink internet satellites now make up half of all active satellites in Earth orbit.</p>



<p>On February 27, the aerospace company <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=sl6-1-pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched 21 new satellites</a> to join its broadband internet Starlink fleet. That brought the total number of active Starlink satellites to 3,660, or about <a href="https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 percent of the nearly 7,300 active satellites in orbit</a>, according to analysis by astronomer Jonathan McDowell using data from SpaceX and the U.S. Space Force.</p>





<p>“These big low-orbit internet constellations have come from nowhere in 2019, to dominating the space environment in 2023,” says McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. “It really is a massive shift and a massive industrialization of low orbit.”</p>



<p>SpaceX has been launching Starlink satellites since 2019 with the goal of bringing broadband internet to remote parts of the globe. And for just as long, astronomers have been warning that the <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy">bright satellites could mess up their view of the cosmos</a> by leaving streaks on telescope images as they glide past (<em>SN: 3/12/20</em>).</p>



<p>Even the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits more than 500 kilometers above the Earth’s surface, is vulnerable to these satellite streaks, as well as those from other satellite constellations. From 2002 to 2021, the percentage of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01903-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubble images affected by light from low-orbit satellites increased by about 50 percent</a>, astronomer Sandor Kruk of the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, and colleagues report March 2 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The number of images partially blocked by satellites is still small, the team found, rising from nearly 3 percent of images taken between 2002 and 2005 to just over 4 percent between 2018 and 2021 for one of Hubble’s cameras. But there are already thousands more Starlink satellites now than there were in 2021.</p>



<p>“The fraction of [Hubble] images crossed by satellites is currently small with a negligible impact on science,” Kruk and colleagues write. “However, the number of satellites and space debris will only increase in the future.” The team predicts that by the 2030s, the probability of a satellite crossing Hubble’s field of view any time it takes an image will be between 20 and 50 percent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="340" src="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_lg_starlink_inline1.jpg" alt="An photo from the Hubble Space Telescope with stars seen and three white lines on the left hand side of the image." class="wp-image-3122426" srcset="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_lg_starlink_inline1.jpg 680w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_lg_starlink_inline1-330x165.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122426">Satellites sometimes photobomb the Hubble Space Telescope, leaving trails like the ones seen in this image. With the sudden traffic increase from satellite constellations in Hubble’s orbit, those streaks are becoming more common.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122426">European Hubble Science Archive/ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The sudden jump in Starlink satellites also poses a problem for space traffic, says astronomer Samantha Lawler of the University of Regina in Canada. Starlink satellites all orbit at a similar distance from Earth, just above 500 kilometers.</p>



<p>“Starlink is the densest patch of space that has ever existed,” Lawler says. The satellites are constantly navigating out of each other’s way to <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/two-satellites-collide-earth-orbit">avoid collisions</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/09</em>). And it’s a popular orbital altitude — Hubble is there, and so is the International Space Station and the Chinese space station.</p>





<p>“If there is some kind of collision [between Starlinks], some kind of mishap, it could immediately affect human lives,” Lawler says.</p>



<p>SpaceX launches Starlink satellites roughly once per week — it launched 51 more on March 3. And they’re not the only company launching constellations of internet satellites. By the 2030s, there could be 100,000 satellites crowding low Earth orbit.</p>



<p>So far, there are no international regulations to curb the number of satellites a private company can launch or to limit which orbits they can occupy.</p>



<p>“The speed of commercial development is much faster than the speed of regulation change,” McDowell says. “There needs to be an overhaul of space traffic management and space regulation generally to cope with these massive commercial projects.”</p>

<p>In November of 2020, an economics professor wrote to the editor-in-chief of a journal with two requests: remove his name from an online paper on which he was the corresponding author, and retract the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than two years later, neither of those things has happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, the article, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijfe.2173">Outward foreign direct investment and economic growth in Romania: Evidence from non-linear ARDL approach</a>,” which appeared in August&nbsp; 2020 in the <em>International Journal of Finance and Economics</em>, was included in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/10991158/2022/27/1">January 2022 issue of the journal</a>. It has been cited 10 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A scholar who was involved in the work but left off the paper has provided evidence, seen by Retraction Watch, that the published article contains falsified data. Two of the paper’s authors also have had another article they co-authored together retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126630"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The authors of the paper are listed as Azka Amin, an assistant professor of business administration at Iqra University in Pakistan, Sofia Anwar, a professor of economics and management sciences at Government College and University in Pakistan, and Xi-Hua Liu, a professor of economics at Qingdao University in China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Nov. 30, 2020, Liu, the corresponding author on the work, emailed&nbsp; Michael P. Dooley, then the top editor of the journal, requesting retraction. In the email, which we obtained, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am writing this mail in a great hour of difficulty I would like to grab your attention toward a very sensitive issue. First of all, I request you to remove my name from “Outward foreign direct investment and economic growth in Romania: Evidence from non-linear ARDL approach, Int J Fin Econ, (2020),<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002ljfe.2173"> https://doi.org/10.1002ljfe.2173</a>” published recently on dated “6 July, 2020.”</p>



<p>Now I would like to explain the reasons for requesting the withdraw. The reason behind is that its first author Azka Amin and her classmate (a student named Usman Ali student of the Dalian University of Technology) disputed the ownership of this paper. I cannot actually judge their respective contributions to this paper. However, from their emails we should be able to judge that Usman Ali made an important academic contribution. More importantly, I did not even know about the paper that Azka Amin submitted to your journal, and I did not even know about listing me as the corresponding author.</p>



<p>Based on the above facts, I would like to request you to remove my name from the paper. In addition, I hope you will carefully consider Azka Amin’s academic ethics and withdraw this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ali, a postdoctoral fellow at Dalian University of Technology in China, told us that, in addition to not including him as an author, the study included “fabricated data and results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Ali, the research detailed in the paper was a collaboration between him, Amin, and Liu. The paper was originally submitted to the <em>Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting</em>, but the journal rejected it, which Ali said he was unaware of at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali discovered in September 2020 that the paper had been published without his knowledge. His name was left off the author list, and another author, Anwar, who Ali said was not involved in the research, was added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali said he asked Amin to withdraw the paper, but instead, she requested that the journal add an author to the paper, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. Ali said Amin did so without his consent.&nbsp; But Ali said he told her he did not want his name added to the paper because some of its results had been changed from the original and were “bogus.” In any case, Ali said the journal never reached out to him about adding his name to the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali also provided documents that he said show that data from the original, rejected manuscript were changed in the published study. For example, the published paper stated that its data cover the years between 1990 and 2019, but a screen capture of what Ali said was the original dataset seems to show a time period of 1990 to 2017. The original manuscript submitted to the <em>Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting</em>, which Ali also included, indicated the data were from 1990-2017, as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet the results in the published paper “are exactly the same as those in the original manuscript,” Ali wrote, “with some exceptions of the fabricated results.” Specifically, Ali said some standard error values and p values were changed from positive to negative, and he included screen captures as corroboration.</p>



<p>In 2021, a paper on which Liu and Amin were both authors was retracted from the journal <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>, because “an investigation by the Academic Committee of the School of Economics of Qingdao University established significantly overlaps with an unpublished manuscript by different authors,” according to the<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-18040-x"> retraction note</a>.</p>



<p>Amin, Anwar, and Liu did not respond to emails from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We don’t know if the journal ever responded to Liu. His name still appears as corresponding author on the online article, which has not been retracted or marked with any sort of editor’s note.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keith Pilbeam, the current editor-in-chief, told us the matter was still under investigation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This paper was published in the International Journal of Finance and Economics prior to the new editorial board taking over in November 2021. However, it is currently under investigation by Wiley Integrity in Publishing Group and as far as I know is currently being actively investigated so that a decision can be made on what to do in regards to this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, the journal’s publisher, responded to a follow-up email, saying:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have been actively investigating this article in accordance with COPE guidelines. The concerns shared here were not previously known to Wiley and will now be addressed as part of the ongoing investigation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Wiley nor Pilbeam answered questions from Retraction Watch about the reason for the years-long delay in retracting the study or why the journal has not added an indication of its investigation, such as an expression of concern, to the study.</p>



<p>Ali told us that trying to get the study retracted has been “a difficult and stressful experience”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is particularly concerning and disappointing when the journal chooses to publish a paper in a regular Issue despite having been informed of the serious ethical problems beforehand. I think it is a disregard for ethical considerations and a failure to take responsibility for the potential harm that may result from the publication of such research.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-particle-egypt-great-pyramid-void">Muons unveiled new details about a void in Egypt’s Great Pyramid</a></h4>

              
                <p>A nebulous void in Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza has been unveiled thanks to strange subatomic particles called muons.</p>



<p>Scientists first identified the void in 2016 using muons, heavy relatives of electrons that can penetrate through solid materials. Thought to be a corridor-shaped hole, the void was located near a chevron-shaped structure visible on the pyramid’s north face. Further muon measurements revealed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36351-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new details of the void’s size and shape</a>, scientists from the ScanPyramids team report March 2 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>

<p>The new muon measurements indicate that the void is a 9-meter-long corridor about 2 meters wide by 2 meters tall, close to the pyramid’s north face. ScanPyramids researchers made additional measurements with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963869523000245?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ground-penetrating radar and ultrasonic testing</a>, they reported March 2 in <em>NDT &amp; E International</em>.&nbsp;The detailed measurements allowed the scientists to use an endoscope to take images inside the chamber, the team announced. The images reveal a corridor with a vaulted ceiling, presumably one that was hasn’t been seen by humans since the pyramid was built more than 4,500 years ago. The corridor’s purpose is still unclear.</p>

<p>Muons are created when high-energy particles from space called cosmic rays crash into the Earth’s atmosphere. Muons are partially absorbed as they rain down onto structures such as the pyramids. Using detectors placed inside the pyramid, scientists from ScanPyramids zeroed in on regions where more muons made it through, indicating they’d traversed less material, which let them map out the location of the void.</p>



<p>Scientists also recently used muons to probe an <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-scan-mystery-ancient-chinese-wall">ancient Chinese wall</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/23</em>), a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq8431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear reactor</a> and <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">various volcanoes</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-boreal-forests-record-co2-2021">Wildfires in boreal forests released a record amount of CO2 in 2021</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON </strong>— In 2021, wildfires pillaged the world’s carbon-rich snow forests.</p>



<p>That year, burning boreal forests released 1.76 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, researchers reported March 2 in a news conference at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>



<p>That’s a new record for the region, which stores about one-third of the world’s land-based carbon. “It’s also roughly double the emissions in that year from aviation,” said earth system scientist Steven Davis of the University of California, Irvine. The trend, if it continues, threatens to make fighting climate change even more difficult.</p>





<p>Boreal forests are part of the taiga, a vast region that necklaces the Earth just south of the Arctic Circle. <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/tropical-forests-have-flipped-sponges-sources-carbon-dioxide">Blazes in tropical forests</a> like the Amazon tend to garner more attention for their potential to contribute large amounts of climate-warming gases to the atmosphere (<em>SN: 9/28/17</em>). But scientists estimate that on a per area basis, boreal forests store about twice as much carbon in their trees and soils as tropical forests.</p>



<p>Climate change is causing the taiga to warm about <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1219844110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as fast as the global average</a>. And wildfires are growing <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/zombie-forest-fires-climate-change">more widespread in the region</a>, releasing more of the trapped carbon, which in turn can worsen climate change (<em>SN: 5/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>Davis and his colleagues analyzed satellite data on carbon emissions from boreal regions from 2000 to 2021. In 2021, emissions from boreal wildfires made up a whopping <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 percent of all the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by wildfires</a> around the world, the researchers report in the March 3 <em>Science</em>. In contrast, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during an average year from 2000 to 2021 were about 10 percent.</p>



<p>The record-breaking emissions coincided with widespread heat waves and droughts in Siberia and northern Canada, probably fueled by human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>There’s no data yet to show if 2022 saw a similar surge in emissions. But, Davis said, “there’s not actually that much evidence that this record will stand for long.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-animal-pikobodies-crops-disease">Plant/animal hybrid proteins could help crops fend off diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new biological mashup just dropped.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pikobodies,&#8221; bioengineered <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn4116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune system proteins that are part plant and part animal</a>, could help flora better fend off diseases, researchers report in the March 3 <em>Science</em>. The protein hybrids exploit animals’ uniquely flexible immune systems, loaning plants the ability to fight off emerging pathogens<em>.</em><br><br>Flora typically rely on physical barriers to keep disease-causing microbes at bay. If something unusual makes it inside the plants, internal sensors sound the alarm and infected cells die. But as pathogens evolve ways to dodge these defenses, plants can’t adapt in real time. Animals’ adaptive immune systems can, making a wealth of antibodies in a matter of weeks when exposed to a pathogen.</p>





<p>In a proof-of-concept study, scientists genetically modified one plant’s internal sensor to sport animal antibodies. The approach harnesses the adaptive immune system’s power to make almost unlimited adjustments to target invaders and lends it to plants, says plant immunologist Xinnian Dong, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Duke University who was not involved in the work.<br><br>Crops especially could benefit from having more adaptable immune systems, since many farms grow fields full of just one type of plant, says Dong. In nature, diversity can help protect vulnerable plants from disease-spreading pathogens and pests. A farm is more like a buffet.</p>



<p>Researchers have had success fine-tuning plant genes to be disease-resistant, but finding the right genes and editing them can take more than a decade, says plant pathologist Sophien Kamoun of the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, England. He and colleagues wanted to know if plant protection could get an additional boost from animal-inspired solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To create the pikobodies, the team fused small antibodies from llamas and alpacas with a protein called Pik-1 that’s found on the cells of <em>Nicotiana benthamiana</em>, a close relative of tobacco plants. Pik-1 typically detects a protein that helps a <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/how-crop-destroying-fungus-mutated-infect-wheat">deadly blast fungus</a> infect plants (<em>SN: 7/10/17</em>). For this test, the animal antibodies had been engineered to target fluorescent proteins</p>



<p>Plants with the pikobodies killed cells exposed to the fluorescent proteins, resulting in dead patches on leaves, the team found. Of 11 tested versions, four were not toxic to the leaves and triggered cell death only when the pikobodies attached to the specific protein that they had been designed bind. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, pikobodies can be combined to give plants more than one way to attack a foreign invader. That tactic could be useful to hit pathogens with the nimble ability to dodge some immune responses from multiple angles.</p>



<p>Theoretically, it’s possible to make pikobodies “against virtually any pathogen we study,” Kamoun says. But not all pikobody combos worked together in tests. “It’s a bit hit or miss,” he says. “We need some more basic knowledge to improve the bioengineering.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-glaciers-ice-healing">Many Antarctic glaciers are hemorrhaging ice. This one is healing its cracks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even as some parts of West Antarctica rapidly melt, raising sea level, large swaths of the ice remain stable for the time being. Scientists have now explored one of those stable spots — an isolated nook where the ocean meets the ice. There, the team found the underside of the ice sculpted into strange grooves, ripples and globes.</p>



<p>This environment is “really at the edge” between melting and freezing, says planetary scientist Justin Lawrence. The delicate balance between these two processes is shaping the ice into those strange textures — similar to the way that minerals dissolve and recrystallize to form the beautiful shapes inside limestone caverns.</p>





<p>The result, at Kamb Ice Stream, is that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01129-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive cracks in the underside of the ice appear to be freezing back together</a> as the beach ball–sized globes fill in the crevasses from above, Lawrence and colleagues report March 2 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>



<p>This refreezing differs from what’s happening at Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier. There, scientists recently reported that these cracks, known as basal crevasses, are instead sites of <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">rapid melting</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/23</em>).</p>



<p>Understanding what is happening at Kamb will help scientists predict how large parts of the Antarctic coastline that are not currently vulnerable might respond as the world continues to warm due to human-caused climate change. Here’s what’s different about Kamb.</p>



<h4>Supercold water underlies the ice at Kamb, slowing melting</h4>



<p>In December 2019, two teams of researchers from New Zealand and the United States visited the Kamb Ice Stream — a type of glacier that consists of a channel of faster-moving ice surrounded by slower ice.</p>



<p>Kamb, like much of the rest of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, rests on a bed that is hundreds of meters below sea level. The New Zealand team used hot water to melt a narrow hole through the ice, just downstream of the “grounding zone,” where the glacier lifts off its muddy bed and floats on the ocean.</p>



<p>The U.S. team then lowered a remote-operated vehicle called Icefin down through 580 meters of ice and into the seawater below. The researchers piloted Icefin as far as a kilometer from the borehole, navigating by video transmitted up through a cable. At the time of the expedition, the team operating Icefin was affiliated with Georgia Tech in Atlanta, but has since moved to Cornell University, except for Lawrence. He now works for Honeybee Robotics, a private company in Altadena, Calif.</p>





<p>Icefin found that much of the seawater beneath Kamb is about 0.3 degrees Celsius above freezing. But directly below the ice sits a colder layer, a mixture of seawater and glacial meltwater just 0.02 to 0.08 degrees C above freezing. Based on these measurements, Lawrence and his colleagues estimate that the exposed underside of Kamb is melting about 26 centimeters per year.</p>



<p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent measurements at the increasingly unstable Thwaites Glacier</a>, about 1,400 kilometers to the northeast, found the seawater at the glacier’s grounding zone 1 to 2 degrees C warmer than at Kamb — and the ice melting 5 to 40 meters per year.</p>



<p>The new finding at Kamb makes sense, says New Zealand team member Christina Hulbe, of the University of Otago, because the seabed at Kamb is relatively shallow. So it is not exposed to the deep, warm ocean currents that are hitting Thwaites.</p>



<p>Much of Antarctica is fringed by cold ocean environments similar to Kamb, she says. “So just understanding that system is important.”</p>



<h4>Greenish globs of refrozen ice fill cracks at Kamb</h4>



<p>As Icefin glided along, its sonars detected massive basal crevasses up to 55 meters across in the ice above. These cracks probably formed as the floating part of the glacier, the ice shelf, flexes up and down with ocean tides.</p>



<p>Lawrence and his colleagues guided the ROV into one of these cracks, and found its white, icy sidewalls carved into narrow vertical grooves. Icefin ascended 40 meters up, until the grooves suddenly vanished — replaced by a jumble of ice globes, which seemed to fill the upper half of the crevasse.</p>



<p>The globes were greenish — a hue often seen in winter ice that forms on the surface of the ocean. This color makes Lawrence and his colleagues think that the globes form from the ultracold mixture of seawater and meltwater that circulates up into a crack and refreezes, gradually filling in the crack, from the top down, over many decades. They think that this is happening in all of the crevasses they observed. “These crevasses are effectively healing themselves,” he says.</p>

The grooves may have formed as concentrated brine, pushed out of the newly forming ice crystals above, slid down the walls, melting channels.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122365">Icefin/NASA PSTAR RISE UP/Schmidt/Lawrence</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This refreezing process might also explain the strange vertical grooves in the walls of the crevasse, Lawrence speculates. As the water freezes, salt is pushed out of the newly forming ice crystals, creating tiny pockets of highly concentrated brine. That dense brine streams down the walls, melting grooves into the ice — similar to the way that salt causes ice to melt when it’s sprinkled onto a sidewalk in the wintertime.</p>



<p>To observe the crevasses refreezing under Kamb “is pretty exceptional,” says Ginny Catania, a glaciologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not part of the project. Those cracks “can propagate all the way to the surface and cause calving” of icebergs, she says, which can shrink the ice shelf if it happens too quickly, destabilizing the glacier and raising sea level.</p>



<p>But if the crevasses can actually heal, this could make these ice shelves more resistant to calving — and more stable — than scientists realized, at least as long as the ice continues to be bathed in cold water on the underside.</p>



<p>A string of instruments installed in the hole continued to measure the temperature and salinity of the water beneath the ice — transmitting that data up a cable to the ice’s surface, and back home via satellite until the batteries ran out two years later. Those data show that conditions down below remained cool and comfortable for Kamb.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780306826627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Are Electric</a><br><em>Sally Adee</em><br><em>Hachette Books, $30</em></p>



<p>It took just a 9-volt battery and a little brain zapping to turn science writer Sally Adee into a stone-cold sharpshooter.</p>



<p>She had flown out to California to test an experimental DARPA technology that used electric jolts to speed soldiers’ sniper training. When the juice was flowing, Adee could tell. In a desert simulation that pit her against virtual bad guys, she hit every one.</p>



<p>“Getting my neurons slapped around by an electric field instantly sharpened my ability to focus,” Adee writes in her new book, <em>We Are Electric</em>. That brain-stimulating experience ignited her 10-year quest to understand how electricity and biology intertwine. And she’s not just talking neurons.</p>





<p>Bioelectricity, Adee makes the case, is a shockingly under­explored area of science that spans all parts of the body. Its story is one of missed opportunity, scientific threads exposed and abandoned, tantalizing clues and claims, “electroquacks” and unproven medical devices — and frogs. Oh so many frogs.</p>



<p>Adee takes us back to the 18th century lab of Luigi Galvani, an Italian scientist hunting for what gives animals the spark of life. His gruesome experiments on twitching frog legs offered proof that animal bodies generate their own electricity, an idea that was hotly debated at the time. (So many scientists repeated Galvani’s experiments, in fact, that Europe began to run out of frogs.)</p>



<p>But around the same time, Galvani critic Alessandro Volta, another Italian scientist, invented the electric battery. It was the kind of razzle-dazzle, history-shaking device that stole the spotlight from animal electricity, and the fledgling field fizzled. “The idea had been set,” Adee writes. “Electricity was not for biology. It was for machines, and telegraphs, and chemical reactions.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="654" height="450" src="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022523_reviews_inline-654x450.jpg" alt="An illustration of Luigi Galvani standing next to his experiment equipment with a pair of frog legs dangling from a nearby wire." class="wp-image-3122310" srcset="//www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022523_reviews_inline-654x450.jpg 654w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022523_reviews_inline-556x383.jpg 556w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022523_reviews_inline-270x186.jpg 270w, //www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022523_reviews_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122310">Luigi Galvani’s 18th century experiments on frog legs offered proof that electricity flowed through the bodies of animals.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122310">ILBUSCA/DIGITALVISION VECTORS/GETTY IMAGES PLUS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It took decades for scientists to pick up Galvani’s experimental threads and get the study of bioelectricity back on track. Since then, we’ve learned just how much electricity orchestrates our lives, and how much more remains to be discovered. Electricity zips through our neurons, makes our hearts tick and flows in every cell of the body. We’re made up of 40 trillion tiny rechargeable batteries, Adee writes.</p>



<p>She describes how cells use ion channels to usher charged molecules in and out. One thing readers might not expect from a book that illustrates the intricacies of ion channels: It’s surprisingly funny.</p>





<p>Chloride ions, for example, are “perpetually low-key ashamed” because they carry a measly -1 charge. Bogus medical contraptions (here’s looking at you, electric penis belts) were “electro-foolery.” In her acknowledgements, Adee jokes about the “life-saving powers of Voltron” and thanks people for enduring her caffeine jitters. That energy thrums through the book, charging her storytelling like a staticky balloon.</p>



<p>Adee is especially electrifying in a chapter about spinal nerve regeneration and why initial experiments juddered to a halt. Decades ago, scientists tried coaxing severed nerves to link up again by applying an electric field. The controversial technique sparked scientific drama, but the idea of using electricity to heal may have been ahead of its time. Fast-forward to 2020, and DARPA has awarded $16 million to researchers with a similar concept: a bio­electric bandage that speeds wound healing.</p>



<p>Along with zingy Band-Aids of the future, Adee describes other sci-fi–sounding devices in the works. One day, for example, surgeons may sprinkle your brain with neurograins, neural lace or <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/neural-dust-can-listen-body-electrical-signals">neural dust</a>, tiny electronic implants that could help scientists monitor brain activity or even help people control robotic arms or other devices (<em>SN: 9/3/16, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Such implants bring many challenges — like how to marry electronics to living tissue — but Adee’s book leaves readers with a sense of excitement. Not only could bioelectricity inspire new and improved medical devices, it could also reveal a current of unexpected truths about the body. </p>



<p>As Adee writes: “We are electrical machines whose full dimensions we have not even yet dreamed of.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/meningitis-causing-bacteria-invade-brain">How meningitis-causing bacteria invade the brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bacteria can slip into the brain by commandeering cells in the brain’s protective layers, a new study finds. The results hint at how a deadly infection called bacterial meningitis takes hold.</p>



<p>In mice infected with meningitis-causing bacteria, the microbes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05753-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploit previously unknown communication between pain-sensing nerve cells and immune cells</a> to slip by the brain’s defenses, researchers report March 1 in <em>Nature</em>. The results also hint at a new way to possibly delay the invasion — using migraine medicines to interrupt those cell-to-cell conversations.</p>





<p>Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the protective layers, or meninges, of the brain that affects 2.5 million people globally per year. It can cause severe headaches and sometimes lasting neurological injury or death.</p>



<p>“Unexpectedly, pain fibers are actually hijacked by the bacteria as they’re trying to invade the brain,” says Isaac Chiu, an immunologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Normally, one might expect pain to be a warning system for us to shut down the bacteria in some way, he says. “We found the opposite…. This [pain] signal is being used by the bacteria for an advantage.”</p>



<p>It’s known that <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-infection-gut-immune-system">pain-sensing neurons and immune cells coexist in the meninges</a>, particularly in the outermost layer called the dura mater (<em>SN: 11/11/20</em>). So to see what role the pain and immune cells play in bacterial meningitis, Chiu’s team infected mice with two of the bacteria known to cause the infection in humans: <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>S. agalactiae</em>. The researchers then observed where that bacteria ended up in mice genetically tweaked to lack pain-sensing nerve cells and compared those resting spots to those in mice with the nerve cells intact.</p>



<p>Mice without pain-sensing neurons had fewer bacteria in the meninges and brain than those with the nerve cells, the team found. This contradicts the idea that pain in meningitis serves as a warning signal to the body’s immune system, mobilizing it for action.</p>



<p>Further tests showed that the bacteria triggered a chain of immune-suppressing events, starting with the microbes secreting toxins in the dura mater.</p>



<p>The toxins hitched onto the pain neurons, which in turn released a molecule called CGRP. This molecule is already known to bind to a receptor on immune cells, where it helps control the dura mater’s immune responses. Injecting infected mice with more CGRP lowered the number of dural immune cells and helped the infection along, the researchers found.</p>



<p>The team also looked more closely at the receptor that CGRP binds to. In infected mice bred without the receptor, fewer bacteria made it into the brain. But in ones with the receptor, immune cells that would otherwise engulf bacteria and recruit reinforcements were disabled.</p>





<p>The findings suggest that either preventing the release of CGRP or preventing it from binding to immune cells might help delay infection.</p>



<p>In humans, neuroscientists know that CGRP is a driver of headaches — it’s already a <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-new-migraine-drug">target of migraine medications</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/18</em>). So the researchers gave five mice the migraine medication olcegepant, which blocks CGRP’s effects, and infected them with <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. After infection, the medicated mice had less bacteria in the meninges and brain, took longer to show symptoms, didn’t lose as much weight and survived longer than mice that were not given the medication.</p>



<p>The finding suggests olcegepant slowed the infection. Even though it only bought mice a few extra hours, that’s crucial in meningitis, which can develop just as quickly. Were olcegepant to work the same way in humans, it might give doctors more time to treat meningitis. But the effect is probably not as dramatic in people, cautions Michael Wilson, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco who wasn’t involved with the work.</p>



<p>Scientists still need to determine whether pain-sensing nerve cells and immune cells have the same rapport in human dura mater, and whether migraine drugs could help treat bacterial meningitis in people.</p>



<p>Neurologist Avindra Nath has doubts. Clinicians think the immune response and inflammation damage the brain during meningitis, says Nath, who heads the team investigating nervous system infections at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md. So treatment involves drugs that suppress the immune response, rather than enhance it as migraine medications might.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chiu acknowledges this but notes there might be room for both approaches. If dural mater immune cells could head the infection off at the pass, it may keep some bacteria from penetrating the defenses, minimizing brain inflammation.</p>



<p>This study might not ultimately change how clinicians treat patients, Wilson says. But it still reveals something new about one of the first lines of defense for the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/plos-journals-update-their-human-subjects-research-policy/">PLOS journals update their Human Subjects Research Policy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Authors: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor, PLOS Publication Ethics Team; Emily Chenette, Editor in Chief, <em>PLOS ONE</em></p>



<p>PLOS and other publishers have recently seen a rise in large-scale cases involving manipulation of the publication process, and PLOS staff are working to increase the stringency of our processes to keep problematic articles out of the literature. As part of this work, we updated the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/human-subjects-research">Human Subjects Research Policy for</a> <em>PLOS ONE, PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Water</em>: as of March 1, 2023<em>, </em>these journals require that <strong>authors of manuscripts reporting research involving human participants provide original ethics approval documentation at the time of submission. </strong>This also applies to studies that use human subjects&rsquo; data or primary tissue samples, except for studies that are exempt from ethics approval per institutional and/or national requirements.</p>



<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>



<p>The competitive nature of academic publishing, tenure, and hiring decisions can incentivize researchers to take shortcuts, compromising on ethics to boost or accelerate their publication records. In some cases, this might mean conducting research before all requisite approvals have been obtained. In others, it might mean purchasing authorship or article content, or compromising the integrity of the peer review process. These unethical practices can pollute the literature with problematic articles that are harmful to the broader community, including people endeavoring to replicate fraudulent research and those directly impacted by the published findings.</p>



<p>PLOS has always had high ethics standards for the research that we publish. Up to this point, PLOS journals have required that submissions of studies involving human participants include an Ethics Statement reporting information about the study&rsquo;s ethics approval and informed consent procedures. On occasion, journal staff have requested ethics approval documents for studies where there were concerns about adherence to the policy.</p>



<p>Recently, the PLOS Publication Ethics team has handled higher volumes of cases where documents received during our investigations raised concerns about whether ethics standards were upheld during the research process, whether measures were in place to protect participants in the research, or whether the reported findings were reliable.</p>



<p>In light of these concerns, <em>PLOS ONE</em> ran a trial in 2022 wherein cohorts of authors were asked to supply ethics approval documents before peer review. Compliance was high, but what journal staff found was deeply troubling: in one cohort, nearly two-thirds of submissions did not meet <em>PLOS ONE&rsquo;s</em> human subjects research requirements and were therefore rejected. Importantly, journal staff would not have detected the issues had they not requested the ethics documentation.</p>



<p>Given these observations, we are updating the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/human-subjects-research">Human Subjects Research Policy</a> for <em>PLOS ONE, PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Water</em> (effective 1 March 2023), and we are considering similar updates for other PLOS journals. Under the new policy, original ethics approval documentation will be required at the time of submission and evaluated by journal staff before peer review. If there are any concerns about the ethics approval documents, if they are not provided, or if they indicate the study did not comply with our policies, the manuscript will be rejected without external review. Per our longstanding policy, we will continue to request ethics documents for manuscripts submitted before March 2023 if deemed necessary by journal staff or editorial board members. Submitted ethics approval documents will not be published.</p>



<p>We recognize that this updated policy alone will not identify all potentially fraudulent or unethical research. Nevertheless, it is an important advance in our efforts to safeguard the integrity of human subjects research publications, uphold our ethics policies, and ensure that the community can continue to trust, reuse, and build upon the work that we publish.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-ice-age-hunter-gatherers-europe">Ancient DNA unveils disparate fates of Ice Age hunter-gatherers in Europe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ice sheets expanded across much of northern Europe from around 25,000 to 19,000 years ago, making a huge expanse of land unlivable. That harsh event set in motion a previously unrecognized tale of two human populations that played out at opposite ends of the continent.</p>



<p>Western European hunter-gatherers outlasted the icy blast in the past. Easterners got replaced by migrations of newcomers.</p>



<p>That’s the implication of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05726-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest study to date of ancient Europeans’ DNA</a>, covering a period before, during and after what’s known as the Last Glacial Maximum, paleogeneticist Cosimo Posth and colleagues report March 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>As researchers have long thought, southwestern Europe provided refuge from the last Ice Age’s big chill for hunter-gatherers based in and near that region, the scientists say. But it turns out that southeastern Europe, where Italy is now located, did not offer lasting respite from the cold for nearby groups, as previously assumed.</p>



<p>Instead, those people were replaced by genetically distinct hunter-gatherers who presumably had lived just to the east along the Balkan Peninsula. Those people, who carried ancestry from parts of southwestern Asia, began trekking into what’s now northern Italy by about 17,000 years ago, as the Ice Age began to wane.</p>



<p>“If local [Ice Age] populations in Italy did not survive and were replaced by groups from the Balkans, this completely changes our interpretation of the archaeological record,” says Posth, of the University of Tübingen in Germany.</p>



<p>Posth and colleagues’ conclusions rest on analyses of DNA from 356 ancient hunter-gatherers, including new molecular evidence for 116 individuals from 14 countries in Europe and Asia. Excavated human remains that yielded DNA dated to between <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils">about 45,000</a> and 5,000 years ago (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>Comparisons of sets of gene variants inherited by these hunter-gatherers from common ancestors enabled the researchers to reconstruct population movements and replacements that shaped ancient Europeans’ genetic makeup. For the first time, ancient DNA evidence included individuals from what’s known as the Gravettian culture, which dates from about 33,000 to 26,000 years ago in central and southern Europe, and from southwestern Europe’s Solutrean culture, which dates to between about 24,000 and 19,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations, makers of Gravettian tools came from two genetically distinct groups that populated western and eastern Europe for roughly 10,000 years before the Ice Age reached its peak, Posth says. Researchers have traditionally regarded Gravettian implements as products of a biologically uniform population that occupied much of Europe.</p>



<p>“What we previously thought was one genetic ancestry in Europe turned out to be two,” says paleogeneticist Mateja Hajdinjak of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who did not participate in the new study. And “it seems that western and southwestern Europe served as a [refuge from glaciation] more than southeastern Europe and Italy.”</p>





<p>Descendants of the western Gravettian population, who are associated with Solutrean artifacts and remnants of another ancient culture in western Europe that ran from about 19,000 to 14,000 years ago, outlasted the Ice Age before spreading northeastward across Europe, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Further support for southwestern Europe as an Ice Age refuge comes from DNA extracted from a pair of fossil teeth that belonged to an individual linked to the Solutrean culture in southern Spain. That roughly 23,000-year-old adult <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-01987-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was genetically similar to western European hunter-gatherers</a> who lived before and after the Last Glacial Maximum, Max Planck paleogeneticist Vanessa Villalba-Mouco and colleagues, including Posth, report March 1 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the genetic evidence suggests that hunter-gatherers in what’s now Italy were replaced by people from farther east, probably based in the Balkan region. Those newcomers must have brought with them a distinctive brand of stone artifacts, previously excavated at Italian sites and elsewhere in eastern Europe, known as Epigravettian tools, Posth says. Many archaeologists have suspected that Epigravettian items were products of hunter-gatherers who clustered in Italy during the Ice Age’s peak freeze.</p>



<p>But, Hajdinjak says, analyses of DNA from fossils of Ice Age Balkan people are needed to clarify what groups moved through Italy, and when those migrations occurred.</p>



<p>Ultimately, descendants of Ice Age migrants into Italy reached southern Italy and then western Europe by around 14,000 years ago, Posth and colleagues say. Ancient DNA evidence indicates that, during those travels, they left a major genetic mark on hunter-gatherers across Europe.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran will talk about his paper &quot;An Evolutionary Ensemble Learning for Diagnosing COVID-19 via Cough Signals&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Objective The spread of the COVID-19 disease has caused great concern around the world and
detecting the positive cases is crucial in curbing the pandemic. One of the symptoms of
the disease is the dry cough it causes. It has previously been shown that cough signals
can be used to identify a variety of diseases including tuberculosis, asthma, etc. In this
paper, we proposed an algorithm to diagnose via cough signals the COVID-19 disease.
Methods The proposed algorithm is an ensemble scheme that consists of a number of base
learners, where each base learner uses a different feature extractor method, including
statistical approaches and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for automatic feature
extraction. Features are extracted from the raw signal and some transforms performed it,
including Fourier, wavelet, Hilbert-Huang, and short-term Fourier transforms. The outputs
of these base-learners are aggregated via a weighted voting scheme, with the weights
optimised via an evolutionary paradigm. This paper also proposes a memetic algorithm for
training the CNNs in the base-learners, which combines the speed of gradient descent (GD)
algorithms and global search space coverage of the evolutionary algorithms. Results
Experiments were performed on the proposed algorithm and different rival algorithms which
included a number of CNN architectures in the literature and generic machine learning
algorithms. The results suggested that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance
compared to the existing algorithms in diagnosing COVID-19 via cough signals. Conclusion
This research showed that COVID-19 could be diagnosed via cough signals and CNNs could be
employed to process these signals and it may be further improved by the optimization of
CNN architecture.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/lemon-juice-get-rid-kidney-stones">Here’s how lemon juice may fend off kidney stones</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprise ingredient may explain how lemon juice puts the squeeze on kidney stones.</p>



<p>Lemons contain nanoparticles that, when fed to rats, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c05099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block stone formation</a>, scientists report in the Feb. 22 <em>Nano Letters</em>. If the tiny sacs do the same for humans, the nanoparticles might one day offer a way to prevent kidney stones in people, says pharmaceutical scientist Hongzhi Qiao of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine.</p>



<p>Lemon juice is a well-known home remedy for kidney stones, which form <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/kidney-stones-grow-and-dissolve-much-geological-crystals">when minerals crystalize and clump up</a> inside the kidney (<em>SN: 9/21/18</em>). These rocky lumps can knock around in the urinary tract, slicing and dicing tissues as <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/riding-roller-coasters-might-help-dislodge-kidney-stones">they eventually pass out of the body</a> (<em>SN: 10/31/16</em>). “It&#8217;s so, so, so painful,” says Jingyin Yan, a nephrologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not part of the new study. Patients may feel sharp pain in their back, side or lower abdomen when they pass a stone, she says. “People describe it as worse than delivering a baby.”</p>





<p>Though some medications can help treat kidney stones, many people end up needing surgery to remove them, says Thomas Chi, a urologist at the University of California, San Francisco, also not part of the study. People often imagine kidney stones as tiny pebbles, but sometimes they bulk up like boulders, he adds. “I’ve taken out stones the size of your fist.”</p>



<p>That’s why prevention is key. Scientists already knew that citric acid, which gives lemons their sour power, may do the trick by binding to the minerals that make up stones. But drinking mouth-puckering lemon juice is not so comfortable for patients, Qiao says.</p>



<p>A 2022 clinical trial found that <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00508-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kidney stone patients had trouble downing 120 milliliters</a> — about a half cup — of lemon juice per day. Swilling loads of lemonade can cause dental problems, too. Chi has had patients drink so much that the acidic liquid ate away at their teeth.</p>



<p>So Qiao and colleagues looked for other, more palatable lemon-derived ingredients that might help prevent kidney stones. Inside edible and medicinal plants like ginseng, grapefruit and dandelion, his team has found extracellular vesicle-like nanoparticles, tiny sacs stuffed with molecules including fat, protein and DNA.</p>

<p>These nanoparticles exist in lemon juice, too­­ — and the team fed them to rats that had also ingested a substance that promotes kidney stone growth. The zesty particles slowed stone formation, Qiao and colleagues found. The finding suggests these particles curb development of calcium oxalate crystals, the most common culprit of kidney stones. The particles can also soften the stones and make them less sticky, the team showed.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The new work challenges the conventional wisdom on how lemon juice works to combat kidney stones, Chi says. Using lemon nanoparticles to treat people is still a long way off, but the team’s results hold promise, he says. “The faster you can bring a finding like this towards a human clinical trial, the better.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-pollen-insects-280-million-years">The oldest known pollen-carrying insects lived about 280 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oldest known fossils of pollen-laden insects are of earwig-like ground-dwellers that lived in what is now Russia about 280 million years ago, researchers report. Their finding pushes back the fossil record of insects transporting pollen from one plant to another, a key aspect of modern-day pollination, by about 120 million years.</p>



<p>The insects — from a pollen-eating genus named <em>Tillyardembia</em> first described in 1937 — were typically about 1.5 centimeters long, says Alexander Khramov, a paleoentomologist at the Borissiak Paleontological Institute in Moscow. Flimsy wings probably kept the creatures mostly on the forest floor, he says, leaving them to climb trees to find and consume their pollen.</p>



<p>Recently, Khramov and his colleagues scrutinized 425 fossils of <em>Tillyardembia</em> in the institute’s collection. Six had clumps of pollen grains <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trapped on their heads, legs, thoraxes or abdomens</a>, the team reports February 28 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. A proportion that small isn’t surprising, Khramov says, because the fossils were preserved in what started out as fine-grained sediments. The early stages of fossilization in such material would tend to wash away pollen from the insects’ remains.</p>

<p>The pollen-laden insects had only a couple of types of pollen trapped on them, the team found, suggesting that the critters were very selective in the tree species they visited. “That sort of specialization is in line with potential pollinators,” says Michael Engel, a paleoentomologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence who was not involved in the study. “There’s probably vast amounts of such specialization that occurred even before <em>Tillyardembia</em>, we just don’t have evidence of it yet.”</p>



<p>Further study of these fossils might reveal if <em>Tillyardembia </em>had evolved special pollen-trapping hairs or other such structures on their bodies or heads, says Conrad Labandeira, a paleoecologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., also not part of the study. It would also be interesting, he says, to see if something about the pollen helped it stick to the insects.&nbsp;If the pollen grains had structures that enabled them to clump more readily, for example, then those same&nbsp;features&nbsp;may have helped them grab Velcro-like onto&nbsp;any hairlike structures on&nbsp;the insects’ bodies.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/snapping-shrimp-fastest-claw-biology">The fastest claw in the sea belongs to young snapping shrimp</a></h4>

              
                <p>Full-grown snapping shrimp were already known to have some of the fastest claws under the waves. But it turns out they’re nothing compared with their kids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Juvenile snapping shrimp produce <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.244645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest known underwater accelerations</a> of any reusable body part, researchers report February 28 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.&nbsp;While the claws’ top speed isn’t terribly impressive, they go from zero to full throttle in record time.</p>



<p>To deter predators or competitors, snapping shrimp create shock waves with their powerful claws. The shrimp store energy in the flexing exoskeleton of their claw as it opens, latching it in place much like a bow-and-arrow mechanism, says Jacob Harrison, a biologist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.</p>





<p>Firing the claw and releasing this elastic energy produces a speeding jet of water. Bubbles form behind it and promptly implode, liberating a huge amount of energy, momentarily <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/shrimps-spew-bubbles-hot-sun">flashing as hot as the sun</a> and creating a deafening crack (<em>SN: 10/3/01</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it was unclear how early in their lives the shrimp could use this weaponry. “We knew that the snapping shrimp did this really impressive behavior,” Harrison says. “But we really didn&#8217;t know anything about how this mechanism developed.”</p>



<p>While a grad student at Duke University, Harrison and his adviser, biomechanist Sheila Patek, reared bigclaw snapping shrimp (<em>Alpheus heterochaelis</em>) from eggs in the laboratory. At 1 month old, the tiny shrimp — less than a centimeter long — began firing their claws when disturbed. The researchers took high-speed video footage of these snaps and calculated their speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wee shrimp could create the collapsing bubbles just like adults. Despite being a tenth the adults’ size or smaller, the juveniles’ claws accelerated 20 times as fast when firing. This acceleration — about 600 kilometers per second per second — is on “the same order of magnitude as a 9-millimeter bullet leaving a gun,” Harrison says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch a young snapping shrimp shut its claw in slow motion | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rwmEvSOJMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It takes less than a millisecond for a juvenile snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) to slam its claw shut. But thanks to footage taken at 300,000 frames per second and then slowed down by 10,000 times, the human eye can capture this extreme acceleration and the imploding bubble it creates.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dracula ants (<em>Mystrium camillae</em>) and some termites produce more explosive bites but aren’t pushing against water. The stinging cells of jellyfish launch their venomous harpoons about 100 times as fast, but their firing mechanism is inherently single use. Snapping shrimp, on the other hand, can fire their claws again and again.</p>





<p>The juveniles’ firing and bubble creation weren’t very reliable at the smallest sizes, but the shrimp routinely tried snapping anyway. The team wonders if the young shrimp could be practicing and training the necessary musculature.</p>



<p>If so, that training might ultimately be crucial to the claw’s function, says Kate Feller, a visual ecologist at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., who studies similarly ultrafast mantis shrimp and was not involved in the new study. “If you were to somehow manipulate the claws so that they couldn’t properly close and they couldn’t snap,” she wonders, “would that affect their ability to develop these mechanisms?”</p>



<p>Understanding the storage of elastic energy in biological materials and how it flows through them is “tricky,” Harrison says. Figuring out how such tiny claws store so much energy without fracturing may help researchers illuminate this superpower.</p>

<p>In April 2022, Ioannis Kalpouzos, a professor at Harvard Law, received an invitation to join the editorial board of the newly-launched <em>American Yearbook of International Law</em>. But something gave him pause.</p>



<p>“The title sounded a bit dodgy &#8211; it sounded like something I should have heard of,” Kalpouzos told Retraction Watch, adding that with some Googling he “found that it wasn’t really a thing.”</p>



<p>“If somebody’s not in the know, it’s easier for them to be duped, I suppose,” Kalpouzos said, but his instincts told him that such a yearbook would most likely be published by an established law review.</p>



<p>So he declined.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The title is one of three new journals launched by Dimitris Liakopoulos, a legal researcher who at the time of this writing sits on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a> with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dLiakopoulos%252c%2bDimitris">33 retractions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/14/legal-researcher-up-to-23-retractions-for-false-affiliations-plagiarism/">previously reported</a>, Liakopoulos had falsely claimed to be a professor at several universities, including Columbia Law School, Stetson University, and various European institutions. In 2020, a representative of Tufts University, where Liakopoulos had claimed to be on faculty, told us that he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Liakopoulos_nonaffiliate.pdf">had never been affiliated with the school</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the retraction notices on Liakopoulos’s work <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/14/itinerant-legal-scholar-who-claimed-tufts-affiliation-up-to-10-retractions/">cite concerns</a> about his stated affiliations, and they often note plagiarism, such as the <a href="https://brill.com/display/book/9789047431145/Bej.9789004177710.i-234_001.xml">note</a> retracting an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/03/03/legal-researcher-who-claimed-false-affiliation-up-to-31-retractions/">entire book</a> Liakopoulos co-authored.</p>



<p>Under the auspices of the putative non-profit <a href="https://theceij.jimdofree.com/">Center of European and International Justice</a>, Liakopoulos has recently launched the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/ayil">American Yearbook of International Law</a>, the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/yeucl/index">Yearbook of European Union and Comparative Law</a>, and the <a href="https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/yiecpl/index">Yearbook of International &amp; European Criminal and Procedural Law</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As yearbooks, the volumes appear annually rather than publishing articles throughout any given year. All three yearbooks have one volume so far, from 2022.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The web site for the Center of European and International Justice states its address as 777 UN Plaza, which is across the street from the United Nations building in New York City. That address is the home of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Center_for_the_United_Nations">Church Center for the United Nations,</a> which boasts a chapel regularly used for weddings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the web address for the center includes the clause jimdofree.com. This indicates it is from a <a href="https://www.jimdo.com/">web domain service</a> that gives people free online hosting, rather than the .org domain one would expect from a legitimate non-profit.</p>



<p>Besides the dubious affiliation, at least two yearbook articles, both by Liakopoulos, have had concerns raised about plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A PubPeer sleuth notes that one article in the American yearbook <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B532E64DAAAE67C926196F9CC46592">lifts</a> from a doctoral thesis originally published in Italian, while an article from one of the European yearbooks <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/56C9F0E47EE3CB1197108D5778C45E">pulls</a> text from a previously published Italian paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The yearbooks are published by the National Documentation Center of Greece, a cultural heritage organization sponsored by the Greek government. We contacted the Documentation Center to ask about how they had vetted the reliability of the yearbooks but did not hear back.</p>



<p>We also used the contact email provided on the yearbook web pages (purportedly directed to a person named Sara Cristain) to ask Liakopoulos some questions about the journals.</p>



<p>A few days later, we received a vituperative note from one Klaus Volger, who assured us that the yearbooks are legitimate, citing among other things – all without evidence – the imprimatur of the Greek government. Volger also asserted that no article in the yearbooks is plagiarized, and said that <em>Retraction Watch </em>is only interested in this topic for “money and publicity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Volger, or someone using his name, had responded similarly after our previous posts.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/hot-lightning-strike-wildfire-spark-risk-climate-change">An incendiary form of lightning may surge under climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>A form of lightning with a knack for sparking wildfires may surge under climate change.</p>



<p>An analysis of satellite data suggests “hot lightning” — strikes that channel electrical charge for an extended period — may be more likely to set landscapes ablaze than more ephemeral flashes, researchers report February 10 in <em>Nature Communications.</em> Each 1 degree Celsius of warming could spur <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36500-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 10 percent increase in the most incendiary of these Promethean bolts</a>, boosting their flash rate to about four times per second by 2090 — up from nearly three times per second in 2011.</p>





<p>That’s dangerous, warns physicist Francisco Javier Pérez-Invernón of the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain. “There will be more risk of lightning-ignited wildfires.”</p>



<p>Among all the forces of nature, lightning sets off the most blazes. Flashes that touch down amid minimal or no rainfall — known as dry lightning — are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ac84a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially effective fire starters</a>. These bolts have initiated some of the most destructive wildfires in recent years, such as the <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">2020 blazes in California</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>But more than parched circumstances can influence a blast’s ability to spark flames. <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/21/17529/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Field observations</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379711220301260?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laboratory experiments</a> have suggested the most enduring form of hot lightning — “long continuing current lightning”— may be especially combustible. These strikes channel current for more than 40 milliseconds. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JD033451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some last longer than one-third of a second</a> — the typical duration of a human eye blink.</p>



<p>“This type of lightning can transport a huge amount of electrical discharge from clouds to the ground or to vegetation,” Pérez-Invernón says. Hot lightning’s flair for fire is analogous to lighting a candle; the more time a wick or vegetation is exposed to incendiary energy, the easier it kindles.</p>



<p>Previous research has proposed <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/lightning-strikes-will-surge-climate-change">lightning may surge under climate change</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/14</em>). But it has remained less clear how hot lightning — and its ability to spark wildfires — might evolve.</p>



<p>Pérez-Invernón and his colleagues examined the relationship between hot lightning and U.S. wildfires, using lightning data collected by a <a href="https://www.goes-r.gov/multimedia/dataAndImageryImagesGoes-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather satellite</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2013-0009.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfire</a> data from 1992 to 2018.</p>



<p>Long continuing current lightning could have sparked up to 90 percent of the roughly 5,600 blazes encompassed in the analysis, the team found. Since <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10 percent</a> of all lightning strikes during the summer in the western United States have long continuing current, the relatively high ignition count led the researchers to infer that flashes of hot lightning were more prone to sparking fire than typical bolts.</p>





<p>The researchers also probed the repercussions of climate change. They ran computer simulations of the global activity of lightning during 2009 to 2011 and from 2090 to 2095, under a future scenario in which annual greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2080 and then decline.</p>



<p>The team found that in the later period, climate change may boost updraft within thunderstorms, causing hot lightning flashes to increase in frequency to about 4 strikes per second globally — about a 40 percent increase from 2011. Meanwhile, the rate of all cloud-to-ground strikes might increase to nearly 8 flashes per second, a 28 percent increase.</p>



<p>After accounting for changes in precipitation, humidity and temperature, the researchers predicted wildfire risk will significantly increase in Southeast Asia, South America, Africa and Australia, and risk will go up most dramatically in North America and Europe. However, risk may decrease in many polar regions, where rainfall is projected to increase while hot lightning rates remain constant.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s valuable to show that risk may evolve differently in different places, says Earth systems scientist Yang Chen of the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. But, he notes, the analysis uses sparse data from polar regions, so there is a lot of uncertainty. Harnessing additional data from ground-based lightning detectors and other data sources could help, he says. “That [region is] important, because a lot of carbon can be released from permafrost.”</p>



<p>Pérez-Invernón agrees more data will help improve projections of rates of lightning-induced wildfire, not just in the polar regions, but also in Africa, where blazes are common but fire reports are lacking.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2023/02/five-things-musicians-should-know-about-the-brain/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/damir-kopezhanov-Oo_nApUwRg-unsplash-1-480x185.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2023/02/five-things-musicians-should-know-about-the-brain/">Five things musicians should know about the brain</a></p><p>You may read the title of this blog post and wonder “why should musicians know about the brain?” Historically, there are thousands of musicians who have performed beautifully without knowing anything at all about the three-pound organ sitting atop the spine. But there are countless other individuals who may benefit from knowing some of the “brain basics” concerning music that have been discovered over the past few decades. </p><p>Music communicates emotion, but sometimes the failure to wire musical information securely in the brain during practice, or experiencing anxiety about technique or memory during performance causes emotional communication to suffer. Some knowledge of brain basics can help us study and teach with greater efficiency and confidence, thus giving us more freedom in performance to concentrate on communicating the emotional essence of the music. Consider the following:</p><h2><strong>1. We are hardwired for music as we are for language</strong></h2><p>Infants are born with amazing musical abilities. They can detect a missing downbeat at the age of two to three days and begin moving to music as soon as they have control of their limbs. They prefer singing to speaking, can recognize variations in complex rhythms at six months, and have a very good memory for music. Many of these abilities are lost by the age of one because they are not nurtured, as is the case with language. Perhaps we should rethink “how” and “when” we begin teaching music to children because music is part of who we are as human beings. Or as well-known music educator Edwin Gordon said, “Music is as basic as language to human development and existence.”</p><h2><strong>2. Practicing drives brain neuroplasticity</strong></h2><p>We all have similar brains, but each person’s brain develops in a unique way based on his learning and experience. For example, the brain of a cardiac surgeon will look a bit different from that of a musician. Many areas of the brain are involved in making music, including the areas for processing visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and motor information, as well as areas for processing emotion and memory. As we practice an instrument or voice, connections develop among all of these areas through vast neural networks, and our brains change as a result. The more we practice, the more the brain changes. These changes in the brain are called neuroplasticity. There are some ways of practicing that lead to stronger wiring or greater neuroplasticity in the brain, meaning increasingly better technical and musical skills and stronger memory for music.</p><h2><strong>3. Practicing happens in the brain, not in the muscles</strong></h2><p>Motor imagery is a powerful practice technique that involves imagining all of the movements necessary to play or sing a piece of music. One hears the music in one’s mind and imagines making the movements to create the sound—“feeling” the movements in one’s mind. Research has shown that when we practice using motor imagery, all of the areas of the brain that would normally be involved when we physically practice are active—with the single exception of the motor cortex that sends signals to the muscles to make movements. So, if we imagine every aspect of making music, our brain is practicing, and the result is nearly the same as if we had physically practiced. Imagine the implications this technique has for being able to practice if injured, if one has no access to an instrument, or if needing additional practice on something technically demanding without the possibility of causing injury from physically over-practicing.</p><h2><strong>4. Sleep may be one of the most important practice strategies of all&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>What happens in the brain during sleep reinforces the idea that practicing occurs in the brain, not in the muscles. With the discovery in the 1950s of REM and NREM sleep, researchers realized that the brain is quite active during sleep, and they subsequently have found that several stages of the sleep cycle are vitally important for the encoding and consolidation of procedural memory (motor skill memory) as well as for encoding and consolidation of declarative memory (memory for a particular piece of music). Lack of sleep impairs both our initial learning of, as well as our memory for, a piece of music.</p><h2><strong>5. The visual is important in learning and making music</strong></h2><p>We think of music as being strictly about sound, but the visual is involved as well. Amazing brain cells called mirror neurons fire not only when we make a motion ourselves but also when we see someone else making that motion or hear the sound resulting from that motion (such as the sound of a musical instrument). If we are trying to learn the violin, our brain “learns” by watching someone else play and develops a template for that motion and for the sound that motion creates, a template on which we can build as we practice. So, observation and listening are tremendously important in teaching or learning an instrument or voice. And surprisingly, these mirror neurons also have an impact on how we hear a live performance as a member of the audience. What we see affects what we hear.</p><p>Over the past few decades, we have added a great deal of information about the mind and body to our vocal and instrumental study. With the recent explosion of information about neuroscience and music, perhaps it’s time to incorporate some information about the brain as well into how we think about studying and making music.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by Damir Kopezhanov from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/-Oo_nApUwRg">Unsplash</a> (public domain)</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/729104960/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/729104960/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f02%2fdamir-kopezhanov-Oo_nApUwRg-unsplash-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/729104960/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/02/new-perspectives-on-the-american-civil-war-reading-list/">New perspectives on the American Civil War [reading list]</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/02/saving-earths-refrigerator-what-does-global-warming-mean-for-our-planets-future/">Saving Earth&#x2019;s Refrigerator: what does global warming mean for our planet&#x2019;s future?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/02/explore-environmental-history-in-eight-books-reading-list/">Explore environmental history in eight books [reading list]</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/eye-drops-delay-nearsightedness-child">Medicated eye drops may delay nearsightedness in children</a></h4>

              
                <p>An eye drop a day could keep myopia at bay — at least temporarily.</p>



<p>Using nightly eye drops with 0.05 percent atropine, a medication that relaxes the eye muscle responsible for focusing vision, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2801319" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may delay myopia onset in children</a>, researchers report February 14 in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>Myopia, also called nearsightedness, is an irreversible condition in which the eyeball grows too long front to back, causing blurred distant vision. It typically begins in childhood, and the earlier it starts, the worse eye health can become later in life. Elongated eyes increase the risk for ocular complications including cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration.</p>





<p>The prevalence of myopia has risen rapidly over the last few decades. About one-fourth of the global population currently has the condition. It is expected to affect half of people worldwide by 2050.</p>



<p>Genetics plays a large role in the condition. A 2020 study found that <a href="https://www.ajo.com/article/S0002-9394(20)30265-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myopia risk is more than 10 times as high in children of two highly myopic parents as in children of nonmyopic parents</a>, says ophthalmologist Jason Yam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>But he and other scientists speculate that environmental factors such as <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/urban-eyes">less time outdoors</a> and more intensive education are causing the recent boom (<em>SN: 1/24/13</em>). “It’s happening too quickly to be a purely genetic or inherited issue,” says optometrist Kathryn Saunders of Ulster University in Coleraine, Northern Ireland, who was not involved in the new study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Low-dose atropine eye drops are already used to slow myopia progression in several countries in Asia. Yam and colleagues wanted to see if the medication could also delay myopia onset. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team recruited nonmyopic children ages 4 through 9 who lived in Hong Kong. Each participant received nightly eye drops but was randomly assigned to receive drops with 0.05 percent atropine, 0.01 percent atropine or a placebo. Families and clinicians didn’t know which treatment group the children were in.</p>



<p>A total of 353 children used their assigned eye drops for two years. Only about 25 percent of children who took 0.05 percent atropine eye drops, roughly 30 kids, developed myopia in at least one eye, compared with about 50 percent of those who used 0.01 percent atropine or placebo eye drops, around 60 kids in each group. The percentages in each group were similar for eye elongation not severe enough to be considered myopia.</p>





<p>“It’s a great first step to encourage us to explore more,” Saunders says.</p>



<p>Scientists will need to conduct studies in more diverse populations and environments to reach generalizable conclusions since the trial took place in only Hong Kong. Eye color may also influence dosing, as lighter-pigmented eyes might be more susceptible to side effects, including sensitivity to light.</p>



<p>How atropine slows myopia onset and progression remains a mystery. The medication might improve blood circulation in the eye, Yam says, but that’s just one existing hypothesis.</p>



<p>The new study was too short to suggest that atropine eye drops can prevent myopia. But an ongoing follow-up period in which participants continue taking the medication through their teenage years — when eye length stabilizes — will help the team understand if atropine eye drops can ward off the condition altogether.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13160 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/longcovid.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="136" />Post COVID-19 Condition or long COVID, can affect anyone exposed to SARS-CoV-2, regardless of age or severity of original symptoms. It is commonly defined as the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least two months. Such symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, among others.</p>
<p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is suggested to be effective in similar conditions, such as Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue syndrome, but is not an accepted treatment for patients diagnosed with long COVID. In a randomized controlled trial conducted at Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, Kjellberg et al. sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for individuals with long COVID symptoms.</p>
<p>Twenty previously healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive either hyperbaric oxygen therapy or a placebo treatment. Data on potential side effects or adverse events that occurred during the treatment were collected, and long COVID symptoms before and after the treatment were assessed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was found to be overall safe, with no serious adverse events reported during treatment or follow-up. The most common adverse effects were cough and chest pain or discomfort, however these were mild and transient.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13161 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/lifestyle.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="147" />Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting reproductive-aged women. Women with PCOS might experience a combination of reproductive, metabolic, and psychological comorbidities. A review by Cowan et al. published in <em>BMC Endocrine Disorders </em>provides an overview of the evidence to date on lifestyle strategies used to optimize management of PCOS.</p>
<p>Modifying protein, carbohydrate or fat quality or quantity seem to affect similarly the presentation of the syndrome. Vigorous aerobic exercise, however, which has been shown to improve body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and insulin resistance, seems to benefit women with PCOS. Also, psychological interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction, to support the specific mental health needs of women with PCOS warrant further investigation, while improving sleep quality might be critical for promoting healthy lifestyle changes and help reduce related symptoms. The authors of the review highlight, however, that while optimizing sleep and emotional wellbeing may aid symptom management, research exploring the efficacy of clinical interventions is lacking. The use of traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine approaches, including acupuncture and yoga, by women with PCOS has been growing fast; however, the research evidence is not sufficiently robust to support their integration into routine clinical practice.</p>
<p>The evidence presented in this review provides support for the idea that a holistic approach to lifestyle management is likely to be beneficial for managing PCOS symptoms.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13162 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/antenatal.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="148" />In a study published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em>, Cheng et al. aimed to evaluate the impact of the teach-back method on maternal health literacy, postpartum health behavior, and maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy.</p>
<p>In a randomized controlled trial, pregnant women with limited maternal health literacy were randomly assigned to either the control group, where they received routine education sessions, or the intervention group, where they received routine education sessions <em>as well as</em> the teach-back method. This method involves pregnant women being asked to use their own words to restate what they have just learned. The educator then assesses women’s understanding of the subject, identifies any misunderstandings, corrects mistakes, and provides additional information, if needed, until all women can correctly restate what they have learned.</p>
<p>The researchers observed that the teach-back method led to positive postpartum health behavior and improved postpartum maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy. In particular, women in the intervention group scored higher in terms of their knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy related to postpartum maternal-infant health, and also had significantly fewer postpartum complications compared to women in the control group.</p>
<p>Overall, the study provides support for the idea that the teach-back method can improve postpartum maternal-infant health among women with limited maternal health literacy. The authors suggest that this method could be potentially incorporated into education programs to improve health outcomes for this population.</p>

A study published in <em>BMC Medical Education</em> aimed to compare the effectiveness of using Virtual Reality versus role-playing methodology in teaching Basic Life Support skills.</p>
<p>Professionals working in healthcare facilities in Catalonia who were enrolled in Basic Life Support courses were randomly assigned to either the Virtual Reality group or the role-playing group. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare learning outcomes in the two groups. Secondary aims included evaluating satisfaction levels in the two groups with regard to the training provided, as well as analyzing the costs associated with each type of training.</p>
<p>No significant differences between the two groups were observed in terms of learning outcomes. However, participants in the VR group reported greater satisfaction with the training compared to those in the role-playing group. Also, the costs of using Virtual Reality proved to be slightly higher per student than the costs of using traditional training. However, as noted by the authors, if Virtual Reality training were to be extensively used, platform costs would possibly decrease and such differences would likely disappear.</p>
<p>In sum, Virtual Reality can be particularly useful for online training programs. However, further research is needed to explore its potential benefits for different professionals.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-13164 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/adolescents.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="66" />Longitudinal health studies investigating the transition from adolescence into early adulthood are critical for understanding developmental changes, and for providing insights as to how health behavior might change as a function of age. However, the success of such studies depends on participant recruitment and retention, which prove to be challenging factors when conducting research with adolescents. In a study published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em>, Jong et al. investigated adolescents’ perspectives regarding signing up and continued involvement in longitudinal health studies.</p>
<p>Forty-eight individuals from England between the ages of 15 and 20 years participated in nine in-person focus groups about recruitment and retention in research. The main reasons for signing up included joining with peer groups, being offered financial incentives, and receiving personalized feedback. Recruitment via social media with simple messages tailored to their needs, building trust and rapport with the research staff, and user-friendly and flexible data collection were further perceived as key factors to continued involvement.</p>
<p>The findings from this study highlight the importance of understanding adolescents’ interests and motivations behind study enrolment and dropout, and can help inform the development of effective strategies for recruiting and retaining adolescents in longitudinal health research.</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/mommy-brain-transforms-pregnancy">‘Mommy brain’ doesn’t capture how the brain transforms during pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pregnancy shrinks parts of the brain. That sounds bad. Throw in the forgetfulness and fogginess, or “momnesia,” that many moms report, and what’s left is the notion that for the brain, the transition to motherhood is a net loss.</p>



<p>“I see it on social media all the time,” says neuroscientist and therapist Jodi Pawluski of the University of Rennes in France. “Your brain shrunk. This is why [you] forget everything.”</p>



<p>But that’s just not true, Pawluski says. The perception that the maternal brain is dysfunctional has gone on long enough: It’s time to “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2801288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start giving the maternal brain the credit it deserves</a>,” Pawluski and her colleagues write February 6 in in <em>JAMA Neurology.</em></p>





<p>Pregnancy does kick-start structural changes in the brain, including a loss of gray matter. But the loss isn’t <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-brain-change-size-shape">automatically a bad thing</a> — reductions can reflect a fine-tuning process that makes the brain more efficient (<em>SN: 3/18/22</em>).</p>



<p>During the transition to motherhood, the brain reorganizes its connections, strengthening those that are useful and letting go of those that aren’t, Pawluski says. This reorganization prepares the brain “to learn rapidly to keep a baby alive,” she says.</p>



<p>In a 2016 study, for example, researchers reported brain changes, including reductions, that appear to <a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-linked-long-term-changes-moms-brain">foster attachment to a new baby</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/16</em>). Other work by this team found pregnancy-triggered decreases in the volume of the ventral striatum, a region involved in motivation and reward. Those reductions in mothers’ brains were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31757430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with a heightened responsiveness</a> toward their babies, the team reported in <em>Psychoneuroendocrinology</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>Still, many pregnant and postpartum women do report memory loss. Studies haven’t found large differences when testing memory for new moms compared with nonmothers, Pawluski says, but more research is needed to understand the mental load of parenthood — the impact of endless tasks and distractions.</p>



<p>A possible explanation for “momnesia” or “mommy brain” is that new mothers turn their attention toward baby and away from other things. Indeed, pregnant women, in contrast to never-pregnant women, demonstrated <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2021.2019280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a boost in learning about baby-related objects</a> as compared with adult-related items, researchers reported in <em>Memory</em> in 2022. Pregnant women also fared better with recalling relationships between objects and locations.</p>



<p>The changes in the maternal brain are akin to those seen during adolescence. A study of first-time mothers and female adolescents found that the reductions in volume in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6865685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal brain matched those seen in the teens</a>, researchers reported in <em>Human Brain Mapping</em> in 2019. “We accept adolescence as being a time of transition and a lot of neuroplasticity,” or the brain’s ability to change, Pawluski says. The shift to motherhood is just as impactful on the brain, she says.</p>





<p>Giving the maternal brain its due for its incredible adaptations does not mean that caregiving is a skill exclusive to those who give birth. While hormones trigger brain modifications during pregnancy, nonbirthing parents’ brains change with the experience of having a newborn. After the birth of their first child, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhac333/6691667?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new fathers’ brains showed a reduction in gray matter</a>, but childless men’s brains didn’t, researchers reported in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em> in 2022.</p>



<p>Changing misperceptions about the brain during the transition to motherhood “comes back to acknowledging the importance of caregiving,” Pawluski says, by all parents. “The ability for your brain to actually learn to keep a baby alive is a big deal.”</p>

              <h4><a href="//www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-impressionist-monet-painters">Air pollution made an impression on Monet and other 19th century painters</a></h4>

              
                <p>The 19th century landscape paintings hanging in London’s Tate Britain museum looked awfully familiar to climate physicist Anna Lea Albright. Artist Joseph Mallord William Turner&#8217;s signature way of shrouding his vistas in fog and smoke reminded Albright of her own research tracking air pollution.<br><br>“I started wondering if there was a connection,” says Albright, who had been visiting the museum on a day off from the Laboratory for Dynamical Meteorology in Paris. After all, Turner — a forerunner of the impressionist movement — was painting as Britain’s industrial revolution gathered steam, and a growing number of belching manufacturing plants earned London the nickname “The Big Smoke.”</p>



<p>Turner’s early works, such as his 1814 painting “Apullia in Search of Appullus,” were rendered in sharp details. Later works, like his celebrated 1844 painting “Rain, Steam and Speed — the Great Western Railway,” embraced a dreamier, fuzzier aesthetic.</p>





<p>Perhaps, Albright thought, this burgeoning painting style wasn’t a purely artistic phenomenon. Perhaps Turner and his successors painted exactly what they saw: their environs becoming more and more obscured by smokestack haze.</p>



<p>To find out how much realism there is in impressionism, Albright teamed up with Harvard University climatologist Peter Huybers, who’s an expert in reconstructing pollution before instruments existed to closely track air quality. Their analysis of nearly 130 paintings by Turner, Paris-based impressionist Claude Monet and several others tells a tale of two modernizing cities.</p>



<p>Low contrast and whiter hues are hallmarks of the impressionist style. They are also hallmarks of air pollution, which can affect how a distant scene looks to the naked eye. Tiny airborne particles, or aerosols, can absorb or scatter light. That makes the bright parts of objects appear dimmer while also shifting the entire scene’s color toward neutral white.</p>



<p>The artworks that Albright and Huybers investigated, which span from the late 1700s to the early 1900s, decrease in contrast as the 19th century progresses. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2219118120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That trend tracks with an increase in air pollution</a>, estimated from historical records of coal sales, Albright and Huybers report in the Feb. 7 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our results indicate that [19th century] paintings capture changes in the optical environment associated with increasingly polluted atmospheres during the industrial revolution,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>



<p>Albright and Huybers distinguished art from aerosol by first using a mathematical model to analyze the contrast and color of 60 paintings that Turner made between 1796 and 1850 as well as 38 Monet works from 1864 to 1901. They then compared the findings to sulfur dioxide emissions over the century, estimated from the trend in the annual amount of coal sold and burned in London and Paris. When sulfur dioxide reacts with molecules in the atmosphere, aerosols form.</p>

The decrease in contrast between the paintings tracks with increasing air pollution from the industrial revolution, researchers say.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122076">From left: Apullia in Search of Appullus vide Ovid, Joseph Mallord William Turner/The Tate Collection (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-NC-ND 3.0</a>); World History Archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As sulfur dioxide emissions increased over time, the amount of contrast in both Turner’s and Monet’s paintings decreased. However, paintings of Paris that Monet made from 1864 to 1872 have much higher contrast than Turner&#8217;s last paintings of London made two decades earlier.</p>



<p>The difference, Albright and Huybers say, can be attributed to the much slower start of the industrial revolution in France. Paris’ air pollution level around 1870 was about what London’s was when Turner started painting in the early 1800s. It confirms that the similar progression in their painting styles can&#8217;t be chalked up to coincidence, but is guided by air pollution, the pair conclude.</p>





<p>The researchers also analyzed the paintings’ visibility, or the distance at which an object can be clearly seen. Before 1830, the visibility in Turner&#8217;s paintings averaged about 25 kilometers, the team found. Paintings made after 1830 had an average visibility of about 10 kilometers. Paintings made by Monet in London around 1900, such as “Charing Cross Bridge,” have a visibility of less than five kilometers. That’s similar to estimates for modern-day megacities such as Delhi and Beijing, Albright and Huybers say.</p>



<p>To strengthen their argument, the researchers also analyzed 18 paintings from four other London- and Paris-based impressionists. Again, as outdoor air pollution increased over time, the contrast and visibility in the paintings decreased, the team found. What’s more, the decrease seen in French paintings lagged behind the decrease seen in British ones.</p>



<p>Overall, air pollution can explain about 61 percent of contrast differences between the paintings, the researchers calculate. In that respect, &#8220;different painters will paint in a similar way when the environment is similar,&#8221; Albright says. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to overstep and say: Oh, we can explain all of impressionism.&#8221;</p>
