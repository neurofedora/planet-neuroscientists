<p>A Cell Press journal quietly removed part of a funding statement from a paper related to gender-affirming hormone therapy that the authors say was included in error. Experts called the move “worrying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00941-6">the paper</a>, which appeared in <em>Cell Reports</em> on September 23, gave estrogen therapy to male monkeys to better understand how hormone therapies used in gender clinics might affect the immune system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research drew attention from several conservative news organizations, some of which called the project “<a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2025/08/shocking-exclusive-taxpayer-dollars-nih-used-create-transgender/">disturbing</a>” and alleged <a href="https://blog.whitecoatwaste.org/2025/08/29/wcw-investigation-nih-state-of-florida-fund-transgender-monkey-experiment/">the work cost millions of dollars</a> in National Institutes of Health funding.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133594"></span>



<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251006181331/https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00941-6">archived version of the paper</a> dated October 6 included a state-funded grant, which is no longer listed in the acknowledgement. The removed statement read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The study was further supported by a pilot award by the HIV/AIDS and Emerging Infectious Diseases Institute (HEIDI) at the University of Miami through the State of Florida Funding Initiative (M.A.M.) sponsored by the State of Florida, Department of Health (award contract #CODVD to M. Stevenson).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://wertheim.scripps.ufl.edu/profile/martins-mauricio/">Mauricio Martins</a> is a researcher at the Herbert Wertheim Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation and Technology at the University of Florida in Jupiter. Martins told Retraction Watch the statement was “inadvertently carried over from a different paper published around the same time” and that the Florida Department of Health grant supported another project unrelated to the <em>Cell Reports </em>paper.</p>



<p>When asked specifically whether the university or the state of Florida asked him to remove the statement, Martins replied they did not. “Once I realized that the HEIDI funding statement in the Cell Reports paper was incorrect, I asked the journal to correct it,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martins did not respond to our question asking which paper the funding statement originally belonged to. But <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1177/08892229251370763">another article</a> he coauthored in August in Mary Ann Liebert’s <em>AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses</em> <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08892229251380258">received a correction this month</a> to add the HEIDI grant to the funding statement. The article, reporting on an HIV-related immunological experiment in monkeys, shares three other coauthors with the <em>Cell Reports </em>paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://news.med.miami.edu/state-and-community-support-brings-heidi-closer-to-an-hiv-aids-cure/">HEIDI award</a> is a state-funded pilot grant given to research on HIV/AIDS at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine. The award’s <a href="https://med.miami.edu/centers-and-institutes/hiv-aids-institute/research/pilot-awards">website</a> no longer lists previous recipients of the grant, but according to an archived version of the website, Martins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250829135920/https://med.miami.edu/centers-and-institutes/hiv-aids-institute/research/pilot-awards">received the grant</a> in the 2022-2023, 2021-2022 and 2017-2018 award cycles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEIDI director <a href="https://med.miami.edu/faculty/mario-stevenson-phd">Mario Stevenson</a>, who was named in the now-removed text, did not respond to a request for comment on whether he was aware of the paper or asked that the funding statement be removed. (He is not a coauthor on the <em>Cell Reports</em> study.) The Florida Department of Health also did not respond to questions on whether they were aware of the study or the funding statement.</p>



<p>When we asked why <em>Cell Reports</em>, owned by Elsevier, did not issue a correction to the article to signal the change, Shawnna Buttery, the editor-in-chief, told us their policy “considers grant and funder details to be non-scientific content of great importance to authors and their funders but not of interest to our readers, and our policy is to make such changes without requiring a Correction notice.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=62124">Mohammad Hosseini</a>, who teaches research ethics at Northwestern University in Chicago, disagreed with that assessment. “If, as they say, the funding statement was only useful for the authors and funders, then there would be no reason to disclose funding information,” he told us. “I believe that the change warranted a correction and cannot really get my head around why the journal or the publisher decided against it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-grey">Andrew Grey</a> at the University of Auckland, who has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/04/how-many-ducks-do-you-need-to-line-up-to-get-a-publication-retracted/">previously written for Retraction Watch</a>, called Buttery’s statement “worrying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The authors made an error, which has been corrected. Readers should be made aware of the correction. It’s a straightforward matter to do so,” Grey said.</p>



<p>Funding disclosures are “pretty central to research integrity in a publication,” <a href="https://www.lisamrasmussen.com/">Lisa Rasmussen</a>, the editor-in-chief of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/gacr20"><em>Accountability in Research</em></a>, told us. “If funding declarations can be made to disappear after publication with no record, it&#8217;s easy to imagine how this could go wrong given particular political or other pressures.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Journals have been called out before for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/12/stealth-corrections-when-journals-quietly-fix-papers/">making changes without noting them</a> in a correction. Last year, a team of researchers found <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/leap.1660">131 articles with what they called “stealth corrections,”</a> changes to author information, figures or data, editorial process records, or other alterations — including to funding statements.</p>

<p>A journal that last year corrected a paper claiming to show a homeopathic intervention improved quality of life and survival for people with advanced lung cancer has now retracted the article after the Committee on Publication Ethics got involved in the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extensive correction and an accompanying editorial, published in September 2024 in <em>The Oncologist</em>, came two years after the Austrian Agency for Scientific Integrity asked the journal to retract the article due to concerns about manipulated data, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/26/homeopathy-for-cancer-paper-extensively-corrected-after-watchdog-agency-requested-retraction/">we reported at the time</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article/30/11/oyaf364/8340391">notice</a>, published November 24, acknowledged the watchdog agency’s retraction request. It also noted the previous corrections and expression of concern for the article, which <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13548">originally appeared</a> in October 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133585"></span>



<p>“Subsequent to the two corrections, concerns have continued to be raised about the study,” the notice states. “In light of this continued uncertainty and the issues previously covered in the corrections, the journal no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions reported in the article and has decided to retract.”</p>



<p>Susan Bates, the journal’s editor-in-chief, told Retraction Watch she had no “further detail to provide” beyond what the retraction notice provides. As the journal changed publishers after the article first appeared, the <a href="https://theoncologist.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/onco.13548">version</a> on the original publisher’s website remains unmarked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Concerns about the study go back to shortly after the article was published. <a href="https://netzwerk-homoeopathie.info/en/dr-norbert-aust/">Norbert Aust</a>, a retired mechanical engineer who started the Homeopathy Information Network in Germany, and Viktor Weisshäupl, a retired anesthesiologist now working on the <a href="http://www.initiative-wissenschaftliche-medizin.at/">Initiative for Scientific Medicine</a> in Austria, first raised concerns in 2021 about how the study was conducted and reported, which led to the official investigation. They told us a formal complaint to COPE — submitted last November and signed by Harald Sitte, a pharmacologist at the Medical University of Vienna — was “the turning point” in getting the journal to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, COPE directed <em>The Oncologist </em>to engage with the Austrian Agency for Scientific Integrity and the Medical University of Vienna, where the lead author of the homeopathy study was affiliated. “This marked the first instance in which the journal demonstrated a willingness to participate in a professional dialogue with its critics,” Aust, Weisshäupl, and Sitte told us in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Aust-Weisshaupl-and-Sitte-joint-statement-to-Retraction-Watch.pdf">a joint statement</a>. Representatives of the journal, the university, and the watchdog agency held a video conference in June, the three critics said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following that meeting, Bates emailed <a href="https://www.ordination-frass.at/en/about-me">Michael Frass</a>, the lead author of the paper, a homeopathic practitioner who was working at the Medical University of Vienna, at the time the work was published. In the email dated July 29, which Frass shared with us and <a href="https://www.ordination-frass.at/schwerpunkte/homoeopathie-bei-krebs">described on his website</a>, Bates said the meeting had raised three questions for her, which she asked Frass to respond to by August 1. If he did not respond in time or could not “provide satisfactory explanations,” she wrote, “I now feel I will need to retract the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bates asked Frass to address whether the randomized controlled trial included any participants who were originally enrolled in his single-arm study and to disclose the specific homeopathic compounds used in the study, along with their potencies and dosing regimens. Bates also wanted to know if Frass was recommending or prescribing the same compounds to patients in his private practice at the time the journal published the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frass told Bates the randomized controlled trial did not include any participants who were originally enrolled in the single-arm trial, but also told us he did not understand what she meant, “as I always compare 2 groups as a clinician.”</p>



<p>In his response, Frass directed Bates to two tables in the paper for the homeopathic products used and their potencies. He also wrote, “It would go beyond the scope of this article if I were to list all the compounds of the medicines used.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for his private practice at the time the article was published, “of course” he was recommending and prescribing the same compounds to his patients, Frass wrote to Bates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bates did not respond, Frass said. On October 24, he received an email informing him of the decision to retract the paper, with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DRAFT-TheOncologist-Frass-et-al-DRAFT-retraction-notice_Oct-2025.docx.pdf">a draft notice</a>.</p>



<p>The draft notice included two specific reasons for retracting the article that weren’t in the final notice. First, because the homeopathic regimens were tailored to each patient and the paper did not report changes in dosing or potency made throughout the trial, the study’s findings would be “difficult to reproduce.” Second, the draft notice stated, Frass should have disclosed his homeopathic practice as a conflict of interest, as “the same homeopathic medicinal products were being marketed and prescribed” in his clinic during the trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a response, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Frass-Response-to-the-Decision-to-Retract-2025.10.24.docx.pdf">Frass argued</a> the trial, like others of homeopathy, was designed to assess “the technique itself, not efficacy of the individual medicines.” He maintained a trained homeopathic practitioner could replicate the study with the information provided. “Given that our study has replicated an existing prescribing technique, the argument that it could not be replicated again simply does not hold,” he wrote.</p>



<p>The point regarding his practice as an undisclosed conflict of interest was “unexpected” and “deeply confusing,” Frass wrote to the journal. “No marketing of medicines occurred and there was no conflict of interest of any kind.” Neither he nor any of his coauthors received any funding from the pharmacy that supplied the homeopathic preparations, he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement of disagreement with the retraction he also submitted, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Frass-Statement-of-Disagreement-2025.10.24.docx.pdf">Frass maintained</a> “the study was conducted ethically and rigorously, and the data presented are valid and accurately reported as already confirmed before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are surprised that a second attack was possible after the validity of the data had been confirmed” in the journal’s previous investigation, Frass told us. “In court proceedings, the following applies: if a defendant has been acquitted, the case cannot be reopened.” </p>



<p>Frass and eight other authors disagreed with the retraction, according to the notice. One author agreed, and the remaining five did not comment, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The retraction published in November “is a long-overdue and necessary step to uphold the integrity of scientific literature,” Aust, Weisshäupl, and Sitte said in their statement. Even still, they called the case “a textbook example of how journals should not deal with criticism from readers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2021, Aust, Weisshäupl, and clinical oncologist Jutta Hübner of Jena University Hospital in Germany submitted a <a href="https://www.initiative-wissenschaftliche-medizin.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Frass_NSCLC/LttE_Frass_Final.pdf">letter to the editor</a> of <em>The Oncologist </em>detailing “some serious concerns that the results are a product of strong biases arising from modifications of the study parameters.” The journal never published the letter or responded to the concerns in it, according to the critics’ statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last September, the journal invited Sitte to submit a commentary on the matter, which he did in January. The journal sent it out for review but never shared the reviews with Sitte, the critics said. On December 4, the journal rejected the commentary “since the paper has already been retracted,” Weisshäupl told us. He was “not surprised at all” by the journal’s decision, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even the corrections didn’t really address the issues the Austrian Agency for Scientific Integrity or the critics raised, their statement to us said. “We got the impression that the journal simply published the lead author&#8217;s explanations uncritically.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The Oncologist</em>, a publication of the Society for Translational Oncology, switched publishers from Wiley to Oxford University Press in January 2022, after Frass’ article and its first correction were published. The subsequent expression of concern, correction, linked editorial and retraction notices have not been added to Wiley’s <a href="https://theoncologist.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/onco.13548">original webpage</a> for the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/11/a-journal-switches-to-a-new-publisher-then-corrects-a-paper-what-should-happen-to-the-old-version/">previously asked Wiley</a> if the publisher would update the page, a spokesperson for the publisher said their current policy for journals that had moved to another publisher was to “rely on the current publisher to carry any post-publication amendments,” but the company was planning to review the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the retraction, we again asked Wiley about updating the original page. A spokesperson said the company now follows <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-45-2024-crec">best practices</a> from the National Information Standards Organisation, which recommend a journal’s current publisher work with its previous publisher to clearly label the article’s status, “especially in instances where the content may be published on both the previous and new publisher sites.” (Disclosure: Our Ivan Oransky was on the working group for those guidelines.)</p>



<p>Wiley received an update about the article from Oxford University Press on December 1, the spokesperson said, and would take action. At the time of posting, Wiley’s version of the article did not include the retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arXiv Mathematics section</span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement-math.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has updated its endorsement policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of December 10th, 2025, the arXiv Mathematics section will no longer accept institutional email addresses (i.e., an email address associated with an academic or research institution) as the sole qualifier for an automatic endorsement for new authors. This policy update is being made to support the arXiv community (authors, readers, volunteer moderators, and staff) by stemming the flood of low-quality, non-scientific submissions to the arXiv Math section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv was built for scientists, by scientists. Our mission has always been to advance science by providing a place for the scientific community to freely and quickly share and discover valuable and relevant scientific research. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv authors are expected to be scientists with expertise in their field and endorsement has been required from the early days of arXiv. The arXiv endorsement process ensures a sustainable and fair way for scientists to help arXiv determine who is a member of good standing in the scientific community by vouching for the scientific work of first-time submitters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past most arXiv sections, including Math, auto-endorsed first-time submitters with affiliation to an academic or research institute. arXiv felt this was a fair way to allow new researchers to submit to arXiv while still preserving the corpus and maintaining a standard of scientific integrity. However, over the past years, arXiv has received an unsustainable increase in the number of non-scientific submissions from automatically endorsed users, increasing the rejection rate and requiring excessive moderation and staff effort. Because of this, we have determined that email addresses associated with academic or research institutions are no longer a sufficient credential for determining minimum research competence. As a result, automatic endorsements will no longer be based solely on an author’s institutional email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic endorsement for new submitters in all Math categories will now require both 1) an email address from an academic/research institution, and 2) previous authorship on an existing paper which has been accepted to the arXiv Mathematics section (see </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper ownership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). New submitters who cannot meet these requirements will no longer be automatically endorsed, but can still </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html#who-can-endorse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtain a personal endorsement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly from an established arXiv author in the same research area.</span></p>
<p><b>What does this update mean for authors in the arXiv Mathematics section?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Auto-endorsement” is practically invisible to most arXiv authors, so this policy update may seem confusing. In the past, when an arXiv author with an institutional affiliation submitted a manuscript for the first time to the Mathematics section on arXiv, the system would allow them to pass through the submission process automatically, with no mention of endorsement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most arXiv authors submitting to arXiv Math categories will not notice a change at all. All authors who are already endorsed to submit to a Math category will continue to be endorsed as long as they remain in good standing and do not violate the arXiv code of conduct. This policy update will mostly affect new submitters— arXiv authors who are submitting for the first time to a category in arXiv’s Mathematics section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters to a Math category will need to pursue one of the following paths for endorsement before they can submit:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters who have an institutional email and are a co-author of a paper in an arXiv Math category and have already claimed ownership of that paper may be auto-endorsed and able to submit papers without further action.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters who have an institutional email and no claimed papers but are co-authors of other papers accepted to an arXiv Math category must </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim ownership of their papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After successfully claiming ownership on their previous papers, they may be auto-endorsed and able to submit papers without further action.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters who </span><b>do not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have an institutional email and no claimed papers, but are co-authors of other papers accepted to an arXiv Math category should </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim ownership of all their papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If still unable to submit, these users must pursue personal endorsement (see next bullet).
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters who are not co-authors on any previous papers on arXiv Mathematics must be personally endorsed to submit to any arXiv Math category, </span><b>whether they have an institutional email affiliation or not.</b> <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our help pages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go into detail on how to get personally endorsed by an advisor, colleague, or arXiv author with endorsement privileges. arXiv staff are not able to personally endorse arXiv authors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This policy update only applies to arXiv Mathematics, and</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the Math categories contained in the section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please note, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/list/math-ph/recent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mathematical Physics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (math-ph) is a sub-section of Physics and will follow endorsement rules for Physics. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each category of arXiv has different moderators, who are subject matter experts with a terminal degree in their particular subject, to best serve the scholarly pursuits, goals, and standards of their category. While this policy update is currently only being implemented for the arXiv Mathematics section, other arXiv sections may wish to update their endorsement policies in the future. We will make these updates public if and when they do occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to our scientific community for supporting us in this policy update. We rely on you to help us keep arXiv open and free, and to help us make sure submissions to arXiv are scientifically rigorous and of interest to the community.</span></p>

<p>The head of a nuclear physics institute in Kazakhstan now has 21 retractions to his name — most of them logged in the past year — following dozens of his papers being flagged on PubPeer for data reuse and images showing suspiciously similar patterns of background noise, suggesting manipulation.</p>



<p>Maxim Zdorovets, director of the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Astana, has written or coauthored <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36055537300">480 papers indexed on Scopus</a>, and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/13/4/55">one analysis</a> puts him as the third most cited researcher in Kazakhstan. His prolific publication record <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2025/01/03/schneider-shorts-3-01-2025-a-flagship-of-science-on-the-entire-continent-and-in-the-whole-world/#zdorovets">has been linked</a> to Russian paper mills, though those claims are unverified. Zdorovets has defended his work in a series of online posts, arguing the imaging similarities come from technical issues and that his own analyses prove image manipulation did not occur. He did not respond to Retraction Watch’s request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest retraction for Zdorovets <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063774525050013">came last month</a> when <em>Crystallography Reports </em>retracted a study containing electron microscope images “highly similar” to those published a year earlier in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1023193525060011">now-retracted paper</a> in the <em>Russian Journal of Electrochemistry</em> by a similar group of authors. Both papers also included images that closely resemble ones Zdorovets and his colleagues presented <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/NAP.2017.8190333">at a nanomaterials conference</a> in Ukraine in 2017. In each instance, the images were meant to be showing different materials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to many of the retraction notices, Zdorovets&#8217; papers have noise in the data that appears unusually similar across several figures. In 2023, a PubPeer commenter who <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/95FE7942B21B21CE136F4C845ED8BB">pointed out suspicious patterns</a> in a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/aa92f2">2017<em> Materials Research Express </em>paper</a> triggered a lengthy exchange with IOP Publishing, the journal’s publisher, which conducted three separate investigations into the paper. Initially, IOP said their subject-matter expert consultant found no sign of “intentional alteration,” and the company decided to take no action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenters pushed back, and in June 2024, the publisher sought opinions from three more experts, one whom they described as an “absolute expert in this area.” The experts concluded the raw data submitted by the authors showed “distinct backgrounds.” The publisher again decided not to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2024, Maarten Van Kampen, a data sleuth in the Netherlands, weighed in on the PubPeer thread, agreeing that the background noise looked identical and also pointing out similarities between data in the 2017 paper and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0020168524010011">another since-retracted paper</a> by a similar group of authors, including Zdorovets, in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, this June, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/95FE7942B21B21CE136F4C845ED8BB#11">IOP Publishing acknowledged</a> that their experts had “failed to compare the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Raw_data_for_the_article_Radiation_modification_of_Ni_nanotubes_by_electrons_/28720913/1">raw data provided by the authors</a> with the published data,” despite earlier claims to the contrary. The journal <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/addf2c">retracted the article</a> for containing identical background noise in the X-ray diffractions, which they said “can be indicative of image manipulation.” They also noted the raw data the authors provided didn’t match the paper’s data, meaning they could find “no evidence of the experiments being undertaken.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked about the investigations, Kim Eggleton, IOP Publishing’s head of peer review and research integrity, said the first set of experts had been given raw data in a different file format than the later group of experts. The newer group also included a specialist in X-ray diffraction and two of the PubPeer commenters who first raised concerns. They had requested the specific format “so they could assess the concerns in greater depth,” she said.</p>



<p>In August this year, the paper’s second author, Marat Kaikanov, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/95FE7942B21B21CE136F4C845ED8BB#13">posted</a> in the PubPeer thread that he hoped his colleagues responsible for the X-ray measurements would “be able to confirm the accuracy” of the results. Kaikanov told us he couldn’t evaluate the flagged data firsthand because those experiments were outside his area of responsibility, but said his own contribution “was completed diligently and in full.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While he didn’t weigh in on that PubPeer exchange, Zdorovets has engaged with some other criticisms on the platform, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A%28%28Maxim+OR+M+OR+MM+OR+MV%29+Zdorovets%29">where 85 papers he coauthored are flagged</a>. In one detailed response, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/53E85E814103A3C40F59D68C8CBD2A#5">he dismissed an allegation</a> the background noise in X-ray diffraction images were duplicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were puzzled by such an unexpected question,” he wrote, “since there is no and cannot be any reasonable sense to somehow artificially change the background on the spectra mentioned in the question.” In his comments on PubPeer, he says he analyzed both spectra and “can firmly say that they are not duplicated in any part,” though he acknowledged a “high degree of similarity” in the backgrounds. His explanation is that the samples were so thin that the instrument recorded signals from the table beneath them, resulting in the resemblances — a claim which Van Kampen, the Dutch data sleuth, calls “unhinged.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As sleuths we get gray hair from these arguments,” Van Kampen told Retraction Watch, adding that persistent denial helps delay or even prevent retractions. He referred to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/04/cosig-sleuths-publish-toolkit-post-publication-review/">a COSIG guide</a> <a href="https://osf.io/2kdez/files/685xa">that states</a>, “No matter what, no two XRD patterns will feature the same noise pattern, even if they are collected from the same sample on the same instrument with the same settings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2018 paper, published in <em>Journal of Nanoparticle Research, </em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11051-018-4346-8">was retracted</a> in December 2024 because of seemingly identical background noise in two figures. When the journal asked the authors for the original data, they found what was provided “differs substantially” from what had been published, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/53E85E814103A3C40F59D68C8CBD2A#10">comments made</a> after the retraction, Zdorovets expressed frustration over a lack of “scientifically-grounded counter arguments” and called the accusations “unfounded.” He said he had provided the original data to the journal and said there was “no conflict” between the submitted files and the figures in the article. “We strongly disagree with the decision to retract,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zdorovets has defended his work in reports he posted on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maxim-Zdorovets">his personal ResearchGate, including </a>what he says is a mathematical analysis of the data in three retracted papers showing no duplications. His coauthors have argued that <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1BBF0500CEE747B1738C9838F2B944">similarities come from</a> reduced image quality and say critics misunderstood <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/81B9BA737237E0C6AD77E20B83E3D3">how X-ray diffraction data</a> were processed, claiming similarities arose from how the figures were viewed or plotted. </p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WsPCVtq9U67chAnzYI3qOHJvaaksXy1WvEkThpfSA8w/edit?usp=sharing">In a statement to Retraction Watch</a>, a researcher who has collaborated with Zdorovets and wished to remain anonymous said ”neither I nor the authors of these papers, including Prof. Zdorovets, performed XRD measurements personally,” and that the measurements came from a specialist at the institute whose data they had no reason to doubt. They suggested post-processing procedures such as smoothing, background correction and normalization might explain the observations. They said all the X-ray diffraction data now undergo internal verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The collaborator said the group felt “deliberately targeted” on PubPeer since “so-called ‘reviewers’ on PubPeer presuppose our guilt in advance.”</p>



<p>The research group remains open to constructive dialogue, the collaborator wrote, and maintains the observed problems are ones of method, not falsification, problems which “could and should have been resolved through correction rather than full retraction.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While background noise duplication is the most frequent issue raised around Zdorovets’ work, seven of the retraction notices also refer to data being reused across several papers that allegedly report on different materials and experiments. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272884218319783">One 2018 paper</a>, published in <em>Ceramics International,</em> is a complete duplication of another paper <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/aac7ba">published</a> in <em>Materials Research Express</em> a few months earlier by a similar group of authors. The editor called the duplication a “misuse of the scientific publishing system.” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838825021930">A 2019 paper</a> in <em>Journal of Alloys and Compounds,</em> duplicates data and tables published <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/15/20/1590">two months earlier</a> in <em>Nanomaterials</em>. That earlier paper, now also retracted, used images published another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0042207X19302830">month earlier</a> in <em>Vacuum.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In 2023, Zdorovets <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/en-gb/promotions/scopus-awards-kazakhstan-2023">won a Scopus prize</a> supported by Elsevier and the government of Kazakhstan to recognize leading Kazakh researchers. He was also <a href="https://enu.kz/en/news/2561">recently elected</a> to the National Academy of Sciences of Kazakhstan.&nbsp;</p>
