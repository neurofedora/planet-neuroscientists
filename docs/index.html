<p>A university dean is <a href="https://www.dnevnik.bg/obrazovanie/2025/02/25/4747574_dekanut_v_sofiiskiia_universitet_milen_zamfirov_e/">being investigated</a> for plagiarism <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/10/dean-in-bulgaria-accused-of-plagiarism/">following our coverage</a> of accusations against him, a Bulgarian newspaper reported last month.</p>



<p>The Academic Ethics Commission in Bulgaria has launched an investigation into <a href="https://scholar.google.bg/citations?user=TpJ45YkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Milen Zamfirov</a>, dean of the faculty of educational sciences at Sofia University, <em>Dnevnik</em> reported February 25.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The accusations concern a 2021 paper he wrote with his colleague Margarita Bakracheva, “<a href="https://fnoi.uni-sofia.bg/EN/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4.-MARGARITA-BAKRACHEVA.pdf">In Search of Integrativity of Sciences: the Principle of Supplementarity in the Story of Pauli and Jung</a>.” As we reported in December 2024, the paper “seems to have significant overlap” with other sources.</p>



<span id="more-131310"></span>



<p>Bakracheva told us at the time the literature was “correctly referenced” at the end of each paragraph; however, experts we spoke to did not agree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.dnevnik.bg/obrazovanie/2025/02/25/4747574_dekanut_v_sofiiskiia_universitet_milen_zamfirov_e/"><em>Dnevnik</em></a> asked the Ministry of Education and Science about our post, the Ministry said they were looking into the researcher’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a January 28 email, Zamfirov requested an “official plagiarism report” from us.</p>



<p>Iliana Mirtscheva, editor-in-chief of the <a href="https://www.ceeol.com/search/journal-detail?id=3073">journal that published the paper</a>, reiterated this request. In her email, dated February 9, Mirtscheva requested “documents on which you base your claims.” (Prior to publishing our December story, a PDF of the allegations was included in an email to the coauthors.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, Zamfirov received a <a href="https://www.bta.bg/en/news/bulgaria/672653-pythagoras-science-awards-presented-in-sofia">Pythagoras Science Award</a>, honoring him as an “Experienced Scientist in Social Sciences and the Humanities.”</p>

<p>A journal has retracted five papers about the appearance, sexual behavior and attractiveness of women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nicolas Guéguen, a professor of marketing at the Université de Bretagne-Sud in France, was an author on each of the papers, published in the Sage journal <em>Perceptual and Motor Skills (PMS)</em> at least 15 years ago<em>. </em>All of the articles garnered <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/28/bust-size-and-hitchhiking-author-earns-five-expressions-of-concern/">expressions of concern in 2023</a>, but Guéguen’s history of misconduct long precedes the <em>PMS</em> papers. </p>



<p>Sleuths have been flagging Guéguen’s work for years for seemingly <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/09/after-18-months-and-recommended-retractions-no-movement-in-psychology-case/">impossible results</a>. In 2019, he was cleared of wrongdoing by his university, but since then has racked up at least four retractions, according to the <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dGueguen%252c%2bNicolas">Retraction Watch database</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131169"></span>



<p>In 2020, his study claiming men who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/09/heard-about-the-study-claiming-men-who-carry-guitar-cases-are-more-attractive-its-been-retracted/">carried guitar cases</a> were more attractive was retracted. He also lost a paper in 2022 regarding the “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=nicolas+gueguen">sexual intent</a>” of women wearing red. In April 2024, he received four more <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/01/exclusive-bust-size-and-hitchhiking-author-to-earn-four-more-expressions-of-concern/">expressions of concern</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The studies retracted February 25 are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.105.4.1294-1298">Bust Size and Hitchhiking: A Field Study</a> (published 2007, cited 13 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science)</li>



<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.109.3.941-948">Hitchhiking Women’s Hair Color</a> (2009, cited 12 times)</li>



<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.104.2.581-588">Touch, Compliance, and Awareness of Tactile Contact</a> (2007, cited 37 times)</li>



<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.2002.95.2.355">Touch, Awareness of Touch, and Compliance with a Request</a> (2002, cited 43 times)</li>



<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.106.1.63-66">Women’s Eye Contact and Men’s Later Interest: Two Field Experiments</a> (2008, cited 1 time)</li>
</ol>



<p>Five of the citations to “Touch, Compliance, and Awareness of Tactile Contact” came after the journal issued its expression of concern. The citations for the rest of the papers all came before the notices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00315125241311636">retraction notice</a> cites work by critics such as researchers Nick Brown and James Heathers, who published a <a href="https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2017/12/a-review-of-research-of-dr-nicolas.html">report</a> of 10 Guéguen studies in 2017. The notice, signed by the editor-in-chief and assistant editor of the journal, refers to implausible research methods, lack of ethics approval and informed consent, and “implausible” or “incorrectly analyzed” data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Editors also listed “antiquated reference lists” as a reason for retraction, noting cited works predated the publications by an average of 10 to 20 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brown told us in an email he is “very pleased” with the retractions. “It is clearly implausible that any of these studies could have been carried out as described, and this problem affects dozens of Guéguen&#8217;s papers, perhaps even a hundred or more,” Brown said.</p>



<p>He did take issue with &#8220;antiquated reference lists&#8221; as a reason for retraction. “Perhaps the reviewers ought to have picked that up when the article was published,” he said. “But then perhaps they, or the editors at the time, ought also to have picked up on the implausible methods, lack of ethical approval, and erroneous statistics, all of which are right there in plain sight in the text of the articles.”</p>



<p>Neither the journal editors nor Guéguen responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson from Sage responded to us by restating the retraction notice, and told us they have been unable to reach the authors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amid efforts by the Trump administration to “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/memo-to-press-hundreds-of-dollars-are-fraudulently-spent-every-year/">put an end to fraudulent and wasteful spending</a>” and “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reduces-the-federal-bureaucracy/">enhance</a>” accountability, two key offices charged with investigating fraud and holding scientists and institutions accountable for federal spending have seen top leadership depart.</p>



<p>At the National Science Foundation’s Office of Inspector General (OIG), the changes start at the top: Inspector General <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250222122225/https://oig.nsf.gov/about/leadership/inspector-general">Allison Lerner</a> is departing, and Megan Wallace, currently assistant inspector general for investigations at NSF, will become the acting inspector general, effective March 1.</p>



<p>Deputy Inspector General Ken Chason is also departing. The acting deputy will be Catherine DelPrete, who is NSF’s general counsel to NSF’s inspector general, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-delprete-aa63a4b5/">her LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>



<p>The changes were confirmed by Nadine Lymn, communications director of the National Science Board, which appoints and supervises NSF’s inspector general.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Retraction Watch has learned that most — if not all — research investigators at the National Science Foundation’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) will also be leaving their jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the departures, at the OIG and the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), are voluntary, while others were part of the mass government firings carried out earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They leave concerning reductions in personnel at both offices, which serve an integral role when it comes to ensuring the integrity of how government funding is spent, said Paul J. Coleman, a consultant who worked for NSF’s OIG for more than 20 years, hired as its first investigator shortly after OIG was created in 1988. “Without having people do oversight, we&#8217;re hurting ourselves, we&#8217;re hurting our own society,” Coleman said.</p>



<p>Aliza Sacknovitz, the deputy director of research integrity and administrative investigations, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sacknovitz-aliza-7257198b_professional-update-part-1-being-a-fed-activity-7299574339945791488-Lurl">announced on LinkedIn</a> that she would be leaving her position as of February 28. Sacknovitz did not reply to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Dwayne Meadows, an investigative scientist in the division, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7295183393053372416/">posted on LinkedIn</a> that he opted to take the deferred resignation buyout offered to all federal employees earlier this year. Meadows declined to comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lisa Vonder Haar, NSF OIG’s chief of staff, would not confirm these or other departures, citing Privacy Act concerns. She added, “Regardless of staff departures, we will continue to provide independent oversight of the U.S. National Science Foundation to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and economy of its programs and operations and to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse.”</p>



<p>The departures will likely leave the OIG’s open research investigations in flux.</p>



<p>Last week, NSF fired about 10 percent of its staff, or 168 employees, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/inside-national-science-foundation-firings-00204763"><em>Politico</em> reported February 20</a>. The move was “the first of many forthcoming workforce reductions,”&nbsp; Micah Cheatham, NSF’s chief management officer, told staffers in a February 18 meeting at the agency, according to a transcript of the meeting obtained by <em>Politico’s E&amp;E News</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://oig.nsf.gov/about/office">mission</a> of NSF’s OIG is “to provide independent oversight of the U.S. National Science Foundation to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and economy of its programs and operations and to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse.” Most recently, <a href="https://oig.nsf.gov/reports/audit/performance-audit-subaward-costs-northeastern-university">an audit of $12.1 million in costs incurred</a> on 20 NSF grants to Northeastern University found evidence of mismanagement, leading the institution to agree to repay more than $600,000, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/02/18/northeastern-will-pay-back-600000-nsf">Inside Higher Ed reported</a> February 18. Other investigations into potential misconduct have led to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/01/08/science-retracting-paper-by-chemists-cut-off-from-nsf-funding/">retractions</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/09/02/nsf-investigation-of-high-profile-plant-retractions-ends-in-two-debarments/">debarment from NSF funding</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">There have also been some notable changes at ORI, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A comparison of ORI’s <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/ori-staff">current staff page</a> with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250213232057/https://ori.hhs.gov/ori-staff">February 13 archive version</a> reveals two key changes.</p>



<p>Ning Du had been acting director of ORI’s Division of Investigative Oversight since October, according to <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/blog/dr-alexander-runko-selected-be-nih-program-officer-%E2%80%93-congratulations-alex">an announcement</a> on the ORI website, and had been with the agency since 2018, according to her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ning-d-5a3b6498/">LinkedIn profile</a>. She is no longer listed among the ORI staff.</p>



<p>Joya Patel, previously listed as ORI’s communications and external engagement director, is also missing from the current staff listing; she confirmed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joya-patel_over-the-weekend-i-was-one-of-the-many-federal-activity-7297041374690828288-wPvc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAByWXIBtsn0tXWeQa9YSfv4kSeHd4MCfrg">in a LinkedIn post</a> she was one of <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/02/governmentwide-firings-devastating-to-probationary-federal-employees/">thousands of federal employees</a> fired in mid-February.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Patel and Du declined to comment.</p>



<p>With a staff of just around two dozen, ORI <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn9352">oversees research integrity and misconduct</a> for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and several other HHS agencies. The Division of Investigative Oversight — now down to six scientist-investigators — reviews institutional inquiries and investigates possible research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI has had a fair amount of turnover, particularly in its leadership. In 2017, its director <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/20/director-u-s-hhs-office-research-integrity-temporarily-removed-post/">Kathy Partin was removed</a> from her post after <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/director-hhs-scientific-fraud-office-out-after-stormy-2-year-tenure">clashes with ORI staff</a> and those at other agencies. During her tenure, Susan Garfinkel, then-director of the Division of Investigative Oversight, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/10/16/division-director-leaving-u-s-research-watchdog-nearly-15-years/">left her post</a> for a position at Ohio State. In January, Garfinkel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/susan-garfinkel-27b249160_i-am-happy-to-announce-that-i-have-accepted-activity-7285651328867938304-4duf/">announced she was returning to ORI</a> as a senior adviser to the director. She told us by email that she currently retains this role, &#8220;but the future is unknown at this time.&#8221; </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Regardless of whether their departure was imposed or voluntary, several federal employees expressed pride in their time as a federal servant. “I leave the office immensely proud of the important work our little but mighty team that investigated research misconduct accomplished. We did good,” Sacknovitz wrote on LinkedIn.</p>



<p>A former government employee who asked to remain anonymous also expressed gratitude for the opportunities the job offered. “I&#8217;m thankful for the colleagues that remain, and I know that they have science’s best interest at heart and researchers&#8217; best interest at heart,” the former employee said. “In my heart, I&#8217;m hoping that they actually get to do their job.”</p>



<p>But it’s not these agencies that will feel the biggest impact of the departures, Coleman said. “It&#8217;s going to be the scientific community. Most people who work at universities want to do the right thing and do the right thing, but there are bad actors,” he said. “If you don&#8217;t have people overseeing that area, then some of them might be able to avoid the consequences of their actions.”</p>



<p><em>This story was updated on Feb. 28, 2025 to include Lerner and Chason’s departure and comment from Garfinkel.</em><br></p>

<p>A journal has retracted three papers after an investigation revealed one of the authors falsely claimed he was affiliated with the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>



<p>All <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479725004335">three</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479725004293">retraction</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147972500430X">notices</a>, issued February 13 by the <em>Journal of Environmental Management</em>,&nbsp; state study coauthor <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7487-5489">Tariq Shah</a> claimed affiliation with the USDA Plant Science Research Unit. “When asked about these issues during an editorial investigation, Shah’s responses caused the editor to further lose confidence in the validity/integrity of the article,” the notices say.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes the journal, told us in an email “Shah provided a document claiming to show his official affiliation with USDA that we later learned through our investigation was forged.” Neither Shah nor Elsevier clarified what the document was.</p>



<span id="more-131152"></span>



<p>A USDA spokesperson confirmed in an email to Retraction Watch “there are no identified records that Tariq Shah was ever employed by the USDA or the Agricultural Research Service,” noting the papers were “falsely attributed” to the USDA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One paper, published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723021655">October 2023, </a>has been cited eight times; a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723024040">December 2023</a> paper has been cited 12 times; and one from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479724006595">March 2024</a> has been cited four times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Shah, whose <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=58244535800">Scopus profile</a> lists him as a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing, told us his listed affiliation with the USDA was an “unintentional mistake.” Shah was a visiting scholar for six months in 2022 at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in the lab of Manuel Kleiner, as confirmed in a <a href="https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/news/department-of-plant-and-microbial-biology-newsletter-fall-2022/">newsletter</a> sent out by the university and Kleiner’s <a href="https://kleinerlab.cals.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2022/08/20220828_CV_ManuelKleiner_ForWebsite.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>. The lab is funded by the USDA, according to <a href="https://kleinerlab.cals.ncsu.edu/">their website</a>.&nbsp; Whether Shah was performing research included in the papers while he was at NCSU is unclear.</p>



<p>“My mistake was that many people there used the USDA affiliation and I also did the same,” Shah told us in an email. He also said he provided “each and every document” requested by the editors and called the decision to retract “biased.”</p>



<p><a href="https://asab.nust.edu.pk/faculty/muhammad-faraz-bhatti/">Muhammad Faraz Bhatti</a>, a coauthor on the March 2024 paper, told us by email none of the coauthors was aware Shah was not affiliated with the USDA. “Shah informed us that he has a PhD in Plant Sciences from France and has recently secured a position in the USDA,” wrote Bhatti, a professor at National University of Sciences and Technology in Islamabad, Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bhatti told us Shah became involved with the research group after befriending Zeeshan Khan, a Ph.D. student at the same university in Pakistan and an author on all three of the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bhatti sent us a copy of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCA-form-NUST.pdf">Research Collaboration Agreement form</a>, on which the “Collaborating Institute/University” is listed as the USDA and Shah is named as the collaborator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same email to Retraction Watch, Bhatti expressed frustration over the journal’s decision to retract the article rather than removing Shah as coauthor:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>making retractions based on wrong information from a co-author is equal to destroying the dignity of the corresponding author (PhD supervisor), the PhD student who worked for 2.5 years on a project, and respected members of the PhD guidance committee (Supervisory committee) who are also co-authors in the paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bhatti said the journal’s editors emailed him before retracting, but due to his “tight teaching and research schedule” and the “generic title of the email,” he overlooked the message. “Keeping in view the severity of the matter, in my view the Editor needed to send a reminder of the email, and we would definitely respond our stance [sic],” he said. The authors have appealed the decision to retract and are waiting for a response from the journal’s ethics committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notices on the other two papers note <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2734-4180">Parvaiz Ahmad</a>, co-corresponding author along with Shah, “cooperated with the investigation in full.” Ahmad, who has had dozens of papers <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=parvaiz+ahmad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flagged on PubPeer</a>, did not respond to our request for comment. </p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>This month, we interviewed Dr Joana Pinto, </strong></span></span><strong>Senior Research Associate at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Oxford and the Principal Investigator on The </strong><u><a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/bulte-group/the-maternal-brain-study/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>Maternal Brain Project</strong></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>. Joana discusses the importance of the Maternal Brain Project, how essential mixed sex studies are and the challenges she has faced applying for women&apos;s health-related grants. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Can you tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What initially drew me to neuroscience was the incredible complexity of the brain and the idea that, despite all we have learned, there is still so much to uncover. As a result, throughout my studies in biomedical engineering, I found myself consistently gravitating towards neuroscience and human physiology. This ultimately led me to pursue a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, with a focus on neuroimaging, where I could delve deeper into understanding the brain and its intricate functions.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>How do you apply your background in biomedical engineering to neuroscience?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My biomedical engineering background has fundamentally shaped how I study and understand brain function. By applying engineering principles, I analyse the brain as part of a dynamic, interconnected system, rather than an isolated organ. This systems-based approach allows me to explore the critical role of brain-body interactions, particularly in optimising blood flow control, an essential factor in maintaining a healthy brain.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>You are the Principal Investigator of </strong></span></span><u><a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/bulte-group/the-maternal-brain-study/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>The Maternal Brain Project</strong></span></span></a></u><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>. Please could you tell us a bit more about it and why it is such an important project?</strong></span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_9564c5ea5260439288480add8d6a6abe~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_157,h_157,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="The Maternal Brain Project logo."></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The Maternal Brain Project was born from a powerful realisation that most neuroscience research overlooks sex-based differences, even though many diseases disproportionately affect women, such as autoimmune disorders and dementia. Interestingly, studies show that women with pregnancy complications, like high blood pressure, face a higher risk of developing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions later in life, including dementia.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Driven by this gap in knowledge, I use advanced imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to map functional changes in the brain during the postpartum period. My focus is on understanding how pregnancy and hypertension may alter blood flow regulation in the brain, with potential long-term implications for brain health.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As Principal Investigator, I am deeply involved in every aspect of the project, from study design and securing funding to participant recruitment, data collection, and analysis. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>In your field of study, what gaps are there, preclinically or clinically, and how do you foresee them being closed?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Neuroscience research has historically been male-centric, often neglecting crucial physiological differences between sexes that influence disease risk and progression. Bridging these gaps demands a multifaceted approach. Preclinically, more studies using female models are needed to explore neurovascular regulation and hormonal influences on brain function. Clinically, longitudinal studies tracking women&apos;s brain health from pregnancy through to later life are essential to understanding long-term impacts. Fortunately, awareness of these disparities is growing, and I am optimistic that meaningful change is underway.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Your field of research is incredibly understudied and underfunded - what challenges have you faced with progressing your work?</strong></span></span><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong> </strong></span></span></em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the biggest hurdles is securing funding. Women’s health, particularly maternal brain research, has not been a priority in neuroscience, making it more difficult to compete for fellowship and grants. Convincing funding bodies of the long-term significance of pregnancy-related brain changes often requires extra effort. Additionally, since neuroscience research has traditionally been male-centric, I have encountered some scepticism about the need for sex-specific studies. This topic is often dismissed as niche, rather than fundamental to broader brain health research.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite these challenges, I am encouraged by the growing awareness of sex-based differences in neuroscience. By continuing to push for greater representation in research, I am optimistic that we can reshape the narrative and drive meaningful progress in this critical field.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Have you experienced any bias/discrimination as a woman in science, and/or have you witnessed any other people being subjected to bias/discrimination? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Yes, I have experienced and witnessed bias in science, and unfortunately, it doesn’t always come from where you might expect. I have seen instances where women themselves reinforce these biases, whether through internalised stereotypes, gatekeeping, or a reluctance to advocate for one another. I have also seen brilliant female scientists struggle with imposter syndrome, doubting their achievements even when they clearly deserve recognition. This isn’t just a personal issue; it’s a reflection of a culture that has historically undervalued women in STEM.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">That said, I’m encouraged by the progress being made. More conversations are happening around these issues, and more initiatives, such as </span></span><u><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/about" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">WiNUK</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, are supporting and recognising women in science.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>There is still a deep-rooted gender and sex inequality around the world, including in research. With the gender ideology extremism occurring in the US, do you foresee regression in the world of science relating to this?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The progress we&apos;ve made in addressing gender and sex disparities in research is undeniable, but it remains fragile, especially in the face of political and ideological extremism. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">That said, the global scientific community is increasingly recognising the importance of sex- and gender-inclusive research, and I believe the overall trajectory remains forward, with scientists continuing to push for evidence-based research and policies. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>You took part in the Commission on the Status of Women - what did being a delegate involve and how was the experience? How can people get involved?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In 2023, I was a UN Women UK participant in the </span></span><u><a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/how-we-work/commission-on-the-status-of-women/csw68-2024" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">68th session of the Commission on the Status of Women</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. I had the opportunity to join live sessions streamed from the UN Headquarters in New York, which allowed me to stay informed about the Commission&apos;s work and key issues being discussed. Additionally, I connected with several women&apos;s advocacy networks, which provided valuable opportunities to network with people from around the world and contribute to the ongoing advocacy for women&apos;s rights and gender equality across various sectors.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the most enjoyable aspects of my current job is the opportunity to work as a team and mentor students. Watching someone develop their skills, build confidence, and succeed in their roles is incredibly rewarding!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>What are some of the challenging aspects of your current job? And, what are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience job?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the challenges I face is learning to say &quot;no&quot;. There are always exciting opportunities to collaborate, take on new projects, and support others. However, balancing these with my existing responsibilities can sometimes feel overwhelming. Nevertheless, over time and with experience, I believe I have become better at setting boundaries and prioritising tasks more effectively.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In the next few years, I hope to be doing work that excites me and feels meaningful! Whether that involves advancing my research, collaborating with others, or taking on new leadership roles, I want to stay engaged in work that truly makes a difference. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Which female-identifying people in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The students, academics, and mothers I work with constantly inspire me. My colleagues motivate me with their curiosity, dedication, and passion for learning, while the mothers teach me invaluable lessons about perseverance and empathy.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>What advice would you give to female-identifying people at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My advice to individuals at the early stages of their neuroscience careers would be to find something you&apos;re truly passionate about. This will drive you through the inevitable challenges and setbacks, and it will keep you motivated even when things get tough.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span style="color: #A5698A;">&quot;What is perhaps the most impressive about Joana is her commitment to the </span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>promotion of gender and sex-inclusive research</strong></span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;">. Neuroscience, specifically, is a field with a severe </span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>underrepresentation of women</strong></span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"> – including in those conducting the research, and those included in research studies – and Joana has been steadfast in her commitment to advocating for the </span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>inclusion of women and gender minorities</strong></span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"> in neuroscience research. She has made significant advances investigating the impact of </span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>pregnancy outcomes</strong></span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"> on brain vascular health and on the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and has communicated this science widely, </span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>engaging the wider community</strong></span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"> in her work. She is an exceptionally motivating communicator, and has secured </span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>prestigious funding </strong></span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;">to support her research through the </span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>Maternal Brain Study</strong></span></em><em><span style="color: #A5698A;">. Joana is most deserving of this recognition, and I have no doubt that she will continue to lead in this field.&quot; </span></em><em><span style="color: #000000;">Taken from Joana Pinto&apos;s Award Nomination Statement.</span></em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Honestly, I was deeply humbled and thrilled to be recognised in such a way. Being nominated in the first place was already a huge honour, and winning the award was both a validation of the work that my team and I do and a reminder of the importance of continuing to push boundaries in neuroscience.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This recognition motivates me to continue pushing for greater inclusivity in neuroscience research. I also hope it encourages more people, especially women and underrepresented groups, to pursue careers in neuroscience, and to highlight the importance of looking at sex and gender as key factors in understanding the brain. </span></span></p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Caroline McMillan will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;Exploring Convergence in Wearable Computing Development&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Wearable technologies draw on a range of disciplines. Due to methodological differences,
wearables researchers can experience gaps or breakdowns in values, goals, and vocabulary
when collaborating. This situation makes wearables development challenging, even more so
when technologies are in the early stages of development, and their technological and
cultural potential is not fully understood. Investigating a common ground to enhance
convergent spaces in research allows researchers and developers to share information
across domains, encouraging divergent perspectives, creativity, and inclusiveness. By
presenting an example of an online search interface that allows users to explore wearable
technologies beyond their discipline, the authors show how users with different mindsets
and skills can engage with information and expand and share knowledge when developing
wearables.</p>

<p>An article by Genentech scientists received an extensive correction in January for multiple instances of image duplications after comments on PubPeer spurred the authors to review the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the correction “inadvertently omitted” an additional duplication, and will be updated after Retraction Watch brought the matter to the journal’s attention, a representative for the publication said. The sleuth who identified the additional duplication said the original article should have been retracted instead of corrected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0604044103">Death-receptor activation halts clathrin-dependent endocytosis</a>,” appeared in July 2006 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, with a correction issued that September. It has been cited 99 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131146"></span>



<p>Most of the authors, including the first and corresponding authors, were affiliated with the biotech company Genentech, based in South San Francisco. When the paper was published, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the former president of Stanford University, was senior vice president for research drug discovery at the company, according to an <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/152571/tessier-lavigne-cv.pdf">online CV</a>. Tessier-Lavigne <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/19/stanford-president-resigns-over-manipulated-research-will-retract-at-least-3-papers/">stepped down</a> from Stanford in 2023 after <em>The Stanford Daily</em> reported on questions about his research, including from his <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/17/internal-review-found-falsified-data-in-stanford-presidents-alzheimers-research-colleagues-allege/">time at Genentech</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In June 2023, an anonymous user on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9A35BEC1F3D18F4B8B5AC8DA8BAF8C#1">commented</a> on elements of figure 2 of the paper that appeared “more similar than expected.” Another user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9A35BEC1F3D18F4B8B5AC8DA8BAF8C#2">chimed in</a> with an additional finding in the same figure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three of the paper’s authors <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9A35BEC1F3D18F4B8B5AC8DA8BAF8C#4">responded</a> in August 2023. The post, signed by first author Cary Austin, second author David Lawrence, and last author Avi Ashkenazi, all Genentech employees, stated the editors of <em>PNAS</em> had alerted them to the query.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We agree that the images are problematic and are undertaking a comprehensive examination of the image data in the article,” the three authors wrote. “We will then update journal editors to determine an appropriate course of action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 3 of this year, <em>PNAS</em> published a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425433121">correction</a> detailing about two dozen instances of splicing, both vertical and horizontal, and duplication in five of the paper’s figures. The authors stated they found the issues with the help of an expert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because the source X-ray films or image files are no longer available, the authors have repeated these experiments,” the notice stated, with reference to a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.24.619217v1">preprint</a> the authors posted on bioRxiv in October 2024. “The new data confirms the original results, reaffirming the experimental conclusions,” they added.</p>



<p>“The editors have evaluated and approved the authors’ response and maintain confidence in the paper,” the notice concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">David Sanders, a biologist and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">scientific sleuth</a> at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., reviewed the original article at our request to look for any issues not noted in the correction. He identified an additional duplication in figure 12, which the correction stated exhibited “potential vertical splicing,” but not duplication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to the paper’s authors, <em>PNAS</em>, and Genentech with Sanders’ finding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prashant Nair, a representative for the journal, told us the editorial office had “inadvertently omitted” mention of the duplication in figure 12 while finalizing the correction text with the authors. The journal will update the correction notice to include the duplication, Nair said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The figure “was part of the editor’s original evaluation,” he said. “As stated in the published Correction notice, the editor reviewed the information provided in the authors’ response and remains confident in the findings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors did not respond to our query. Karen Ring, senior manager for science communications, public affairs and access at Genentech, said the company was “aware of the potential issue you refer to in Figure 12 and are working with PNAS to address it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ring did not respond to our question about whether any other work by the authors was under review. “Genentech is a company founded on principles of scientific excellence and integrity and we remain committed to those principles today,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sanders said the original <em>PNAS </em>article “with so many problems” should be retracted. “It simply wasn’t valid.”</p>



<p>The journal has previously allowed authors to correct a paper with reference to data published in a preprint. In <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2415544121">August</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419360121">October</a> of last year, <em>PNAS</em> published two corrections for the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0800135105">same paper</a> in which data had been reused. The authors “performed confirmatory experimentation” posted in a preprint, according to the initial correction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The practice allows authors “to escape responsibility for the original article,” Sanders said. “I find that an unsatisfactory solution.”</p>
