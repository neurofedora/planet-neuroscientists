                Deafblindness is a complex condition that affects both sight and hearing, but its impact goes far beyond sensory loss. This article explores how language experience and personal context shape neurodevelopmental outcomes, highlighting the need for more tailored research and greater public awareness.

<p>An obstetrician and gynecologist from an Egyptian university has garnered more than a half-dozen retractions so far this year for self plagiarism and problematic data.</p>



<p><a href="https://shams.academia.edu/IbrahimAbdelazim">Ibrahim A Abdelazim</a> is on the faculty of Ain Shams University, Cairo, but is on “unpaid leave” and currently working at Ahmadi Hospital in Kuwait, he told us. The recent retractions bring <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Retractions-Ibrahim-A-Abdelazim.pdf">his total to 10</a>, along with one expression of concern. Several journals are conducting investigations into his other papers. </p>



<p>Published from 2012 to 2016, the retracted papers range from methods papers describing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-024-07430-4">how to detect premature rupture of fetal membranes</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-025-07998-5">how to sample endometrial tissue</a> to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2024.11.026">a descriptive study of fertility after environmental crisis</a>. </p>



<span id="more-132516"></span>



<p>All 10 of the notices on the articles cite anomalous data or self plagiarism as the reasons for the retractions. Abdelazim did not answer our question about the pattern of data issues and plagiarized text in his comments to Retraction Watch, but he said he had been unable to provide ethical approval documents during the journals’ investigations.</p>



<p>Collectively, the papers have been cited 160 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Ben Mol, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Monash University in Australia, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4361BA84D208603A24D44D9EF6FDB7#0">flagged</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6BEA36414605ED11DD03BCE5EB5276#0">some</a> of Abdelazim’s problematic papers on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Ibrahim+A+Abdelazim+">PubPeer</a>. Mol is an experienced sleuth who has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">raised concerns</a> about <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/high-profile-ob-gyn-accused-of-duplicating-data-threatens-to-sue-critic/">problematic</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/24/paper-retracted-after-author-told-journal-study-was-not-actually-performed/">research</a> in the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/05/02/a-study-of-c-section-scars-in-women-who-hadnt-undergone-the-surgery/">ob-gyn literature</a> in the past. In correspondence we have seen, Mol contacted several journals about Abdelazim’s papers, some of which opened investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One investigation into a paper published in the <em>European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology</em> resulted in a 2024 retraction after the authors provided the raw data for the study. According to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2024.11.026">retraction notice</a>, “the provided files appeared incomplete and demonstrated biologically implausible distributions.”</p>

<p>Three of Abdelazim’s retracted papers were in <em>Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics</em>, published by Springer Nature. “We were alerted to concerns with these papers thanks to a whistleblower, who contacted the journal,” said Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity, resolutions, at the company. According to the retraction notices, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-022-06767-y">2022 retraction</a> was for “serious anomalies” in the data, and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-024-07430-4">2024</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-025-07998-5">March 2025</a> retractions were for self plagiarism.</p>



<p>In 2023, another of Abdelazim’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-012-2548-3">papers</a> in <em>Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics</em> was retracted, but a correction was issued in 2024 reinstating the paper. “Unfortunately, due to an administrative issue, a separate paper was accidentally retracted in error,” Kersjes told us. “We published a Publisher Correction to rectify this error and make it clear to our readers that this paper was not retracted.”</p>



<p>In March 2025, the <em>Journal of the Turkish-German Gynecological Association</em>, published by Galenos Publishing, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4274/jtgga.galenos.2025.e001">retracted six of Abdelazim’s papers</a>, three for anomalous data. The three identical retraction notices stated that after allegations were raised by a third party, “the Editorial Board identified unusual features in some of the reported data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other three papers were retracted for self plagiarism, with one of the notices stating that “a methodological counterpart of this article was published in another journal shortly thereafter, with overlapping patient recruitment periods between the two studies.” After the authors “were unable to supply the original files” for any of the six papers and “considering the detection of other duplication cases by the corresponding author,” the Editorial Board retracted the six articles.</p>



<p>Neither the <em>Journal of the Turkish-German Gynecological Association</em> nor Galenos Publishing responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>In addition to the 10 retractions, one of Abdelazim’s papers in the <em>Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Research, </em>published by Wiley, has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.16211">an expression of concern</a> due to potential self plagiarism. “Concerns about two manuscripts were raised by a third party in February 2024 and we initiated an investigation at that time,” a Wiley spokesperson told us. The investigation “revealed a partial redundancy, which was the focus of the corresponding EOC for the second manuscript.”</p>



<p>However, self-plagiarism may not be the only issue with those two papers. The Wiley spokesperson told us, “subsequently, we received additional concerns about the scientific content and reliability of these manuscripts.” They said the investigation is still ongoing.</p>



<p><em>Ginekologia Polska</em>, a Polish gynecology journal, opened an investigation into Abdelazim’s papers published there, according to an email the journal sent Mol after he raised concerns about Abdelazim’s papers in the journal in April. Both the journal and its publisher, the VM Media Group, have not responded to our inquiries about the status of the investigation.</p>



<p>Abdelazim did not address our question about the pattern of retractions for anomalous data and self plagiarism. Instead, he gave an example of one paper retracted from the <em>Turkish journal of the Turkish German Gynecological Association </em>for a similarity between two papers. He went on to say:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other papers were retracted because the publishing journals asked for the ethical committee approvals and raw data for those papers which were published within ≥10 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding ethical approval, all retracted papers were conducted within ≥10 years and at that time, there was no ethical approval committee in the Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University. This committee launched in 2019-2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the raw data, we are not keeping the raw data for any studies conducted inside the Arab Republic of Egypt for more than 5 years, this is upon formal decision by ‘MEDICAL AND CLINICAL REGULATION LAW’ signed by the PRIME MINISTER OF EGYPT.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the Ain Shams University <a href="https://med.asu.edu.eg/home/en/the-origins-and-achievements/">website</a>, the Faculty of Medicine Research Ethics Committee was established in October 2007, contrary to what Abdelazim told us. An <a href="https://www.edaegypt.gov.eg/media/iqefpbx1/guide-line-gcp-v3.pdf">English translation of the cited law</a> says researchers are required “to keep the documents of the medical research at the research facility at least 5 years” after writing the clinical study report, and “take sufficient precautions to protect the same from any loss or damage.”</p>



<p>According to the retraction notices, Abdelazim agreed with two of the retractions, did not respond to communications about two, disagreed with one, and the other five do not list whether he agreed.</p>

Richardson et al./PNAS 2025</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Systematic research fraud has outpaced corrective measures and will only keep accelerating, according to a study of problematic publishing practices and the networks that fuel them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, published August 4 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420092122">examined research fraud</a> carried out by paper mills, brokers and predatory publishers. By producing low quality or fabricated research, selling authorship and publishing without adequate quality control and peer review, respectively, these three groups were well known to produce a large volume of fraudulent research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a great paper showing how much fraud there is in the scientific literature. The paper also looks at different methods on how to detect problematic papers, networks and editors,” Anna Abalkina, a researcher at Freie Universität Berlin and creator of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, said.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132493"></span>



<p>Researchers and journalists have been looking into paper mills for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435624003056">more than</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.342.6162.1035">a decade</a>, as they have affected <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/30/publisher-retracting-more-than-30-articles-from-paper-mills/">multiple</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/21/mega-journal-cureus-kicks-out-organizations-critics-called-paper-mills/">publishers</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/01/22/the-mill-and-the-loss-journal-up-to-39-retractions-from-paper-mill-articles/">over</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/14/dozens-of-elsevier-papers-retracted-over-fake-companies-and-suspicious-authorship-changes/">the years</a>, even before the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">high-profile retractions</a> of thousands of articles from Hindawi journals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest study confirms the large volume of suspected paper mill products have been doubling more than twice as fast as corrective measures — both official measures like retractions and unofficial channels like the number of crowdsourced comments flagging problematic papers on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s like emptying an overflowing bathtub with a spoon,” coauthor <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/amaral-luis-a-nunes.html">Luis Amaral</a>, a professor at Northwestern University, told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To combat this systemic fraud, the researchers call for a global change in research incentives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Case studies</strong></h3>



<p>To look at cases of paper mill activity to inform their larger network design, Amaral and a research team of metascientists examined metadata from the journal <em>PLOS One</em>, and DOIs from IEEE conference proceedings, along with the Retraction Watch Database and PubPeer comments to compile networks of editors who were significantly more likely to accept articles that eventually got retracted or flagged for concern. (Disclosure: Our Ivan Oransky is a volunteer member of the PubPeer Foundation’s board of directors.)</p>



<p><em>PLOS One</em> has been a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/exclusive-plos-one-to-retract-more-than-100-papers-for-manipulated-peer-review/">known target of paper mill activity in the past</a>. Amaral and colleagues identified networks of editors who accepted an abnormally high rate of papers that were later retracted. The 45 editors implicated in this network edited 1.3 percent of all articles, but 30.2 percent of all retracted articles. More than half of the editors also authored articles that were later retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Renee Hoch, head of publication ethics at PLOS, told us that since the increased paper mill activity was detected four to five years ago, the company has implemented measures to investigate existing articles and paper mill networks, and thoroughly screen new papers, authors and editors before publication. Even before then, the publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/04/25/how-one-journal-became-a-major-retraction-engine/">had expanded</a> its publication ethics team to investigate papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“PLOS was used as a data source in this study in part because PLOS publishes all of our articles Open Access, we list the names of handling editors on our articles, and we allow bulk access to our article content and metadata,” Hoch said. “However, the issues that surfaced in this article are not specific to <em>PLOS One</em> and instead are affecting journals and publishers across the industry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers conducted the same analysis on papers from Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) conference proceedings, which have long been a known target for <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.362.6413.393">paper mill activity</a>. They found hundreds of conferences produced abnormally high proportions of papers that were later retracted, flagged on PubPeer, or flagged for using tortured phrases. Seven of these conference series were flagged every year the conference was held.</p>



<p>“We believe our preventive measures and efforts identify almost all papers submitted to us that do not meet our standards,” an IEEE corporate spokesperson told us. “To adhere to our standards, IEEE continuously inspects our digital library and acts accordingly when we become aware of possible issues with content, takes the appropriate level of care and time in our review, and, if necessary, retracts nonconforming publications.“&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/luis_amaral_headshot_low_res.detail.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="187" height="200" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/luis_amaral_headshot_low_res.detail.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132497"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Luis Amaral</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In addition to looking at individual journals and publishers, Amaral and colleagues used large databases such as Scopus and Clarivate’s Web of Science, along with PubPeer comments about suspected image duplication to map a network of papers across many large publishers like Springer Nature, Spandidos, Wiley and Elsevier. They found multiple clusters of duplicated images that seemed to be published close in time. Of papers with suspected image duplication, 34.1 percent have been retracted.</p>



<p>The authors’ approach of looking at image duplication networks is innovative and had not been done before, Abalkina said. “It is fascinating to see how paper mills expand like [an] octopus engaging more and more scholars in the network.”</p>



<p>Amaral and colleagues also analyzed the impact of fraud on certain subfields, focusing on RNA biology, which study coauthor Jennifer Byrne of the University of Sydney and others <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/11/misspelled-cell-lines-take-on-new-lives-and-why-thats-bad-for-the-scientific-literature/">have closely</a> <a href="https://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/5/4/e202101203">examined</a> for years. The researchers found compromised subfields had a retraction rate around 4 percent, while uncompromised ones remained lower, at about 0.1 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the researchers quantified journal hopping using a known paper mill broker, the Academic Research and Development Association (ARDA), which some of the study coauthors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">described in detail last year</a> for Retraction Watch. ARDA’s website listed journals in which the organization guaranteed publication. As the listed journals were de-indexed from Scopus (at a much higher rate than other journals – 33.3 percent versus 0.5 percent), new journals would be added to the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite publishers’ current efforts, the researchers calculated that only 28.7 percent of suspected paper mill products have been retracted. The figure came from the researchers’ dataset of paper mill products and the Retraction Watch Database, using data through 2020, although data show paper mill growth since then has been rapid. They extrapolated from current trends that “only around 25 percent of suspected paper mill products will ever be retracted and that only around 10 percent of suspected paper mill products will ever reside in a de-indexed journal.”</p>



<p>These numbers likely underestimate the full extent of the problem, because they “rely on the instances of scientific fraud that have been reported,” they wrote in the paper.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What can be done?</strong></h3>



<p>Amaral compared the scale of the issue to combating the ozone hole over Antarctica, and said that the scale of the solutions need to match. “We need the biggest, most important stakeholders of science to come together to talk about what needs to be done, what standards need to be implemented and not wait for the problem to solve itself,” he told us. He named national organizations like the U.S. National Academies, the Chinese Academies of Sciences, and the U.K. Royal Society as stakeholders big enough to influence large organizations like publishers to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They need to implement decisions, and they need to advocate strongly for those decisions to be adopted by journals, by funding agencies, by employers, universities, the national labs,” Amaral told us. “It&#8217;s not going to be an individual choice.”</p>



<p>However, individuals can play a role in advocating for change. Anyone can “press on policymakers to end the culture of hyper-competition in science,” Reese Richardson, a coauthor of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University, told us. “Scientists are all competing against each other for an increasingly scarce pool of resources,” he said.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/reese_richardson.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/reese_richardson.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132498" style="width:200px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/reese_richardson.jpg 1000w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/reese_richardson-300x300.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/reese_richardson-150x150.jpg 150w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/reese_richardson-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Reese Richardson</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Scientists can help address the problem in additional ways, Richardson told us. “What scientists can do in their own personal capacity is do post-publication peer review, and take a critical eye to the literature in their fields because it&#8217;s clear that we&#8217;re only detecting a tiny, tiny fraction of the problem,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also suggested researchers develop “high throughput approaches to identify problematic articles” and metascientists “can use rare signals, like the comments that people leave on PubPeer observations about image misidentification and image duplication and instrument misidentification, tortured phrases … to understand what&#8217;s happening behind the scenes. That&#8217;s the job of meta scientists – to use public visible indicators to get at what&#8217;s invisible.”</p>



<p>We’ve covered a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/04/cosig-sleuths-publish-toolkit-post-publication-review/">number of these high throughput approaches</a> in the past, including one <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/27/exclusive-thousands-of-papers-misidentify-microscopes-in-possible-sign-of-misconduct/">Richardson and Amaral developed</a> with others to detect papers that misidentify microscopes used in their studies.</p>



<p>“We are part of a community that has been fighting for recognition of something that has been concerning us,” Amaral told us. “We are grateful for everything that everyone else has done, and to be a part of that, because science is very important to us and we want to do things to maintain the ideals of what science should be.”</p>

<p>Springer Nature has officially <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-97-9914-5">retracted</a> a book on machine learning <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/16/springer-nature-to-retract-machine-learning-book-following-retraction-watch-coverage/">following coverage by </a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/30/springer-nature-book-on-machine-learning-is-full-of-made-up-citations/">Retraction Watch</a>. A reader sent us a tip about this book; we’d love your help identifying more.</p>



<p>As we reported, the book, <em>Mastering Machine Learning: From Basics to Advanced</em>, contained many citations to nonexistent works. These fake references are a hallmark of text generated by large language models like ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-9914-5_1">retraction notice</a> mentions the illusory citations, stating, “Following publication concerns were raised regarding the validity of certain references. Upon further investigation, the Publisher was unable to verify the source of 25 out of 46 references in this book.” After listing the 25 citations, 12 of which we found in our initial reporting, it continues, “the Series Editor and the publisher therefore no longer have confidence in the reliability of this book. The author has not stated explicitly whether he agrees with this retraction.”</p>



<span id="more-132478"></span>



<p>The website for the book remains intact, with each chapter labeled “Retracted Chapter,” the title appended with “Retracted Book” the cover image watermarked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following our story, we received multiple tips from readers about other books with fake citations. Do you know of another recently published book with citations that don’t check out? <a href="https://forms.gle/BJxk2VgB8mgtoBks7">Tell us about it here</a>. On the form, we ask you to point to specific citations that are not real. We&#8217;ll take it from there.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/2025/08/02/packaging-changes-at-neurofedora.html">Packaging changes at NeuroFedora</a></h4>

              
                <p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> team has decided to make a couple of changes to the artefacts that we produce and maintain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Comp Neuro Lab ISO image has been dropped.</li>
<li>We are moving away from packaging Python software that is easily installable from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPi</a> into rpms for the Fedora repositories to testing it out on Fedora.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the years that the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> team has been maintaining neuroscience rpm packages for the Fedora repositories, we have amassed a rather large number, <a class="reference external" href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig">almost ~500 packages</a>.
That is great, and we are extremely pleased with our coverage of the neuroscience software ecosystem.
However, given that the team is composed of a few volunteers who can only dedicate limited amounts of their time to maintaining packages, we were beginning to find that we were unable to keep up with the increasing workload.</p>
<p>Further, we realised that the use case for including all neuroscience software in Fedora was no longer clear---was it really required for us to package all of it for users?</p>
<p>An example case is the Python ecosystem.
Usually, users/researchers/developers tend to install Python software directly from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPi</a> rather than relying on system packages that we provide.
The suggested use of virtual environments to isolate projects and their dependencies also requires the use of software directly from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPi</a>, rather than using our system packages.
Therefore, for software that can be installed directly, we argue that it is less important that we package them.
Instead, it is more useful to our user base if we thoroughly test that this set of software can be properly installed and used on Fedora---on all the different versions of Python that a Fedora release supports.</p>
<p>So, a new guideline that we now follow is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>prioritise packaging software that cannot be easily installed from upstream forges (such as <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPi</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Following this, we have made a start on the Python packages that we maintain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we made a list of software that is easily installable from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPi</a></li>
<li>we began dropping them from Fedora, and instead testing their usage from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The testing involves:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>checking that the software and its extras can be successfully installed on Fedora using <cite>pip</cite></li>
<li>checking that the modules that the software include can be successfully imported</li>
</ul>
<p>We <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/blob/main/f/python-package-usage-check">automate these tests using PyTest</a>, and a daily report is published on <a class="reference external" href="https://ankursinha.fedorapeople.org/neurofedora/package-status/">fedorapeople.org here</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/">documentation</a> has also been updated to reflect this change.
We now include two tables on each page.
One table provides information about the software that can be installed from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPi</a>, and so is not included in rpm form in Fedora.
The other provides information about the software that continues to be included in Fedora, because it cannot be easily installed from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPi</a> directly.</p>
<p>We will continue reporting issues to upstream developers as we have done before.
The difference now is that we work directly with what they publish, rather than our rpm packaged versions of what they publish.</p>
<p>You can follow this discussion and progress <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/580">here</a>.
Please refer to the lists in the documentation for the up to date list of packages we include/test.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, a long time ago, two science journalists had an idea for a blog about retractions. And on Aug. 3, 2010, Retraction Watch launched, detailing in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/08/03/why-write-a-blog-about-retractions/">the first post</a> why retractions matter. </p>



<p>And now, 15 years and 6,700 posts later, that work seems more important than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are gratified every day to see Retraction Watch driving the conversation on integrity in scientific research. Our work has provided the foundation for stories on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/scientific-journals-quality-publishers-6399fc95">mass resignations</a> at journals, how <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-scanning-error-created-a-fake-science-term-now-ai-wont-let-it-die-2000590659">fake phrases</a> end up in the literature, the retraction of a paper claiming evidence for <a href="https://www.jpost.com/archaeology/article-860552">an ancient comet</a> with Biblical ties. We’ve gotten shoutouts in <em>Science</em>, which included <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/some-guidance-authors-engaging-media">links to our stories</a> as examples for scientists of how to respond constructively to critiques of their work, and in <em>Nature, </em>which urged universities to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00509-1">examine their own retraction data</a>.</p>



<span id="more-132464"></span>



<p>Journalists turn to us to comment on issues such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04253-w">“publish or perish”</a> culture, the Trump administration’s call for government scientists to <a href="https://heterodoxacademy.substack.com/p/demoralizing-and-paralyzing-scientists">withdraw in-press manuscripts</a>, and of course on the recent high-profile retraction of the “<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fifteen-years-later-science-retracts-arsenic-life-paper-despite-study-authors">arsenic-life”</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02325-z">paper</a> in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The Retraction Watch Database was central to recent studies looking at retractions in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-024-8233-7">specific</a> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2831119">fields</a> and in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468781225000645?via%3Dihub">certain clinical practice guidelines</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448">anomalies in citations</a> universities use in their rankings, retractions <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00455-y">by institution</a>, retraction rates <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00353/127805/The-Retraction-Gender-Gap-Are-Mixed-Teams-More">by gender</a>, and even <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Report-to-Appropriations-Committee-on-Scholarly-Publishing-and-Public-Access-Implementation.pdf">a report to the U.S. Congress</a> by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky penned <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/02/rfk-kennedy-vaccines-scientific-literature/681681/">an editorial</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em> on how citing literature can be manipulated for any cause, and an article in <em>American Scientist </em>about <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/retraction-reactions">how researchers respond </a>to retractions; Ivan wrote in <em>Quillette </em>about the <a href="https://quillette.com/2025/04/21/when-do-scholarly-retractions-become-a-form-of-censorship/">politicization of retractions</a>.</p>



<p>This year, the Council of Science Editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/06/retraction-watch-awarded-council-of-science-editors-highest-honor/">honored us</a> with the 2025 Award for Meritorious Achievement. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/06/meet-retraction-watchs-two-new-journalists/">hired</a> two fulltime journalists. We’ve published stories with partners, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/data-manipulations-alleged-study-paved-way-microsoft-s-quantum-chip">including</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/shoddy-commentaries-quick-and-dirty-route-higher-impact-numbers-are-rise"><em>Science</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224"><em>The Conversation</em></a>. More than 4 million people came to our website. Our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retraction-watch-database-user-guide/">Retraction Watch Database</a> surpassed 60,000 entries, more than any other such repository. Our <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/our-projects/retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Hijacked Journal Checker</a> is up to 345 journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what we’re celebrating on our 15th anniversary is the growth and expansion of our parent nonprofit, <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/">The Center for Scientific Integrity</a>. We announced three exciting new projects this year:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/our-projects/elisabeth-bik-fund/">Elisabeth Bik Science Integrity Fund</a>, launched with the proceeds of Bik’s Einstein Award, is providing financial resources to Bik and other sleuths and collaborators, as well as funding for training programs, grants, or awards for science integrity advocates. Read more about it <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/renowned-scientific-integrity-investigator-endows-fund-support-fellow-sleuths">in <em>Science</em></a>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Our <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/2025/05/27/meet-the-first-two-retraction-watch-sleuths-in-residence/">Sleuth in Residence Program</a> expanded our team to include David Robert Grimes and Mariana Ribeiro, who are bringing their research expertise to the dozens of tips we receive. The goal of the program is to build capacity in this space to emphasize the value of compensating and protecting the critical work of sleuths.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>And we launched the <a href="https://medicalevidenceproject.org/">Medical Evidence Project</a>, to investigate and rapidly disseminate problems in the medical literature that directly affect human health. Led by James Heathers, the project will leverage the tools of forensic metascience to identify problems in scientific articles, combined with the experience and platform of Retraction Watch to publicize those findings. Read more about it in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01739-z"><em>Nature</em></a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/06/25/meet-sciences-new-fraud-fighter-00421851"><em>Politico</em></a> and <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/06/12/un-projet-pour-nettoyer-la-litterature-medicale-des-etudes-douteuses_6612453_1650684.html?search-type=classic&amp;ise_click_rank=2"><em>Le Monde</em></a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>And, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/job-opportunities/">we’re hiring more staff</a> to support all our projects.</p>



<p>We’re thrilled by this growth, and look forward to seeing where these projects take us. And we have some exciting ideas of other ways we can continue to keep individuals, institutions and publishers accountable.</p>



<p>None of this would have been possible without you, our readers, who value and support our work. Here’s a way you can continue to support us to keep us going for the next 15 years:</p>



<p><strong>For our 15th anniversary, we’re aiming to raise $15,000. </strong></p>



<p>A fair chunk of our budget comes from individual donations. These funds help pay freelancers to report stories, for public records requests, for tech tools to help us do our jobs, and much more. And because such donations are typically unrestricted, they can fill in the gaps where needed, and extend the life of grant-funded projects, leaving us more time to do the work rather than fundraise.</p>



<p>As an added incentive, for a limited time, <strong>your donation will be matched, up to $7,500</strong>. Every dollar counts, and for this fundraising cycle, your dollars will count double!</p>



<p>Retraction Watch stories have always been free, and we are committed to keeping it that way. Show your support and appreciation for the work we do by donating at the link below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to make a tax-deductible contribution to support our work? For donations to Retraction Watch or The Center for Scientific Integrity, donate <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/1909130">here using Paypal</a> or <a href="https://the-center-for-scientific-integrity.square.site/">here using Square</a>. You can also donate directly to the <a href="https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLMPPR50YXGE9/checkout/NPCVYBMC6G7XW47GKMVJ4D3H">Elisabeth Bik Science Integrity Fund</a>, the <a href="https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLMPPR50YXGE9/checkout/A5DINJ5GJL6IC72H6YXF6PE7">Medical Evidence Project</a>, the <a href="https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLMPPR50YXGE9/checkout/4CYWDUCYBL33I7U3HAQJD3YF">Sleuths in Residence Program</a>, or the <a href="https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLMPPR50YXGE9/checkout/RUB6DXONZMZX52GISYSGJWKN">Hijacked Journal Tracker</a> using those links. And thanks! </p>
