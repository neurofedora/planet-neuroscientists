                <p><strong>It's ADHD Awareness Month. As Katherine Mortimer - a PhD student with ADHD - says, ADHD can be both a challenge and a superpower but the important thing is identifying these and working with them. She shares her experience and advice with us here.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_407d9729fac041788c41ff82d404378c~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Image credit: Kelly Sikkema via Unsplash" ></figure><p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as made clear by the name, is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by inattentive and hyperactive personality traits. But it is often more complex than that for individuals with ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19, in the second year of my undergraduate degree. In school I was often labelled a daydreamer - my overactive imagination was blamed for this - but for as long as I can remember I have struggled to stay focused and to escape the chaotic world inside my head.</p>

<p>When starting my PhD, I didn’t fully anticipate how my ADHD and a PhD lifestyle might clash. PhDs rely on self-motivation, attention to detail and can be emotionally challenging. I noticed that I was struggling to stay on task, keep on top of my work, pay attention in meetings, and ultimately it became difficult to deal with the emotional lows that can coincide with the PhD experience. But now going into my second year, I have uncovered ways to harmonise my ADHD with my PhD. I have learnt useful techniques that I will carry through for the next couple years of my PhD and most likely for the rest of my life. </p>
<h4>Emotional regulation and rejection sensitivity </h4><p>As a neuroscientist, I have found comfort in trying to understand the neurological underpinnings of my ADHD, but it also makes my behaviour feel far out of my control. Some symptoms of ADHD, such as impulsiveness and the inability to focus and feel motivated, have been attributed to functional deficits in areas of the brain which are heavily populated by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11060940"  >,<u>dopaminergic neurons</u></a>. Low dopamine activity may also explain the more emotional symptoms of ADHD, such as rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD) and emotional dysregulation, where the highs are very high, and the lows are very low.</p>
<blockquote>This field is full of rejections. There are the obvious ones...but there are a lot of less overt moments, too</blockquote><p>Unfortunately for those who experience RSD and are pursuing a PhD (or any route in academia), this field is full of rejections. There are the obvious ones, like when journals reject your paper or when you attempt an experiment for the 50th time only for it to not work (again). No one likes being rejected, but for individuals with RSD it can be harrowing, causing a complete decline in mood which may be viewed as ‘irrational’ by others. There are a lot of less overt moments, too, though, that can be deeply affective but subtle, and interactions with your supervisor can play a major role in perceived rejection. Maybe a meeting with them didn’t go as well as planned, or they shot down an idea you had for your project. Supervisors are your main point of call; they are vital to the success of your PhD and they are completely unique to the PhD experience. What other job has a mentor or boss that gives you so much 1-to-1 attention? Because of this, perceived rejection can be found in even the smallest interactions with them. One technique I try to apply to limit RSD in this context is to not put too much pressure on these interactions. A weekly meeting is not the be all and end all, and will not alter your supervisor's opinion of you if you feel you’ve come up short on successful results or meaningful outcomes. In general terms, there will be bad lab days, but there will also be good lab days and the more you accept this part of the journey, the more likely you are to learn from your rejections and turn them into growth.  </p>
<h4>Executive dysfunction and attention span</h4><p>Let’s talk about executive dysfunction. Right off the bat, it sounds like a bunch of cognitive jargon, but executive function comes down to seemingly very basic parts of our working lives such as completing a task from beginning to end, remembering to go to meetings,  or completing tasks with a deadline. Executive dysfunction is struggling with all of the above. It is largely attributed to the inattentive side of ADHD and it makes perfect sense if you view it in terms of attention. If you do not pay attention to something, it is harder to commit it to memory. Struggling with executive dysfunction can often fuel rejection sensitivity and lead to feelings of inadequacy and embarrassment. For example, when your supervisor asks you if you made any progress on the part of your project, they advised you to try but you have no recollection of this.</p><blockquote>Working from home days are so important for my mental wellbeing and allow me to work more efficiently in the lab on the days I am in</blockquote><p>A potentially obvious way to deal with this is to write things down! And I don’t mean leaving yourself cryptic messages on random notepads and having to ask yourself “What does 'just eyeballs’ mean??’ (this is a real message I left myself amid a bunch of doodles). Writing up meeting notes immediately after they have occurred is a good way to combat this, but also make notes during the meeting. Leave comments in full sentences on half-written areas of your thesis to remind yourself of your thought process at the time, or even use your lab book to write full-on diary entries retelling your day in the lab if that helps. </p>

<p>Burnout and feeling overwhelmed can worsen executive dysfunction and are all too common among PhD students. Please remember that it is completely reasonable to take breaks. Use your lunch breaks to detach yourself from what you’re doing, catch up with lab mates and destress. Having a work from home day each week is also a great way to get yourself out of the lab and limit your burnout. Save some reading or data analysis for this time! I’ve found this to be so important for my mental wellbeing and it allows me to work more efficiently in the lab on the days I am in. </p>
<blockquote>My ADHD is not just a hindrance, it is also all the parts of myself that make me perfectly suited for a PhD</blockquote>
<h4>Superpower</h4><p>When I spoke to my mum (who also has ADHD) about writing this article, she noted how negative I was being, describing ADHD as a huge obstacle to me obtaining my PhD. However, she reminded me that my ADHD is not just a hindrance, it is also all the parts of myself that make me perfectly suited for a PhD. It’s the persistent intellectual curiosity, the need to always understand why, chronic problem-solving, ability to hyperfocus, and the creativity and resourcefulness that allows me to think outside the box and explore a huge range of research related to my project. We are often taught to view our neurodivergence as a superpower, and to this I say, why not? If a part of our ADHD makes us enthralled by a particular area of research and constantly seeking answers to a research question, then surely we are the ideal PhD candidates. </p><hr><p>This article was written by Katherine Mortimer and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Harpreet Singh will talk about the paper entitled &quot;Exploring Computer Science Students’ Perception of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Descriptive and Correlation Study&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>ChatGPT is an emerging tool that can be employed in many activities including in
learning/teaching in universities. Like many other tools, it has its benefits and its
drawbacks. If used properly, it can improve learning, and if used irresponsibly, it can
have a negative impact on learning. The aim of this research is to study how ChatGPT can
be used in academia to improve teaching/learning activities. In this paper, we study
students’ opinions about how the tool can be used positively in learning activities. A
survey is conducted among 430 students of an MSc degree in computer science at the
University of Hertfordshire, UK, and their opinions about the tool are studied. The survey
tries to capture different aspects in which the tool can be employed in academia and the
ways in which it can harm or help students in learning activities. The findings suggest
that many students are familiar with the tool but do not regularly use it for academic
purposes. Moreover, students are skeptical of its positive impacts on learning and think
that universities should provide more vivid guidelines and better education on how and
where the tool can be used for learning activities. The students’ feedback responses are
analyzed and discussed and the authors’ opinions regarding the subject are presented. This
study shows that ChatGPT can be helpful in learning/teaching activities, but better
guidelines should be provided for the students in using the tool.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Amidst the COVID-19 calamity, one can argue that science is one of the few aspects of the human response that has worked relatively well. However, despite the many advances in preventing and treating COVID-19, there have also been missteps as the world has scrambled to respond to a deadly new pathogen. It has been humbling for the U.S. to lead large high-income countries in per capita deaths from COVID-19 even with its wealth and scientific expertise. We are all too aware of the needless illnesses and deaths that have resulted from misguided political leadership, inadequate preparation, delayed responses, fragile supply chains, health disparities, and vaccine hesitancy. But we will not dwell on these issues here. Rather, we would like to review the COVID-19 pandemic through the prism of the 3R’s of research integrity: rigor, reproducibility, and responsibility. These form the fundamental pillars of the foundation of science. It is appropriate that we devote more attention to the foibles than to the successes so that we can learn from the mistakes and missed opportunities. What could have been done better? What needs to improve?</p>



<span id="more-128137"></span>



<p>Has COVID research been rigorous and reproducible?&nbsp; Certainly, much of the work that brought us vaccines and new therapies has been. But unfortunately, other instances have fallen far short of rigor. Perhaps the most prominent example early in the pandemic related to the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used for the treatment of malaria and rheumatic diseases, were suggested as possible therapies for SARS in 2003, but were not formally studied in a clinical setting. Shortly after the COVID pandemic began to take off in China, rumors of a possible benefit of these agents began to appear in social media. On February 19, 2020, a letter was published in an obscure Asian journal, which mentioned a press briefing reporting that chloroquine improved clinical outcomes compared to control treatment in more than 100 patients with COVID-19 in China. No data were provided however, and the paper initially attracted little notice. However, on March 4, an article from a prominent research group in France led by Dr. Didier Raoult appeared in the <em>International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents</em>, reviewing the <em>in vitro </em>antiviral activity of chloroquine against coronaviruses and referring to the reportedly favorable experience in China.</p>



<p>On March 13, two cryptocurrency investors, Greg Rigano and James Todaro, posted a non-peer-reviewed paper online, touting chloroquine as “an effective treatment for COVID-19.” The authors claimed some prestigious institutional affiliations, which were subsequently disavowed, but nevertheless their paper was tweeted by Elon Musk to over 40 million followers, and one of the authors was interviewed by Tucker Carlson of Fox News, who publicized the claims to millions of viewers. On March 16, a preprint from Dr. Raoult and his group reported the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin in 26 patients, who were compared with 16 controls receiving standard care. Viral clearance as measured by PCR was reported to be more rapid in recipients of hydroxychloroquine and much more rapid in those who also received azithromycin. The paper was accepted for publication soon afterward.</p>



<p>Red flags about this paper were raised almost immediately, but not before hydroxychloroquine was being touted by President Donald Trump as a “game changer” that would be fast-tracked by the FDA for approval. On March 28, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in patients with severe COVID-19. Among the concerns regarding the French study were the small sample size, the lack of randomization (which resulted in poorly matched study and control groups), the use of different diagnostic assays, and the failure to account for six patients who had been initially enrolled in the study. It was also noted that the Editor-in-Chief of the journal publishing the article was one of the authors, and the review process took less than 24 hours. The same research group subsequently published a paper reporting that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were 92% effective in more than 1,000 patients with early COVID-19. However, the follow-up study did not include a control group. Dr. Raoult was quoted as saying that randomized controlled trials are unnecessary and unethical in deadly infectious diseases and appeal only to statisticians “<em>who have never seen a patient</em>.” Meanwhile, he initiated a lawsuit against Dr. Elisabeth Bik, one of the scientists who had criticized his original paper on hydroxychloroquine.</p>



<p>We now know from numerous subsequent clinical studies involving thousands of patients that hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, is <em>not</em> beneficial for patients at any stage of COVID-19, nor for the prevention of infection, and may even be associated with a higher risk of death. With very few exceptions, the results are highly consistent. The FDA Emergency Use Authorization was withdrawn on June 15, 2020. Yet hydroxychloroquine has been given to countless patients on the basis of non-rigorous science and continues to be given in some settings to this day.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">As if to prove the adage that <em>history repeats itself—the first time as tragedy, the second as farce</em>, no sooner had enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine begun to wane, when a new unproven treatment began to gain rapidly in popularity—ivermectin. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone used to treat parasitic infections in humans and other animals. Early in the pandemic, Australian scientists reported that ivermectin could inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. It was quickly pointed out that the concentration of ivermectin required to inhibit viral replication greatly exceeded concentrations achievable from normal human dosing of the drug, but unfortunately this warning was unheeded.</p>



<p>Soon there were reports that ivermectin could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or reduce disease progression in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. A systematic review found that most clinical studies of ivermectin failed to meet predefined eligibility criteria and suffered from imprecision and a high risk of bias. The authors of the review concluded that it is uncertain whether ivermectin is beneficial in COVID-19. But this message was drowned out by ringing endorsements from groups like “America’s Frontline Doctors,” a group of physicians closely aligned with right-wing political organizations, which had originally advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID. A related group calling themselves the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, or FLCCC, led by a critical care physician in Wisconsin named Pierre Kory, lent their voices to these efforts. Dr. Kory was quoted as saying, “<em>My dream is that every household has ivermectin in their cupboard. And you take it upon development of the first symptom of anything approximating a viral symptom. . . Even if it’s not COVID, it’s safe to take it and it’s probably effective against that virus</em>.”</p>



<p>During that latter part of the summer of 2020, an explosive rise in ivermectin prescriptions was observed in the US. High doses of ivermectin can produce a variety of adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, seizures, respiratory failure, and coma. Poison centers found themselves swamped with calls about ivermectin overdoses. The FDA even issued a warning not to take ivermectin for COVID, noting that some people were even taking ivermectin preparations intended for the deworming of horses. Off-label ivermectin use continued to be popular on social media even though careful reviewers found serious flaws in the purported evidence for its benefits in COVID. An independent analysis<em> </em>failed to find a single clinical trial demonstrating a benefit from ivermectin in COVID that did not contain “<em>either obvious signs of fabrication or errors so critical that they invalidated the study</em>,” including the same patient data being used to represent multiple subjects, non-random patient selection, numbers unlikely to occur naturally, incorrectly calculated percentages, and an inability of local health organizations to corroborate that the studies took place.”</p>



<p>Were these aberrations? Extreme cases perhaps, but systematic analyses suggests that deficiencies in the rigor of COVID-related research have been commonplace. A study of 686 COVID-19 clinical research articles found shorter time to publication and lower methodological quality than for other articles in the same journals. This suggests a lowering of the usual standards for publication in the time of plague.</p>



<p>Another issue that cannot be ignored is the important role of social media in disseminating and amplifying misinformation. A commentary has discussed an urgent need for improved understanding and stewardship of global collective behavior, cautioning that it has become easy to connect and share information through social media, but “<em>in contexts where decisions depend upon accurate information, such processes can undermine collective intelligence and promote dangerous behavior</em>.” A lack of trust in government institutions is undermining public health efforts. A country-level analysis demonstrates an inverse correlation between confidence in institutions and COVID burden. As the epidemiologist Jay Kaufman observed, “<em>Science alone can’t heal a sick society. . . Science is a social process. . . To restore faith in science, there must be faith in social institutions</em>.” Our social divisions are literally killing us.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">more than 350 articles relating to COVID-19</a> have been retracted at the time of this writing. This is a modest number in view of the nearly 400,000 articles published on COVID, but it is nevertheless instructive to look at a few of the most high-profile retractions. Two of the retracted articles were published in the most prestigious and selective clinical journals in the world, the <em>Lancet</em> and the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The <em>Lancet</em> paper, published in May 2020, purported to describe a multinational registry analysis of 96,032 patients hospitalized with COVID and found that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were associated with decreased in-hospital survival. The <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> paper, published the following month, purported to analyze 8,910 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and found no association between the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and in-hospital mortality. Note that both of these findings have been subsequently confirmed by other legitimate studies, so what is in dispute is not the bottom-line findings of these articles. The problem is that the data were made up out of thin air. The retracted articles claimed to draw from an enormous registry including patients from 671 hospitals on six continents. One would expect such a monumental effort to involve hundreds if not thousands of contributors. However, suspicions quickly arose when no one could identify even a single hospital that had contributed to this registry, and major discrepancies were noted between the number of reported cases for some regions and data from independent sources.</p>



<p>Although both papers were retracted within weeks of publication, significant damage was done. Clinical trials had been suspended and international guidelines had been revised on the basis of the published findings. Editors and reviewers were apparently seduced by the reputation of the first author (a respected Harvard Professor) and the power of big data. The pressures of the pandemic may have allowed the papers to slip through the peer review process with less than the usual scrutiny. Dr. Sapan Desai, the founder of Surgisphere, the company that claimed to have assembled the registry, turned out to be a surgeon with multiple prior malpractice claims and little experience in data analytics. An investigation of his company identified just a handful of employees, several of whom had no background in science or data analysis, and the company was occupying rented office space. Dr. Amit Patel, a co-author on the studies, turned out to be Dr. Desai’s brother-in-law. The first author Dr. Mandeep Mehra admitted to not having seen any primary data. Although Dr. Desai has not admitted any wrongdoing, the Surgisphere papers are now believed to have been a hoax based on fabricated data. The editor-in-chief of the <em>Lancet </em>concluded that the study was a “<em>monumental fraud.</em>”&nbsp; Nevertheless, the papers have continued to be cited despite their retraction; each has been cited more than 700 times, and many of the citing articles appear to be unaware that the papers have been retracted.</p>



<p>Further evidence of peer review failure can be seen in two retracted articles by a psychologist named Harald Walach. Walach published articles claiming that COVID vaccines were responsible for two deaths for every three infections prevented and that face mask use results in hypercapnia in children. Although the papers were strongly criticized for their nonsensical findings and quickly retracted by the journals <em>Vaccines</em> and <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>, they were widely circulated and continue to be cited by anti-vaccine and anti-face mask advocates.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Serious questions regarding scientific responsibility have arisen during the pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 was initially assumed to have arisen as a zoonotic pathogen making a species jump from bats to humans, possibly via an intermediate host, subsequent attention was focused on the possibility of transmission from a lab leak involving scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where coronavirus research is performed. Speculations were made about whether so-called “Gain-of-Function” research to identify viral adaptations that facilitate human infection might have inadvertently led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. At this time, the weight of scientific evidence favors a natural origin. Nevertheless, the lack of transparency on the part of the Chinese government and the politicization of the issue have raised uncomfortable questions about whether scientists are adequately considering and mitigating the public health risks of research with dangerous pathogens. As Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO has noted, “<em>Lab accidents happen</em>,” and it is incumbent upon scientists to be cognizant of these hazards and to take every possible precaution to minimize the risk to the public.<strong> </strong>In his classic description of the Black Death in London, <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>, Daniel Defoe wrote “<em>It mattered not from whence it came</em>.” But the origin of the pandemic does matter. Whether by zoonotic spillover or lab accident, we need to understand how the pandemic began in order to take appropriate measures to prevent this from happening again.</p>



<p>Although we have focused on some examples in which science fell short of its ideals during the COVID pandemic, overall, the scientific community acquitted itself well. We have already mentioned the remarkable success of vaccine development efforts. Scientists threw themselves wholeheartedly into COVID research, putting their other interests on hold. Collaborative and team science allowed the rapid execution of multinational trials, and data sharing, open access and preprint servers facilitated the timely dissemination of information. Critical knowledge regarding pre-symptomatic spread and superspreading, non-pharmaceutical interventions, diagnostic testing, distinction between protective and detrimental immune responses, ventilatory management, thromboembolic complications, and viral variants was quickly and widely shared, allowing substantial improvements in clinical outcomes as the pandemic proceeded.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, both the strengths and weaknesses of the contemporary scientific enterprise have been on ample display. Scientists produced a massive number of publications, but wading through this literature to find the truth has not been easy. As Robert Peter Gale wryly observed, the pandemic would be quickly ended if SARS-CoV-2 could be conquered by publications, guidelines, and interminable meetings alone. Due to the urgency of the pandemic, scientific standards were sometimes compromised. Limitations of randomized clinical trials as an exclusive source of knowledge to guide clinical decision-making were exposed. Important questions were raised about the potential dangers of scientific research on pathogenic microbes, while the origins of the pandemic have remained uncertain.</p>



<p>Vigorous debate is often regarded as a sign of a healthy scientific enterprise. However, open bickering among scientists about public health policies instead contributed to increasing societal polarization and undermining of public trust in science during the pandemic. Peter Sandman, an expert on risk communication, identified many mistakes made by officials in their messaging to the public, including a failure to communicate uncertainty and acknowledge error. Resistance to lockdowns and mandates were frequently met by backlash and hostility to public health officials. Unfortunately, the loss of credibility and public resistance to expert guidance have proven persistent, even as pandemic waves have receded.</p>



<p>Social media has posed a formidable challenge by creating alternative sources of information and disinformation that compete with science in influencing policy-making and public opinion. This represents a serious threat that society has scarcely begun to address. With science as just one among many potential sources of information, the imperative of making science as rigorous, as reproducible, and as responsible as possible becomes clear. Otherwise, why should anyone believe scientists rather than other sources claiming to represent the truth?  For science to retain its influence in society, efforts to make it more rigorous, reproducible, and responsible must be a ceaseless undertaking. Only scientists can carry the torch and continue to perform the high-quality research that will lead to better prevention and treatment, not only of COVID, but of future threats as well. </p>



<p>As Albert Camus observed in <em>The Plague, </em>“<em>What’s natural is the microbe. All the rest—health, integrity, purity—is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter</em>.” We can and must learn from our experience because it is a certainty that COVID will not be the last pandemic.</p>

<p>&#8220;arXiv serves as both the memory and a window to the future of science. It preserves the collective knowledge of our scientific endeavors, ensuring that it is readily available for all, while also acting as a beacon that guides us towards the uncharted territories of discovery. It is a testament to the remarkable synergy of tradition and innovation, making arXiv an indispensable resource for anyone curious about the ever-evolving landscape of scientific inquiry.&#8221; Alex Z.</p>
<p>&#8220;Access to free knowledge is essential in combatting fear. Fear often stems from the unknown. Through free knowledge and research, we can gain understanding, paving the way for a brighter future for all of us.&#8221; &#8211; Danny G.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support #openaccess and arXiv because I believe in making research accessible to all. I have uploaded my own papers to the platform and regularly rely on papers published there for my research.&#8221; &#8211; Nicole X.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arxiv.org is one of my favorite scholarly resources and I have benefited immeasurably from this free and easy to use service over the years. I am happy to lend support to this indispensable service to the scientific community.&#8221; &#8211; Brian H.</p>
<p>What does arXiv mean to you? If open access and arXiv play an essential role in your studies, research, or daily life, please consider sharing your thoughts and giving a gift to arXiv this giving week to help us continue to provide free and open access to science for all.</p>
<p>Share your thoughts, with an option to donate a gift to arXiv if you choose, here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/iheartarxiv">https://tinyurl.com/iheartarxiv</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-elusive-isotope-nitrogen-9">Physicists get a first glimpse of the elusive isotope nitrogen-9</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers may have just spotted the elusive, ephemeral nucleus of nitrogen-9 for the first time.</p>



<p>With seven protons and two neutrons, the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.172501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lopsided atomic nucleus of nitrogen-9</a> pushes the limits of what can even be considered a nucleus at all. Yet signs of its existence seem to be lurking in years-old data from experiments seeking out a different unusual nucleus, researchers report in the Oct. 27 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>If follow-up studies can confirm the detection, nitrogen-9 will be the first nucleus spotted with five more protons than it can stably hold — until now, the limit was four.</p>





<p>“What are the limits of nuclear existence?” asks nuclear physicist Andreas Heinz of Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, who was not involved in the study. That’s what the study’s authors and physicists more generally are trying to understand, he says.</p>



<p>Protons and neutrons, the subatomic particles that make up atomic nuclei, are essentially <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-particle-physics-proton-gluon-quarks-force">glued together by the strong nuclear force</a> (<em>SN: 9/13/22</em>). But the force can’t hold together nuclei that have wildly skewed ratios of protons to neutrons. Too many of either particle — especially protons, which repel each other due to their positive charge — and the nuclear bucket starts to overflow.</p>



<p>Beyond this overflow point, which physicists call the “drip line,” nuclei cannot fully bind their particles.</p>



<p>“People talk about the drip line as something like the end of the existence of nuclei,” says Marek Płoszajczak, a nuclear physicist at the Grand Accélérateur National d&#8217;Ions Lourds in Caen, France, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>But nuclei <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-isotope-elements-new-particle-accelerator-atom-nucleus">do exist beyond the drip line</a>, if only ephemerally (<em>SN: 11/15/21</em>). To qualify as a nucleus, a handful of protons and neutrons need to hang out together for something like 10<sup>-22</sup> seconds — a blink so brief that more of these moments fit in a second than seconds fit in the age of the universe. Though Heinz notes that’s a somewhat arbitrary definition based mainly on just one previous study.</p>



<p>Scientists searching for nuclei beyond the drip line are testing that definition. “We&#8217;re interested in how far you can go before you no longer can consider these things new nuclei,” says nuclear scientist Robert Charity of Washington University in St. Louis.</p>



<p>Finding a nucleus as far beyond the drip line as nitrogen-9 — five protons beyond — was surprising even for Charity’s team. Until now, scientists had only ever found isotopes up to four protons beyond the drip line.</p>



<p>The atoms of any given element each have a fixed number of protons. But the number of neutrons can vary, creating what are known as isotopes of that element (<em>SN: 9/14/23</em>). Charity and colleagues had been hunting for an isotope of oxygen, oxygen-11, by smashing high-powered beams of oxygen-13 nuclei into beryllium targets and measuring the decay products of short-lived nuclei produced in the collision.</p>



<p>Years after the experiment, Charity says, he noticed decay products in the data that looked like they should have crumbled away from nitrogen-9 nuclei. His theorist colleagues later confirmed that the decay products could really have come from the isotope. It lasts for about 10<sup>-21 </sup>seconds, or about 10 times as long as the minimum cutoff, Charity says.</p>



<p>The statistical strength of the evidence for nitrogen-9 falls right on the knife-edge of what scientists would consider a discovery. But the team really does have “strong evidence” for nitrogen-9, Heinz says. “For me, this sounds really convincing.” And, he says, the possible discovery should come as reassuring news to experimentalists looking for other isotopes beyond the drip line.</p>





<p>As for theorists? Płoszajczak says the new result should give them a “push” to improve their models of nuclei beyond the drip line, which are still rather limited. “These experiments show that the life of the nucleus extends far beyond the drip line.”</p>



<p>When it came to nitrogen-9, experiment beat theory to the punch. But better theories could make it possible to start looking for drippy nuclei on purpose, which would, in turn, make it easier to verify theories. When that happens, “we will start to have a kind of a discussion — a talk with nature,” Płoszajczak says. “Then, I think the whole field will explode. So we are just at the beginning.”</p>

<p>The Lancet today retracted two papers by former Karolinska Institutet surgeon Paolo Macchiarini, whose professional and personal escapades have made headlines for more than a decade and who has been <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/transplant-surgeon-gets-prison-sentence-failed-stem-cell-treatments">sentenced to 30 months in prison for causing bodily harm to his patients</a>.</p>



<p>The move comes a month after Sweden’s National Board for Assessment of Misconduct (NPOF in Swedish) said it had <a href="https://npof.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Decision-in-case-3.2-22-0092_web.pdf">found Macchiarini guilty of misconduct</a> involving the two articles, eight months after the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/13/five-years-on-convicted-transplant-surgeon-earns-expressions-of-concern-from-lancet/">issued expressions of concern for the two papers</a>, and five years after Macchiarini had already been found to have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/07/06/the-final-verdict-lancet-retracts-two-papers-by-macchiarini/">committed misconduct in related work</a>.</p>

<p>The retractions are the third and fourth for Macchiarini from The Lancet, which has faced criticism for many years for how long it took to retract the fraudulent paper by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/09/29/the-doctor-who-fooled-the-world-an-excerpt-from-brian-deers-new-book-about-andrew-wakefield/">Andrew Wakefield and colleagues that has been used as evidence that vaccines cause autism</a>.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Patricia Murray and Peter Wilmshurst, who have been <a href="https://drpeterwilmshurst.wordpress.com/2022/09/25/is-the-lancet-complicit-in-research-fraud/">chronicling the problems in Macchiarini’s work for years</a>, and were among those <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o498">calling in the BMJ</a> for the retraction of one of the now-retracted papers last year, told Retraction Watch they welcomed the decision to retract:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are concerned that the decision to retract the fraudulent articles has taken more than 5 years since the Lancet received irrefutable evidence that the original 2008 paper made false claims and as a result the 2014 paper was also false. The Lancet ignored requests from doctors, scientists and the chairs of the UK Parliament’s Science and Technology Committee and Health and Social Care Committee.</p>

<p>In a comment we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/For-retraction-watch.doc">make available in full here</a>, they continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Again the Lancet’s reputation for correcting the scientific record has been harmed. Some may wonder which other articles in the Lancet the editors are failing to retract when they know they are false.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And, they said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The wider concern is that other senior authors on the 2008 paper and their institutions have known for some years that the article is false.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Murray and Wilmshurst referred specifically to co-author Martin Birchall, formerly of University of Bristol and now at University College London, who they said “continued to perform tracheal transplants using the original false Macchiarini-Birchall technique after Macchiarini stopped doing so.”</p>



<p>They conclude:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It may be no coincidence that while UCL has repeatedly refused to get Birchall to retract the paper, he and his colleagues have been awarded massive grants from public funds to extend the research in this flawed technology at UCL.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-glacier-peru-llamas-climate">At the foot of a melting glacier in Peru, llamas helped revitalize the land</a></h4>

              
                <p>When glaciers melt, they leave behind barren landscapes that can take decades to support plants and animals. But a new study found that within just three years, such exposed land was revitalized by llamas, whose activity nourished the soil and fostered plant growth.</p>



<p>By the foot of Peru’s shrinking Uruashraju glacier, researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-41458-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with local farmers to capture and herd llamas</a> on four designated plots. For three days a month from 2019 to 2022, the llamas (<em>Llama glama</em>) grazed the plots, fertilizing them with dung and dispersing viable seeds from droppings and fur.</p>





<p>By the end of that time, the otherwise arid and easily eroded soil stabilized, grew richer in nutrients and supported 57 percent more plant cover than before, geographer Anaїs Zimmer and colleagues report September 24 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Such a revival of the ancestral Andean practice of camelid herding could potentially cushion the crops, animals and livelihoods of local communities from the impacts of climate change, says Zimmer, of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>



<p>As is the case worldwide, glaciers are disappearing in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca mountains at an unprecedented rate. And as the ice shrinks, nearby ecosystems wither: They lose access to summertime supplies of freshwater and sometimes encounter harmful acidic minerals in rocks once covered by the glaciers.</p>



<p>Llamas may help counter some of these effects. Their transformation of the land, as seen in the new study, could reduce rock weathering and help the soil hold onto more moisture, thus limiting the acidic runoff that can poison farmers’ crops. Such contamination is one reason local farmers partnered with the researchers. The animals’ behavior could one day even generate new pasturelands as soil quality improves.</p>



<p>The idea that herbivore grazing may positively impact a landscape is not new. Nor is rewilding, the push to reintroduce key species to their native ecosystems, unique to the Cordillera Blanca mountains. In Finland, for example, the Indigenous Sami are working to reinstall reindeer in deforested taiga land, potentially restoring it. And a group in Spain hopes one day to lift the wild bovine known as the auroch out of extinction, putting it to use in grazing.</p>



<p>But the size and speed of the changes the llamas helped bring about surprised the researchers. From 2021 to 2022, the average amount of plant cover in the llama plots grew from about 9 percent to nearly 14 percent — faster than it did in four control plots. Four new types of plant species also moved into the experimental plots over the course of the study.</p>



<p>The research underscores the valuable roles animals play in shaping landscapes, says ecologist Kelsey Reider of James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., who was not involved with the new research. Sprinkling nutrients such as phosphorus over the soil can produce similar effects on plant growth, she says, but “the animals themselves are doing a lot.”</p>

<p>For one, animal poo is special: It holds onto both moisture and microbes. For another, in grazing and trampling on plants, the llamas weed out dominant plants, making space for new species.</p>



<p>For the new study, Zimmer and colleagues primarily chose to work with llamas rather than another native camelid, the vicuña, because llamas are easier to herd and make gentler tramplers. And the farmers that the researchers collaborated with were also particularly invested in restoring llama communities, features of Incan religious rituals. Centuries of Spanish conquest replaced llamas and other wild camelids with foreign livestock that uprooted native plants. Bringing llamas back, the farmers think, might slow or reverse the physical and cultural loss.</p>





<p>Zimmer would like to continue the study for at least a decade to track the full effects of the intervention. While the llamas might help a bevy of plants survive in the region, she says, it remains unclear which will stick around, and whether those will ultimately help or harm the ecosystem.</p>



<p>She also notes that the icy mountaintops also hold religious significance for some communities, meaning that as the ice melts away, some feel as though they are “losing their cultural identities.” By 2100, scientists project that the Cordillera Blanca will lose the last of its glaciers as the Earth warms. If further research with llamas bears positive results, Zimmer hopes local government actors might invest in llama herding as a potential adaptation strategy. It can’t bring back the glaciers. But, she says, it may return a sense of agency to local communities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-seismic-data-show-mars-dense-core">Marsquakes and meteorite hits show Mars has a dense liquid metal core</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mars has a heavy heart after all.</p>



<p>The Red Planet has a dense core of liquid iron surrounded by a relatively thin layer of molten rock, researchers report. The finding resolves a recent conundrum that came about when seismic measurements on Mars seemed to suggest that the planet had a surprisingly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seismic-waves-mars-core">large, light core</a> rich in low-density elements (<em>SN: 4/24/23</em>).</p>



<p>The new view, described in two studies in the Oct. 26 <em>Nature</em>, shows the planet is made of materials common in the solar system at the time Mars formed. A lighter core would have required a mix of elements that wouldn’t have matched the proportions in the dust and debris that eventually became the solar system.</p>



<p>The researchers deduced the structure of Mars’ interior by studying seismic waves detected with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-nasa-insight-lander-learned-about-mars-magnetism-quakes">NASA’s InSight lander</a> (<em>SN: 2/24/20</em>). It measured Marsquakes and reverberations from meteorite impacts on the planet for a little over four years.</p>

The reverberations from a meteor impact on Mars (upper right) led to seismic waves that dipped into the molten rock, revealing the existence of a smaller, denser iron core.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132667">N. Starter/CNES/IPGP</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Waves reflecting from the molten rock layer were initially interpreted as bouncing from the outer edge of a core with a radius of about 1,800 kilometers and a density of 6,200 kilograms per cubic meter. The new research added data from seismic waves that dip into that molten layer to reveal the planet’s true heart.</p>



<p>The core has a roughly 10 percent smaller radius and a higher density than previously reported, with one group finding a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06586-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">density of 6,650 kilograms per cubic meter</a>, and the other finding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06601-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6,500 kilograms per cubic meter</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A better understanding of Mars has implications far beyond the Red Planet. Mars and Earth were very similar when they first formed, says planetary scientist Henri Samuel of CNRS in Paris, and a coauthor of one of the new studies. “However, at some point these two planets diverged and Mars is now not habitable while the Earth is. Therefore, understanding how this divergence has occurred can tell us a lot [about] our own planet.”</p>

<p>A diabetes researcher who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/08/19/judge-dismisses-defamation-suit-against-diabetes-journal/">lost a defamation suit</a> against a journal that marked four of his papers with expressions of concern now has four more papers flagged – by the same journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Diabetes</em>, a journal of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), placed expressions of concern on four papers led or co-authored by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-author/mario-saad/">Mario Saad</a>, of the University of Campinas (Unicamp) in Brazil on October 23.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saad sued the ADA in 2015 after <em>Diabetes</em> marked four other papers with similar notices. A judge dismissed the suit, and the journal later <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/24/lawsuit-couldnt-stop-four-retractions-for-diabetes-researcher-who-also-added-two-expressions-of-concern/">retracted the papers</a> (for which <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/05/dirt-award-cleaning-scientific-literature/">we recognized them</a> with a DiRT — Doing the Right Thing — award). Saad is now up to 19 retractions, by <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSaad%252c%2bMario%2bJose%2bAbdalla">our count</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128116"></span>



<p>In March of this year, sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">Elisabeth Bik</a> pointed out images in the four papers with “remarkably similar” elements. The expressions of concern identify the same images as problematic, either containing a “panel duplication” or appearing “unexpectedly similar” to images in other papers from the same lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collectively, the articles have been cited nearly 500 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Their titles are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saad has not responded to our request for comment. He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/24/lawsuit-couldnt-stop-four-retractions-for-diabetes-researcher-who-also-added-two-expressions-of-concern/">previously told us</a> <em>Diabetes</em>’ decision to retract his papers was “unfair and a persecution”:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-new-deep-sea-coral-reefs-galapagos">See the wonders of two newfound deep-sea coral reefs off the Galápagos</a></h4>

              
                <p>Four decades ago, warm waters from an El Niño event killed off nearly all the corals surrounding the Galápagos. Most coral reefs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gal%C3%A1pagos-waters-preview-future-corals">never recovered</a> (<em>SN: 1/9/15</em>). But in recent months, researchers have discovered vast landscapes of thriving corals in deeper waters surrounding the equatorial islands.</p>



<p>In April, scientists documented the <a href="https://www.darwinfoundation.org/en/blog-articles/887-scientists-discover-pristine-deep-sea-coral-reefs-in-the-galapagos-marine-reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first pristine deep coral reef</a> found in the region, dubbed Cacho De Coral, which sits atop the ridge of an underwater volcano and stretches about 250 meters. On October 26, a second team announced the discovery of an even bigger reef, this one more than 800 meters long, spanning the length of eight football fields. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With coral reefs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-ocean-heat-florida-climate-change">around the globe in peril</a> due to climate change, the finds are a small piece of good news (<em>SN: 8/9/23</em>). These newfound reefs within the Galápagos Islands Marine Reserve have so far been protected from human influence and the direct impacts of warming waters.</p>

<p>The newest reef was discovered when oceanographer Stuart Banks and colleagues set out on a 30-day expedition to explore parts of the ocean using a remotely operated robot named SuBastian. While in the Galápagos Islands Marine Reserve, which included a visit to Cacho De Coral, the team spotted a second reef.</p>



<p>“It’s like coming into your house and realizing that you’ve got a basement that you never knew was there,” says Banks, of the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos. “And it’s full of really cool stuff.”</p>





<p>The newly identified reefs are in cold waters up to 420 meters below the surface, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, a nonprofit based in Palo Alto, Calif., that operates ocean research vessels, announced in a news release. Such a location probably helped corals living there remain pristine. Unlike corals that flourish in warm, shallow water with lots of sunlight to fuel symbiotic algae, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nearly-200-great-barrier-reef-coral-species-also-live-deep-sea">deep-sea corals survive in darker parts of the ocean</a> that don’t warm up as quickly under climate change (<em>SN: 12/11/18</em>).</p>



<p>It’s rare to find so much living coral in one spot, and scientists often need to get close to glimpse everything that’s hiding inside rocky reefs, Banks says. “Seeing these things for the first time is always a big ‘wow.’”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-cancer-cells-bacteria-viruses-energy">Human cancer cells might slurp up bacteria-killing viruses for energy</a></h4>

              
                <p>From our nose to our lungs to our guts, the human body is home to a diverse range of microorganisms. Such rich microbial ecosystems are prime hunting grounds for viruses that infect and kill bacteria. But how these bacteria-killing viruses interact with human cells has remained mysterious.</p>



<p>Past research has shown that human cells can slurp up bacteria-killing viruses when a cell ingests a large amount of the fluid surrounding it. Microbiologist Jeremy Barr wanted to know if the ingested viruses have any effect on the cell’s immune response.</p>





<p>To his surprise, Barr instead found that <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mammalian cancer cells grown in the lab use the viruses as a food source</a>. The results, published in the Oct. 26 <em>PLOS Biology</em>, show that it’s possible for mammalian cells to use bacteria-killing viruses as fuel — meaning normal, noncancerous cells could do it too, though this remains to be seen.</p>



<p>This nascent line of work upends traditional biological dogma, says Barr of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “You&#8217;re told that [phages] just do not interact with mammalian cells,” he says. “And that&#8217;s completely false. They do.”</p>



<p>Bacteria-killing viruses, called bacteriophages, are ubiquitous in the human body. <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-virology-111821-111322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cells in our body ingest up to 30 billion phages each day</a>, Barr estimates. To test how the phages interact with mammalian cells, the researchers experimented with human and dog cancer cells, mainly because they are easy to cultivate in the lab. The team grew the cancer cells in an environment flush with bacteriophage T4, a common virus that preys on <em>E. coli</em>.</p>



<p>Barr’s team then used a battery of antibodies, each of which binds to a specific type of protein, to determine the proteins the cells made in response to the phage. Though the researchers expected to see more proteins involved in inflammation, part of the cell’s immune response, they instead saw changes in the amounts of proteins involved in cell growth and division. “Cells that had been given phage were actually growing at a faster rate,” Barr says. This suggests that “they&#8217;re using the phages as a food source.”</p>



<p>Because the cells used in this study were grown in a lab and come from established lines of cells used for research, we can’t yet be sure that cells in the bodies of humans and other mammals behave the same way, says Paul Bollyky, an immunologist at Stanford University. “Cell lines are funny creatures,” he says. “They do things energetically that are probably closer to tumor biology than to normal cell biology, so it can be difficult to extrapolate.”</p>



<p>Still, “this is a really exciting and trailblazing study from a group that&#8217;s doing excellent work,” Bollyky says. “Like a lot of good science, this study really raises questions.”</p>



<p>Barr says he next wants to investigate whether noncancerous cells derived from a living animal also snack on phages. He also plans to examine more phages, especially viruses that — like T4 — live in our guts, and others that are being used in phage therapy, where viruses are used instead of antibiotics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-virus-phage-shigellosis-arms-race">to kill infectious bacteria</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/21</em>). “We know they kill the bacterial hosts, but what are they doing to the human host?” Barr asks. “How do they interact?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-female-chimps-menopause">Surprisingly long-lived wild female chimps go through menopause</a></h4>

              
                <p>Female chimps living in an East African forest experience menopause and then survive years, even decades, after becoming biologically unable to reproduce.</p>



<p>The apes are the first known examples of wild, nonhuman primates to go through the fertility-squelching hormonal changes and live well beyond their reproductive years.</p>



<p>The finding <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add5473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raises new questions about how menopause evolved</a>, UCLA evolutionary anthropologist Brian Wood and colleagues conclude in the Oct. 27 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Until now, females who experience menopause and keep living for years have been documented only in humans and five whale species. It’s unclear what evolutionary benefit exists to explain such longevity past the point of being able to give birth and pass on one’s genes.</p>





<p>Although evolutionary explanations for menopause remain debatable, the new finding reflects an especially close genetic relationship between humans and chimps, Wood says. “Both [species] are more predisposed to post-reproductive survival than other great apes.”</p>



<p>Some evidence suggests that female fertility ends at similar ages in humans and chimps (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>) if our ape relatives live long enough, says anthropologist Kristen Hawkes of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. But in other studies, female chimps, such as those studied by Jane Goodall at Tanzania’s Gombe National Park starting in 1960, aged quickly and often died in their early 30s, usually while still having menstrual cycles, she says.</p>



<p>“What’s surprising [in Wood’s study] is so many females living so long after menopause,” Hawkes says.</p>



<p>Wood’s team examined mortality and fertility rates of 185 females in the Ngogo community of wild chimps in Kibale National Park in Uganda during field seasons that ran from 1995 through 2016. By first assessing chimps when they were young or middle-aged, the researchers were able to get an accurate read on the animals’ ages.</p>



<p>Hormonal measures of fertility declined after age 30, and the researchers observed no births in chimps older than 50. A total of 16 Ngogo females lived past age 50, some into their 60s. Urine samples taken from 66 Ngogo females, ages 14 to 67, revealed a decline in fertility starting after age 30 that terminated reproduction by around age 50. Menopause also results in an end to women’s reproduction at about age 50, Wood says.</p>



<p>In the Ngogo community, females, on average, live 20 percent of their adult years — defined as starting at age 14 — after having lost the ability to reproduce, the scientists estimate.</p>

<p>Wild chimps’ social lives do not fit a scenario, previously suggested by Hawkes and others, for the evolution of human menopause. Women, the idea goes, may live so long past their reproductive years because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grandmothers-survival-evolution">grandmothers provide vital care to their grandchildren</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/19</em>). But female chimps move to new communities from their native ones during adolescence. Grandmothers usually have no breeding daughters nearby whom they can assist.</p>



<p>Another possibility is that older female chimps may possess experience and knowledge necessary for group survival. Related evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-whales-follow-postmenopausal-leaders">older female killer whales often lead salmon hunts</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/15</em>).</p>



<p>Or, the researchers suggest, an absence of predation by leopards due to human hunting in the 1960s, plentiful food sources and successful competition with nearby chimp groups may have supported a temporary emergence of long life spans among Ngogo females. Similarly, female survival long beyond the reproductive years also occurs in chimps, and some other mammals, that are fed and protected from predators in zoos and other captive settings.</p>





<p>But responses of captive animals offer little insight into how menopause may have evolved in the wild, Wood says.</p>



<p>Ngogo chimps inhabit a forest that has been protected from logging and exposure to deadly respiratory infections carried by humans, perhaps aiding male and female chimp longevity, the researchers say. Male chimps in the group live about as long as females do. Menopause may have evolved in chimps living in relatively undisturbed settings, such as Kibale, due to young females migrating to new groups, Wood says. <a></a></p>



<p>After these moves, aging females having kids become increasingly related to other breeders of both sexes and their offspring. At advanced ages, females with local kin — perhaps in ancient human groups as well as chimp communities — evolved to stop reproducing so that young females bringing fresh genes to the community could conceive new generations, the team suggests.</p>



<p>But Duke University evolutionary biologist Susan Alberts doubts that females in a slow-reproducing species such as chimps become genetically related to enough individuals in a new group for that evolutionary scenario to have played out.</p>



<p>Instead, the unusually potent longevity-enhancing conditions for Ngogo chimps may enable females to display an evolved capacity for surviving well beyond the reproductive years, Alberts says.</p>



<p>Alberts and colleagues previously analyzed long-term reproductive data for seven nonhuman primate species — including chimps — and a population of African hunter-gatherers. Females in the nonhuman primate species could survive reproductive declines for a year or two, but lower death rates in hunter-gatherers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1311857110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulted in extended lives after menopause</a>, Alberts says. “Menopause may be a latent trait in primates that gets revealed as mortality rates decline,” she says.</p>



<p>Few wild chimp communities have been studied as thoroughly and for as long as the Ngogo crowd. That makes the new menopause findings tough to generalize to wild chimps living elsewhere. “We still don’t know much about most chimps’ lives,” Alberts says.</p>

<p>A controversial paper on the safety and immunogenicity of an Iran-made COVID-19 vaccine is being investigated by the U.S.-based publisher Wiley, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>Iran reportedly has already administered <a href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1101482/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85%DB%8C-%DB%B2-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85">3 million doses</a> of the vaccine, dubbed Noora, which the country <a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/470601/Noora-vaccine-receives-emergency-use-license">licensed for emergency use</a> last year.</p>



<p>The paper describes the vaccine’s first test in humans, marking the only time results from the clinical development of the homegrown shot have been reported in international journals.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28097">Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant receptor-binding domain-based protein subunit vaccine (Noora vaccine<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) against COVID-19 in adults: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial</a>” was published in 2022 in the <em>Journal of Medical Virology</em>, an achievement <a href="https://www.farsnews.ir/news/14010720000204/%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-2-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1">highlighted</a> in Iranian news media. One report said the study showed a dose of 80 micrograms of the vaccine was <a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/477532/Clinical-studies-of-Noora-vaccine-published-in-Medical-Virology">“safe” and provided “adequate immunity in adults.”</a> </p>



<span id="more-128108"></span>



<p>But in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.28731">a commentary</a> published in May 2023, in the same journal, <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=2934">Donald Forthal</a>, chief of the University of California, Irvine&#8217;s Division of Infectious Diseases, expressed surprise that “a manuscript containing so many serious flaws would have been accepted for publication following peer review, and given these issues, a retraction may be in order.”</p>



<p>Among several problems, Forthal wrote, was that more than 80% of the placebo group had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, “which is very surprising and unexpected, and raises the possibility that occult COVID‐19 infections could have confounded the results across all cohorts.”</p>



<p>Forthal, who studies the immune response to viral infections, also raised doubts about the serum samples from convalescent patients, which were used as a benchmark to gauge the vaccine’s ability to elicit protective antibodies:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Who are the convalescent serum donors? If they are largely asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, or if they are months out from infection, the titers will be low, thereby providing a favorably biased comparator for the vaccine‐induced titers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The results overall also raise concern about the clinical efficacy of the Noora vaccine at preventing COVID‐19 infection in a population, as 60% (9/15) of recipients of the 80 mcg dose series developed virus‐neutralizing antibody titers of less than 1/16th the level observed in most of the convalescent serum samples tested. By contrast, the Novavax recombinant spike protein vaccine generated mean virus‐neutralizing antibody titers greater than fourfold that of symptomatic COVID‐19 outpatients.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Forthal also flagged “a systematic problem with the references, as many of the citations are incorrect and not relevant to the issue discussed.” And he said a glaring conflict of interest had not been stated: Several authors were employees of Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, in Iran, “which funded the study and has developed the vaccine for commercial purposes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, an anonymous commenter <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/179DB7875D6760293758F6CBD3900D">summarized Forthal’s concerns</a> on PubPeer, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The deficiencies in this publication raise serious questions about the effectiveness of the Noora vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection. More than four months after publication of the Letter to the Editor, there has been no published response from the authors of the original paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither the corresponding authors nor the university responded to requests for comments.</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson said the publisher was “aware of the concerns” and that an “investigation is currently ongoing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shou-Jiang Gao, the journal’s editor-in-chief, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Upon receiving the comments [from Forthal], the authors have submitted a &#8220;response&#8221; and it is currently under a third round of revision. </p>



<p>The original article had undergone rigorously [sic] review by experts of the field before it was published. In fact, it underwent 2 rounds of reviews, each with 2 reviewers. The &#8220;response&#8221; that the authors have submitted has already undergone 3 rounds of review, each with 2 reviewers. The last decision was made on October 24, 2023 and deadline for submitting the revision is November 23, 2023. So, we are waiting for the authors to submit the last revision before accepting and publishing it. This should fully address the issues that are raised.  </p>



<p>Dr. Donald Forthal has reached out to us many, many times and we have updated him the status [sic]. We believe this should go through a fair evaluation and peer review process, which takes some time. We ask you and him to be patient when this runs through the due review course.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Noora vaccine is among several COVID-19 vaccines available in Iran. Only the results of the phase 1 trial have been published in an international journal, but the vaccine reportedly has also undergone phase 2 and 3 testing and was found to be <a href="https://dolat.ir/detail/391516">94% effective</a>, according to Iranian health authorities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-squeezing-ligo-gravitational-waves">How quantum ‘squeezing’ will help LIGO detect more gravitational waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Putting the squeeze on light improves gravitational wave observatories.</p>



<p>An upgrade to one such observatory, LIGO, that comes from exploiting a quantum rule known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle makes it easier to spot spacetime ripples that arise from some of the cosmos’s most violent events.</p>



<p>As a result, LIGO should detect up to 65 percent <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/2507bK60Qb81c00f36d98e151e24c0cc4de92490e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more collisions between massive objects like black holes and neutron stars</a> than it would without the upgrade, researchers report in an upcoming issue of <em>Physical Review X</em>.</p>





<p>To look for gravitational waves, LIGO researchers rely on laser light that moves in a detector between mirrors placed four kilometers apart. But light is subject to a version of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that ensures the more you know about the intensity of a light signal, the less you know about its frequency. That limits how well researchers can spot gravitational waves.</p>



<p>In 2019, LIGO scientists turned to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-gravitational-wave-detector-quantum-upgrade">quantum “squeezing,”</a> which, in effect, reduced uncertainty in the laser’s frequency and increased uncertainty in its intensity (<em>SN: 2/15/19</em>). That allowed the researchers to turn up the laser’s power and improve LIGO’s ability to spot waves of higher frequencies. But turning the power up further would have made measuring lower-frequency waves harder by adding a low-frequency rumble to the signal.</p>



<p>The solution, described in the new study, was to use quantum squeezing to reduce uncertainty in the laser’s intensity at low frequencies, while reducing the frequency uncertainty in higher-frequency measurements.</p>



<p>Even next-generation gravitational wave observatories will benefit from the new result, says physicist Lisa Barsotti of MIT. “The beauty is you can do both. You can push the limit of what is possible from the technology of laser power and mirror [design], and then do squeezing on top of that.”<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

<p>A cancer researcher who lost nine papers in one day as a publisher purged articles offered in “authorship-for-sale” schemes told Retraction Watch he and his co-authors “will soon defend ourselves legally.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, the publisher Frontiers announced it had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/08/frontiers-retracts-nearly-40-papers-linked-to-authorship-for-sale/">retracted 38 papers</a> after its research integrity team found links to the practice of buying and selling authorship positions. Brokers list advertisements for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/">authorships of scientific papers</a> on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/07/introducing-two-sites-that-claim-to-sell-authorships-on-scientific-papers/">dedicated websites</a> as well as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/13/after-a-sleuth-reveals-a-paper-with-authorships-advertised-for-sale-its-retracted/">social media</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nine of the 38 articles Frontiers retracted listed <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dJarahian%252c%2bMostafa">Mostafa Jarahian</a>, formerly of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, as a co-author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we initially reported on the large batch of retractions, one of Jarahian’s co-authors shared an article from Frontiers&nbsp; indicating the publisher had decided to retract the paper after “concerns were brought to our attention from the German Cancer Research Center regarding the authorship of the article.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128102"></span>



<p>A draft retraction notice included in the email said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the German Cancer Research Center contacted the editorial office stating that the author Mostafa Jarahian is not an employee.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We reached out to Jarahian at the time, but didn’t hear back until recently. He shared with us an email from Martin R. Berger, who had led the DKFZ’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210928074332/https://www.dkfz.de/en/abteilungen/fspg/g401.php">Toxicology and Chemotherapy</a> research group with Jarahian as a member, to Frontiers. Berger confirmed to us that he sent the email, which disputed the publisher’s reasons for retracting Jarahian’s articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Berger wrote that Jarahian had been a member of the DKFZ since 2001, and part of Berger’s department from 2017 until leaving in 2020. All <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dJarahian%252c%2bMostafa">nine retracted papers</a> were submitted in 2021, according to the articles’ webpages, and published either that year or in 2022. Berger wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As I understand the situation, the only allegation, which is correct, is that the article(s) under concern was (were) labelled with his old affiliation. On the other hand, there is some period after leaving an institution, during which it is normal to use the old affiliation, as the work originated and was carried out there. In addition, during the period in question, Dr. Jarahian did not have a new position / new employer. In this situation, he used his private email address, which clearly differs from official DKFZ email addresses.</p>



<p>Finally, the science of the article(s) is not being disputed. In addition, the co-authors have not been involved in any accusation regarding science integrity. Therefore, it does not seem appropriate, to harm all authors because of a minor mistake of one author. If you deem it necessary to establish justice in this regard, I suggest that you allow Dr. Jarahian to write a short erratum.</p>



<p>If you can follow this suggestion, you would solve the underlying problem with distinction and grace and avoid the punishment of many co-authors. In the case, in which a PhD is pending on a publication, this would seem clearly unfair and exaggerated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Berger told us he had not received any response from Frontiers, which he said was “sad as well as a nuisance.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jarahian said he and his co-authors had not taken legal action yet, “but we intend to do it.” He did not respond further when we asked him to comment on Frontiers’ finding that his retracted papers had author positions posted for sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Frontiers spokesperson told us the publisher was “confident in our decision” and had “received no indication of legal action by Mostafa Jarahian against Frontiers to date.” The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction decision was a result of a thorough investigation by the Frontiers’ Research Integrity team. The concerns over ‘authorship for sale’ were flagged via Pubpeer, a valuable source of community feedback, of the adverts for several of Dr Jarahian&#8217;s publications (<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/3E7C467522CEB092CBB5307B59E0DF#12">here</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/CE62E7EA89923F67BCE0AD9030A73C#2">here).</a> Similar concerns of authorship abnormalities were highlighted in articles published by the same author group elsewhere (for example, see <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8CAE625CBAB294FEF50B2ABC1011B1#1">here</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E0115C166B09F70885F7452CF6AFD1#1">here</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the direct discussions with the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), the institution confirmed that&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Dr Jarahian was no longer an employee (the tenure finished in February 2020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>DKFZ was not aware of any of the 9 articles, all of which were submitted and published in 2021.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We shared the details of our investigation with the Committee on Publication Ethics (<a href="https://publicationethics.org/">COPE).</a> The Committee subsequently confirmed that Frontiers had followed adequate processes consistent with COPE expectations to assess the concerns and correct the published record.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-water-river-salmon-fish-climate">Pumping cold water into rivers could act as ‘air conditioning’ for fish</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PITTSBURGH</strong> — Salmon may now have their own version of human air conditioning. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This past summer, hundreds of fish in the Wrights River in Nova Scotia, Canada, found reprieve from the heat in <a href="https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2023AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/392393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human-generated plumes of cold water</a>, civil engineer Kathryn Smith reported October 17 at the Geological Society of America meeting. The work, though only proof of concept, could aid efforts to conserve cold-water species amid the widespread <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-waves-rivers-united-states-fish-plants-water-quality">warming of rivers</a> due to climate change (<em>SN: 10/20/22</em>).</p>





<p>When water temperatures get too hot, fish can become stressed or even die. In rivers, Atlantic salmon and other cold-water species sometimes escape the heat by flocking to cooler areas, which often arise near groundwater springs or relatively cool tributaries.</p>



<p>Lots of work has been done to preserve and augment these naturally occurring refuges, said Smith, of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, “but there hasn’t really been an emphasis or focus on if we can create cold-water habitat.”</p>



<p>So she and her colleagues pumped groundwater that was about 9° Celsius (or about 48° Fahrenheit) from a nearby well into the river, manifesting an artificial plume of water that could be as much as 20 degrees Celsius cooler than the surrounding water.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="266" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/102423_N_fish-cooling-stations_thermal_inline.jpg" alt="Two images side by side.

A thermal image (right) shows the effect: Cooler water appears darker purple while warmer water and sun-baked rocks are orange and yellow.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3132582">Kathryn Smith</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The plume attracted several hundred fish of varying life stages and species, including Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Most were alevins — juvenile fish still attached to yolk sacs — that occupied the plume throughout the tests. But when a heat wave brought on maximum water temperatures of about 30° C, more mature fish also took shelter in the plume.</p>



<p>For a pump-free approach, the team also rerouted some water from the river into an underground trench, where it cooled before reentering the river. Though this method lowered the water temperature by only a few degrees Celsius, fish were observed frequenting the passively cooled flow throughout the summer.</p>



<p>More work lies ahead to determine how many of these sites would need to be constructed and sustained to significantly benefit fish populations, and how to do so while keeping energy costs low, says John Ackerman, a consulting engineer based in Hazleton, Pa., who was not involved in the research. But the researchers are demonstrating that these solutions can work, he says. “The concept is solid.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-feathers-bird-fossils">Dinosaur feathers may have been more birdlike than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many feathered dinosaurs couldn’t fly — at least, not like birds do today. But the reptiles’ feathers may have been more birdlike than scientists thought.</p>



<p>In 2019, fossil analyses found that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1815703116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feathers from a flightless dinosaur</a> mostly contained a different, more flexible form of the keratin protein that makes up modern bird beaks, scales and feathers. Researchers suggested then that feathers had evolved molecularly over time to become stiffer as birds — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-shrank-continually-birds">the last living dinosaurs</a> — took to the skies (<em>SN: 7/31/14</em>).</p>





<p>Yet <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02177-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fossilization can change feather proteins</a>, making one keratin protein resemble another, researchers report in the October <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>. &nbsp;The team also presented their findings on October 19 at the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology&#8217;s annual meeting in Cincinnati.</p>



<p>The study raises the possibility that dinosaur feathers may have mainly contained the beta-keratin proteins found in bird feathers. While such a finding would not imply all feathered dinosaurs flew, it does raise new questions about feather evolution.</p>



<p>The work also gives scientists valuable insight into one way the fossil record may transform over time, says Julia Clarke, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the new research. “There’s still a lot more to discover about the process of chemical alteration that all structures undergo during the process of rock formation, liquification and burial,” she says.</p>



<p>For the new study, paleontologist Tiffany Slater of University College Cork in Ireland and colleagues placed modern bird feathers under heat conditions that mimic what deeply buried dinosaur feathers may have endured during fossilization. Beta-keratins in the feathers unfolded and reformed in the shape of alpha-keratins, the more flexible form previously found to be dominant in dinosaur feathers, suggesting that a similar process had occurred in those feathers.</p>



<p>The researchers next examined a roughly 50-million-year-old bird feather and a 125-million-year-old feather from the nonavian dinosaur <em>Sinornithosaurus</em>. To their surprise, the bird feather seemed to consist mainly of alpha-keratins. Since it should have been rich in the beta variety, the team suspects that the proteins transformed during fossilization. The dinosaur feather, by contrast, contained mainly beta-keratins, suggesting it wasn’t exposed to enough heat to morph its proteins.</p>



<p>The simplest interpretation is that the distorting effects of fossilization led previous researchers astray in thinking dinosaur and bird feathers were so different molecularly, Slater says.</p>



<p>But the conditions the team tested in the new study may not accurately replicate what occurred during centuries of burial, says molecular paleontologist Mary Schweitzer of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who was involved in the 2019 research.</p>



<p>In her own work, feathers exposed to even higher temperatures preserved their proteins well when kept in sediment, rather than removed from it as in the current study. The effect fossilization has on feather proteins may be more complex and as yet misunderstood, she believes.</p>



<p>Scientists increasingly think that feathers did not evolve for flight. Instead, they probably kept dinosaurs warm and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-feathered-dino-shows-its-colors">helped them attract mates</a> (<em>SN: 2/4/10</em>). But some nonavian dinosaurs did <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-birds-could-achieve-liftoff">launch themselves into the air</a> and glide from place to place (<em>SN: 10/28/16</em>). And some that couldn’t fly still <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-running-gait-reveals-insights-history-bird-flight">flapped their wings as they ran</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/19</em>).</p>



<p>If feathers are only one piece of the puzzle of how flight evolved, keratin composition may be an even smaller sliver, says Matthew Shawkey, a biologist at Ghent University in Belgium, who wasn’t involved in the new research. “Would a feather made of alpha-keratin really be so flimsy?” he asks. “I just don’t know.”</p>





<p>More important for the evolution of flight, he thinks, may be the shape of feathers, whether they have veins, and how they are arranged relative to one another.</p>

                <p>Berkley Walker didn’t plan on becoming a scientist; he wanted to be an entrepreneur. And he got started early on that goal: In high school in Portland, Ore., he started a granola bar company, which helped pay for his bachelor’s degree in microbiology.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>After college, Walker went to work as a product manager at an instrumentation company in Washington state, planning to go to business school and then into biotech. But a class on environmental biophysics at nearby Washington State University in 2009 changed his trajectory. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The course was about using mathematics to model physical systems in nature. “Working that math out to understand how energy and matter exchange within the environment,” Walker says — that was all it took. He decided to pursue a career as a plant scientist. “I wanted to have some kind of usefulness to the world,” Walker says. “Feeding people is where I settled.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Amazing but inefficient plants</h4>



<p>Today, at Michigan State University, Walker wants to understand the intricate details of how photosynthesis works, with the ultimate aim of improving it.</p>



<p>He remains deeply fascinated by plants: “You just take this little seed, you put it in the dirt and then you get this plant,” he says. “And it spreads these leaves out. And those leaves just take the sun, and they scrub carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and they use that to make the food that we eat, the clothes that we wear, the air that we breathe, energy that we consume. And that’s just miraculous.”</p>



<p>But as impressive as photosynthesis is, it is surprisingly inefficient. A leaf converts just around 1 percent of the sun’s light into usable energy, Walker says. In part that’s because of mistakes in the first step of photosynthesis. The enzyme that captures CO<sub>2</sub> molecules and sticks them to sugar makes a lot of mistakes, often grabbing oxygen instead. Those mistakes result in a compound that actually inhibits photosynthesis. Photorespiration, a kind of recycling process, gets rid of that compound — but photorespiration requires a lot of energy.</p>



<p>Losses due to this recycling in the American Midwest over an average wheat and soybean growing season <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-043015-111709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add up to about 148 trillion dietary calories</a>, Walker says. “If you were to convert these calories into doughnut equivalents,” he says, “you would have a stack of doughnuts that would go to the moon and back about 11 times.”</p>



<p>Any efficiency gain could make a huge difference in agricultural productivity. But first scientists have to better understand how photorespiration works.</p>



<p>To that end, Walker came up with an innovative technique to trace carbon molecules in leaves, research reported in a 2022 paper in <em>Nature Plants</em>. The researchers were using flux analysis, which reveals the movements of molecules through plants’ metabolic network. But they needed a better way to freeze the metabolism of a plant. The problem was, there was no way to spray liquid nitrogen into the instrument chamber that held the leaves.</p>



<p>After talking to engineers at the company that makes the instrument, Walker decided to drill a hole in the chamber so his team could insert a nozzle to spray in liquid nitrogen and hit the leaf surface instantaneously. “That’s a really critical step,” says Xinyu Fu, who has been a postdoc in Walker’s lab for the past four years. A lot could change in the 10 seconds it would take to open the chamber and take the leaf out.</p>

<p>The work revealed that up to about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-022-01294-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent of the carbon-bearing amino acid serine that is produced during photorespiration</a> gets diverted by the plant to be used for something — perhaps protein synthesis — rather than going all the way through the recycling process. That suggests optimizing photorespiration in the context of climate change could result in more nutritious, protein-rich crops. But, “as we’re trying to change it,” Walker says, “we need to understand what trade-offs there might be.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A generosity of spirit</h4>





<p>Colleagues who know Walker best point to his eagerness to collaborate as one of his strengths, along with his generosity of spirit.</p>



<p>Don Ort, a plant scientist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Walker’s postdoc adviser for nearly three years, says Walker is a committed teacher and colleague. “Being involved in the education of graduate students and postdocs is a passion for him,” Ort says. “He’s very passionate about what he does. He does it with a very high level of enthusiasm and a very high level of optimism. And it’s infectious to people around him.”</p>



<p>Walker sees plant science as one big community that is trying to solve two big problems: How to make crops more productive to feed a growing population, and how to do it in a changing climate, which may pose any number of challenges to agriculture. And he believes we’ll start seeing solutions in the coming decades, whether they come out of his lab or someone else’s.</p>



<p>“Whoever comes up with those, and if they’re shown to work and work repeatedly in a lot of crops, then that&#8217;s a really big deal,” he says. “That&#8217;s the kind of idea that we&#8217;re chasing.”</p>

                <p><strong>A STEM degree can take you many places besides the lab but deciding what to do after graduating can be tricky. Ana Mosciuk reflects on her own journey back and forth between the lab and 'alternative' careers, with insights on the realities of these various jobs to help you match your own skills and interests to the right path.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_1fddd2d37eae47049a8ebd29f1a6acf6~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_940,h_658,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>I have finished my MSc dissertation and completed my research internship. After the 'congratulations', the question everyone has been asking is 'which lab will you work at?'. But the truth is, I'm not sure whether I want to stay in research at all.</p>

<p>Going into this MSc in Clinical, Social and Cognitive Neuroscience at City, University of London, my plan was to apply for a PhD and pursue a traditional career in a research lab but the more I think about it, I no longer feel that it’s the right path for me. </p>

<p>I decided to take some time and explore other career options in neuroscience, and reflecting on my study and work experiences has helped me to figure out what I want to do next. </p>

<p>I came to the UK from Lithuania in 2013 to study a BSc in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Westminster (London) with a dream to become a research scientist. In the summer following my second year, I landed my first research placement.</p>

<p>I worked on the kinetic analysis of oestrogen receptor ligand interactions in breast cancer tissue, and learnt a whole range of cell biology techniques, but my first lab experience wasn’t what I expected it to be. I thought that I’d spend a lot of time conducting experiments and analysing results but in reality, many of my lab days consisted of filling out health and safety forms and doing literature reviews. I didn’t really get a chance to learn about the topic in more depth, and the tasks I was assigned were often repetitive. I did find a positive result in the end, but I was frustrated to not participate in the analysis of this data. It’s fairly typical for an early undergraduate student interning in the lab for the first time to have limited  responsibilities. Your first lab experience gives you a chance to build some initial lab skills under the supervision of lecturers or postgraduate students and then, as you become a more experienced student, you can be given more responsibility and time to invest in the background of the research. </p>

<p>My hope was that working on my own research project during my final year of my undergraduate degree would be different because I would be in charge of choosing the research question, designing the experiment and analysing data. This was true but unfortunately, I ended up assigned to a project outside of my interests. Although I enjoyed being at the forefront of research with that buzz of discovery, it was quite discouraging to keep working on the subject I wasn’t passionate about, and my love for science started to fade away. </p>

<p>6 months passed, I handed in my dissertation, graduated, and told myself I was done with the lab once and for all.</p>

<p>The first stop on my career journey was trying out teaching because I had some tutoring experience and I enjoy explaining scientific concepts to others. I thought it could be fun working on school projects and encouraging young people to get into science. </p>

<p>After a year of giving private science lessons, I enjoyed thinking about science from a new angle and finding new ways to make difficult concepts engaging and accessible, but I felt that I was no longer learning anything new myself. I wanted to stay up to date with scientific discoveries and contribute to new ones - my passion for science was starting to come back! </p>

<p>In my free time I continued reading scientific papers that interested me. I started to search for new opportunities and came across science writing vacancies. </p>

<p>I landed a job with a media agency and began writing health articles for a self-care app. I also started freelance writing for medical professionals and lifestyle companies. I enjoyed writing on various health topics, knowing that my articles could help people improve their lives and learn how to be healthier. </p>

<p>Then, in January 2020, the pandemic hit and soon we entered lockdown. Like many, I was working long and lonely hours at home and it had a serious impact on my mental health. </p>

<p>A few of my clients were asking me to write more articles about mental health problems and I began to learn more about how the brain works in health and disease. That’s when my love for science and discoveries was properly sparked again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I started to think about research again. I finally knew my area of interest and had read a lot of literature for my writing job, so it was time to give my research career another go!</p>

<p>That’s when I decided to pursue a graduate degree in neuroscience. I applied and got accepted for an MSc in Clinical, Social and Cognitive Neuroscience at City, University of London which combined teaching with a research internship.</p>

<p>I started my studies in October 2021 and, dedicated to my reignited goal of being a research scientist, I reached out to one of my lecturers for a chance to work with him on a decision-making study alongside the course. I also conducted my own research for my dissertation, studying emotion recognition.</p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_09a1e387f4284dd7ad52136aa24507c5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_781,h_516,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Ana working with course mate Adrianna in the EEG lab." ></figure><p>I really enjoyed designing an experiment and analysing data, but my experience of working in the lab was quite isolating. I was often frustrated by the slow progress of data collection by factors outside of my own control, like participants cancelling their appointments at the last minute. </p>

<p>What I <em>did </em>really enjoy was reading scientific literature and explaining neuroscientific concepts in simple terms to wider audiences - it felt more immediately impactful.</p>

<p>Realising this, when I finished my dissertation, I decided to explore options outside the lab that would bring me closer to people. Luckily, when I started my Master’s, I applied for a Student Communications Assistant job in the Marketing Department at my university to build experience in marketing and communications. I learnt how to write newsletters, student hub stories, manage social media channels and work on campaigns helping students to make the most of their time at uni. This helped me to land an internship at a mental health startup. There, I worked with the product team and gained experience in producing web content, designing landing pages and improving user experience. </p>

<p>Compared to the lab where I was working alone for long hours without a regular working schedule, in this role I felt more like I was part of the team. I enjoyed having group meetings, brainstorming ideas and then seeing them come to life. The job is very creative and I'm constantly thinking of new ways to design solutions to peoples' problems.</p>

<p>I also continued freelance writing throughout my masters. Since I’ve always maintained these writing and communication skills, I found a few clients in the health and wellness niche through networking and on freelance platforms. My days consist of creating and editing web content about mental health, healthy lifestyle and news in neuroscience research. </p>

<p>Now, I want to combine the aspects I most enjoyed from all these work and study experiences together - the excitement of scientific research with the creativity and human contact of communications - so I’m exploring different career roles in science writing and communications. </p>

<p>My current goal is to improve my skills as a science communicator. I’m doing a <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/cx/get-started?src=go-pa&#38;trk=sem-ga_campid.1399342497_asid.54056821126_crid.311040980383_kw.linkedin%20learning_d.c_tid.kwd-310582843911_n.g_mt.e_geo.1006996&#38;mcid=6841864363146670249&#38;cid=&#38;gclid=Cj0KCQjwmICoBhDxARIsABXkXlLumW3EanQXtRMO2c-o5JmENgjc--pi8OZQ4bwjxu49UzymvsWPYsQaAkiMEALw_wcB&#38;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" >,<u>LinkedIn Learning</u></a> course (students can often access these for free through their university) about creating a communications strategy, and I am working towards qualifications in online email marketing and social media advertising. </p>

<p>Attending events is also a great way to learn more about science writing and communications. Back in April, I attended an <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/events" target="_blank" >,<u>online event organised by WiNUK</u></a> about alternative careers in neuroscience. It was very inspiring to hear from amazing women working in science communications, illustrations and presenting and learn about their journeys - I definitely recommend checking it out if anyone is interested in these fields.</p>

<p>It’s also important to build up your portfolio to showcase your work to potential clients and employers. You can create an online portfolio with <a href="https://contently.net/why-create-a-portfolio/" target="_blank" >,<u>Contently</u></a> and upload content that you’ve written and published. I’m trying out different writing styles and have produced long-form and short-form articles for my clients, wrote research study summaries, LinkedIn posts, podcast descriptions, newsletters and performed desk research. Now I want to learn how to write engaging and informative blog posts, which is why I’ve joined the incredible Women in Neuroscience UK’s guest writers group. </p>

<p>To get more science comms experience, my fellow coursemate Adrianna, who also opted for an ‘alternative’ career, and I have started a blog, <a href="https://neurobirdies.com/" target="_blank" >,<u>neurobirdies.com</u></a><u>,</u> where we’re documenting our neuroscience journeys while sharing studying tips and exploring various neuroscience-related careers.

<p><strong>Neglected dangers of thermal pollution </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environmental-sciences-20"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 20, 1973</p>



<p>Most urban dwellers have experienced the swelter of a summer night in the city, but higher temperatures in the atmosphere over such “heat islands” may have more insidious effects, which urban planners seldom consider.… Urban-rural temperature differences can be as high as 18&nbsp;degrees [Fahrenheit]. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Today, excess heat from pavement and buildings cause U.S. cities to run <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/explainer-urban-heat-islands-and-how-to-cool-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half&nbsp;a degree to 4 degrees Celsius</a> (1 to 7 degrees F) higher on average than outlying areas. This heat island effect is expected to worsen as a side effect of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-heat-wave-summer">climate change</a>. Because urban areas are expanding, that means their growing populations are at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-human-body-climate">risk for heat-related illness or death</a>, scientists reported in 2019 in <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>. To stay cool, some cities are switching to roofs and surfaces that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reflective-paint-could-keep-sunbaked-buildings-cool">reflect a lot of sunlight and heat</a>. Adding trees helps too: Trees provide shade and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">emit water vapor</a> that lowers air temperature, almost like if a city could sweat (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 18</em>).</p>

<p>This study brings us back in time to the Middle to Late Pleistocene (about 0.46 − 0.012 million years ago, Ma), when our far away ancestors were living alongside the woolly rhinoceros (<em>Coelodonta antiquitatis</em>), an extinct rhino of the genus <em>Coelodonta</em> that was particularly well adapted to cold climates and widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. Traces of their cohabitation has been found in caves such as <a href="https://www.lascaux-dordogne.com/en/lascaux-cave">Lascaux</a> and <a href="https://archeologie.culture.gouv.fr/chauvet/en">Chauvet</a> but sadly the phylogenetic trees of the woolly rhinoceros was not included!</p>
<p>Investigation of rhinoceros fossils previously uncovered in Northern China and Siberia led to the hypothesis that the Chinese fossils are the descendants of the Siberian relatives. The increasing availability of ancient DNA samples has led to a refinement of the phylogeny of the Rhinocerotidae family and the woolly rhinoceros now appears to be more closely related to the Sumatran rhinoceros than any other extant rhinoceros.</p>
<p>The authors generated four mitogenomes from 16 Late Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros in Northern China and carried out a comparison with previously published genomes in order to investigate the maternal lineage of the Chinese woolly rhinoceros. They also calculated the nucleotide diversity of woolly rhinoceros’ specimens from different regions in Asia thus providing insights into the molecular evolution of Chinese woolly rhinoceros and shedding light on of past dispersal events of this extinct rhino. They detected a new early separating maternal clad, deeply divergent, that could represent the first woolly rhinoceros population before its dispersal into Asia. Alternatively, this newly discoverer clade could point to this extinct rhino having evolved in Northern China rather than in Europe! This theory would indeed require further investigation. In any case, these findings highlight Northern China as a possible refugium for Quaternary mammals under pressure of climate and environmental changes and a key evolution center of the Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros.</p>

<p>This study set out to characterize exposure to PM in a typical workplace for the whole duration of the production cycle in order to quantify the risks of respiratory symptoms and lung function in a cohort of reinforced concrete parts production industry in Almaty, Kazakhstan.<br />
50 personal samples were collected from workers in the factory in the summer of 2023 using portable PM2.5 cyclones and filters. 10 samples at each of the five different locations included: the concrete-mixing unit, the armature shop, the metal working workshop, the molding workshop and finally the office as a control. The workers were also asked to complete a questionnaire about their working history, respiratory symptoms which was followed by a lung function test.</p>
<p>The highest PM2.5 concentrations were found in the concrete-mixing unit (median 1180 µg/m3), followed by metalworking (510 µg/m3), armature workshop (375 µg/m3) and molding site (245 µg/m3), different from the concentrations in the office (29.5 µg/m3).<br />
The authors concluded that mixing concrete and metalworks are the steps that pose the greatest risk for worker’s health due to the higher exposure. It is due to the exposure to aerosol via inhalation which are adversely affecting respiratory health by causing more respiratory symptoms, independently of smoking and past respiratory diagnoses. Therefore wider use if PPE and exposure control measures should be put in place in reinforced concrete parts production in order to preserve workers’ health.</p>

<p>This paper describes a novel method NLP that implements unsupervised learning of word embeddings and allows for the clinical language to be automatically learnt with only minimal manual feature engineering and tagging required from clinical experts. This pipeline enables a gradual refinement of the data in a transparent way and the predictions are interpretable, a key factor for healthcare.</p>
<p>The method was put to the test using real EHR dataset and evaluating its performance at a classification task which in this case was used to detect patient’s allergies compared to a range of common supervised learning algorithms. The new, combined method performed much better than the other method evaluated. These promising results suggest that more research should be aimed at exploiting the inherent synergies between unsupervised, supervised, and rule-based paradigms for clinical NLP.</p>

<p>This was an exploratory qualitative study making use of face-to-face-focus group discussions with representative households between September and October 2019.The participants were between 25 and 59 years old. Dental pain was the most commonly reported oral health issue mentioned by the participants and they mostly describes the intensity and severity of the pain. The consequences of these pain were severe sometimes even resulting in the death of the patient!</p>
<p>The study concluded that the residents had preconceived ideas about dental clinics such as them being unaffordable that precluded them from visiting them. Instead they preferred self-care remedies and engaged in sometimes harmful oral health practices. Policymakers would need to take these findings into account in order to provide better education on early dental care as well as available, and affordable oral healthcare to slum residents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/10/community-over-commercialization-oa-week-2023/">Community Over Commercialization: OA Week 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>Open Access Week is a special commemoration for us as one of the original co-founders of the event, along with <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc">SPARC</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a>. It shows <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/10/oa-weeks-past/">how far we&rsquo;ve come</a>, but also what we still have to accomplish. This year&rsquo;s theme is <a href="https://www.openaccessweek.org/theme">&ldquo;Community over Commercialization,&rdquo;</a> and we&rsquo;re giving you a sneak peek into how PLOS prioritizes that ethos in our day-to-day thinking.</p>



<p>PLOS started with an <a href="https://plos.org/open-letter/">open letter</a>. A call to the research community to build a better future through transparency and inclusion, standing in direct opposition to the profit-motivated practices at large commercial journal publishers. That spirit still drives the organization today.</p>



<p><strong>Community Publishing</strong></p>



<p>We are a mission-driven organization that aims to transform scholarly research communication. Most of our readers know PLOS best as a nonprofit, Open Access publisher. The research communities we serve are at the heart of each of our journals. We only launch new journals and open research initiatives after consulting with representatives of the relevant research communities. It&rsquo;s not our goal to simply add more options to the list researchers have to choose from today, but to consider journals as vehicles for change and identify the role PLOS can play in providing a venue for researchers to share their work more openly. Journal attributes, such as the level of editorial selectivity, scope, editorial policies, leadership/Editorial Board membership and our business models are shaped by community consultation, centering on their unmet needs, and aim to shift research behaviors from closed to open.</p>



<p>Here are just a few ways that we think about <a href="https://plos.org/your-journal-options/">our journals</a> and our <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science </a>mission.</p>



<ul><li>Many of our journals are interdisciplinary in order to draw together disparate but connected stakeholders and facilitate discussion between researchers, policymakers, and individuals</li><li>We created a new policy on&nbsp;<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inclusivity in Global Research</a>&nbsp;(i.e. anti-&lsquo;parachute/helicopter/neo-colonial&rsquo; research)</li><li>We are now permitting non-human authors&nbsp;<a href="https://latitude.plos.org/2023/09/applying-inclusive-authorship-criteria-two-examples-from-plos-water/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in exceptional circumstances</a></li><li>We require <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandatory availability of data underlying published articles</a></li><li>We <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strongly encourage preprint posting</a>; provision of service to deposit submitted papers to preprint servers</li><li>We endorse <a href="https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/#:~:text=PLOS%20authors%20can%20opt%2Din,the%20reviews%20will%20appear%20anonymously." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparent peer review</a>; publishing peer-review reports and editor decision letters with published papers</li></ul>



<p>Although the theme of &ldquo;Community over Commercialization&rdquo; is evident everywhere at PLOS, it is perhaps best expressed through our <strong>publishing program</strong>, which is also the truest expression of our Open Science mission.&nbsp; PLOS partners with like-minded organizations and scholars, and our unique editorial approach is closely aligned with the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science">UNESCO recommendation for Open Science</a> which emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and inclusion; and the<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals"> </a><a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>, which have a global community perspective.</p>



<p>When PLOS decided to launch<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new journals</a>, we knew had to build them from a new blueprint in order to fulfill our aims and mission namely by:</p>



<ul><li>including the broadest range of researchers&rsquo; voices globally</li><li>ensuring that these new Open Science platforms would be shaped at every level by the communities they aimed to serve</li><li>striving to amplify the perspectives of all researchers and stakeholders in global issues including from Lower middle-income countries</li><li>leveraging the diversity of the editorial boards, which shape content, policies, and practices that are reflective of the research communities working in these fields</li></ul>



<p><strong>Community funding</strong></p>



<p>As Open Access has grown, we saw a need to try something new: supporting its cost in a regionally equitable way with <strong><u>our focus on community, not profits,</u></strong> which brings us to our business models, which underpin our approach. At issue: Article Processing Charges (APCs) helped demonstrate that Open publishing could be viable and allowed Open Access to become a meaningful force in scholarly communication.</p>



<p>But APCs don&rsquo;t work for everyone. Not all disciplines or regions have the same level of funding, and publishing costs can deplete author grants and reduce the amount available for research, while for publishers, administering individual publication fees carries significant overhead which leads to higher costs overall.</p>



<p>We firmly believe that all researchers should have the opportunity to both read and publish under an <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Open Access license</a>, and that solutions for sustainable Open Access publishing need to involve all stakeholders. That&rsquo;s why PLOS is leading the charge in developing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-alternative-models-continue-to-grow-in-2023/">non-APC alternative funding models.</a> All these business models address specific challenges in Open Access publishing and were created with input from the community.</p>



<p><strong>A future of Openness through community</strong></p>



<p>Although PLOS is primarily a publisher, we advocate for Open Research practices because we believe that Open Science is better science&mdash;more rigorous, more trustworthy, more equitable, more reproducible, more creative, faster, and more impactful for society. PLOS&rsquo; has a built-in philosophy of sharing what we learn (e.g. OS research) and openly seeking input and collaboration in how we innovate is a defining principle of how we work.</p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; mission is to lead a transformation in scholarly publishing from a closed to an Open model. We believe we can best accomplish that by empowering our community to engage in Open Science practices on a large scale, as part of their regular scientific communications while collaborating with other actors in scholarly communication such as institutions, funders, and policymakers to move towards a better Open Science ecosystem.</p>

                <p>Half a century ago, the first genetically modified organism ushered in a new era of biological innovation. To mark this anniversary, here are eight milestone GMOs. Many have had, or are poised to have, a dramatic impact on our lives.</p>

<p>In November 1973, geneticist Stanley Cohen and colleagues <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.70.11.3240?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that they had built a plasmid, a ring of DNA, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/animal-genes-transplanted-bacteria">carried a gene from another organism into an <em>E.&nbsp;coli </em>cell</a> — the birth of genetic engineering (<em>SN:&nbsp;6/1/74</em>). The team later showed that such modified cells could produce the protein associated with a foreign gene. <em>E.&nbsp;coli</em> has since been modified to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3179032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass-produce therapeutic drugs</a>, <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2016/11/harnessing-bacteria-fight-ocean-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break down plastics</a> and more. “The most important GMO is the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.76.1.106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microbes that are used to make insulin</a>,” says geneticist Matthew Cobb of the University of Manchester in England. In 1978, facing problems with insulin derived from pigs and cows, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/human-insulin-seizing-golden-plasmid">engineered <em>E.&nbsp;coli</em> to make human insulin</a> for treating diabetes (<em>SN:&nbsp;9/16/78</em>). The lifesaving drug <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/human-insulin-sale">hit the market</a> in 1982 (<em>SN: 10/9/82</em>).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Transgenic mice</h3>

<p>Mouse models are a go-to for scientists who want to study human disease in a controlled way in the lab. In 1974, biologists Rudolf Jaenisch and Beatrice Mintz laid the groundwork for these models by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC388203/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">injecting DNA from simian virus into mouse embryos</a>, which were later born with viral DNA in their genomes. In papers published in 1980 and 1981, a team led by biologists Jon Gordon and Frank Ruddle incorporated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/transplanted-gene-egg-mouse">viral DNA into mouse genomes</a> so that it was passed on to subsequent generations (<em>SN:&nbsp;9/13/80</em>). The star rodents were called “transgenic” mice. Since then, transgenic and knockout mice, where a single gene is broken or removed, have been developed to mimic and study human diseases from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/msj.20159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alzheimer’s</a> to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6709737/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcoholism</a> to <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2012.0212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression </a>and cancer.</p>

<p>In 1987, geneticist Mark Vaeck and colleagues reported that they had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/328033a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically engineered tobacco</a> to produce Bt toxins. These toxins, made by the bacterium <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>, affect only certain insects, including several common agricultural pests. Pesticides derived from the toxins take time and money to spray, but the new tobacco plant had built-in protection. Estimates suggest that more than 1&nbsp;billion hectares of Bt crops — corn, cotton, soybeans and more — have been grown since, with no known safety issues for consumers. These crops have improved yields while reducing the need for pesticides. They “are grown on massive scales, in many countries around the world,” says Emma Kovak, a food and agriculture analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental think tank in Berkeley, Calif. “They’ve had a massive impact.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Flavr Savr tomato</h3>

<p>The impact of the Flavr Savr tomato, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/tomato-biotechnology-heads-market">introduced in 1994</a>, is largely symbolic (<em>SN: 5/28/94</em>). Its genome was modified to block the production of an enzyme responsible for fruit softening, thus <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00022530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping the fruit firm longer</a>. High production and distribution costs ultimately doomed the Flavr Savr, but it was the first genetically engineered crop to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and to be commercially sold. GM&nbsp;crops have boomed since the Flavr Savr flopped. In 2019, more than 190 million hectares were planted with GM crops. Such crops include potatoes, squash, sugar beets, papayas and corn.</p>



<p>Some people also trace a rise in GMO opposition back to the Flavr Savr tomato, Kovak says. The tomato went through intense safety tests, but people opposed to GMO foods more generally, then and now, point to potential health and environmental risks.</p>

<p>More than 2 billion people worldwide face micro­nutrient deficiencies. Traditional breeding and genetic engineering can amp up those nutrients, and <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/86511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rice has been an obvious target</a>. “More than half of the world’s population, including many of those living in poverty, rely on rice for most of their daily calories,” says B.P. Mallikarjuna Swamy, a rice biofortification researcher at the International Rice Research Institute in Los Baños, Philippines.</p>

<p>The FDA approved AquAdvantage salmon for human consumption <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/intentional-genomic-alterations-igas-animals/aquadvantage-salmon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2015</a> — making the salmon the first GMO animal to be OK’d as human food in the United States. Canada followed in 2016. With a growth hormone gene from Chinook salmon, AquAdvantage salmon reach full size in half the time of traditional farm-raised Atlantic salmon. Fast-growing farmed salmon could have widespread appeal, but there are concerns that if the engineered salmon escape, they could push out wild salmon. For now, AquAdvantage salmon are only trickling into the U.S. supply chain.</p>

<p>Some researchers are turning to GMOs for conservation. The American chestnut, which once dominated the eastern seaboard, offers an early example of what such efforts might look like. These “redwoods of the East” were severely reduced by the mid-1900s by a parasitic fungus introduced from imported trees. Historical efforts to develop a blight-resistant chestnut using traditional breeding haven’t panned out, but the Darling chestnut might be the answer. This <a href="https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mpp.13165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically engineered tree</a> is more resistant to the fungal blight disease thanks to a wheat gene that breaks down the harmful chemical the pathogen produces. The tree has been under review by regulatory agencies since January 2020.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Mosquitoes</h3>

<p>Genetically modifying animals that spread disease, including mosquitoes, could save a lot of lives; malaria alone kills hundreds of thousands of people each year. “We’re already using genetically modified mosquitoes for disease control,” says biologist Vanessa Macias of the University of North Texas in Denton. Tests in 2021 in Florida, for example, released male <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes genetically engineered so <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">female offspring die before adulthood</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>). The goal? Reduce the population of insects that spread the Zika and dengue viruses. Modified mosquitoes have also been released in Brazil, the Cayman Islands, Panama and India. </p>



<p>Other research teams are adding genes that make mosquitoes resistant to a pathogen, says Macias, thereby preventing disease spread. And advances in gene editing mean it’s now possible to use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-spread-their-wings">what are known as gene drives</a> to spread genetic modifications through entire populations (<em>SN: 12/2/15</em>). Yet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-mosquito-malaria-crispr-africa-public-outreach">open questions remain</a>, including whether it is ethical or wise to transform entire animal populations (<em>SN: 6/3/22</em>). “We’re talking about unknown unknowns,” Macias says.</p>

<p>The publisher PLOS appears close to an agreement with a scientist who sued to stop the addition of an expression of concern to one of her articles, according to a recent filing in the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/research/office-of-research-and-graduate-education/research-faculty/clinical-and-translational-science/singh-soudamani/">Soudamani Singh</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Clinical and Translational Sciences at Marshall University’s Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine in Huntington, W. Va., filed suit against PLOS in April, as we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/scientist-sues-publisher-to-block-expression-of-concern/">previously reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Singh’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Singh-complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, the publisher planned to place an expression of concern on one of her papers after she and her co-authors had requested a correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh’s suit sought a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction preventing PLOS from publishing the expression of concern, as well as damages and legal fees.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128095"></span>



<p>The paper at issue, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203552">Cyclooxygenase pathway mediates the inhibition of Na-glutamine co-transporter B0AT1 in rabbit villus cells during chronic intestinal inflammation</a>,” published in <em>PLOS ONE</em> in September 2018, currently has no notice of any sort. The article has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On October 12, the federal judge assigned to the case <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Singh-5-pending-settlement.pdf">ordered</a> a stay of the action, citing a “pending settlement.” The judge also ordered the parties to submit an order dismissing the case by November 13, or the court would dismiss the case, allowing the possibility for Singh to re-file.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We could not learn the terms of the settlement. Singh’s lawyer did not respond to our request for comment, and David Knutson, senior communications manager for PLOS, said the publisher “cannot comment because this is an ongoing case.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-supernova-stars-die-hubble">A rare glimpse at a relatively nearby supernova offers clues to how stars die</a></h4>

              
                <p>In May, a star in the Pinwheel galaxy exploded in just the right place at nearly the right time for astronomers to unravel details of its death. It was the closest supernova to go off in the last five years.</p>



<p>Astronomers have long been fascinated with these stellar explosions, which signal the end of life for the universe’s biggest stars. Not only are they dramatic — a supernova can shine 5 billion times as bright as our sun — but the explosions seed the universe with gold, silver, zinc and other elements forged only in a dying star’s last moments.</p>





<p>And this supernova — designated SN 2023ixf — was perfectly placed for astronomers to capture it relatively soon after it went off.</p>



<p>Because researchers can’t predict when a star will die, they typically wouldn&#8217;t have lots of images of a supernova from shortly after it happened, says Edo Berger, an astronomer at Harvard University. But thanks to the supernova’s position in a nearby galaxy that’s popular with stargazers, scientists were able to use images from amateur astronomers to pin down when the star exploded to within just a few hours, says astronomer Daichi Hiramatsu, also at Harvard.</p>



<p>Having data on the explosion not long after it happened is crucial to answering many open questions about how stars’ dying moments play out. Here are three things to know about this stunning supernova.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">SN 2023ixf used to be a dust-shrouded red supergiant</h4>



<p>SN 2023ixf was first discovered by Japanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki a few days after the star exploded. Almost immediately after learning about the supernova, researchers started scouring archival data for the star it used to be, says astronomer Charlie Kilpatrick of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “We looked at the imaging within hours of the report,” he says.</p>



<p>Right away, he and his colleagues found something in Hubble Space Telescope images of the Pinwheel galaxy taken between 5 and 24 years earlier that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ace4ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked like it could be the star</a>, the supernova progenitor, that exploded as SN 2023ixf. It was a lucky find, as astronomers had no idea that the star would explode when the Hubble images were taken. Since then, other research teams have used other telescope images to independently confirm the identity of SN 2023ixf’s progenitor&nbsp;— a red supergiant cloaked in a dusty veil.</p>



<p>Stars like this one are the most common progenitors for explosions like SN 2023ixf, Kilpatrick says. And “in a lot of ways,” he notes, SN 2023ixf “is kind of a normal supernova.”</p>



<p>That’s a good thing, Berger says. It’s easy to get excited about supernovas that are particularly unusual. “But here we have a supernova that&#8217;s actually representative of the way that most stars die,” he says, which helps with astronomers’ overall understanding of stellar evolution.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">SN 2023ixf’s final years involved extreme weight loss</h4>



<p>Studying stellar deaths requires a bit of forensic analysis, Berger says. The star dies, but you don’t see it happen. “Then you kind of have to backtrack what the star was doing all the way up to that point,” he says. “And tracking how the star was losing mass is a critical part of that.”</p>





<p>Berger and Hiramatsu recently published results&nbsp;suggesting that the star that exploded as SN 2023ixf <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf299" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost an incredible amount</a> of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ace0c4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass in its final years</a> — an entire sun’s worth, which was far more than expected.</p>



<p>To reconstruct these dramatic stellar death throes, the researchers scrutinized the light cast as SN 2023ixf exploded. As the star collapsed, it emitted a shock wave that set off a bright flash of light as the wave collided with material surrounding the star — including mass lost before the explosion. Using the explosion’s light to map out this material allowed the team to reconstruct SN 2023ixf’s mass loss rates leading up to the explosion.</p>



<p>Red supergiants are known to lose mass leading up to a supernova, but far less than in the final years before this latest explosion, Hiramatsu says. Something changed for SN 2023ixf’s progenitor star —&nbsp;something that might happen to other stars, too, and that researchers still don’t understand.</p>



<p>“Stellar evolution theory is just not up to the task” to tell us, Berger says. To figure out what happens in the last moments of a star’s long life, “we have to do it from data.” And this supernova is a rare chance to gather some of that data.</p>



<p>“It’s an incredible opportunity,” Kilpatrick says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">SN 2023ixf is the nearest supernova of the multi-messenger era</h4>



<p>Historically, light cast by a supernova would be the only cosmic “messenger” astronomers could use to learn about the event. But “one type of messenger is not enough for us to recover all the mysterious things about this kind of collapsing star,” says astrophysicist Zidu Lin of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who studies ghostly subatomic particles called neutrinos, which interact only very weakly with matter.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it’s now possible to detect neutrinos or gravitational waves streaming away from certain celestial objects — possibly including stellar explosions like SN 2023ixf. At just more than 21 million light-years away, the supernova is the closest of its kind to light up the sky within the era of modern “multi-messenger” astronomy. Today’s technology isn’t quite sensitive enough to catch gravitational waves or low energy neutrinos from supernovas outside the Milky Way, including SN 2023ixf, Lin says. However, it is possible to detect a few high energy neutrinos from supernovas in nearby galaxies, like the Pinwheel.</p>



<p>It was a bit surprising, then, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none were detected from SN 2023ixf</a>, researchers reported in September. “The nondetection of the high energy neutrinos, combined with some optical signals, might be able to form a multi-messenger analysis,” Lin says. In particular, it could help astronomers constrain ideas about exactly how high energy neutrinos are generated within dying stars.</p>
