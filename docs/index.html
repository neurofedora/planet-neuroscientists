                When fed peanuts, red squirrels in Britain developed weaker bites — showing that food supplements to threatened animals could have unintended side effects.

<p class="has-drop-cap">Last October, Martin McPhillie, a <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/5234/dr-martin-mcphillie">lecturer</a> in organic chemistry at the UK’s University of Leeds, received an email alert from his institution about a new article bearing his name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “Docking Study of Licensed Non-Viral Drugs to Obtain Ebola Virus Inhibitors,” appeared in the <em>Journal of Biochemical Technology</em>, a title of Istanbul, Turkey-based <a href="https://deniz.pub/journals">Deniz Publication</a>. The journal is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study was within McPhillie’s area of expertise, and aligned with work he and the other listed coauthors had previously published. But he knew the new study wasn’t his.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130766"></span>



<p>“I felt very professionally violated at the time and still angry about the whole episode,” McPhillie told Retraction Watch. “I am acutely aware of how academic malpractice can ruin an academic career so did not want to be associated with this paper.”</p>



<p>McPhillie emailed the journal’s <a href="https://jbiochemtech.com/journal-page/editorial-team">editor in chief</a>, Marcello Iriti, an <a href="https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/marcello-iriti">associate professor</a> of biomedical, surgical, and dental sciences at the Università degli Studi di Milano in Italy, and explained the situation. Iriti “was apologetic but did not offer an explanation,” McPhillie said. According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, the editor called the publication of the article a “mystery.”</p>



<p>Iriti also told us he didn’t know how the paper came to be published with the names of authors who had no involvement in the work. He referred our question to an unnamed managing editor copied on his reply. The managing editor did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McPhillie was initially “relieved” Iriti responded, but then the journal removed the article from its website with an undated notice that stated only “<a href="https://jbiochemtech.com/article/docking-study-of-licensed-non-viral-drugs-to-obtain-ebola-virus-inhibitors-qiq049ivryvrbac">This article has been retracted</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To my mind, ‘retracted’ usually means that the authors have committed malpractice,” McPhillie said, but in his case, “the authors are innocent” and the problem likely lies with the journal. “There is stigma associated with retracted papers.”</p>



<p>When McPhillie contacted Iriti again, the editor was “rather dismissive” and said “there was nothing more they could do,” McPhillie said. </p>



<p>“I would have thought the journal would have other options to remove papers like this,” McPhillie said, which he thinks would also benefit the journal. “They don&#8217;t seem to care.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In cases we’ve covered previously, researchers who find their names attached to papers they didn’t write have had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/09/violated-engineering-professor-found-her-name-on-four-papers-she-didnt-write/">mixed</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/">results</a> in getting the papers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">removed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to alerting the other listed authors, McPhillie Googled the paper title and found an <a href="https://ijpras.com/article/docking-study-o-f-licensed-non-viral-drugs-to-obtain-ebola-virus-inhibitors-gcjqwyjxkygeu9g">identical article</a> with different authors published in 2024 in the <em>International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Allied Sciences</em>. The journal appears to belong to another Istanbul-based entity, <a href="https://meralpublisher.com/">Meral Publisher</a>, and also is not listed in Web of Science. Ozgur Karcioglu, the editor in chief, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="587" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-1024x587.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130768" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-1024x587.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-300x172.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-768x440.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers-1536x880.png 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-pubpeer-duped-papers.png 1670w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This image from PubPeer user “Cisticola tinniens” shows two nearly identical papers from two journals with different authors listed. The paper on the right has been retracted. Neither journal is indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Muhammad Rafiq of the Balochistan University of IT, Engineering and Management Sciences in Quetta, Pakistan, the listed corresponding author of the <em>International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Allied Sciences</em> article, told Retraction Watch he had “nothing to do” with the paper. “I don’t know why this appeared with my name.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rafiq and the same group of coauthors had published a similar study, “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/14/6/660">Identification of Prospective Ebola Virus VP35 and VP40 Protein Inhibitors from Myxobacterial Natural Products</a>,” in <em>Biomolecules</em>, an MDPI title, in June 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in December, an anonymous PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/90992B779547EB4C3E4A34EE2D8A7A#1">posted</a> about the retraction statement in the <em>Journal of Biochemical Technology </em>and asked the authors or publisher to clarify the reason for their decision. The user also pointed out several issues in the paper, most notably the stated use of “AutoCAD,” a design software used in engineering. “I have never seen AutoCAD used in computational chemistry,” the commenter wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the journal had removed the paper from its website, the PubPeer commenter had found a version of record on White Rose, the University of Leeds institutional repository, which has since been removed as well. McPhillie learned of the copy of the paper in the repository from PubPeer, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have asked our research library team for information about how this paper could be deposited internally, as someone had to &#8216;claim&#8217; it,” he told us. “I haven&#8217;t received a response to that, although they were sympathetic to our situation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than a dozen universities have used “questionable authorship practices” to inflate their publication metrics, authors of a new study say. One university even saw an increase in published articles of nearly 1,500% in the last four years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00339/125732/Using-Bibliometrics-to-Detect-Questionable">published January 5 in <em>Quantitative Science Studies</em></a>, “intends to serve as a starting point for broader discussions on balancing the pressures of global competition with maintaining ethical standards in research productivity and authorship practice,” study authors <a href="https://sites.aub.edu.lb/lmeho/">Lokman Meho</a> and <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/spark/Pages/drelieakl.aspx">Elie Akl</a>, researchers at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, told <em>Retraction Watch</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130720"></span>



<p>Universities manipulating publication metrics have made headlines recently. Highly cited researchers started <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/saudi-universities-lose-highly-cited-researchers-after-payment-schemes-raise-ethics">cutting ties</a> with schools in Saudi Arabia after an investigation revealed that institutions were offering cash in exchange for affiliation — all to boost rankings. In 2023, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/21/exclusive-researcher-outs-indian-universitys-publishing-scam-after-it-fails-to-pay-him/">covered a case</a> in which a prominent researcher was offered money by a university senior administrator to add his name to publications, outing the scam after not getting paid. And <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">our 2023 investigation</a> with <em>Science</em> uncovered a self-citation scheme at Saveetha Dental College — affiliated with Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, a name you will see again below — used to boost rankings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There has been speculation about universities gaming the metrics system for a while,” sleuth Dorothy Bishop said in an email, “but I’m not aware of any previous attempt to study this formally using bibliometric indicators.” Bishop said “motivations of the universities who take part in this are hard to understand, but it’s clearly done to improve performance on international rankings.”</p>



<p>Meho and Akl used data from Elsevier’s SciVal, Scopus, and Clarivate’s Web of Science to identify 80 universities that experienced growth in research output, as measured by number of published journal articles, of over 100% from 2019 to 2023 — far outpacing the global average of 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of these, 14 institutions also had declines in rates of first authorship of more than 15 percentage points over four years.This rate, over five times the average decrease of 3%, could be a sign of questionable authorship practices like sold or honorary authorship, the researchers said. “Such a dramatic decline often indicates a fundamental shift in how research contributions are distributed within an institution.”</p>



<p>Those 14 universities are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>An earlier <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18331">preprint</a> of the study results used different thresholds, resulting in the addition of Saveetha University and the removal of three others from the list. None of the 14 universities responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the universities saw a 234% rise in total publications over four years and a 23% drop in rates of first authorship. Eight of the 14 schools ranked at the top of the list of most significant declines in first authorship rates out of the 1,000 most-published universities. By 2023, 11 ranked among the 15 universities with lowest first authorship rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers also looked at hyperprolific authorship, defining it as publishing 40 or more articles annually. Combined, the 14 universities had an increase in hyperprolific authors from 23 in 2019 to 177 in 2023, an increase of 670% and a growth rate 10 times the average. However, this rate wasn’t consistent over all schools: King Saud University, for example, went from four hyperprolific authors in 2019 to 63 in 2023, a 1,500% increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers defined many of the hyperprolific authors among the 14 universities as “noncore,” meaning they published articles with universities they are not directly affiliated with. An increase in authors with multiple affiliations can mean a rise in ethical collaborations. But a sharp increase — as seen in some of the listed universities — can indicate “strategic efforts to amplify research output,” the researchers wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 2019 to 2023, the percentage of articles with authors with multiple affiliations remained stable at 18%. The control group, consisting of four universities known for conventional authorship practices — California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, and the University of California, Berkeley — had a much lower proportion of papers with authors with multiple affiliations, at 6%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inflating academic output “directly biases the outcomes of ranking systems, compromising their reliability and usefulness,” Meho and Akl write in the study. They conclude with a call to action for universities, funding agencies, and policymakers, among other bodies, to create and enforce more stringent guidelines and review processes around authorship practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 2014 paper in <em>Science </em>by a lab in Toronto has been retracted after a December <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7951">expression of concern</a> raised “potential data integrity issues.”</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1248024">Mitosis Inhibits DNA Double-Strand Break Repair to Guard Against Telomere Fusions</a>,” is from the <a href="https://durocherlab.org/">lab of Daniel Durocher</a>, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Toronto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice, published today and signed by all of the original authors, reads, in part:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130695"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We have since become aware of anomalies in Fig. 1 in the main paper and in figs. S3, S7, S9, and S11 in the supplementary materials. As a result of these issues, Science posted an Editorial Expression of Concern about the Report on 5 December 2024 (2). We are working with our institution to determine the basis of the problems. However, because of the scope and seriousness of the data and image irregularities, we have decided to retract the paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article has been cited 258 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. As we previously reported, the two papers <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=daniel+durocher">are among several</a> from Durocher’s lab that have been flagged for potentially duplicated images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meagan Phelan, a communications director for <em>Science</em>, said in an email Durocher and his colleagues are still evaluating the paper in cooperation with the Sinai Health Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. “However, because of the scope and seriousness of the data and image irregularities as they’ve already uncovered them, the authors have decided to retract the paper now, which we commend them for and agree with,” she told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sholto David, who uses the name “Mycosphaerella arachidis” on PubPeer, flagged the potential image duplication in a November 2024 <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0AF7C9EA1C32C958CE1A0E086CB846#1">comment</a>. He called the bands in the images “surprisingly similar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/05/science-places-expressions-of-concern-on-two-articles-as-torontos-sinai-health-investigates/">reported</a> in early December, the 2014 paper was one of two in <em>Science</em> that received an expression of concern. A 2007 article, “Orchestration of the DNA-Damage Response by the RNF8 Ubiquitin Ligase,” had a “duplicate image in Fig. 3D,” according to the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7744">notice</a>. That paper has been cited over 700 times, according to Web of Science.</p>



<p>Phelan told us the journal was “working with the authors to get the experiment reproduced” before considering retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Durocher did not respond directly to our request for comment. After we reached out to him, Jovana Drinjakovic, a scientific communications officer for the Sinai Health Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, sent us the same email we received in December after the two papers received expressions of concern:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While the 2007 paper has a figure error that the authors are working to correct, the 2014 paper was noted to contain data irregularities. As soon as the senior author was made aware of the irregularities pertaining to the 2014 study, he promptly notified Sinai Health. This triggered an internal inquiry, in accordance with its policy on addressing research misconduct allegations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Durocher replied on PubPeer threads for both the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9FD4EF09B9702618F5B1411AD25C3B">2007 paper</a> and the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0AF7C9EA1C32C958CE1A0E086CB846#1">2014 paper</a> that his lab would look into the irregularities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to understand the brain, should you work as a neuroscientist in the lab? Or teach the subject for students? Or simply read textbooks and papers while having a normal job? In this blog post, I will share some thoughts onthis topic.</p>



<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Why do I do research?</strong></p>



<p>There are three reasons why I&#8217;m doing research in neuroscience:</p>



<p>First, I like this job and what it entails: working with technology, building microscopes, working with animals, coding, analyzing data, and exploring new things every week. If you are familiar with this blog, you probably know how much I like these aspects of my work.</p>



<p>Second, with my research I want to contribute to the basic knowledge about the brain within the science community. I believe that this deepened basic understanding of the brain will ultimately have positive impact on our society, how we see ourselves and how we treat our own and other minds during health and disease. In this line of thought, I see myself as a servant to the public.</p>



<p>Third, and this is the focus of today&#8217;s blog post, doing research in neuroscience also enables me to increase and improve my own understanding of the cellular events in the brain, of thought processes, and of life in general. This is what drew me to science in the beginning.</p>



<p>In contrast to this last point, the work as a researcher embedded into the science machinery of the 21st century tends to be focused on something else, and for understandable reasons. Most of the daily work of scientists is focused on making discoveries, on having impact, and on being seen as successful. It almost seems a natural idea to believe that making discoveries is the same as better understanding the brain. And although discoveries might be the best way to increase the overall insight into the brain for humanity, it might not be the best way to increase your own understanding of the brain.</p>



<p><strong>2. Understanding by reading from others (“passive” research)</strong></p>



<p>One of the tasks that kept me most busy in early 2024 was the final preparations for our publication on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8">centripetal propagation</a> of calcium signals in astrocytes. I still believe that this is my most important contribution to science so far, and I do think that I learnt much during this research project. However, the final steps of publication consisted of rather tedious interactions with copy editors, formatting of figures and file types, preparing journal cover suggestions, as well as advertisement of the work through discussions, talks or public announcements. All of this may be helpful for my career and useful for the potential audience, and can be fun as well, but certainly does not advance my own understanding of the brain. I felt as though I was treading water &#8211; being very busy and working hard, yet at the same time, I got the impression that I had temporarily lost touch with the heart of research.</p>



<p>At the same time, I had to step in on short notice to give a lecture to medical students about the motor system, covering cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. Since I didn’t find the existing lecture materials fully satisfying, I began researching the topic myself. Coming from physics and having been interested in the principles of neuroscience like the dynamics of recurrent networks or principles of dendritic integration rather than in the anatomical details, I had never fully had a firm grasp of the motor system. Now, I was forced to understand the connections between the motor cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, and their effect on brainstem and spinal cord, in just a few days. What role do the &#8220;indirect&#8221; and &#8220;direct&#8221; pathway play in the striatum, and how are they influenced by dopamine? What is the opinion of current research about these established ideas? What role does the cerebellum play? How should we treat David Marr’s idea of the cerebellum? What is currently known about the plasticity of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum? My understanding of these topics had been superficial at best. The challenge of delivering a two-hour lecture on this topic &#8211; and being able to answer any question from students &#8211; forced me to seriously think about these topics.</p>



<p>After an intense weekend that had been full of struggles, textbooks and review papers, not only had I prepared an acceptable lecture, but I had also made real progress in my personal understanding of how the brain works. It wasn’t directly relevant to my own research, but over the following months, I noticed that far more studies from the field of motor systems suddenly caught my attention &#8211; because now I understood better what they were about.  Retrospectively,  I could now also better understand the work on the brain stem done in the neighboring lab of <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=2">Silvia Arber</a> during my PhD.</p>



<p>Therefore, the most important progress in my understanding of the brain during this time in early 2024 didn’t come from my own active research or from a conference where I could catch up on the latest developments. Instead, it came from a weekend when I was forced to dive into a topic slightly outside of my comfort zone. Let’s call this “passive” research, as it did not involve my own lab activities but &#8216;only&#8217; researching the conclusion from other scientists.</p>



<p>If I wanted to really understand the brain, wouldn’t it make sense to work this way more often? That is, instead of spending five years applying my time and expertise on a narrowly defined scientific question, shouldn’t I first aim to better comprehend the available knowledge?</p>



<p><strong>3. The limitations of a “passive” research to understanding the brain</strong></p>



<p>A few years ago (around 2007-2009), I had already tried to understand the brain in such a “passive” way: by systematically absorbing and mapping out the existing knowledge, while being myself not yet an active researcher. At the time, I was in the middle of my physics studies. Physics itself wasn’t my main interest but rather a means to learn the methods and ways of thinking that are necessary to penetrate neuroscience and ultimately understand the brain. At the same time, however, I realized that I lacked some basic knowledge in neuroscience. For example, I had some notions about the different brain regions, but these notions were very vague and consisted of not much more than names.</p>



<p>To change this lack of knowledge, I started a project that I called &#8220;The brain on A4&#8221; (A4 is a paper page format similar to the US letter). The idea was to search the literature for a given brain region, summarize the findings, and condense them onto a single A4 page. My vision was to eventually wallpaper my room with these 100 A4 pages so that the summarized facts and essential insights about all relevant brain regions would always be present as anchor points for my thought processes. This way, they would gradually sink into my mind and provide the foundation for a deeper understanding through reflection and the integration of new thoughts.</p>



<p>For illustration, here are two pages of the &#8220;Brain on A4&#8221; project, written in German (with a few French textbook excerpts included since I was studying also at a French university then).</p>

<p>In short, the idea didn’t work. Using this approach, I covered some brain regions, and when I read through these A4 drafts today, they don’t seem completely off base. But the concepts that are now familiar to me and connected to other topics had only vague meanings back then when I copied them from Wikipedia, Scholarpedia or review articles that took me several days to go through. I could recall the keywords and talk about them, but I couldn’t truly grasp them when I put myself to the test.</p>



<p>Why? Because knowledge must grow organically. It needs both contextual embedding and emotional anchorage. This embedding can be a discussion partner, or a project where this knowledge is applied or tested, or, at the minimum, it can be the exam at the end of the semester where the knowledge is finally “applied”.</p>



<p>In addition, I was also lacking the toolset to probe the knowledge. Different from maths, physics or foreign languages, the knowledge about the brain comes in vague and confusing sentences that are difficult to evaluate. That is, for most of the statements of the brain, it is difficult to say whether it is indeed true or what it means. The equation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy">potential energy</a> E = m·g·h can fully understood by derivations or examples. On the other hand, the statement &#8220;The major input to the hippocampus is through the entorhinal cortex&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus">source</a>) only makes sense (if at all) when the entorhinal cortex is well-understood (which is not the case). In addition, neuroscientific publications are full of wrong conclusions and overinterpretations. For example, if I randomly take the latest article about neuroscience published in Nature, I get <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04232-1">this News article</a> of a research article by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08340-w">Chang et al.</a> . The main finding of the study is indeed interesting and worthwhile reporting: recent memories are replayed and therefore consolidated during special sleep phases of mice where the pupil is particularly small. The News article, however, stresses that this segregation of recent memories into distinct phases may prevent an effect called catastrophic forgetting, when existing memories are overwritten because they use the same synapses. This interpretation, however, is quite misleading. Catastrophic forgetting and the finding of this study are vaguely connected but not closely linked, which becomes quite clear after reading the wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_interference">catastrophic forgetting</a>. As a lay person, it is almost impossible to understand that this tiny part of the discussion, which prominently featured in the subheadings of the News article, is only a vague connection that does not really reflect the core experimental findings of the study.</p>



<p>Similarly, when I made the A4-summaries, I meticulously listed the inputs and outputs of brain regions. But what could I make out of the fact that the basal ganglia receives input from cortex, substantia nigra, raphe and formatio reticularis (as in my notes above), if all of those brain areas were similarly defined as receivers of input from many other areas? Back then in 2008, I wrote about the cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia loops and how they enable gating (see screenshot above), but only when I worked through the details again with a broader knowledge base 16 years later, I managed to see the context where I could embed the facts and make them stick in my memory. And it took me this many years working in neuroscience to slowly grow this context.</p>



<p><strong>4. The limitation of a systematic approach to understanding the brain</strong></p>



<p>A second reason why this approach for mapping the brain to A4 pages didn’t work may have been its systematic nature. A systematic approach is often useful, especially when coordinating with collaborators, or when orchestrating a larger project. However, I’ve come to believe that a more organic &#8211; or even chaotic &#8211; approach can be &nbsp;more effective, especially when it comes to understanding something. A systematic approach assumes that you can determine in advance what needs to be done, in order to faithfully follow this structure afterwards. For the A4 project, the systematic structure was the division into &#8220;brain regions.&#8221; Of course, the brain can not be understood by just listing the properties of brain regions; many important concepts take place on a different level, between brain regions, or on the cellular level. I noticed the limitations of my approach myself soon enough and added A4 pages on other topics that I deemed relevant like &#8220;energy supply to the brain&#8221; and &#8220;comparison with information processing in computers.&#8221; The project lost its structure, for good reason. And soon after, before the structure became completely chaotic, I abandoned the project entirely.</p>



<p>One thing that I learnt from this failure is how a systematic approach can sometimes hinder understanding. In formal education, this truth is often hidden because curricula and instructors provide the structuring of knowledge already. But when it comes to acquiring new knowledge and insight, rather than merely processing and assembling pre-existing knowledge, this systematic approach must be continuously interrupted and re-invented to enable real progress. When I first heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle">hermeneutic circle</a>, invented by hermeneutics (the science of understanding a text), I had the impression that this concept was an accurate description of the process of understanding. Following the hermeneutic circle, deeper understanding is approached not on a direct path but iteratively, by drawing circles around the object of understanding, maybe constructing a web of context and possibly an eventual path towards the goal. In this picture, the process of understanding is diffuse and unguided, and is corrected only occasionally by counscious deliberation and a more systematic mind. As a consequence, the object of interest can only be treated and laid down systematically once its understanding has been reached, but not on the way to this point.</p>



<p><strong>5. The limitation of a non-systemic approach to understanding the brain</strong></p>



<p>However, the unsystematic approach to understanding the brain has a major drawback: you lose the sense of your own progress, and you lose the overview of the whole. Often, progress is incremental and, over years, so slow that you hardly notice you’ve learned something new &#8211; leading to a lack of satisfaction. And, even more importantly, you lose the big picture.</p>



<p>This may also be one of the greatest barriers to understanding the brain: the possible inability of our minds to comprehend the big picture of such a complex system where different scales are so intricately intertwined. A few years ago, I wrote a blog post about this topic (&#8220;Entanglement of temporal and spatial scales in the brain, but not in the mind&#8221;), which I still find relevant today. Can we, as humans with limited information-processing capacity and working memory, understand a complex system? Or more precisely: what level of understanding is possible with our own working tool &#8211; the brain -, and what kind of understanding lies beyond our reach?</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://humphries-lab.org/">Mark Humphries</a> wrote <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/systems-neuroscience/imagining-the-ultimate-systems-neuroscience-paper/">a blog post</a> to address a similar question. He speculated that the synthesis and understanding of scientific findings may, in the future, no longer be carried out by humans but by machines &#8211; for example, by a large language model or a machine agent tasked with understanding the brain. Personally, I find this scenario plausible but not desirable. An understanding of the brain by an artificial agent that is beyond my own ability may be practically useful, but it doesn’t satisfy my scientific curiosity. Therefore, I believe that we should focus on how to support our own understanding in its chaotic nature and, perhaps retrospectively, wrest structure and meaning from this chaos. How? By writing for yourself.</p>



<p><strong>6. The importance of writing things up for yourself</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, I believe that understanding the brain is a chaotic and iterative process that does not proceed systematically or in a predictable trajectory. Instead, it involves trying out different approaches and constantly adopting new perspectives. For me, these approaches include reading textbooks and preparing lectures; reading and summarizing current papers; and conducting my own “active” research in the lab and <em>in silico</em>.</p>



<p>During this process, I found that shifting one&#8217;s perspective can be particularly helpful in gaining a better understanding. To gain such new perspectives, I regularly read <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/02/11/public-peer-review-files/">open reviews</a>, which often present a picture different from the scientific articles themselves. Or, I like to explore new, ambitious formats that shake off the dust of the traditional publication system and attempt to take a more naive view of specific research topics. A venue that is still fresh in spirit and that I can recommend for this purpose is <a href="http://thetransmitter.org">thetransmitter.org</a>.</p>



<p>However, the best method to adopt knowledge and integrate it into one’s own world model is by processing the knowledge in an active manner. The two methods I find most useful are mind maps and writing. Usually, I use mind maps when I’m completely confused, either about the direction of a project, or about my approach to neuroscience in general. Usually, I just start with a single word in the center of a paper within a circle and then add thoughts in an associative manner for 20-30 minutes. The result of this process is not necessarily useful for others. However, seeing the keywords laid out before me, I can often see the missing links or identify things that should be grouped together, or grouped differently.</p>



<p>Below is an example of a such mind-map. I drew this map in 2016 a bit more than two years into my PhD, at a stage where I was quite struggling to shape my PhD project. Unlike most of my mind maps which are hand-drawn and therefore almost illegible to others, this one was drawn on a computer (in adobe illustrator, to play around with the program). I was brain-storming about the role of oscillations in the olfactory bulb of zebrafish (check out <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1292">this paper</a> if you&#8217;re interested). Although I did not follow up on this project, some of the ideas are clearly predecessors of analyses in my <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.09.013">main PhD paper</a> on the olfactory cortex homolog in zebrafish. The mind-map is basically a loosely connected assembly of concepts and ideas that had been living in my thoughts, often inspired by some reading of computational neuroscience papers or by discussions with <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119">Rainer Friedrich</a>, my PhD supervisor. I used this map to visualize, re-group and connect these ideas:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="7892" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/01/08/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2024/the-patching-project-context_reworked/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-patching-project-context_reworked.png" data-orig-size="4265,1734" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="The patching project, context_reworked" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-patching-project-context_reworked.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-patching-project-context_reworked.png?w=640" width="1024" height="416" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-patching-project-context_reworked.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7892" /></figure>



<p>The second method is writing, and I believe that it is the only true method to really understand something. In contrast to reading, writing is an active process, and so much more powerful in embedding and anchoring knowledge in your own mind. You may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_explanatory_depth">illusion of explanatory depth</a>, the tendency of our brain to trick us into thinking we understand something simply because we’ve heard about it or can name it. Only when we attempt to explain or describe a concept, we realize how superficial our thoughts were and how shaky our mental models really are. Writing is a method for systematically destroying these ill-founded mental structures. (Expressing an idea in mathematical or algorithmic terms is even more precise and therefore even better for this purpose!) When we have destroyed such an idea, we shouldn’t mourn the loss of a seemingly brilliant concept but instead celebrate the progress we’ve made in refining our understanding.</p>



<p>In addition, writing has always been a form of storytelling. By putting our understanding of the brain into words &#8211; even if those words are initially fragmented, scattered, and contradictory &#8211; writing seeks to find meaning, identify patterns, and embed details into a larger whole. With a bit of practice, writing does all of this for you.</p>



<p>Importantly, I’m not talking about writing papers or grant proposals here. In those cases, you have a clear audience in mind (editors or reviewers) and eventually tailor your writing to meet their expectations. And you will be happy and satisfied when you produce something that meets the standards for publication. Instead, I’m talking about writing for oneself. This mode of writing confronts your own critical voice and follows ideas without regard for how the text would look like. And I believe that this way of writing, which is not directly rewarded by supervisors or reviewers, is the most useful in the long run.</p>



<p>I believe that many researchers in neuroscience (and maybe you as a reader) initially started to work as neuroscientists not because they wanted to be famous or successful or well-known but because they wanted to understand how the brain works. So if you want to take this seriously, write for yourself.</p>

<p>A biotech company whose CEO faced allegations of manipulating data in papers used in NIH grant applications will pay a settlement of $4 million to resolve those allegations, the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/bothell-biopharmaceutical-company-pays-4-million-resolve-allegations-it-relied">announced</a> January 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement is the latest installment in a series of allegations surrounding research by Leen Kawas, the former CEO of the company, Bothell, Wash.-based Athira Pharma. In October 2021, four months after placing cofounder and then-CEO Kawas <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/17/athira-pharma-ceo-placed-on-leave-amid-allegations-of-altered-images-in-research-papers/">on leave</a>, an internal investigation found she falsified images in her doctoral dissertation and at least four research papers. </p>



<p>But concerns had been raised about the images as early as 2016, and Athira failed to report them, the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/bothell-biopharmaceutical-company-pays-4-million-resolve-allegations-it-relied">DOJ statement</a> noted. Those papers “were referenced in several grant applications submitted to NIH, including in a grant that NIH funded in 2019,” the statement continued.</p>



<span id="more-130665"></span>



<p>In September 2021, four papers in the <em>Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics </em><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/24/four-papers-by-athira-ceo-earn-expressions-of-concern/">earned expressions of concern</a> after they were flagged for possible image manipulation. (To date, none of these papers have been retracted, and have a combined 106 citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.)</p>



<p>In October of that year, <a href="https://investors.athira.com/news-releases/news-release-details/athira-pharma-announces-leadership-changes-mark-litton-phd-mba">Athira released</a> the results of its internal investigation, finding “that Dr. Kawas altered images in her 2011 doctoral dissertation and in at least four research papers that she co-authored while a graduate student at WSU, published from 2011 to 2014.”</p>



<p>At the time, Athira said Kawas’s research wasn’t the subject of its leading drug candidate or a patent application for it. However, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/21/athira-chief-executive-resigns-as-company-confirms-she-altered-research/">STAT reported</a> in October 2021:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21859930/">Two</a> of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22129598/">papers </a>were cited in a 2013 patent granted to the company, while <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22960190/">three</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23055539/">altered </a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25187433/">papers </a>co-authored by Kawas were referenced in an Athira application for $15 million funding from the National Institutes of Health, which STAT obtained <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/05/athira-cited-altered-studies-in-nih-grant-application-creating-legal-risk/">through a Freedom of Information request</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“To its credit, Athira immediately notified NIH of the research misconduct after the full board of directors learned of it,” U.S. attorney Tessa M. Gorman said in the Jan. 6 statement. “The company’s transparency significantly helped Athira mitigate its damages and demonstrated its resolve towards coming into compliance with the relevant law and regulations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement resolves claims made by Andrew P. Mallon, who filed a whistleblower suit under the False Claims Act. Mallon is to receive $203,434 as part of the settlement, according to the DOJ statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At publication time, Kawas, Athira and Mallon had not responded to requests for comment.</p>



<p>The settlement comes on the heels of news that Athira <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/athira-pharma-faces-nasdaq-delisting-over-share-price-93CH-3671599">faces Nasdaq delisting</a> because its stock price does not meet the minimum bid price requirement. In September, <a href="https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/athira-pharma-to-lay-off-70-of-workforce">the company announced</a> it was cutting 49 positions, or 70 percent of its workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kawas is now cofounder and managing general partner of Propel Bio Partners, a venture capital firm, according to the Propel Bio Partners <a href="https://www.propelbio.com/team/leen-kawas-phd/">website</a>. She has also published a <a href="https://leenkawas.medium.com/">regular column at Medium</a>, including a recent entry on turning “<a href="https://leenkawas.medium.com/forbecouncil-post-resilience-in-action-how-women-can-turn-setbacks-into-strengths-71ec712d80bd">setbacks into strengths</a>.”</p>

<p>The publisher of the <em>Journal of Human Evolution </em>says it does not use artificial intelligence in its production process, contrary to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Social-Media-Statement-re-JHE-Resignations.pdf">a statement</a> issued last month by the journal’s editorial board <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/27/evolution-journal-editors-resign-en-masse-to-protest-elsevier-changes/">when all but one member of the group resigned</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement, <a href="https://x.com/clementzanolli/status/1872352787662852156">shared on X</a> on December 26, noted the journal’s “joint Editors-in-Chief, all Emeritus Editors retired or active in the field, and all but one Associate Editor” were resigning because Elsevier, the journal’s publisher, “has steadily eroded the infrastructure essential to the success of the journal while simultaneously undermining the core principles and practices that have successfully guided the journal for the past 38 years.” Among the examples cited:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130646"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In fall of 2023, for example, without consulting or informing the editors, Elsevier initiated the use of AI during production, creating article proofs devoid of capitalization of all proper nouns (e.g., formally recognized epochs, site names, countries, cities, genera, etc.) as well italics for genera and species. These AI changes reversed the accepted versions of papers that had already been properly formatted by the handling editors.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Retraction Watch has now received a response to a request for comment from an Elsevier spokesperson (our message on Dec. 26 was met with an out-of-office reply, and on Jan. 2 the company said it was still looking into the matter): </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We sincerely thank the outgoing editors, the majority of whom were coming to the end of their term at the end of 2024, for their invaluable contributions and dedication to the journal. We will continue to build on their important work in maintaining the high quality expected of the journal with the new editorial team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We do want to address an important inaccuracy in the statement issued by the outgoing editors, specifically the incorrect linking of a formatting glitch to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in our production processes. We do not use AI in our production processes. The journal trialled a production workflow that inadvertently introduced the formatting errors to which the editors refer. We had already acted on their feedback and reverted to the journal&#8217;s previous workflow earlier in 2024.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-human-evolution/about/editorial-board">the journal’s website</a>, three new editors in chief have been appointed: Nohemi Sala of the National Research Centre on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain; Song Xing of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing; and Radu Iovita of New York University’s Center for the Study of Human Origins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The previous editors in chief, Mark Grabowski and Andrea B. Taylor, did not respond to our request for comment on the board’s resignation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass resignation is the 20th such episode since early 2023, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">our records</a>.</p>
