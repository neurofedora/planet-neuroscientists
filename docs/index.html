                <p><strong>Author: </strong>Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director, Open Research Solutions, PLOS; and Chris Heid, Head of Product, PLOS</p>



<p><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></p>



<p>Research by PLOS and Research Consulting has found there is a growing need for Open Science Indicators (Open Science monitoring solutions) among some funders and institutions but implementation of monitoring solutions may be limited unless Open Science practices are a strategic priority for organisations. Research data sharing, and code and software sharing, are among the most important Open Science practices to monitor but organisations need information that is compatible with their own structure and nomenclature to be usable, which is not available currently. In the future Open Science Indicators need to monitor not just prevalence but also the effects or qualities of Open Science practices.</p>



<p><em><strong>What did we want to know and why?</strong></em></p>



<p>PLOS <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/12/open-science-indicators-first-dataset/">launched Open Science Indicators</a> (OSI) in 2022 with DataSeer to support our goal to increase adoption of Open Science practices beyond open access to research articles. Previous research <a href="https://osf.io/z4py9/">by PLOS</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/3401278">others</a> has identified a similar Open Science &ldquo;measurement problem&rdquo; among funders and institutions, and a lack of suitable solutions to solve this problem. While OSI was designed to support PLOS&rsquo;s needs, sharing the OSI data and methods openly is a way to positively influence Open Science activities outside of PLOS. This Open Science approach to OSI has been reflected in numerous reuses of the OSI dataset and results &ndash; by funders, <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8117154">governmental committees</a>, <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2023/02/16/preparing-for-open-science-indicators/">institutions</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/ajhs4/">researchers</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04121339v2">solution developers</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002516">journals</a>. Therefore, we wanted to learn more about the problem of monitoring Open Science practices from the perspective of funders and institutions &ndash; and the extent to which OSI or other solutions might help to solve it.</p>



<p><em><strong>How did we find out?</strong></em></p>



<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.research-consulting.com/">Research Consulting</a> in the UK, between October and December 2023 we conducted a series of interviews with 24 representatives of 5 research funders and 10 institutions*, followed by 2 focus groups.</p>



<p><em><strong>What did we learn?</strong></em></p>



<p>Our interviews confirmed that, among our cohort at least, interest in Open Science (Research) Indicators is growing, and we confirmed an emerging link between Open Science practices and the quality and reliability of research &ndash; as shown for example by the <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/8117154">UK Committee on Research Integrity&rsquo;s interest in these indicators</a>.</p>



<p>Of the various Open Science practices &ndash; beyond open access to research articles &ndash; that may be important to monitor, interest was greatest in research data sharing; code and software sharing, and the quality or &ldquo;<a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIRness</a>&rdquo; of data and metadata. This aligns to some extent with findings of previous research, with the exception of the Open Science practice of study registration (preregistration), which was the highest priority in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001949">a peer-reviewed study targeted at the biomedical research</a> field.</p>



<p><strong><em>Figure</em></strong><em>: Relative importance of 6 Open Science Indicators that emerged from our interviews, ranked during the focus groups</em></p>

<p>Open Science Indicators are being used by the senior leadership of a minority of funders and institutions we interviewed, to track the effects of, or to develop, open science plans and policies. While &ldquo;compliance monitoring&rdquo; could imply punitive outcomes for non-compliance, this isn&rsquo;t the case. The intent of such activities is to identify where researcher or institutional support is needed&nbsp; &ndash; in line with how OSIs are being used at PLOS, to promote improvements in practice. For institutions in particular, Open Science Indicators are also being used at a more functional or departmental level, such as to make a case for budget or to provide training. Indeed, attention on Open Science practice is more likely to be at a &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; or department, rather than senior leadership level, and many organisations would support making Open Science more of a strategic priority. This desire for greater priority, or resources, for Open Science practices echoes what PLOS has heard from representatives of other publishers who want to see better practice in research data sharing and policy at their journals.</p>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.openresearch.manchester.ac.uk/support/tracker/">institutions</a> and <a href="https://avointiede.fi/en/policies-materials/monitoring/monitoring-results-2022">funders</a> have been experimenting with monitoring solutions but participants in our research reported difficulties in gathering sufficiently comprehensive or detailed information to meet their needs. Resources such as PLOS Open Science Indicators could form part of an Open Science monitoring solution for funders and institutions, but a complete solution would require more comprehensive coverage of an organisation&rsquo;s research outputs and greater metadata quality that allows users to view the results according to their organisation&rsquo;s structure. Also, being able to benchmark an organisation against a relevant comparator organisation or group is important &ndash; to give context to results and help make a case for intervention, while avoiding the (re)creation of institutional rankings on the information.</p>



<p>Our focus groups revealed several desirable characteristics of monitoring solutions that would make them more trustworthy to their users. These included:</p>



<ul><li>Endorsement and recognition from a range of sector stakeholders</li><li>Transparency of data sources, data collection methods, datasets and analysis</li><li>Clear OSI definitions and specifications</li><li>Coverage of a large number of organisations</li><li>Use of open infrastructure based on Open Science principles</li></ul>



<p><em><strong>What happens next?</strong></em></p>



<p>While PLOS Open Science Indicators is not a product or service as such, it&rsquo;s crucial for PLOS to understand the needs of our stakeholders and customers who share a desire to increase adoption of Open Science &ndash; if this is to be achieved beyond content published in PLOS&rsquo; journals, which is our aim. PLOS is involved in several initiatives in the burgeoning Open Science monitoring space including a <a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/building-an-open-science-monitoring-framework-with-open-technologies-unesco-workshop-19-12-23/">new initiative led by the French Open Science Monitor in collaboration with UNESCO</a>. Also, in collaboration with DataSeer and others, we are developing <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/2023/12/15/reflections-on-ukrn-open-research-indicators-work-so-far/">Open Research indicator pilots for UK institutions &ndash; led by the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN)</a>. The insights from this research are informing how we are approaching collaboration with these community initiatives. The results have also been influential in our 2024 plans for OSI, in terms of what new features or indicators to consider and in improvements to data quality &ndash; for users at and outside of PLOS.</p>



<p>A theme from our findings and what we are hearing from research institutions in our collaborations with the UKRN is a need to think beyond the <em>prevalence </em>of Open Science practices &ndash; to the <em>effects and qualities</em> of those practices. This is also in line with the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators_principles_and_definitions/21640889">original principles and concept for OSI</a> or, to use another widely adopted framework that informed OSI, the &lsquo;Interoperable&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reusable&rsquo; (I and R) parts of <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">the FAIR acronym</a>. Watch this space for more information on work already underway to better understand the effects of Open Science practices.</p>



<p><em><strong>Limitations of our findings</strong></em></p>



<p>We did not target particular research topics or disciplines in these discussions, but did focus on funders and institutions in the US and Europe, where Open Science policies may lend themselves to a potential need to monitor Open Science. As such our findings are not representative of all funders and institutions, and likely reflect the views of early adopters and innovators in this area.</p>

<p>A journal has retracted, over the objections of the authors, a controversial 2023 paper claiming a dig site in Indonesia is home to the largest pyramid built by humans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work was led by the Indonesian archeologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Hilman_Natawidjaja">Danny Hilman Natawidjaja</a>, of the Research Center for Natural Disasters in Bandung.</p>



<p>Hilman has been working <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunung_Padang">at the site</a> in Java for <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/digging-for-the-truth-at-controversial-megalithic-site-20130726-2qphb.html">many years</a> in his quest to prove it contains the ruins of a massive pyramid built by an advanced culture between 9,000 and 27,000 years ago. Hilman has also tried to link the site to the l<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PLATO-NEVER-LIED-ATLANTIS-INDONESIA-ebook/dp/B00I3SIFRQ">ost city of Atlantis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the notion that Gunung Padang is the mother of all pyramids – and, according to Hilman, the world’s oldest building – has been dismissed by some as “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180505213518/https://webs.ucm.es/info/arqueoweb/pdf/18/04_PerezGarcia.pdf">pseudoarchaeology</a>,”</p>



<span id="more-128975"></span>



<p>The paper, “Geo-Archaeological prospecting of Gunung Padang buried prehistoric pyramid in West Java, Indonesia”, attracted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/16/really-really-weak-experts-attack-claim-that-indonesia-site-is-worlds-oldest-building">mounds of critical attention</a> when it appeared last October in&nbsp; <em>Archaeological Prospection</em>, a Wiley title. Among the skeptics was <a href="https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/dibblew">Flint Dibble</a>, an archeologist who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxaHo3V4lGg">reviewed the research</a> on his YouTube channel in February.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the abstract of the article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Radiocarbon dating of organic soils from the structures uncovered multiple construction stages dating back thousands of years BCE, with the initial phase dating to the Palaeolithic era. These findings offer valuable insights into the construction history of Gunung Padang, shedding light on the engineering capabilities of ancient civilizations during the Palaeolithic era.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1932">retraction notice</a> states, the dating appears to have been fatally flawed:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following publication of this article, concerns were raised by third parties with expertise in geophysics, archaeology, and radiocarbon dating, about the conclusions drawn by the authors based on the evidence reported. The publisher and the Co-Editors-in-Chief have investigated these concerns and have concluded that the article contains a major error. This error, which was not identified during peer review, is that the radiocarbon dating was applied to soil samples that were not associated with any artifacts or features that could be reliably interpreted as anthropogenic or “man-made.” Therefore, the interpretation that the site is an ancient pyramid built 9000 or more years ago is incorrect, and the article must be retracted. Danny Hilman Natawidjaja responded on behalf of the authors, all of whom disagree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hilman, who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dannyhilman.natawidjaja/posts/10221568918126201">posted a response</a> to the retraction on Facebook – along with a Dropbox folder with materials he believes supports the validity of the work – told us he and his colleagues “are baffled” by the journal’s decision:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>we disagree because they (the Wiley Team) did not even care to give us sufficient evidence and scientific rationale to support the alleged major error. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Facebook, the researchers wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Was the decision to retract our paper a severe form of censorship, blatantly disregarding the fundamental principles of scientific inquiry, transparency, and fairness in academic discourse?</p>



<p>We urge the academic community, scientific organizations, and concerned individuals to stand with us in challenging this decision and upholding the principles of integrity, transparency, and fairness in scientific research and publishing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We caught up with Dibble in Greece. He told us the conclusion in particular doesn&#8217;t &#8220;really match any of the actual evidence presented in the body of the paper.&#8221; He also speculated that the peer reviewers may have been focused on their own areas of interest and not able to see the larger picture: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A wide range of methods were presented in the paper, so there wouldn&#8217;t really be many people who were familiar with all those methods in addition to the local archaeological context. It does seem likely that none of the reviewers were familiar with that archaeological context at all. And, that&#8217;s an issue for sure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dibble noted that he could think of only one similar retraction in the field of archeology, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/21/journal-investigating-sodom-comet-paper-for-data-problems/">2022 article</a> about an ancient airburst:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;m guessing these two papers were retracted because the journal editors felt embarrassed for having published pieces whose conclusions were sorely lacking in evidence. But, that&#8217;s just a guess? It&#8217;s so uncommon. In both cases, authors on these teams were associated with more prominent pseudoarchaeological ideas. So, that might also have something to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On X, in a thread worth reading, Dibble also <a href="https://twitter.com/FlintDibble/status/1770428110116196596">expressed annoyance</a> at the journal (and the media coverage of the article and its aftermath) for focusing on what isn’t as opposed to what is known about Gunung Padang – knowledge generated by other archeologists: </p>

                <p><strong>Inspired by neurodiversity celebration week, we are starting a new series, Bridging the Gap! For each post, we will have a conversation with a woman in neuroscience to discuss the gaps and the health inequalities relating to different areas of neuroscience, as well as the exciting new research that is attempting to bridge these gaps. First up, we have Dr Jessica Agnew-Blais, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Queen Mary University of London. In our interview, Dr Agnew-Blais shared with us her opinions and expertise on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or “ADHD”, and on the importance of investigating it more in women.</strong></p>

Its symptoms are broad, but the core traits are considered to be restlessness or hyperactivity, difficulties concentrating and impulsivity, although not everyone experiences all of these. Usually these characteristics are observed during childhood, which leads to the diagnosis of the majority of cases during the early years, especially in males. However, an increasing number of women are being diagnosed later in life, during early adulthood. This observation is slowly contributing to a shift in the conceptualisation of ADHD and it has highlighted the need to improve our understanding. The Medical Research Council (MRC) has recently prompted the initiation of new projects, <a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/new-studies-aim-to-bridge-knowledge-gap-in-adhd/" target="_blank" >,,<u>aimed at further investigating ADHD</u></a>. Dr Jessica Agnew-Blais is one of the MRC awarded researchers and talked to us about her work on ADHD in women.</p>


<p><strong>Could you tell us about your research on ADHD and what inspired you to investigate this?</strong></p>

<p>At the very beginning, I was investigating how ADHD changes when we grow up. I was working on a study called ‘E-RISK study’, which is a UK-based longitudinal twin cohort study that follows people from when they were born and assesses them at four different times during childhood. I was working with them when [the subjects] were 18 years old and we found that a lot of people that had met ADHD criteria at age 18 - showing high levels of symptoms and high levels of impairments - had not met the criteria when they were kids. This was very surprising because ADHD is supposed to have an early onset in childhood and having symptoms as a kid is actually part of the diagnosis. It was a bit of a mystery seeing all these people that seemed to have ADHD symptoms when they were young adults but not when they were kids, at least according to the parents and teachers that were rating their symptoms at the time. Interestingly, one thing that we identified about this group of late ADHD people, is that they tended to be women. So that’s what got me thinking: “What’s going on in women with ADHD? Are people not picking up on their symptoms when they are kids?” If we look across different population surveys, generally we do see more boys than girls being diagnosed during childhood. However, if we look during adulthood, the ratio is more even. That means that more women are diagnosed when they are adults and I really wanted to understand why this is the case! </p>

<p>So for part of my project, we will use longitudinal cohorts, based in Bristol, to look at the childhood characteristics of women that have a late recognition, or late emergence, of ADHD. The idea is to try and understand if there are things that could be identified in women with ADHD that are being missed when they are kids, or if there are any exacerbating factors occurring during teenage years that are making their ADHD more obvious in young adulthood. A second part of the project will then look in detail into adolescence and puberty. Using, this time, a US-based cohort, we want to understand: “Is there maybe a subgroup of girls for whom symptoms might actually get worse in adolescence?” Maybe there is! No one really knows or has looked at this before.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a third aspect of the project. The idea for it actually came from twitter, when I saw women saying that, at certain times of their menstrual cycle, their ADHD symptoms were worse and their medication didn’t work as well. I found that strange and I started looking if there was any research on that…there was nothing! I thought, “Well, that’s a problem!” So for this study, we will recruit women and follow them for three months while they do daily questionnaires about their ADHD symptoms and other related things, such as irritability, brain fog and fatigue. In the meantime, we will track their menstrual cycle and try to see if there are changes in the levels of ADHD symptoms and impairments across the cycle. Generally oestrogen declines during the menstrual period and low oestrogen is associated with lower dopamine availability. As we know that dopamine plays a key role in ADHD, and in stimulant medications, it would make sense that drops in oestrogen might lead to an impact on ADHD symptoms and medication.</p>


<p><strong>You mentioned that, in general, boys are diagnosed earlier than girls. What would you say are the main reasons for such a big gap in ADHD diagnoses between men and women?</strong></p>

<p>I think there are many reasons. One is that there is still a bias thinking that ADHD is a male disorder. I think that if there is a gender bias in how clinicians, teachers or parents perceive kids, this could lead to under-diagnosing some kids. For example, we see a tendency for girls with ADHD to have more inattentive symptoms or less comorbid conduct problems. As a result, these girls might be less troublesome and less disruptive. If you are a teacher and you are prioritising who to refer for an assessment, you might notice a really disruptive kid that is messing with the classroom rather than the daydreaming girl that maybe is not concentrating as much as she should, but is not creating disruptions. I also think there is a fundamental issue in a lot of studies in which the symptoms were described largely in boys. As a result, even the way symptoms are described could be gendered. We don’t know if, in girls, these symptoms reflect ADHD in the same way as in boys and there could be subtle differences in the way they are presented. For example, girls, driven also by some cultural expectations, may be more likely to express hyperactivity through talkativeness and verbal impulsivity, as opposed to physical impulsivity. The same cultural expectations may pressure girls to conform to a sort of level of agreeableness, especially maybe in the classroom. As a result, girls might end up making a lot of effort to mask their symptoms, compensate for them and be more social, and for this reason, people may not notice their ADHD as much.  </p>


<p><strong>How do you think delaying diagnosis affects how women experience ADHD and are impaired by it?</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s a really profound problem. While I was designing this study, I talked to a lot of women that had been diagnosed with ADHD as adults but had received a lot of other diagnoses before, like for depression, borderline personality disorder or anxiety. This means they had to wait for years to be finally given a very effective treatment. I would say that delaying appropriate medications is definitely a negative effect of under-diagnosing women.</p>
<p>I also think that a lot of women developed a negative self-concept because they didn’t know they had ADHD. They would tell me they thought there was something wrong about them, or that they were a bad kid, or daughter or student, or that they were stupid and that they felt bad about themselves. They were kind of attributing all their symptoms to something negative about themselves because they had not received a diagnosis. Because of that, they had low self-esteem and maybe all these negative things about themselves, swirling around, were even contributing to the depressive feelings. A lot of women end up looking back and feeling sad for all the things they could have done, or done better, if they had had that self-knowledge and that treatment. I think there is a feeling of regret and sadness for their younger self that had not received the right support. </p>


<p><strong>So, how do you think that research methodologies and questions could be changed to investigate, more accurately, ADHD in women and girls?</strong></p>

<p>On a basic level, we have to make sure to include women and girls in the studies because, even now, sometimes that doesn’t happen and that’s a fundamental issue. There is also some work being done to adapt some of the questionnaires to be more appropriate for women. For example, a researcher from the Netherlands, named Sandra Kooij, is adapting for women some of the questions of the DIVA, one of the adult ADHD diagnostic interviews. One of the things she’s including in this interview is asking people what part of the menstrual cycle they are in. Because, if your menstrual cycle affects your symptoms levels, and you do the interview when you are at the lower level of your symptoms, it may not capture the full picture of what your symptoms are like. I thought that was very interesting because, for my study, I was thinking about how people that had already been diagnosed are affected by hormonal fluctuations, while she took it a step further saying even when you are assessing somebody, you might want to know what part of the cycle they are in.</p>

<p>Then, in terms of issues that are relevant to women and should be taken into consideration investigating ADHD, one thing that comes up a lot is pregnancy and the pre- and post-natal period. Oftentimes, women are advised to stop their medication when they are trying to get pregnant. For people that have been relying on medication for a long time, that could be very difficult and they are not really provided with a lot of other means of support. On top of that, getting pregnant could take a long time, and with the 9 months of pregnancy and the breastfeeding period, it could add up to years with women not getting their treatment and this is not something that has been very well addressed. </p>

<p>Another noteworthy thing is perimenopause and menopause. A lot of older women I talked to felt like the hormonal changes during that period were exacerbating their ADHD symptoms. This is completely under-researched and I hope to look at these symptom changes during the menopausal transition, with a new PhD student, because this was the number one issue raised by the women I talked to. In general, I would say that these things that are more ‘women-specific’ just aren’t investigated in ADHD research, which is actually common to a bunch of other health issues. </p>


<p><strong>You talked about how women might not show ADHD symptoms during their childhood, how hormonal factors could influence that and how current diagnostic tests might not be able to pick up on this. You also mentioned women being asked to stop taking medications during pregnancy. So in relation to these things, how could clinical and diagnostic practices be modified in a useful way to address women?</strong></p>

<p>I really wrestle with the requirements of childhood onset. People may be looking for a diagnosis when they are adults, and some clinicians ask for their primary school records, or to talk to their parents or their teachers. Maybe the patients are 50 years old, they can’t provide those written records or evidence anymore. I understand that if they never had any issue for all their life and suddenly they do, the clinician might want to check for other neurological things but I don’t think it’s very useful to ask for evidence that other people thought they had ADHD as kids, because teachers and parents might not have noticed. We know that, and the thing that is frustrating, from the perspective of a researcher, is that a lot of these things that we know, don’t necessarily get translated into a clinical environment. For example, I was talking to a student who waited for ages to get her NHS assessment for ADHD and she was told she could not have ADHD because she went to university and had a master’s degree. That is absolutely not true! I hope, with this new research, to have an element of clinical education, not only for the end person that is doing the assessment, but also for the GP and for the people earlier on that have to do all these referrals. Just because someone is functional, it doesn’t mean that they are functioning the best for themselves or that they are not struggling. Just because ‘on paper’ a woman made it to university, that doesn’t necessarily mean she can’t have ADHD. I find that so frustrating and I understand, on some level, why the childhood onset criteria is there, but I don’t know if there is much utility for it, and denying someone treatment because they don’t have teacher reports (saying that they were hyperactive) is not a good strategy.</p>


<p><strong>Would you say that the general understanding and perception of ADHD is changing lately, and if so, how?</strong></p>

<p>I think there is a better recognition, now, of the fact that girls and women can have ADHD. A lot of studies that looked at medication use found that there are a lot more women getting prescribed with ADHD medications than in the previous years. I also think now ADHD is not necessarily viewed as a deficit. It’s not to say that people might not need support and treatment, but I think the whole neurodiversity movement started an important change in saying, “We don’t need to be fixed, there are things in the environment that can be adapted better for people with different neurodiversities''. Also, I think it’s really good that now a lot of funders, like UKRI, require that you have people who have lived experience as part of designing your research. I have a panel of women who have ADHD who advise on the questionnaire and the study design. It’s amazing, they are just fabulous and so insightful. The research has so much improved by incorporating the thoughts and the feedback of women who actually have ADHD. It is a key, positive step to involve them, because you don’t want to do some research that is not going to end up being relevant to people, asking the right questions or asking them the right way.</p>


<p><strong>Speaking of research, what do you think are the most exciting future prospects that you can see happening in ADHD research?</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s important to investigate more time and hormonal transitions. There is also an exciting, growing recognition that we need to study more ADHD in adults. For example, I am working with a colleague in Edinburgh to research neurodivergent parents and how being neurodivergent can affect your parenting. A lot of research tends to be about the kids and it ignores the fact that those same people with ADHD grow up. In general, I would also say that we used to think of ADHD as very static. However, increasingly, we are seeing more work looking at how much symptoms and impairments can change depending on the context and the demands that are placed on the person with ADHD. For a long time I think there was a bit of a pushback against the idea that context can matter. One of the reasons for this may be that, before, a lot of people wouldn’t believe that ADHD even existed, so researchers and clinicians were trying to address this by saying, “No, it’s a brain disorder, it exists and it doesn’t change ''. Instead now, we are recognising more and more that yes, it is in the brain but that doesn’t mean that the social context you are in, or what you are experiencing, or where you are in your life - for example, if you are going through an hormonal transition - all these things, can impact you, your symptoms and your functioning. I would say this leads to an interesting and new complexity around ADHD and ADHD research.</p>


<p><strong>Thank you, this was all very interesting and insightful. I would just like to conclude by asking you, what advice would you give to women that have just been diagnosed or are attempting to receive a diagnosis?</strong></p>

<p>My first advice would be: if you are attempting to receive a diagnosis, don’t give up in the meantime, because it can take a long time. A lot of women I talked to, even after getting a diagnosis and maybe some medications, they didn’t necessarily feel like they got a lot of support after that. They told me: “I didn’t feel like I had a roadmap for what to do'' or “I learned more from this Facebook group of women with ADHD than I did from my clinician”. Indeed, a lot of the support that women get comes from other individuals with ADHD through, for example, blogs, groups and podcasts that help them with practical advice, strategies and insights. It is super useful to have these less formal kinds of support and this community that offers both emotional and instrumental support. </p>

<p>A journal has retracted a controversial 2010 article on intelligence and infections that was based on data gathered decades ago by a now-deceased researcher who <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43768132">lost his emeritus status in 2018</a> after students said his work was racist and sexist.</p>



<p>The article, “Parasite prevalence and the worldwide distribution of cognitive ability’, was published in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>, by a group at the University of New Mexico. Their claim, according to the <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2010.0973">abstract</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The worldwide distribution of cognitive ability is determined in part by variation in the intensity of infectious diseases. From an energetics standpoint, a developing human will have difficulty building a brain and fighting off infectious diseases at the same time, as both are very metabolically costly tasks.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Overlaying average national IQ with parasitic stress, they found “robust worldwide” correlations in five of six regions of the globe:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128943"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Infectious disease remains the most powerful predictor of average national IQ when temperature, distance from Africa, gross domestic product per capita and several measures of education are controlled for. These findings suggest that the Flynn effect [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">which posits that average national IQs increase over time</a>] may be caused in part by the decrease in the intensity of infectious diseases as nations develop.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The study – and a related paper by a different group of authors – caught the attention of the popular science media. The <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/why-is-average-iq-higher-in-massachusetts-than-louisiana/2011/09/16/gIQA7P3UXK_blog.html">covered the research</a> (pointing out some shortcomings), as did <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/do-parasites-make-you-dumber"><em>Science</em></a>, and the lead author, Christopher Eppig, wrote about it for <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-average-iq-higher-in-some-places/"><em>Scientific American</em></a>. In that article, Eppig wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In our 2010 study, we not only found a very strong relationship between levels of infectious disease and IQ, but controlling for the effects of education, national wealth, temperature, and distance from sub-Saharan Africa, infectious disease emerged as the best predictor of the bunch. A recent study by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000572">Christopher Hassall and Thomas Sherratt</a> repeated our analysis using more sophisticated statistical methods, and concluded that infectious disease may be the only really important predictor of average national IQ.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But as the <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.0463">journal notes in the retraction</a>, Eppig and his colleagues based their study on an analysis of data published in 2004 by Tatu Vanhanen and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lynn">Richard Lynn</a>, who died in 2023: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following the publication of this article, Proceedings B was recently made aware of potential problems with the underpinning datasets used in the analyses, which were drawn from published sources [<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.0463#RSPB20240463C1">1</a>,<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.0463#RSPB20240463C2">2</a>]. The editors&#8217; attention was drawn to the fact that the datasets on between-country variation in IQ had been the subject of several critiques claiming that they contain substantial inaccuracies and biases that throw substantial doubt on inferences made from them, and that these problems had not been resolved in revised versions of the dataset used by Eppig and colleagues. Upon detailed scrutiny, the editors found these claims to be convincing and asked Eppig and colleagues for their response. While the authors acknowledged at least some of the claimed flaws, they maintained that the inferences from the data were nevertheless reliable.</p>



<p>Proceedings B publishes research of outstanding scientific excellence and importance, conforming to recognized standards of scientific procedure in terms of methodology and ethical standards. Journal policy stipulates retraction where editors have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable (and may invalidate the conclusions of the paper). After carefully considering the dataset, the critiques, the authors’ response and the potential harms created by using a dataset that appears to portray human populations in some geographical regions as of below normal intelligence on average, the editors concluded that the manifest problems in the data warranted retraction in order to uphold these standards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lynn’s career, and views, have been highly visible for many years in the United States in the United Kingdom, where he worked. In 2018, Ulster University, where he was a professor emeritus, agreed to demands from students that the school revoke his academic status – news covered by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43768132"><em>BBC </em></a>among other outlets (including <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/08/08/prof-who-lost-emeritus-status-for-views-on-race-and-intelligence-has-paper-flagged/">this one</a>).<br><br>We emailed the chief editor of the journal, and received a reply from a spokesperson for the Royal Society, who told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In July 2023, the editorial team was made aware of criticism about the dataset used by Eppig et al. in a 2010 paper in Proceedings B. After considering a wide array of evidence, including the original data set, subsequent critiques and the authors’ response, the editors concluded problems with the study were sufficient to call its conclusions into question and warrant retraction.<br><br>The decision to retract was made in January 2024, and the authors were informed at that time, the spokesperson added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Randy Thornill, the last author of the paper, did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">So what about the other paper that used Vanhanen and Lynn&#8217;s data? Hassall and Sherratt told us that in light of the retraction, they would ask <em>Intelligence</em>, where they published their paper in 2011, to revisit the research. Hassall, of the University of Leeds, in England, told us: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our paper was really focused on statistical issues when looking at spatial patterns in anything, but with IQ data as a case study (prompted by the fact that Eppig et al (and many others) were doing these kinds of analyses). As a result, I’d be hesitant to retract the whole thing as it has value as (and was always intended as) a methodological contribution.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, both researchers agreed the journal ought to do something to indicate the work was potentially fraught. Hassall said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>researchers are clearly using our work to support the idea of an IQ-disease link.</p>



<p>Taken together, it’s a complicated picture:</p>



<ol>
<li>The point of our paper is the method and the method is sound and important, independent of data</li>



<li>Our analysis yields quantitatively the same conclusions whether based on a problematic dataset (IQ) or on a robust dataset (PISA) that is measuring something similar</li>



<li>Researchers cite our work sometimes for the methods and sometimes for the (potentially questionable) results.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>



<p>Sherratt, of Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While our paper does a service by educating researchers on why autocorrelation matters and how to address it, at very least there needs to be a “public health warning” on the data set on which our methods paper is based. We should insist on this. A corrigendum might do the trick if it is seen whenever a reader views our paper … The fear is that if we don’t do anything then, now that Epigg et al. (2010) has been taken out of circulation, our paper can still be used to provide general support for the relationship!</p>

                <p><em>How does the role of NUAK1 tau phosphorylation differ within mouse and human brains, and why could inhibiting this enzyme open the door to future therapeutics within Alzheimer’s disease research?</em></p>

<p>A new paper published by the journal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10766794/" target="_blank" >Acta Neuropathologica</a> has highlighted a possible driver of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease is the <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" >most common form of dementia</a> worldwide, encompassing a range of symptoms such as memory loss, that contributes to cognitive decline within individuals. Since age is the <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors#:~:text=The%20greatest%20known%20risk%20factor,Alzheimer's%20doubles%20every%20five%20years." target="_blank" >greatest risk factor</a> to developing the disease, it is most widespread in people aged over 65. With more people living longer due to advances in global healthcare systems, the number of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease is <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/facts-media#:~:text=There%20are%2055%20million%20people,to%20139%20million%20by%202050." target="_blank" >set to increase</a>. As there is no cure, recent advancements in <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/three-promising-drugs-for-treating-alzheimers-disease-bring-fresh-hope#:~:text=Lecanemab%20was%20fully%20approved%20by,Alzheimer's%20disease%20in%20July%202023." target="_blank" >disease-modifying treatments</a> are the only possible therapies shown to slow down the progression of the disease.</p>
<blockquote>"Phospho-tau 356 appears to correlate with Alzheimer’s disease progression"</blockquote>
<p>Neurons within Alzheimer’s disease <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" >fail to communicate</a> properly due to a build up of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, resulting in neuronal cell death. These tau tangles are made up of hyperphosphorylated tau. Enzymes, known as kinases, can regulate the turnover of tau by phosphorylating the protein. One kinase in particular, named NUAK1, is responsible for generating a type of phospho-tau 356.</p>

<p>Recently, researchers at the <a href="https://ukdri.ac.uk/news-and-events/study-uncovers-potential-driver-of-alzheimers-disease-progression#:~:text=A%20study%20led%20by%20Dr,the%20development%20of%20future%20therapeutics" target="_blank" >UKDRI University of Edinburgh</a> used high resolution imaging to find that levels of phospho-tau 356 correlated with Alzheimer’s disease progression within human post-mortem brains. It was noted that post-mortem brains at later disease staging had higher levels of phospho-tau 356. Moreover, phospho-tau 356 was found within the between the synapses of neurons in post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease patients, near neurofibrillary tangles, possibly disrupting cell-to-cell communication. Therefore, phospho-tau 356 appears to correlate with Alzheimer’s disease progression.</p>

<p>Next, scientists blocked the action of NUAK1 by using an inhibitory drug. By using mouse brain slice cultures, the overall tau levels decreased both in the neuron and within the synapse itself. However, when used on valuable left-over human brain tissue from tumour removal surgery, the drug demonstrated more specificity compared to mice brain slices, by selectively lowering phospho-tau 356 levels alone.</p>

<p>Overall, these findings have determined that phosphor-tau 356 correlates with Alzheimer’s disease progression, with higher levels of phospho-tau associated with more severe Alzheimer’s disease cases post-mortem. Thus, phospho-tau 356 could be a future therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease via inhibiting NUAK1 enzyme activity. Finally, this study highlighted differences in tau turnover from NUAK1 activity within both mouse and human brain tissue; indicating the importance of translating animal research into human therapies.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2024/03/beyond-god-and-atheism/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GoffBlogBanner-480x185.jpg" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2024/03/beyond-god-and-atheism/">Beyond God and atheism</a></p><p>What are we doing here? What’s the point of existence?</p><p>Traditionally, the West has been dominated by two very different answers to these big questions. On the one hand, there is belief in the traditional God of the Abrahamic faiths, a supreme being who created the universe for a good purpose. On the other hand, there is the meaningless, purposeless universe of secular atheism. However, I’ve come to think both views are inadequate, as both have things they can’t explain about reality. In my view, the evidence we currently have points to the universe having purpose but one that exists in the absence of the traditional God.</p><p>The theistic worldview struggles to explain suffering, particularly in the natural world. Why would a loving, all-powerful God choose to create the North American long-tailed shrew that paralyses its prey and then slowly eats it alive over several days before it dies from its wounds? Theologians have tried to argue that there are certain good things that exist in our world that couldn’t exist in a world with less suffering, such as serious moral choices, or opportunities to show courage or compassion. But even if that’s right, it’s not clear that our creator has the right to kill and maim—by choosing to create hurricanes and disease, for example—in order, say, to provide the opportunity to show courage. A classic objection to crude forms of utilitarianism considers the possibility of a doctor who has the option of kidnapping and killing one healthy patient in order to save the lives of five other patients: giving the heart to one, the kidneys to another, and so on. Perhaps this doctor could increase the amount of well-being in the world through this action: saving five lives at the cost of one. Even so, many feel that the doctor doesn’t have the right to take the life of the healthy person, even for a good purpose. Likewise, I think it would be wrong for a cosmic creator to infringe on the right to life and security of so many by creating earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters.</p><p>Looking at the other side of the coin, the secular atheist belief in a meaningless, purposeless universe struggles to explain the fine-tuning of physics for life. This is the recent discovery that for life to be possible, certain numbers in physics had to fall in a certain, very narrow range. If the strength of dark energy—the force that powers the expansion of the universe—had been a little bit stronger, no two particles would have ever met, meaning no stars, no planets, no structural complexity at all. If, on the other hand, it had been significantly weaker, it would not have counteracted gravity, and the universe would have collapsed back on itself a split second after the big bang. For life to be possible, the strength of dark energy had to be—like Goldilocks&#8217; porridge—just right.</p><p>For a long time, I thought the multiverse was the best explanation of the fine-tuning of physics for life. If enough people play the lottery, it becomes likely that someone’s going to get the right numbers to win. Likewise, if there are enough universes, with enough variety in the numbers in their ‘local physics,’ then statistically it becomes highly probable that one of them is going to fluke the right numbers for life to exist.</p><p>However, I have been persuaded by philosophers of probability that the attempt to explain fine-tuning in terms of a multiverse violates a very important principle in probabilistic reasoning, known as the “Total Evidence Requirement.” This is the principle that you should always work with the most specific evidence you have. If the prosecution tells the jury that Jack always carries a knife around with him, when they know full well that he always carries a <em>butter</em> knife around with him, then they have misled to jury—not by <em>lying</em>, but by giving them less specific evidence than is available.</p><p>The multiverse theorist violates this principle by working with the evidence that <em>a</em> universe is fine-tuned, rather than the more specific evidence we have available, namely that <em>this </em>universe is fine-tuned. According to the standard account of the multiverse, the numbers in our physics were determined by probabilistic processes very early in its existence. These probabilistic processes make it highly unlikely that any particular universe will be fine-tuned, even though if there are enough universes one of them will probably end up fine-tuned. However, we are obliged by the Total Evidence Requirement to work with the evidence that <em>this </em>universe in particular is fine-tuned, and the multiverse theory fails to explain this data.</p><p>This is all a bit abstract, so let’s take a concrete example. Suppose you walk into a forest and happen upon a monkey typing in perfect English. This needs explaining. Maybe it’s a trained monkey. Maybe it’s a robot. Maybe you’re hallucinating. What would <em>not</em> explain the data is postulating millions of other monkeys on other planets elsewhere in the universe, who are mostly typing nonsense. Why not? Because, in line with the Requirement of Total Evidence, your evidence is not that <em>some </em>monkey is typing English but that <em>this</em> monkey is typing in English.</p><p>In my view, we face a stark choice. Either it is an incredible fluke that these numbers in our physics are just right for life, or these numbers are as they are <em>because</em> they are the right numbers for life, in other words, that there is some kind of “cosmic purpose” or goal-directedness towards life at the fundamental level of reality. The former option is too improbable to take seriously. The only rational option remaining is to embrace cosmic purpose.</p><p>Theism cannot explain suffering. Atheism cannot explain fine-tuning. Only cosmic purpose in the absence of God can accommodate both of these data-points.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/873689576/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/873689576/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f03%2fGoffBlogBanner-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/873689576/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/02/african-american-religions-and-the-voodoo-label/">African American religions and the voodoo label</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/03/chewing-the-cud-and-ruminating-on-word-origins/">Chewing the cud and ruminating on word origins</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/03/unheard-voices-overcoming-barriers-in-womens-music-composition/">Unheard voices: overcoming barriers in women&#x2019;s music composition</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/spotlight-on-laura-elin-pigott">Spotlight on: Laura Elin Pigott</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>We are back with our 'spotlight on' interview series, shedding light on inspiring women working in the field of neuroscience and reflecting on their distinct backgrounds and career journeys. The questions posed to these individuals explore the themes of job perks and challenges, developing new skills, inspirations in the neuroscience field, and goals for the future. Stay tuned to see new interviews every few weeks from women in a range of neuroscience-related professions!</strong></p>

Laura also has other research affiliations, including with Queen Square Institute of Neurology and University College London (UCL). Laura previously completed a MSc Clinical Neurosciences degree, and we will be exploring her subsequent career path in this interview, as well as her experiences and useful insights as a woman in neuroscience.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about your background in science/neuroscience? </strong><em> </em></p>

<p>I started off interested in the human body and how we can help rehabilitate people; even as a child I read books on anatomy and the workings of the human body and brain. I think this curiosity, coupled with my personal experiences of hospitals and rehabilitation, was why I pursued a BSc in Physiotherapy. I cannot remember a time when I wanted to be anything else. </p>

<p>Then, during my first degree, I got the incredible opportunity to conduct some research, which I later presented at a conference. I remember thinking that translating research into <em>real </em>change could help, not just the hundreds of patients a clinician sees, but the thousands or millions of patients to come. So, I decided very quickly that I wanted to pursue neuroscience and research. Then, during my MSC in Clinical Neurosciences, I was encouraged to push myself and think outside the box, and so I did – what better way to learn? </p>

<p>I think it is because of this curiosity that I have found myself in a few different areas of sub-specialisms, but they all have one thing in common, the incredible capacity of our brain. </p>


<p><strong>Can you tell us about your current role/area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</strong></p>

<p>I am very lucky to work in a field that I am passionate about and to have the opportunity to join research, such as the study I am a part of at the Neurophysiology unit at UCL on epilepsy. I was drawn to this because of my interest in neural networks: how we can monitor them and how they differ in disease. </p>

<p>My main research, over the past few years, has been on the surveillance of high-grade gliomas at the Queen Square Institute of Neurology. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made. Cancer will touch all of us, in one way or another, at some point in our lives and the possibilities for new cancer treatments provide us all with hope. </p>

<p>Most recently, I have started a study at LSBU, looking at the impact of social media on brain development. Due to my interest in neural networks, I’m fascinated by how these connections develop and what can influence them. I’m also excited about this new project as I have also had the opportunity to get students involved through research placements. </p>


<p><strong>What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</strong></p>

<p>I honestly believe this is the best job in the world - the endless learning and imagination that comes with academia and research, the excitement of students eager to learn, and that proud feeling you get when someone does well in an exam or project. </p>

<p>That “Aha, I get it” feeling when I am researching something or when a student has an “aha” moment when they are learning something. </p>


<p><strong>What are some of the challenging aspects of your current job?</strong></p>

<p>Time and money, as with any job. As academics we are constantly juggling our time, and as researchers we are constantly needing funding. </p>


<p><strong>What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience role?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to develop more research projects for students to take an active role in. I had the opportunity to participate in research as a student and I would love to feed that back. I want to show students that research can be exciting, creative, and inspiring. </p>

<p>I also want to learn more about the money distribution within research and how we can optimise this. </p>


<p><strong>Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond?</strong></p>

<p>There are so many women who have inspired me and helped me get to where I am today. There have been some truly amazing women in neuroscience and science over the course of history; some received the recognition they deserved, and others silently paved the way for women like us. Anita Harding, Elizabeth Roboz Einstein, Marie Curie, Rosalind Franklin and Cécile Charrier are a few that, despite the challenges they faced, pushed back against the stereotypes. </p>

<p>More recently, scientists like May Britt-Moser, Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier, Wendy Suzuki, who push the boundaries of research and academia with their ambition and imagination, inspire me. </p>

<p>Beyond science, or perhaps before I had my love for science, my mum inspired me; she always encouraged me and she embodies the phrase “a woman can do anything a man can, just in heels too!”. My sister, who possesses a kindness with no room for outside malice, also inspires me. The women who, through work or friendship, accept me and challenge me to be a better neuroscientist and a better person; one cannot exist without the other. And also the men in my life, like my dad, who support me and have given me the resilience I needed to succeed. </p>

<p>One woman in particular stands out, Tirion Havard, my academic mentor, who called me out when I wasn’t “standing on the right side of feminism”. We had just met in a research meeting and were chatting after it had finished. At the time, I was a lot more timid and still finding my footing in the research and academic world. She asked me what kind of woman I wanted to be – did I want to be small and get “trodden on”, or did I want to be heard. She told me I needed to put on my “big girl pants and get my elbows out”, because I was coming through. And it’s a memory I look back on fondly; it was one of those mind-blowing moments, where you think to yourself: <u>I can do this and I will do this. </u></p>


<p><strong>What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</strong></p>

<p>I’d like to complete my PhD and I’d also like to become a Professor of Neuroscience. </p>

<p>I recently delivered a Seed Talk, which educates the public on various topics; my talk was on “The Science of Neuroplasticity”. I would love to grow more into public speaking, as I think we should all have the knowledge and the tools we need to be informed about the workings of our own body. </p>

<p>On this note, over the coming months, I’m hoping to work on a ‘public engagement and highlighting need’ project about stroke recovery with Start Something: Women in immersive tech, Different strokes and Local strokes in the southwest with Anna Ridley. </p>

<p>I’d also like to see myself mentoring other young professionals; I think that academia and research can be lonely sometimes and having a go-to person makes life easier. I want to be the reason young women stay and succeed, not the reason we continue to have high attrition rates. </p>


<p><strong>What advice would you give to females at the early stages of their neuroscience careers?</strong></p>

<p>Keep going. You can do it! </p>

<p>We are programmed from such a young age to be amenable and to not take up space, but as I learnt, sometimes we have to put our big girl pants on and get our elbows out. So be vocal and voice your ideas and DON’T be afraid to put your name to it. </p>

<p>Create a network. This is something I struggled with, but now having so many supportive colleagues around me, means that the bad days don’t seem all that bad after all.</p>

<p>Don’t take the notes. I mean you can if you want to, but do you? Really? And why doesn’t Tim do it? It’s okay to say, “I think someone else should, so we have some variety within the team!” or “I actually have a few points I’d like to discuss today so perhaps someone else could pitch in”. </p>

<p>Have pre-prepped “stock answers” for when you feel something inequitable is happening. This helps me feel more prepared. </p>

<p>Think like a man. I think sometimes we are our worst enemy. My male alter ego is Laurence and when I catch myself doing, or about to do something, that may be an unwanted/unnecessary ‘pink task’, I say to myself, “Would Laurence do/take this?” and if the answer is no, then my answer should be no too. </p>

<p>Make male allies. My supervisor, Sotirios Bisdas, challenged me and never treated me any different. Most of my male colleagues listen and look to me for my speciality, just as I look to them for theirs. This should be the norm, and I am confident that one day soon it will be. Science will be so much more productive if we all work harmoniously. </p>


<p><strong>What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need improving/addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</strong></p>

<p>Today, the challenge we face is more covert than it once was; they are sexist notions that trickle in from our societal standards of what a woman should be, look like, and do… This covert hostility, or persistent quiet sexism, brews and seems harmless to some, but the statistics would indicate that this is in fact endangering the future of equality. So, challenging these notions is important, especially if we want to recruit more girls into STEM. </p>

<p>Without gender equality in science, scientific progress will fulfil just half of its potential.</p>

<p>Overall, the percentage of female graduates with core STEM degrees is steadily growing, however, the split is still just 26%. This figure is also translated into the female STEM workforce, with women making up 24%. This shows that there is still work to be done to encourage women to study these subjects, transition into the workforce and, importantly, remain in these fields.</p>

<p>Once women are in the workforce, we receive less research funding and fewer prizes for scientific contributions, with women receiving, on average, 60 cents to every dollar a male researcher receives. This means that gender inequality will directly impact scientific discoveries, as well as equality in the workforce (as promotion applications have sections dedicated to funding and prizes). How can we expect to increase the percentage of women in STEM, sitting at a mere 24%, when the money is unequally distributed?</p>

<p>This brings me to my next issue that I would like the industry to tackle; attrition of women in STEM. </p>

<p>The competitive nature of academia is unlikely to change, both because of the low number of faculty positions available, and because of the driven nature of those in the field. However, talented women are currently discouraged from academia, or left behind, for example due to the added pressure of parenting responsibilities, to which the academic environment is hostile.</p>

<p>Even with policies in place, a broad cultural change will be necessary to precipitate true equality. Only a quarter of fathers take paternity leave, with this number dropping over the past few years – this is troublesome for the future of gender equality and also indicates a significant ingrained bias. </p>

<p>If we are stopping women from succeeding in their careers, what example are we setting for our future generations?</p>

<p>Finally, scientifically, we need to look at the research we are outputting; is this representative of our populations? Historically, we have seen the horrendous consequences of not conducting research on people of the reflected population of use. We must learn from this. As research advances, and we see awesome new methods and technologies, guidelines and policies will be useful in ensuring we are equitable and progressive in our approach to research and development.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 2022, a researcher in Turkey was reviewing a paper for a cardiology journal when an image of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/western-blot-288/">Western blot</a> caught her eye: A hardly visible pair of “unusual” lighter pixels seemed out of place. Magnification only bolstered her suspicion that something was off.</p>



<p>“This image made me think that the bands were cut one by one and pasted on a membrane background,” Şenay Akin, of Hacettepe University in Ankara, wrote in her comments to the editor of <em>Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy</em>, a Springer Nature journal. “If this is the case, it indicates a manipulation [of] the results of this study.”</p>



<p>The editor, Yochai Birnbaum of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, made a note to check the figure, adding below Akin’s comments in the editorial-management system: “I agree with the reviewer. It could be that the I/R band was manipulated.”</p>



<span id="more-128933"></span>



<p>Akin followed up with Birnbaum to ask why the paper was eventually rejected. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We emailed the corresponding author using his email addressed to ask clarification and data concerning the western blots. As he did not responded, I finally rejected the manuscript</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Birnbaum whether the rejection was related to the alleged manipulation, but he and a spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes the journal, declined to comment, citing confidentiality concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A few months after the manuscript was rejected by Birnbaum’s journal, however, it appeared in the pages of the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology</em>, an Elsevier journal, under the same title, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2023.175774">Inhibition of MALT1 reduces ferroptosis in rat hearts following ischemia/reperfusion via enhancing the Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway.</a>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The image Akin had flagged in the rejected paper “had been modified” in the published version, she told us, softening the suspicious features in the original. Some of the error bars and <em>P</em>-values in the paper also differed from the material she had reviewed.</p>



<p>Akin took it upon herself to alert the journal’s editor-in-chief, Frank Redegeld of Utrecht University, in the Netherlands, to her misgivings. But Redegeld dismissed her concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Redegeld wrote that he had investigated the allegations about the Western blots with “very sensitive AI image analysis software.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The analysis did not detect any issues with the western blot images as published,” he told us. “Therefore, we have no reason to assume the published figure was manipulated and we have closed this case accordingly.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ya-Qian Jiang of The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in Changsha, China, lead author of the paper and one of the authors credited for conducting the experiments, told us by email:“We actually provided all the raw data for [the Western blots] as the supplemental materials in the process of review.” Jiang also sent us <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jjX1bubn50ZjCZ6YGySnMPXBM5O31Y6K/view?usp=sharing">the image</a> purported to be the original Figure 1F.</p>



<p>“Anyone [who] has the hand-on experience in doing WB should understand why he/she does not use the full-size membrane to incubate with the antibody and why there [are] some peculiar features — haloes around the bands,” Jiang said.</p>



<p>But David Sanders, a scientific sleuth and biologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, said the blots published in the <em>European Journal of Pharmacology</em> had “clear discontinuities,” adding that “some of the bands appear to be pasted on to other bands as background.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Sanders could not rule out legitimate image processing had caused the anomalies, magnifying the image revealed clear rectangular outlines for the bands that were posted on a background, he told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Thursday, March 14th is arXiv&#8217;s Giving Day! The number pi will always hold a special place in our hearts, which makes the fact that arXiv Giving Day falls on 3.14 this year even more special!</p>
<p>arXiv Giving Day is a part of Cornell Giving Day, which is facilitated by our parent organization, Cornell University. On March 14th, we ask both the Cornell community, and the scientific community at large, to come together in support of important causes that help foster inclusive education, equitable scholarship, and scientific innovation.</p>
<p>Like pi, the possibilities and potential for scientific discovery provided by arXiv are endless—but our resources aren’t. arXiv is open and free to use for all, but it is not free to operate. arXiv is a critical community resource, and we depend on you to help us stay fast, free to use, and open for all.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://givingday.cornell.edu/campaigns/arxiv">100% of your contribution today</a> will go towards supporting arXiv&#8217;s infrastructure, operations, and special initiatives.</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re a big slice of the pie that makes arXiv and open science possible. Thank you for your contribution, whether that is through a gift today, or simply through the use of arXiv in your work and studies. We are proud to provide a platform that helps you share your research with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s continue to promote open science and discovery together.</strong></p>

<p>Wiley, whose Hindawi subsidiary has attracted thousands of paper mill papers that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">later needed to be retracted</a>, has seen widespread paper mill activity among hundreds of its journals, it announced yesterday.</p>



<p>More than 270 of its titles rejected anywhere from 600 to 1,000 papers per month before peer review once they implemented a pilot of what the publisher calls its <a href="https://johnwiley2020news.q4web.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Wiley-announces-pilot-of-new-AI-powered-Papermill-Detection-service/default.aspx">Papermill Detection service</a>. That service flagged 10-13% of all of the 10,000 manuscripts submitted to those journals per month, Wiley told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Wiley said the service includes “six distinct tools,” including looking for similarities with known paper mill papers, searching for “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">tortured phrases</a>” and other problematic passages, flagging “irregular publishing patterns by paper authors,” verifying researcher identity, detecting hallmarks of generative AI, and analyzing the relevance of a given manuscript to the journal.</p>



<span id="more-128927"></span>



<p>Wiley will now “advance this new service into the next phase of testing in partnership with Sage and IEEE,” a spokesperson said.</p>



<p>“This service is complementary to the STM Integrity Hub, which has been established to provide a shared infrastructure both for screening and information sharing across publishers,” the spokesperson told Retraction Watch. The service does not make use of another product, the Papermill Alarm from Clear Skies, which is incorporated into the <a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/stm-integrity-hub-incorporates-clear-skies-papermill-alarm-screening-tool/">Integrity Hub</a>, the spokesperson added.</p>



<p>Asked what Wiley would tell authors of rejected papers, or whether they would alert any other publishers, the spokesperson said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley’s Papermill Detection service is meant to supplement human integrity checks with AI-powered tools. This means that papers will not automatically be rejected if they are flagged in the system – rather, they will be flagged to an editor for closer consideration before proceeding in the publishing workflow.</p>



<p>Research integrity is an industry-wide challenge, and we are committed to transparency and sharing what we learn about papermills with our peers and the wider industry. We will continue to do so as we learn more through the continued testing and piloting of this service. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also asked if Wiley has considered steps to reduce the incentives authors have to use paper mills, rather than just working to detect them:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Yes, this is a problem we must address across the entire scholarly communications ecosystem. Wiley agrees with the findings of the 2022 joint report between COPE and STM which calls for direct engagement with funders, universities and hospitals to create new incentives. The United2Act initiative, which <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/network/publishing/research-publishing/research-integrity/wiley-endorse-united2Act-initiative">Wiley endorses</a> and contributes to, has been organized to bring those stakeholders together.&nbsp; One of their five working groups is focused directly on this important dialog between the stakeholders in the global academic reward systems.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wiley will <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/06/wiley-to-stop-using-hindawi-name-amid-18-million-revenue-decline/">stop using the Hindawi brand</a>, it said late last year, after they paused publication of&nbsp; lucrative special issues because they were overrun by paper mills. That move cost the company, which publishes about 1,600 journals, millions of dollars. CEO Brian Napack <a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Wiley-Announces-CEO-Transition/default.aspx">stepped down in October 2023</a> amid the bad news.</p>

<p>Following an investigation into possible paper mill activities, the journal <em>Cureus</em> has barred a doctor in Pakistan from publishing more papers &#8220;out of an abundance of caution,&#8221; Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The journal investigated Satish Kumar, an internist at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical College in Karachi, after a tipster accused him of selling authorship of scientific papers to scientists who did not participate in the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tipster, who wishes to remain anonymous to avoid backlash from the authors of these papers, sent <em>Cureus</em> WhatsApp messages from a group called &#8220;research Match Residency.&#8221; There, a user named ”SSS” sent paper titles and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Whatsapp-group-mentioning-payment-scaled.jpg">offered author slots on manuscripts</a>. Many of the articles were slated for publication in <em>Cureus</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128901"></span>



<p>The tipster also shared the WhatsApp messages with Retraction Watch, telling us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have known Dr. Satesh Kumar for a couple of years and previously had his contact information saved in my phone. Upon his online advertisements in various WhatsApp groups, I recognized the name already saved in my phone from our prior communication.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Graham Parker, director of Publishing and Customer Success at <em>Cureus</em>, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We conducted a thorough investigation and were unable to confirm these allegations. However, the circumstantial evidence presented to the journal was, out of an abundance of caution, enough to warrant the rejection of any in-progress article submissions that involved Dr. Kumar. Additionally, Dr. Kumar&#8217;s Cureus account was permanently suspended.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Several of the paper titles advertised in the WhatsApp group match papers in <em>Cureus</em>, according to screenshots and a video shared with Retraction Watch. Satish Kumar (spelled Satesh Kumar in two of the articles) is listed as an author on all of the papers, which include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/217975-cardio-oncology-managing-cardiovascular-complications-of-cancer-therapies#!/">Cardio-Oncology: Managing Cardiovascular Complications of Cancer Therapies</a></li>

</ul>



<p>However, Parker stated that the journal did not find &#8220;irrefutable proof&#8221; authorship slots were &#8220;sold on any articles submitted to or published in Cureus.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All authors that were questioned stated they had no knowledge of any such activity and extensive working materials were produced showing the collaborative work by the authors. As a result, the journal found no basis for retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to the findings of the investigation, Kumar told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I certainly deny all allegations for which i have provided all the material and proof to Cureus and Mr parker in cureus. There is no single proof where they can prove i am included in any of such allegations. I have all materials and i am open to arrange and speak on call as well to give more explanation. I have already provided all materials to Mr Parker and [Cureus reviewer] Prof guistino Varassi. I am more than ready to provide an explanation and evidences to you as well considering, i am innocent and have no such involvement.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, Kumar refused to go on the record during a subsequent call with Retraction Watch.&nbsp;Later, he wrote by email: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I sent emails to journal that if they dont have anything proven, they should unban me, however i can&#8217;t force someone to do because they are the owner of their journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The tipster also accused Kumar of using AI to author at least a portion of six of his more recent papers, which the tipster checked using the app GPT Zero, a tool that has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10519776/">proven accurate</a> at flagging machine-generated medical text. Based on the abstracts of these papers, the use of AI varied from 65% to 97%.</p>



<p>On March 7, Parker wrote in an email to the tipster:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;d like to once again thank you for your dedication to scientific integrity and fairness. We have conducted a thorough review regarding potential use of generative AI tools in Satesh Kumar&#8217;s articles and are unable to make a conclusive determination. ZeroGPT, GPTZero and similar tools cannot be relied upon in this regard as they have been shown to produce many false positives (perhaps most famously indicating that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/">United States Constitution was written by AI</a>), but they also do not distinguish between generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) and proofreading tools such as Grammarly.</p>



<p>As a result, we do not intend to take any further action regarding these articles. However, Dr. Kumar&#8217;s account will remain permanently suspended out of an abundance of caution, as the journal no longer wishes to work with him in any capacity. Thanks again for your time and energy on this.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>. The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. This is the last blog in our<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=einstein-awards-program"> 5-part series</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every research study involves numerous potential outcomes and conclusions, as researchers employ diverse analytical approaches when interpreting empirical data. Recognizing the variability in these methods, my colleagues from the University of Innsbruck, Stanford University, and Dartmouth College, along with myself, have established the Global Analytical Robustness Initiative.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The primary goal of this initiative is to enhance analytical standards within the behavioral and social sciences, thereby boosting the reliability and transparency of research outcomes. The team&rsquo;s plan is to have 100 studies examined by around 500 experts for analytical robustness and create an open database that makes transparent the correlation between the analytical paths taken in empirical work and the results presented in the research.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>There is a lack of analytical resilience in empirical research that slows down the knowledge accumulation process</p><cite>Psychologist Barnab&aacute;s Sz&aacute;szi</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The project will enable researchers to identify and respond to the corresponding problems and challenges. On this basis, the Global Analytical Robustness Initiative aims to issue recommendations on how to increase analytical robustness and train scientists to use the most robust analytical methodologies. &ldquo;In this way, we hope to strengthen the reliability of future empirical results and, ultimately, foster trust in science.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-brain-menstrual-cycle-and-female-sex-hormones-acknowledging-sex-bias-in-neuroimaging-research">The brain, menstrual cycle and female sex hormones: acknowledging sex bias in neuroimaging research</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Disclaimer: WiNUK acknowledges that the menstrual cycle is not a gender-specific experience. Throughout this blog, people who experience the hormone changes of the menstrual cycle are referred to as the ‘female sex’ or ‘female’, and those who were assigned female at birth.</em></p>
<hr><h5>What is the menstrual cycle?</h5><p>The menstrual cycle is the ~28 day hormone cycle females have to regulate the shedding and build up of the uterus lining. The hormones that fluctuate are oestrogen, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. Fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone are the most prominent,  lasting for the majority of the cycle, with oestrogen peaking during the follicular phase until ovulation and progesterone increasing during the luteal phase as the lining builds, and dropping when the lining sheds. </p>
<blockquote>"Even in people without PMDD, peak progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle are associated with increases in negative mood"</blockquote><h5>How can these hormones affect the brain?</h5><p>As these changes are so long-lasting and distinct, with oestrogen levels rising 8-fold and progesterone levels 80-fold during the ~28 day cycle (1), it has been hypothesised that people who experience these hormone changes will have marked differences in brain function and behaviour during these times. Indeed, many  report emotional changes, increased irritability and decreased self-esteem during their cycle. Furthermore, people who take hormonal contraception may experience similar mood disturbances. But how do sex hormones have such a profound effect on our emotions? It is all down to the distribution of sex hormone receptors in the brain. Progesterone binds to receptors located in the amygdala, a brain region responsible for a range of emotional responses, such as anxiety, social understanding (interpreting social cues), and fear. Progesterone has been implicated in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that is associated with emotional dysregulation during the luteal phase (when progesterone peaks) (2). Even in people without PMDD, peak progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle are associated with increases in negative mood (3). Progesterone can easily cross the blood brain barrier and can even accumulate in brain tissue to beyond levels found in the blood. Moreover, progesterone also has a role in stress regulation. During periods of stress, it can be converted to cortisol, the primary stress hormone (4) maintaining the actions of the sympathetic nervous system (the branch of the nervous system responsible for staying in high alert during situations of prolonged stress). </p>

<p>Other areas of the brain have sex hormone receptors too. The hippocampus is rich in sex hormone receptors and is also highly plastic, meaning it can be structurally altered in response to stimuli such as hormones. Indeed, oestrogen has been found to modulate structural plasticity in the hippocampus (5), having important implications in learning and memory. The hippocampus is also responsible for long term memory storage which can have significant implications on emotion - such as how a fond childhood memory might make us happy and reminiscent, or a negative one fearful and anxious.</p>
<blockquote>"Only 0.5% of neuroimaging studies consider the effects of sex hormones and hormone transition phases on the brain"</blockquote>
<p>Studies on the hippocampus have shown conflicting responses to sex hormones; some suggest there is a significant increase in grey matter in this region during the peak oestrogen portion of the menstrual cycle (6, 7), while others find no such result and lean towards the effect of progesterone on cycle stage-dependent changes in hippocampal volume (3). </p>
<h5>The gap in research on female sex hormones and neuroimaging</h5><p>Unfortunately, the scarcity and vagueness of research on the effect of female sex hormones in the brain is in part due to the long-standing bias towards males in neuroscientific research. In recent years, researchers have been encouraged to include both sexes in their experiments, whether it is on humans or rodents. Despite this leading to an increase in female representation in sample populations, the majority of research does not then analyse sex differences - as few as 5% of papers in neuroscience and psychiatry published in 2019 included ‘optimal analysis of possible sex differences’ (8). This emphasises a very pressing issue in neuroscience research. If we aren’t including females in our sample populations and are not analysing sex differences as a variable within research, we most certainly are not taking into account sex-dependent hormone cycles. This is evident in neuroimaging, with only 0.5% of neuroimaging studies considering the effects of sex hormones and hormone transition phases on the brain (9). It is even more alarming that this has only been flagged in the past couple years, when oral contraceptives have been readily prescribed since the 1960’s. </p>
<h5>The future of sex hormone and neuroendocrine research</h5><p>Current trends, largely driven by female neuroscientists, are to provide more clarity on the effect of the menstrual cycle on brain structure and behaviour. The overarching flaw of most neuroimaging studies evaluating the effect of the menstrual cycle on the brain is that they only observe a snapshot of the cycle. To improve our understanding of brain changes across the full 28 days, imaging experiments need to visualise the brain at a range of time points. When neuroimaging takes into account the day-to-day hormone fluctuations over the breadth of the menstrual cycle, we can begin to see just how the brain is altered over this period of time. A number of studies by the Jacobs Lab (University of California, Santa Barbara) have done just that, looking at how oestrogen and progesterone affect functional brain networks of an individual across a 30-day cycle (10).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that people are becoming more aware of the sex bias in research, attention is turning to the long-dismissed importance of sex differences in neuroscience. Soon we may uncover answers as to why females make up two thirds of people with Alzheimer’s, how to help those suffering from PMDD, and other interesting differences.</p>

<p>Human cell lines represent key reagents for many research laboratories. Cell lines are often the first models that researchers choose for experiments such as gene manipulation and drug testing, as they are relatively accessible and inexpensive, particularly compared with mouse and other animal models. </p>



<p>However, cell lines also are prone to contamination by other faster growing cell lines. As a result,&nbsp; many human cell lines purported to represent particular tumor types have been found by genetic testing to be contaminated by other cancer cells. This potential for confusion poses a serious problem for researchers who want to study a particular cancer type but end up using cells from an unrelated disease.</p>



<p>Our team studies <a href="https://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/5/4/e202101203">wrongly identified nucleotide sequence reagents in cancer research</a>, such as PCR primers and gene knockdown reagents. Recently in the context of an undergraduate student project, we decided to also check the identities of cell lines in a small group of papers on the human gene <em>miR-145</em>, which codes for a microRNA. We <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.582220v1">found</a> wrongly identified nucleotide sequences and cell lines in numerous articles about <em>miR-145</em>, but also what appeared to be five misspelled identifiers of contaminated cell lines. </p>



<span id="more-128885"></span>



<p>This issue isn’t new – some cell line identifiers are known to be misspelled, although little has been written about such misspellings. We decided to study these apparent misspellings, and eventually found 23 published human cell line identifiers that were not recognised as cell lines in the most comprehensive cell line knowledgebase, <a href="https://www.cellosaurus.org/">Cellosaurus</a>. We then studied eight of these non-verifiable (NV) cell line identifiers <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.582220v1">in detail across 420 papers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While all eight NV identifiers likely represent misspellings in at least some papers, we also found that seven of the eight NV cell line identifiers seemed to be taking on new identities as independent cell lines. How did we separate identifier misspellings from seemingly independent cell lines? NV cell line identifiers were described as misspellings where they were only used alternately with similarly named human cell line(s), such that the misspelled identifier was never directly connected with any similarly-named cell line. </p>



<p>In contrast, NV cell line identifiers were indicated to represent independent cell lines if they were used without mentions of any similarly named human cell line; if an NV and similarly named human cell line was included in any list of cell lines studied; if results for both cell lines were shown in the same experiment(s); and/or&nbsp; if both cell line identifiers were directly connected in the text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We determined that more than half of the 420 papers appeared to refer to at least one NV identifier as an independent cell line. However, we could not find any published descriptions of how these cell lines were first established. Some authors claimed to have produced genetic profiles for three NV cell lines, but we could not find such profiles for these cell lines, either in publications describing NV cell lines or elsewhere. Six NV cell lines were claimed to have been sourced from large cell line repositories such as ATCC, but we could not find any of these NV identifiers or cell lines in the claimed repository catalogues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why should we be concerned by NV cell lines? As the problem of cell line contamination has shown, cell line identities underpin the results of experiments conducted with these models. The inability to independently verify cell lines raises doubts about&nbsp; the significance of associated results, how these results might be reproduced, and even which experiments were conducted in the first place. While researchers seem unlikely to source NV cell lines for their own experiments (as we could not find them in claimed repositories), they could still risk wasting time and money by following up results from NV cell lines using cell lines that they already have on hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Descriptions of NV cell lines call for a zero-tolerance approach to misspelled cell line identifiers and pairing the names of all published cell lines with their corresponding <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/18/how-a-typo-in-a-catalog-number-led-to-the-correction-of-a-scientific-paper-and-what-we-can-learn-from-that/">Research Resource Identifiers</a> (<a href="https://www.rrids.org/">RRIDs</a>). In the meantime, as we have advised for nucleotide sequence identities, researchers should check the identities of any cell lines that they don’t recognize before planning any future experiments. Simple checks could avoid wasting time on cell lines that might be found on wanted posters, but not in Cellosaurus.</p>
