<p>A panel of scholars in Finland has downgraded 60 journals in their quality rating system, following months of review and feedback from researchers.</p>



<p>The Finnish Publication Forum (JUFO) classifies and rates journals and other scholarly publications to “support the quality assessment of academic research,” according to its website. JUFO considers the level of transparency, the number of experts on a publication’s editorial board, and the standard of peer review to make its assessment, which academics can use to determine the credibility of a given title or its publisher.</p>



<p>JUFO’s classification ranges from 3, for “supreme-level” publications, to 1, which still counts as legitimate publication. <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/faq-0#Q5">Level 0</a> means the journal is excluded from the ranking, which may dissuade researchers from publishing with them, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/can-you-explain-what-these-1500-papers-are-doing-in-this-journal/">James Heathers</a>, a scientific sleuth said. Finland’s university funding model relies on JUFO as a publication quality metric. </p>



<span id="more-129519"></span>



<p>In February, JUFO posted an <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/jufo-collects-experiences-defects-quality-assessment-practices-scientific-journals">open call</a> asking for negative experiences to help re-evaluate&nbsp; the ranking system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heathers and <a href="https://www.jyu.fi/en/people/veli-matti-karhulahti">Veli-Matti Karhulahti</a>, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä, gathered roughly 200 different publication-related experiences from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mkarhulahti.bsky.social/post/3kndn377upk2z">BlueSky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/jamesheathers/status/1768268321323946064">X</a> users and submitted them to JUFO.</p>



<p>The 60 <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XL6WpwztflELASTDu0TqdJP5XenY9YrGi6vXOZ3Gea8/edit?gid=0#gid=0">journals</a> will be downgraded from level 1 to level 0 at the start of 2025. Of these, 21 are from MDPI, three from Wiley, and three from Frontiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/02/exclusive-mdpi-journal-undergoing-reevaluation-at-scopus-indexing-on-hold/">JUFO downgraded MDPI’s</a> <em>Sustainability</em> to level 0 over doubts about the journal’s “procedures to ensure scientific quality work reliably,” as we reported. At JUFO’s June meeting, the group discussed the possibility of downgrading all MDPI journals to level 0 but did not take any action on the idea. MDPI did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Tom Ciavarella, head of public affairs for Frontiers North America, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Finland and Frontiers established <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2022/04/07/finland-and-frontiers-establish-national-open-access-agreement/">a national Open Access agreement</a> in 2022 and enjoy a strong collaborative relationship. We have been made aware of the recent decision by JUFO to list three Frontiers journals &#8212; Frontiers in Plant Science, Frontiers in Marine Science, and Frontiers in Sociology &#8212; at level 0 starting January 1, 2025. Frontiers is seeking information from JUFO about its decision. JUFO did not communicate any concerns to Frontiers about these journals prior to their change in status. These are journals that have strong support in the respective research communities, including in Finland.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Wiley has been transparent about our commitment to cleaning the scholarly record, investing in research integrity, and strengthening publishing processes. These journals continue to serve their communities,” a spokesperson for Wiley said.</p>



<p>Heathers’ X post which gained the most traction specifically asked for experiences with MDPI, Hindawi and Frontiers, Karhulahti said, which isn’t entirely representative of all publisher experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking about the submissions they received, Heathers said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Many of these journals were making unreasonable demands of their reviewers, or rejecting their opinion entirely, providing slipshod review processes, are run by dismissive, disinterested or just completely bent editors, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heathers and Karhulahti also submitted reports of good practice by journals to JUFO, he said.</p>



<p>“We recognise about half the journals from the submissions we made, so it&#8217;s likely that we provided a lot of the raw fuel that underpinned those downgrades,” Heathers told Retraction Watch. A spokesperson for JUFO declined to comment on individuals who gave feedback.</p>



<p>Although the campaign has ended, the scientific community can give JUFO feedback on the quality of publications at any time, a spokesperson for JUFO said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karhulahti urged more countries to stop relying on publisher-generated metrics of quality such as indexing in Scopus and instead use researcher or community-produced indexes, like JUFO.</p>



<p>“All in all, a very successful experiment,” Heathers said, “and one we would happily repeat.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-impact-of-exercise-on-mental-health-a-neuroscientific-perspective">The Impact of Exercise on Mental Health: A Neuroscientific Perspective</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;">Mental Health Awareness Week, observed in mid-May, highlights the ongoing importance of addressing mental health issues. As we move into July and enjoy better weather, the seasonal depression that affects many during the winter months often lifts. However, it&apos;s important to remember that mental health issues do not simply disappear with the arrival of summer. Among the many factors that influence mental health, exercise stands out due to its significant and well-documented benefits. This blog explores the neuroscience behind how physical activity can enhance mental well-being, providing insights into the mechanisms that make exercise a potent tool for mental health improvement.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Exercise as a Primary Treatment for Depression</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A comprehensive study conducted by researchers at the University of South Australia has emphasised the potential of exercise as a primary treatment for depression. Published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, this meta-review is the most extensive to date, analysing data from 97 reviews, encompassing 1,039 trials and 128,119 participants. The findings are striking: physical activity is 1.5 times more effective than traditional treatments, such as counselling or leading medications, in alleviating symptoms of depression. </p>
<p>The meta-review reveals that short-term exercise interventions, lasting 12 weeks or less, are particularly effective. This highlights the rapid impact physical activity can have on mental health, offering a promising alternative or complement to conventional treatments. Notably, substantial benefits were observed in diverse groups, including individuals with depression, pregnant and postpartum women, healthy individuals, and those diagnosed with HIV or kidney disease. This suggests that exercise can be beneficial across a wide range of demographics and health conditions. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Types and Intensity of Exercise</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The type and intensity of exercise play crucial roles in its effectiveness. This study found that all forms of physical activity—ranging from aerobic exercises and resistance training, to mixed-mode exercise and yoga—were effective in improving mental health. However, moderate-to-high-intensity exercise was more effective than low-intensity exercise, likely due to the greater physiological and neurochemical changes induced by higher-intensity workouts. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Another systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Noetel et al. in 2024 corroborates these findings. This analysis examined the impact of various exercise modalities on depression and found that walking, jogging, yoga, strength training, and dancing significantly alleviate depressive symptoms. Interestingly, the review highlighted differences in effectiveness based on gender and age. For instance, walking and jogging benefited both genders, whereas strength training was more effective for women, and yoga or qigong was particularly effective for men. Additionally, yoga showed greater benefits for older adults, while strength training was more beneficial for younger individuals. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Neurological Mechanisms</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Understanding the neurological mechanisms behind the mental health benefits of exercise is essential. The University of South Australia study points to several key neurobiological changes induced by physical activity. Exercise boosts the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), enhances the availability of serotonin and norepinephrine, regulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and reduces systemic inflammation. These changes contribute to improved mood and reduced anxiety, supporting the therapeutic benefits of physical activity. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Noetel et al. also propose several mechanisms based on trends observed in their data. They suggest that social interaction in group exercises can enhance social connectivity, reducing feelings of isolation and depression. Practices like yoga promote mindfulness and experiential acceptance, which are beneficial for mental health. Activities with immediate feedback, such as strength training, can boost self-confidence and perceived competence. Furthermore, exposure to green spaces during outdoor activities provides additional environmental and psychological benefits. Collectively, these factors contribute to the mental health benefits associated with exercise. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Implications for Mental Health Treatment</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Despite the strong evidence supporting the benefits of exercise, it remains underutilised in clinical practice for several reasons. Patients may be reluctant to adopt exercise routines, particularly if they are experiencing severe depressive symptoms. Additionally, prescribing and monitoring exercise can be challenging in clinical settings, and there is a lack of standardised protocols for integrating exercise into mental health treatment plans. </p>
<p>Clinical guidelines also vary across countries. While some, like Australia, recommend lifestyle management, including exercise, as a first-line treatment, others view it as a complementary approach when psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is ineffective. The meta-analysis by Noetel et al. advocates for the integration of exercise into primary treatment protocols for depression, tailored to individual patient characteristics. They propose that structured programs and group exercises can provide additional support and enhance adherence, leading to better outcomes. Exercise should be recommended as a primary treatment for depression, rather than merely as a supplementary option. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;">The evidence strongly supports the incorporation of physical activity as a primary treatment for depression and anxiety. Both studies highlight the significant mental health benefits, lower costs, and fewer side effects of exercise compared to traditional treatments. Given these advantages, exercise should be more widely adopted in therapeutic settings. Future research should focus on optimising exercise prescriptions and integrating physical activity into standard mental health care practices to enhance patient outcomes.</span></p>

<p>The corresponding author of a paper flagged on PubPeer for an apparently duplicated image will be asking the journal to publish a correction, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/12640/text/">The BET bromodomain inhibitor exerts the most potent synergistic anticancer effects with quinone-containing compounds and anti-microtubule drugs</a>,” appeared in <em>Oncotarget</em> in 2016. Its authors include Marcel Dinger, now a dean at the University of Sydney, who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/05/26/university-of-sydney-dean-working-to-amend-review-papers-that-cited-papermill-articles/">has said he’s working to correct review papers</a> that cited papermill articles, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=jennifer+a+byrne">sleuth</a> <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/jennifer-byrne.html">Jennifer A. Byrne</a>, also of the University of Sydney.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this month, an anonymous user on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1472682C2E9A6EA981C51A72C6C398#1">pointed out</a> areas of images in figure 6B that were “much more similar than expected.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129496"></span>



<p>We reached out to <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-tao-liu">Tao Liu</a>, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, and the corresponding author of the article, who told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>My collaborator accidently made a mistake when assembling Figure 6B, and provided me the wrong graph in 2015. We will contact the journal to publish an erratum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Byrne told us she could see the partial duplication the PubPeer comment flagged, and “based on my understanding of the data shown, I agree that there should not be any duplication between these 2 images.”</p>



<p>She added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>By way of background, I was a co-author on this publication as I was a co-investigator on one of the competitively-awarded grants that supported this project, from 2013-2015. This grant was intended to promote collaborative translational research across two research sites in Sydney, Australia, where I was the co-investigator representing the second research site. None of the experiments for this project, including those described in this publication, were performed in my laboratory. I reviewed the manuscript prior to submission but I did not detect the image duplication.</p>

Do we grasp the essence of equity and its implications amongst all the chatter? How do different stakeholders of the scholarly publishing landscape approach equity, define it, and act on it?

<p>Clarivate, the company that calculates Journal Impact Factors based on citations to articles, didn’t publish the metric for <a href="https://jcr.help.clarivate.com/Content/title-suppressions.htm">17 journals</a> this year due to suspected citation manipulation. That’s a substantial increase from <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/28/truly-devastating-four-journals-wont-get-new-impact-factors-this-year-because-of-citation-shenanigans/">last year</a>, when only four were excluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increase is, in part, case of rising tides lifting (sinking?) all boats: In its <a href="https://clarivate.com/news/clarivate-reveals-worlds-leading-and-trusted-journals-with-the-2024-journal-citation-reports/">2024 Journal Citation Reports</a>, Clarivate included an additional 7,200 journals from the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) and the the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), a spokesperson for the company said, resulting in a larger number of impact factor suppressions than in past years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate suppressed nearly twice as many journals <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">in 2020</a>, when it penalized 33 for self-citation. The company suppressed <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">10 in 2021</a>, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/28/the-lancet-more-than-doubles-its-impact-factor-eclipsing-nejm-for-the-first-time-ever/">three the following year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129506"></span>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, a spokesperson said journals are suppressed from the report due to “anomalous citation behavior, including where there is evidence of excessive journal self-citation and/or citation stacking (which involves two or more journals). We do not presume a motive or accuse these journals of wrongdoing.”</p>



<p>Though the metric is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/07/14/impact-factor-science-journals/">controversial</a>, many institutions use impact factors as an indicator of journal quality to evaluate the work of researchers – meaning journal suppressions can have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">negative effects for authors</a> as well as for journals, which may see decreased submissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://environment.yale.edu/directory/faculty/robert-mendelsohn">Robert Mendelsohn</a>, the editor-in-chief of <a href="https://worldscientific.com/worldscinet/cce"><em>Climate Change Economics</em></a><em>,</em> said his journal was suppressed because of “too many citations” from Springer’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11356"><em>Environmental Science &amp; Pollution Research</em></a>, which also did not receive an impact factor:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Clarivate said this was unusual for an economics journal and therefore suspicious. We tried to explain that our journal was focused on climate change and that it was important to link the economic studies to natural science.&nbsp; This explained why so many authors had science citations.&nbsp; Clarivate apparently did not care and gave us a year to change our ways. Keeping climate change studies anchored in natural science, however, is important. So we are not changing our citation policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer said the publisher was disappointed that Clarivate had chosen to suppress <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11356"><em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em> </a>from the Journal Citation Reports, and that they are investigating Clarivate’s concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cfi.lu.lv/en/notikumi/konferences/cfiorganizetasstarptautiskaskonferencesunpasakumi/gadskarteja-functional-materials-and-nanotechnologies-konference/rcbjsf-2014-fmnt/invited-speakers/prof-rostyslav-vlokh/">Rostyslav Vlokh</a>, editor-in-chief of <a href="https://ifo.lviv.ua/journal/index.html"><em>Ukranian Journal for Physical Optics</em></a>, told us the reason his journal was suppressed was because of the “abnormally large number of citations (46%) for our journal in 2023” that came from <em>Optik </em>journal. He denied that his journal had any control over the “editorial politics” of <em>Optik.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The citation stacking is quite a thin issue in this case, i.e., we cannot unambiguously prove or deny it &#8211; many authors were involved in the citation,” Vlokh said, calling the Clarivate editorial team “a bit hasty” in their decision-making.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Editor-in-chief of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/waaa20"><em>Activities, Adaptation &amp; Aging</em></a>, <a href="https://sunwayuniversity.edu.my/sunway-business-school/staff-profiles/lim-weng-marc">Lim Weng Marc</a>, told us in an email, “We are indeed sadden [sic] by this outcome.” He attributes the suppression of his impact factor to “change in our journal’s focus in 2021, which created a niche, and possibly due to the fairly small number of articles we publish.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal published 17 articles in 2021, 18 in 2022, and 28 in 2023. This low number “could have magnified the supposed self-citation to the articles in the same issue which our editorial introduces,” Marc said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Catherine Liu, a publisher for Elsevier, commented on the suppression of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy"><em>Resources Policy</em></a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As shown by the Clarivate analysis, the citations from <em>Resources Policy</em> to 2 other small journals indeed provided a substantial boost to the citations numbers for 2 other small journals, with respect to the body of outgoing citations from Resources Policy they appear to be a tiny fraction (0.6%). However, although <em>Resources Policy</em> is prestigious within the community, and the scope of the problem is limited, Clarivate still insist to suppress <em>Resources Policy</em> from receiving Journal Impact Factor this time.</p>

<p>Liu noted that Elsevier is investigating this issue and might retract flagged papers or “at minimum” re-review and correct them, based on Elsevier’s recently updated retractions policy, which seeks to address compromised peer review and systematic review or citation problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate is verifying <em>Cuadernos De Economía</em> following a high number of citations in other journals, a spokesperson for Elsevier’s <em>Cuadernos De Economía</em> said.</p>



<p>Two of the suppressed journals, <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/41066"><em>Granular Computing</em></a><em>,</em> a Springer title,<em> </em>and<em> </em>Elsevier’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-sciences"><em>Information Sciences</em></a>, both have <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/wpedrycz">Witold Pedrycz</a> as editor-in-chief. Pedrycz did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier takes these claims “very seriously” and is reviewing the articles highlighted by Clarivate, a spokesperson for Elsevier said. Clarivate was concerned about citations in 12 articles published in <em>Information Sciences</em> in 2023 and elected to suppress the journal’s impact factor for one year, the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>The other suppressed journals which didn’t respond to our request for comment are as follows:</p>

</ul>



<p>“Suppressed journals remain in the Web of Science Core Collection – although they may be subject to re-evaluation and will be removed from coverage if they fail – and will be eligible for inclusion in the Journal Citation Reports again the following year,” a spokesperson for Clarivate said.</p>

<p>A 2020 paper that claimed to find a link between microbial genomes in tissue and cancer has been retracted following an analysis that called the results into question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2095-1">Microbiome analyses of blood and tissues suggest cancer diagnostic approach</a>,” was published in March 2020 and has been cited 610 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. It was retracted June 26. The study was also key to the formation of biotech start-up <a href="https://micronoma.com/">Micronoma</a>, which did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/robin.knight">Rob Knight</a>, corresponding author and researcher at the University of California San Diego, also did not immediately respond to our request for comment. </p>



<span id="more-129502"></span>



<p>In October 2023, <em>mBio,</em> a journal from the American Society for Microbiology, published “<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01607-23">Major data analysis errors invalidate cancer microbiome findings</a>.” The paper pointed out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/health/cancer-microbes-debate.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2k0.rotR.wjzhApCf1DtD&amp;smid=url-share">several major flaws</a> in the the earlier article by Knight’s group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After downloading and analyzing the original data, “we found almost right away that the authors of the Nature paper had made some huge mistakes &#8211; that most of the bacteria they found simply weren&#8217;t there, or else were present in quantities that were 100s of times smaller than they reported. Oops,” <a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/Steven+L.+Salzberg/2777097">Steven Salzberg</a>, a researcher at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, and corresponding author of the 2023 paper, told Retraction Watch in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salzberg and his colleagues found “some of these species were ‘nonsensical,’” he told us. For example, the Knight paper found that<em> Hepandensovirus</em> was the most important species to identify adrenocortical carcinoma. “Well, that&#8217;s a shrimp virus! Makes no sense as it doesn&#8217;t exist in humans,” he told us.</p>



<p>Knight’s group responded to the criticism in a follow-up paper, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-024-02974-w">Robustness of cancer microbiome signals over a broad range of methodological variation</a>,” published in February 2024 in <em>Oncogene</em>. In it, they defended their original findings: “These extensive re-analyses and updated methods validate our original conclusion that cancer type-specific microbial signatures exist in TCGA, and show they are robust to methodology.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07656-x">retraction notice</a> cites Salzberg’s paper and the response from the authors. It reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Editors have retracted this article. After publication, concerns about the robustness of specific microbial signatures reported as associated with cancer were brought to the attention of the Editors. The authors have provided responses to the issues in a separate publication.</p>



<p>Expert post-publication peer review of the issues raised and the authors’ responses has confirmed that some of the findings of the article are affected and the corresponding conclusions are no longer supported. All authors agree with this retraction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/06/plos-announces-new-publishing-agreement-with-colombian-consortium/">PLOS Announces New Publishing Agreement with Colombian Consortium</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS published the following press release on Wednesday, June 26.</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash;The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is pleased to announce a consortium agreement with Consorcio Colombia / Consortia facilitated by Accucoms, that allows joining member institutions to participate in PLOS&rsquo; three innovative publishing models across all 14 PLOS titles. The agreement provides researchers from affiliated institutions unlimited publishing privileges in PLOS journals without incurring fees. Eight Colombian institutions have joined the agreement in 2024 [1], and more institutions are expected to join in the following years.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Consorcio Colombia is a collaborative work initiative with great recognition in Latin America and constantly seeks options to facilitate access to information and open access in the country. That is why it decided to sign an agreement with PLOS to facilitate the publication of the research community in one of the most important open access publishers in the world. With this, we hope to increase the visibility and academic impact of our research while promoting sustainable models of scientific communication,&rdquo;&nbsp;said C&eacute;sar Rend&oacute;n, CEO of Consortia.</p>



<p>M&oacute;nica Cristancho, Library Director at Universidad El Bosque, one of the participating institutions in 2024, said, &ldquo;Collaborating with PLOS, through the open access agreement with Consorcio Colombia, has been crucial in promoting the publications of researchers from Universidad El Bosque. Thanks to this partnership, our researchers have the opportunity to share their discoveries widely and accessibly, adhering to the fundamental principle of open access to scientific information. This not only democratizes knowledge, allowing anyone to freely access research findings, but also fosters global collaboration. Thus, this agreement is not only beneficial for our institution and our researchers, but also contributes to the advancement of science and the welfare of society at large.&rdquo;</p>



<p>PLOS institutional business models such as Community Action Publishing (CAP) [2], Flat Fees [3], and Global Equity [4] ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our agreement with Consorcio Colombia will help to expand PLOS&rsquo; footprint in South America and provide equitable access to Open Science opportunities for researchers in the region,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Roheena Anand, Executive Director of Global Publishing Development &amp; Sales at PLOS. &ldquo;Consorcio Colombia shares our intention of removing barriers for authors to publish Open Access and building business models which move journals toward a more equitable and fee-free form of publishing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am happy to have collaborated on the negotiation of a very first PLOS consortium agreement in Latin America. This agreement allows Colombian institutions to sign up for unlimited publishing in all PLOS journals without APC fees for their researchers, at a very accessible cost for the institutions.&nbsp;It is great to see that 8 institutions have already signed up in 2024, and I&rsquo;m confident many more Colombian institutions will understand the benefits of this agreement and will join in the coming few years,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Anouk Snijders, Commercial Manager Latin America, Accucoms.</p>



<p>The members of Consorcio Colombia join a growing list of institutions in Latin America, including UNAM, CINVESTAV, and INCMNSZ in Mexico and Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in Peru&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/"><strong>among others</strong></a>, to support their researchers through unlimited publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a>&nbsp; honored PLOS as the 2021 co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>

<p></p>



<p><em>Cureus</em> has retracted a 2024 case study after learning it had published a piece about the identical patient, by authors from the same institution, just months earlier.  </p>



<p>The paper, “Lipoma Growing on the Back for 26 Years: A Bizarre Case Report,” was published March 26 and retracted June 17. Three of the four authors are affiliated with Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, in Wardha, India. The corresponding author, <a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/409557-samiksha-v-gupta">Samiksha V. Gupta</a>, was a medical student at the institution but has since received his degree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/238773-lipoma-growing-on-the-back-for-26-years-a-bizarre-case-report/retraction#!/">notice</a> states: </p>



<span id="more-129490"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted by the Editor-in-Chief after it has been discovered that this case was already presented and published in <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/215406-giant-lipoma-a-case-report#!/">Kher C, Chakole S (January 26, 2024) Giant Lipoma: A Case Report. Cureus 16(1): e53000. doi:10.7759/cureus.53000</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“It was discovered” is doing a lot of work here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Springer Nature, which now owns <em>Cureus</em>, how the editors of the journal managed to publish the case study twice, given the distinctive topic and the fact the authors came from the same institution – Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graham Parker-Finger, director of publishing and customer success for Cureus, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We understand that the assistant surgeon on the case shared details with physicians who cared for the patient post-op without realizing that the attending physicians were going to publish this case. As a result, the case was submitted and published twice. Both papers went through the review process and the overlap was not identified at the time as the case was written up by two different groups and thus there was no text overlap/duplication flagged by ithenticate.  Additionally, although of the same subject, the photos are different. As soon as we became aware of the issue, we investigated, leading to the retraction of the later report.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In fact, the photos of the tumor, which are available online, are not so very different after all. The only apparent difference is that the colors are more vivid in the retracted image, which also is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. (The caption on one of the images reads: “A swelling of 10 cm × 12 cm x 7 cm was present over the left scapula;” the other “depicts a giant lipoma over the right suprascapular region” – which clearly is incorrect.) The articles also show the tumors after removal, and again, they are obviously identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Parker-Finger if the episode has prompted any changes in process at the publication. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The articles were submitted 12 weeks apart with different authors and, as they were written independently, did not contain textual similarities that would be picked up by ithenticate, so identifying the overlap was not possible. It may be worth noting that we receive more than a thousand submissions each week.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Gupta about the duplicate submission, and why he and his colleagues chose <em>Cureus </em>as a home for the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I sincerely apologize for any confusion caused by the submission of the case. To clarify, I was not aware that my colleagues at Datta Meghe had already submitted the case for publication. </p>



<p>Regarding your question about why Cureus was chosen over other journals, our decision was based on several factors. Cureus was selected because we believed it offered a suitable platform for the dissemination of our research findings, aligning well with the scope and objectives of our work.</p>



<p>I understand the importance of addressing this issue promptly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were, well, curious how Gupta’s group got the image for their paper. He said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I actually reached out to my senior for assistance, and he provided me with all the information and pictures related to that particular case.</p>

<br /><p>Understanding the brain requires processing and analysing large, multidimensional datasets.
Systems neuroscience, in particular, has undergone a drastic transformation, with individual labs now commonly generating terabytes or even petabytes of data annually.
While there has been an increase in software tools to process this data, many of these tools are single-purpose, inadequately maintained, or poorly integrated with the broader software ecosystem.
This talk will outline some of the tools we are developing for <a class="reference external" href="https://brainglobe.info/">computational neuroanatomy</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/">video behavioural analysis</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/">data management</a>.</p>
<p>About the&nbsp;speaker:</p>
<p>Adam Tyson is the Head Research Engineer at the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/">Sainsbury Wellcome Centre</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit">Gatsby Computational Neuroscience</a> Unit at University College London.
He established the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuroinformatics.dev/">Neuroinformatics Unit</a>, a research software engineering team dedicated to developing robust, maintainable, and user-friendly software tools for neuroscience and machine learning.
Adam completed a PhD in neuroscience at King’s College London before working as a software developer at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Sainsbury Wellcome&nbsp;Centre.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nt.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="190" height="230" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nt.jpg?resize=190%2C230&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-121771" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Richard Phelps</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I was once required to testify in a court case. My lawyer gave me a few pieces of advice, but he repeated one&nbsp; several times, which may be why I remember it. “Never say never,” he said. Or, conversely, never say always. Declarations of absolutes present opposing attorneys too wide an opening. They need to identify only a single example to contradict. In trial courts, one cannot get away with making reckless absolutist claims unchallenged.</p>



<p>In academic scholarship, however, it happens all the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meet the dismissive literature review, in which an author at the beginning of a journal article declares the published research literature on the topic either nonexistent or so poor in quality that all of it is … dismissible. Typically, no evidence supports the claim. You’ve seen the claims yourself (e.g., “little previous research has, …” “few studies have looked at …,” “there is no research on …,” etc.). With one type of dismissive review — a <em>firstness claim </em>— authors boldly declare themselves to be the first in the history of the world to study a particular topic (as in, “this is the first study of …”).</p>



<span id="more-129482"></span>



<p>In academia, declarations of a void in the research literature are rarely challenged. As long as a few unknowing, uncaring, or otherwise cooperative reviewers and editors let the statement slide, it passes unimpeded into the world of scholarship and becomes what I call a dismissive literature review. No one with a self or public interest in countering the claim is offered an opportunity to challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The size of <a href="https://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Resources/DismissiveList.htm">my collection</a> of such reviews surpassed 1,000&nbsp; some time ago, despite its limitation to a single, relatively small topic — U.S. education policy — and a small proportion of researchers in that field sometimes labeled “<a href="https://nonpartisaneducation.org/Foundation/ThinkTankCelebrity.htm">celebrity scholars</a>.” Those are researchers blessed with public relations offices and information dissemination budgets supporting the promotion of their brand (think government-funded research centers, think tanks, the most prestigious universities).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Serendipity started the process. I encountered most of the collected items in the normal course of my professional reading. I first took note of false dismissive reviews on topics I had deeply researched, topics which I knew for a fact contained robust research literatures. After a while, I started to notice dismissive literature reviews throughout scholarly research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I am deeply familiar with the dismissed literature, I have added notes to the reviews, typically containing the names and publication years of some of the dismissed research. Granted, many reviews remain in the Dismissive List with notes not yet added. Conducting compensatory reviews for over 1,000 separate claims poses a considerable time commitment, as honest, thorough literature searches can take days, weeks, months, or years, depending on the topic, the number of searchers involved, and the resources at their disposal.</p>



<p>Of course, in dealing with so many separate details, I may have made mistakes. With only a single exception, however, I can vouch for one reliable characteristic of the Dismissive List:&nbsp; the author in each case provided no evidence to support his or her claim of a research literature’s nonexistence or alleged inferiority. In each case, no mention was made of where, how—or even if—the scholar searched for previous studies, as is routinely provided in meta-analyses. The dismissive claims are not research results; they are unsupported declarations.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Resources/DismissiveList.htm">Dismissive List</a> comprises dozens of worksheets, organized by individual , group of scholars or journalists. Journalists <a href="https://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Resources/Journalists.htm">include themselves</a> in this mode of information suppression when <a href="https://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Resources/JournoPublicists.htm">they repeat</a> a scholar’s dismissive review, without any effort made to verify the claim.</p>



<p>Each entry in the Dismissive List&nbsp; includes fields for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Author (s)</li>



<li>Co-author(s)</li>



<li>Dismissive quote</li>



<li>Dismissal type (simple dismissal, firstness claim, or denigration)</li>



<li>Title of article or document</li>



<li>Source location (e.g., publication name)</li>



<li>Hyperlink to article</li>



<li>Funders of study, when known</li>



<li>Notes on previous, dismissed research (authors, dates)</li>



<li>Notes on other misleading claims (when applicable)</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-drop-cap">For the most part, the list includes statements made by &#8220;serial dismissers,&#8221; scholars who dismiss repeatedly on a variety of topics. This is done to help counter the argument that they might be innocent, did try to look for previous research, and simply could not find it. In some cases, they dismiss a research literature that is hundreds or thousands of studies deep. And, when they <a href="https://educationpolicy.us/Malfunction/App3.pdf">do that repeatedly across a variety of topics</a>, the odds&nbsp; their dismissive behavior could be innocent fade to miniscule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w16070">articles</a> lead <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w16070">with a dismissive review</a>. “This is the first study of X” may be the first sentence in the abstract and the introduction (and perhaps also the conclusion). The author crowns a research article with a statement unsupported by any evidence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some scholars seem addicted. They place dismissive reviews in the article abstract, introduction, literature review section, conclusion, discussion, and perhaps sprinkled elsewhere throughout. Some individual articles contain a dozen or more. One might assume a single dismissive review near the front of an article would be sufficient for driving home the point – namely, an alleged absence of previous research. Why repeat the same message throughout from beginning to end?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I suspect the behavior is not intended to get <em>that </em>point across but, rather, another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A dismissive review implies one is familiar with an entire research literature …that one is a topical expert. The desire to exploit any possible opportunity to proclaim expertise may motivate the repetition. (Indeed, if &nbsp; no previous research on the topic truly existed, the dismissive scholar would be the world’s foremost expert after completing a single study.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, someone falsely claiming to know an entire research literature is the opposite of an expert. And every occasion of a policymaker or journalist seeking their false expertise is an opportunity lost, when they could have consulted a genuine expert.</p>



<p>Claiming an absence of research on a topic comprises the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/emip.12332">entire substance</a> of <a href="https://edexcellence.net/articles/identifying-what-works-is-still-a-work-in-progress">some articles</a>, without any evidence of said absence, or of having looked for it. Apparently, some editors see no harm in publishing an article wholly devoted to declaring a void (without evidence) and a need for more research. Research is what we do, and more research is always good, isn’t it?</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Some <a href="https://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Resources/DanielKoretz.htm">highly successful scholars</a> have employed dismissive reviews <a href="https://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Resources/EricHanushek.htm">throughout their careers</a>. Which raises the question: Have they profited more from the quality of their work, or the substantial advantages provided by dismissive reviewing?</p>



<p>Those benefits include time savings; avoiding contradictory evidence and debate; adding to one’s citation totals, while not adding to the citation counts of their rivals; and establishing (false) bona fides as an expert and research pioneer, which increases likelihood of press coverage and grant funding (to “fill knowledge gaps”).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, two of the most celebrated and rewarded scholars in the Dismissive List have accumulated two of the longest dismissive review worksheets. Each has been publishing for over 30 years and written hundreds of dismissive literature reviews throughout their careers. Their behavior serves as a model to their graduate students and others who might aspire to their level of prestige and professional attainment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of <a href="https://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Resources/DanielKoretz.htm">one scholar</a> with almost 300 dismissive entries, most of the literature reviews in the list are rebutted with an extensive compilation of previous studies . For one line of research, for example, the author claims a lack of studies and promotes <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10880553">one of his from over 30 years ago</a>, conducted at a location he will not identify (confidentiality!), using outcome measures he will not identify, and producing a data set he will not provide (again, confidentiality!).</p>



<p>In fact, other studies on the topic date as far back as 1927. At least 79 relevant studies were published between 1927 and 2019. Meta-analyses or research summaries were published in <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ254150">1981</a>, <a href="https://hepgjournals.org/doi/10.17763/haer.53.1.n06j5h5356217648">1983</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543053004571">1983</a>, <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED286939.pdf">1983</a>, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1984-16352-001">1984</a>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/causality/1990-baker.pdf">1990</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED385593">1993</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-3992.2003.tb00132.x">2005</a>, <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/education/sites/default/files/attached-files/Briggs_Meta-Analysis.pdf">2005</a>, <a href="https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=articles">2006</a>, and <a href="http://leadershipblog.act.org/2017/07/what-research-says-about-effects-of.html">2017</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, the only research this author acknowledges on any given topic is that conducted by colleagues in his small, mutual support circle.&nbsp; If only a handful of studies conducted by him and his close colleagues support his views on a topic, they become the only studies that exist on that topic.</p>



<p>How do they get away with this? One way is by hedging the dismissive declaration. One doesn’t declare that <em>no</em> previous research exists, just that the amount is “little,” “thin,” “scarce,” “scanty,” or “few” and its quality not “rigorous,” “new,” “solid,” “systematic,” or “robust.” As the dismissed research is not cited and the dismissed scholars are not identified, readers are given no assistance in finding and reading that work and deciding for themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hedges can vary dramatically in meaning. “There have been no <em>rigorous</em> studies of X” could mean no previous studies have employed the analytic method one prefers (e.g., multiple regressions), or it could signify a lack of studies by others in one’s field (e.g., other economists) or&nbsp; those by anyone one considers important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another way celebrity researchers get away with dismissive reviews: money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A majority of the reviews on the Dismissive List were funded by the federal government or wealthy foundations. That success also suggests that the scholars receiving the funding may have used dismissive reviews in their grant applications as motivation for the funding, as in:&nbsp; we need to know X, there is no research on X, so give us money to study X. (To investigate this hypothesis, I once asked a few research-funding foundations for copies of the original grant applications for some of their funded projects.&nbsp; Each declined.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>When those dismissive reviews are false, funders ostensibly dedicated to increasing knowledge may instead be reducing it.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Loath to mimic behavior I criticize, I contacted some of the researchers featured in the Dismissive List and offered them an opportunity to comment on this article. I chose the 14 individuals who contributed the most dismissive reviews to the list — from at least 40 up to just shy of 300. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Only one replied. According to Eva L. Baker, the longtime co-director of the Center for Research on Educational Standards and Student Testing (CRESST), who has 45 entries on the List: &#8220;We could argue about the state of evidence on any of a number of topics.&#8221;</p>



<p>All the above may make one wonder. How many of the most ambitious scholars conduct honest research literature reviews and thoroughly report those findings in their journal articles? With little&nbsp; enforcement or accountability, &nbsp; the benefit of dismissing a research literature without bothering to look for it far outweighs the risk of getting caught in the lie. </p>



<p>For many scholars, the default literature search has become, “Let’s not and say we did.”</p>

<p>A paper that purported to find vitamin D could reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms has been retracted from <em>PLOS ONE</em>, four years after the journal issued an expression of concern about the research.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239799">Vitamin D sufficiency, a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL reduced risk for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection</a>,” appeared online September 25, 2020. <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/profile/michael-holick/">Michael F. Holick</a>, a professor of medicine at Boston University and a proponent of the use of vitamin D, was the last author among a group of other researchers from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after publication, the paper gained traction on platforms like Twitter (now X) as evidence vitamin D could treat COVID-19 symptoms.</p>



<p>Amidst this discussion, <a href="https://lnu.se/en/staff/nicholas.brown/">Nick Brown</a>, a science integrity researcher at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EqWov8kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, a research fellow at the University of Wollongong, Australia, pointed out potential flaws with the work, including the <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7178D75E4C63D6FA7BC68F914861E0">small sample size</a> of the study and a <a href="https://x.com/sTeamTraen/status/1310997416305451010">lack of patient information</a> such as how the patients died.</p>



<span id="more-129477"></span>



<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> posted an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240965">expression of concern</a> for the article on October 14, 2020. According to the notice, “concerns were raised about the validity of results and conclusions reported in the article and about undisclosed competing interests.” The expression of concern also noted “statements in the article, including in its title and conclusions, that suggest a causal relationship between vitamin D levels and the clinical outcome of COVID-19 infections which is not supported by the data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The competing interests refer to Holick’s “non-financial interests based on his vitamin D research and other activities focused on vitamin D; contributions to an app that tracks vitamin D; and interests that include consultancies, funding support, and authorship of books related to vitamin D usage.” In 2018, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/business/vitamin-d-michael-holick.html">the <em>New York Times</em> reported</a> on Holick’s financial ties to the vitamin D industry.</p>



<p>“This project did not receive any grants. Prof. Holick did not have any funding support for this project,” Mohammad Ali Sahraian, the paper’s corresponding author, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the competing interests, Holick said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The app dminder.info is free. I do not derive any income from it. I am no longer a consultant for Quest Diagnostics and therefore it was not listed. I do not receive any book royalties related to any information that is in this publication. I do not have any conflict of interest regarding any aspect of the study design, the results, or conclusions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 189 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, with the bulk of citations coming after the expression of concern.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On June 6, nearly four years later, <em>PLOS</em> <em>ONE </em>retracted the study. A statistical reviewer and members of the <em>PLOS ONE</em> Editorial Board found that the study design was inadequate to address the research question and the methods used were not detailed enough to reproduce the study, according to the retraction notice. “As such, we have concluded that the article’s conclusions are not supported by the reported data,” the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305303">notice</a> said.</p>



<p>Sahraian said he and his colleagues were “very surprised” and “upset” by the retraction, which should “not be decided without any ethical problem.”</p>



<p>“It would have been preferable for these issues to have been identified and addressed during the pre-publication review process, rather than after the work had already been made public,” Sahraian told Retraction Watch. “However, we did not claim a causal role of vitamin D in the clinical outcome of COVID-19 infections. The current study was cross-sectional and only considered the association between COVID-19 and circulating vitamin D levels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holick, Saharian, and the paper’s first author do not agree with the retraction, while others could not be reached, the notice states. Sahraian said they don’t agree because they provided detailed responses to the editorial board’s concerns on multiple occasions, but did not receive any response from the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I believe it is unfair, unethical, and inhumane to retract an article due solely to the faults of the editorial team rather than addressing the flaws inherent to the study itself,” he said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-knutson-61513910/">David Knutson</a>, head of communications at <em>PLOS</em>,<em> </em>said, “the authors’ comment that the communications in this case were one-sided, and the implication that our editorial decision was biased, are not true.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>PLOS</em> completed an objective evaluation and communicated with the authors on multiple occasions, Knutston said.&nbsp; He acknowledged a “long gap in our communications with the authors between March 2021 and December 2023” and apologized for one instance in which <em>PLOS</em> did not update an author following their query about the retraction decision.</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz said he has mixed feelings about this retraction. “It is to the credit of the editorial team that they even bothered to investigate, and retracting on the basis of low quality &#8211; rather than misconduct or similar &#8211; shows a commitment to integrity that few journals display,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But retracting it “at this point will have no impact whatsoever on the pollution of the literature &#8211; the damage has well and truly been done. I think that the <em>PLOS</em> <em>ONE </em>editorial team should explain exactly why it took an entire pandemic&#8217;s worth of time to come to a decision, given that the issues they cite as reasons to retract are the same ones I pointed out on Twitter in September 2020,” Meyerowitz-Katz said.</p>



<p>Brown said it would have been better if the retraction “didn’t take quite so long,” but given the expression of concern was issued rapidly, “I think the journal handled it overall fairly well.”</p>



<p><em>PLOS ONE </em>cited an <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-publication-ethics-a-frank-discussion-on-handling-difficult-cases/">ethics case backlog</a> for their slowness in retracting this paper, among other papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knutson told us the case was “complex,” and the four year time period “reflects the time we required to complete a rigorous assessment and investigation,” as well as “some internal delays due to competing priorities.” He said:</p>



<p>Given the complexity of this case, the nature of the concerns, and potential clinical implications of the article and the concerns raised, we published an interim Expression of Concern soon after the concerns were raised to our attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knutson said the competing interests mentioned in the expression of concern did not play a part in the retraction of the paper. “The retraction decision was based on concerns about the study design, methodological reporting, and the reliability of the article’s conclusions,” he said.</p>

Do it. Take a moment and think about it.</p><p>Those who do not need to imagine are the 55 million people living with Alzheimer’s and the 10 million living with Parkinson’s, respectively, as they experience similar challenges every day. While these figures raise concern, future projections are alarming: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(18)30295-3/fulltext">by 2050, the number of cases is expected to double in high-income countries and triple in low/middle-income countries</a>. Things are particularly bleak in the latter, as they account for 60% of the cases but less than 25% of global investment in research, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</p><p>With growing patient-per-clinic ratios and soaring inequities across the globe, how will we detect these diseases early and massively enough for timely intervention? What solutions could balance the scales of brain health worldwide? An unsuspected answer involves combining natural speech and artificial intelligence. Yes, this sounds like another flight of imagination, but it all rests on solid science.</p><div><blockquote>Note that these diseases are incurable. Rapid and mass detection is our best alternative; and this is precisely where the need for innovation emerges.</blockquote></div><h2>Tracking diseases</h2><p>Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by progressive atrophy of distinct brain regions. Alzheimer’s usually begins with neuron degeneration in the hippocampus and temporal lobe, affecting memory and several other abilities. In Parkinson’s, neuronal degradation begins in the basal ganglia, leading to motor and cognitive difficulties. Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg. For patients, these diseases are disabling and often fatal. For families, they undermine emotional stability, financial solvency, and quality of life. For governments, they challenge health systems’ infrastructure and finances. Thus, these conditions project from the brain onto society, tracing a devastating trajectory.</p><p>That is why timely detection is crucial. Early diagnosis can mitigate the impact of symptoms, reduce their emotional burden on patients and caregivers, increase time to plan neuroprotective habits, and reduce costs by favoring routine over emergency care. Note that these diseases are incurable. Rapid and mass detection is our best alternative; and this is precisely where the need for innovation emerges.</p><p>Today, diagnosis rests on interviews with specialists, extensive paper-and-pencil tests, and, when conditions allow, brain MRI studies and biomarker assessments. These procedures are invaluable, but imperfect. Many countries lack enough qualified personnel and appropriate technology (and when these resources exist, their costs can be prohibitive). Furthermore, outcomes depend on the judgments of examiners, who vary in training and experience. Moreover, assessments are usually stressful and appointments take weeks or months. Worse yet, these limitations are exacerbated as patient numbers increase and socioeconomic disparities between countries deepen. An urgent need thus arises for new affordable, user-friendly, scalable, and immediate approaches.</p><h2>Red flags in speech</h2><p>This is where digital speech biomarkers come into play. Suppose that Tom, who is pushing 70, has been showing signs of cognitive decline and you suspect he might be suffering from Alzheimer’s. What if you asked him to recount a memory and an app detected traces of the disease in his speech? This non-invasive, low-cost approach offers real-time results without the need to visit a clinic, sparking great enthusiasm. Yet, how exactly does it work?</p><p>The key is that when we speak, we engage multiple brain regions that are affected by these diseases. Some, such as the hippocampus and the temporal lobe, are involved in accessing words as discourse unfolds; others, like the basal ganglia, coordinate the physical movements during speech production. So, if such regions were atrophied, one would expect alterations in the types of words used, their articulation, or other relevant aspects. By testing specific linguistic dimensions, we can uncover the integrity or dysfunction of those brain areas.</p><p>The first step is to record the natural speech of individuals with and without a given disease (the more, the better). Subsequently, complex algorithms quantify multiple aspects of the recording (say, speech rhythm) and its transcription (say, word properties). These metrics are used to train computational models that learn the typical speech characteristics of diagnosed individuals and healthy ones. Once the model is trained, it is presented with acoustic and linguistic measures from Tom, and, essentially, queried with this question: “Model, based on what you’ve learned, does Tom have the disease or not?”</p><p>In a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13472">recent study</a>, our team identified Alzheimer’s disease with nearly 90% success via word property analysis. The model learned that patients, compared to their healthy peers, use words with higher frequency (‘doctor’ rather than ‘physician’), lower specificity (‘dog’ instead of ‘poodle’), and more common sound sequences (like ‘bat’, which resembles ‘cat’, ‘fat’, ‘mat’, ‘rat’, ‘bet’, ‘bit’, ‘bought’, ‘boot’, ‘bad’, ‘bag’, and ‘ban’; as opposed to ‘giraffe’, whose sound sequence is quite unique). Indeed, these lexical properties predicted the patients’ level of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. The reason is quite simple: word selection is a central function of semantic memory, which becomes impaired since the onset of temporo-hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer’s. When navigating semantic memory, people with the disease prioritize the most accessible parts of their vocabulary, consisting of frequent, unspecific, and common-sounds words. And the more severe their disorder is, the simpler the words they favor.</p><p>In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.28751">another study</a>, we detected Parkinson’s disease with over 90% accuracy by measuring motor aspects of speech. We found that patients, compared to healthy individuals, leave longer pauses between words and produce less recognizable sounds. These patterns even differentiated between disease variants. Once again, the finding is clear. Speech production requires coordinating movements of the tongue, lips, and vocal cords, among other organs. Since basal ganglia atrophy affects motor skills, these actions in people with Parkinson’s prove slow, shaky, and imprecise. The audio signal carries traces of these alterations.</p><p>The breakthroughs do not stop there. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33294808/">These methods can anticipate who will develop specific conditions in the future</a>. Some studies also suggest that they outperform standard tests in estimating disease severity and discriminating between syndromes. The approach has been validated with data acquired in hospitals and over the phone, incorporated in clinical trials, and harnessed by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-023-02240-z">user-friendly apps</a>. These are critical milestones towards rethinking clinical assessments.</p><div><blockquote>The breakthroughs do not stop there. These methods can anticipate who will develop specific conditions in the future.</blockquote></div><h2>A story in the making </h2><p>For all its promise, this story is only beginning. The approach requires more validation, especially in large groups of patients. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/146/12/4870/7231969?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">New studies should focus on vulnerable populations</a> to balance the abundant data coming from high-income countries. More generally, a digital medical culture must be cultivated for clinicians to incorporate computational tools. Of course, these milestones demand concerted efforts of scientists, medical professionals, patients, family members, companies, and policymakers. None of this is easy or immediate. The path from science to clinical practice and public policy is long, crooked, and uphill.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not an isolated endeavor. Various teams are working on other digital tools for disease detection, including eye-tracking devices, motion sensors, and gamified cognitive tests. Speech analysis is part of a vast movement pushing for clinical equity through technological innovations.</p><p>To conclude, imagine that we can detect these diseases before Tom shows symptoms of decline. Imagine doing so by reducing the social gaps among world nations. And imagine a future where all this needs no longer be imagined. If such a day ever arrives, it will be through disruptions like this.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/users/tungart7-38741244/">TungArt7</a> via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/illustrations/doctor-writing-medicine-hand-8733826/">Pixabay</a>. </sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/899965244/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/899965244/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f06%2fBRAINJ-Garcia-blog-post-image-AI-speech-and-language-assessment-models-1-480x185.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/899965244/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/06/better-together-coupling-up-to-watch-tv-and-talk-synchronizes-brain-waves/">Better together: coupling up to watch TV and talk synchronizes brain waves</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/06/behind-the-scenes-what-its-like-to-be-a-junior-author-for-the-ohcm/">Behind the scenes: what it&#8217;s like to be a junior author for the OHCM</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/the-hidden-toll-of-war/">The hidden toll of war</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>
