<p>A year after writing an article about a movement in South Korea to hold clergymembers accountable for sexual abuse, a theology professor has asked for the paper to be retracted after acknowledging “citation irregularities” in the work. The specific problems remain unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/jsce/content/jsce_2022_0042_0002_0345_0362">paper</a>’s retraction notice, dated December 21, 2023, states that the editors of the <em>Journal of the Society of Christian Ethics</em> supported the request to pull the article. Asked for more details about which “irregularities” or other factors might have contributed to the retraction, <a href="https://www.merrimack.edu/profiles/maria-mt-davila/">Maria Teresa Dávila</a>, one of the journal’s editors and an associate professor of religious studies at Merrimack College, in North Andover, Massachusetts, confirmed the retraction and referenced the society’s <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/wp/crossmark/">publishing guidelines</a> and <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/wp/crossmark/">ethics statement</a>, but did not highlight specific passages that would pertain to this specific case. She also refused to answer further questions about the retraction. </p>



<span id="more-128673"></span>



<p>The paper’s author, David Kwon of Seattle University, published the article when he was still an assistant professor at Saint Mary’s University of Minnesota. His work centers on gender and racial justice from a global perspective. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>



<p>The #ChurchToo movement followed swiftly on the heels of the #MeToo movement that started in the United States. That religious reckoning made its way to South Korea, where a corresponding #ChurchToo movement exposed priests and pastors with histories of committing sexual abuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kwon’s article, “Clergy Sexual Abuse and an Ethics of Recognition: An Example of the #ChurchToo Movement in South Korea,” provided philosophical frameworks and strategies for ensuring the longevity of this push for gender justice for women in Korean Christianity:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The hashtag activism Korean #ChurchToo must transform into an assembly in the street. This transformation has the potential to help the Korean church to break free from the grip of oppressive social norms, structures, and ritualized patterns that render women and minority genders’ bodily lives more precarious.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has yet to be cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-bird-flu-viruses-infect-human-cells">Bird flu viruses may pack tools that help them infect human cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bird flu viruses may pack a little taste of home to help them adapt to life in new hosts.</p>



<p>Viruses usually infect only certain types of hosts. For instance, many viruses that infect humans don’t infect other animals. But influenza viruses often seem to jump from birds to other species. In 2009, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2009-science-news-year-body-brain">H1N1 “swine flu” made the leap from birds to pigs and then into people</a>, setting off a pandemic (<em>SN: 12/18/09</em>). Even now, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-outbreak-influenza-panzootic-galapagos">an outbreak of avian influenza</a> is infecting and killing birds, sea mammals and some other animals around the world (<em>SN: 1/25/24</em>). No one knows whether that flu virus may eventually infect people and, if it does, whether it will have the ability to spread easily and cause a pandemic.</p>



<p>Despite plenty of instances of bird flu viruses infecting people, scientists weren’t sure exactly how the viruses overtake other species’ cells. A new study offers a clue about one of the first steps avian influenza viruses use to adapt to infect humans and other animals.</p>



<p>Avian influenza viruses tuck proteins that aid replication into their viral particles, researchers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Harbin and colleagues have discovered. The reproductive aids, called ANP32 proteins, may help flu viruses make the <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj4163" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump from birds to mammals</a>, the researchers report January 31 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The finding may help researchers better understand and predict which flu viruses have the potential to cause a pandemic.</p>



<p>When viruses infect a host, they “don&#8217;t carry everything with them that they need, and they just hijack things that are already inside the cell” to help them replicate, says Wendy Barclay, a molecular virologist at Imperial College London. Researchers knew that the viruses come equipped with basic replication machinery called polymerases. But that may not be enough to really establish an infection.</p>



<p>The viruses need to hijack host proteins to help the invaders quickly make copies of themselves. That includes ANP32 proteins, which help bring together proteins that form the polymerase copy machines.</p>



<p>“Today’s flu virus needs this help in order to replicate itself fast enough inside any host cell so that it doesn&#8217;t get clobbered by our immune response and shut down,” says Barclay, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>The researchers examined avian influenza proteins inside mammalian cells under electron microscopes and found that some viral particles carried a little bit of bird ANP32 with them. The protein is probably attached to the viral polymerase and gets bundled into the viral particle along with the rest of the replication machinery, the researchers discovered. The stronger the attraction between the polymerase and ANP32 proteins, the more helper protein that gets incorporated into viruses.</p>



<p>It has been a mystery how avian influenza viruses, which have different ANP32 proteins than mammals do, could grab onto and use the ANP32 proteins in human and and other mammalian cells. Researchers thought that perhaps some flu viruses already had mutations that would allow viral polymerases to interact with mammalian ANP32 proteins.</p>



<p>But the new study suggests that by packing their own bird versions of the proteins, flu viruses don’t immediately need to grab host ANP32 proteins. Instead, the virus can use the avian ANP32 protein for one round of copies inside the human or other animal cell. “This initial foothold maybe allows the virus to just replicate enough to make a few mutations,” Barclay says.</p>



<p>Some of those mutations may then allow the bird version of the polymerase to interact with mammalian ANP32 proteins. Viruses that carried the bird version of ANP32 were more likely to acquire such adaptive mutations when grown in human cells or in mice, the researchers found. “This explains how avian viruses, which shouldn’t be able to replicate in human cells, are in fact able to replicate and evolve to interact with human ANP32,” says Jacob Yount, a viral immunologist at the Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>If the findings hold up to further investigation, scientists may be able predict which viruses are more likely to cause a pandemic by looking at the strength of interaction between the viral polymerase and ANP32, Barclay says. “There may be some [bird flu viruses] that are much better at pulling the ANP from the chicken or the duck into the human cell than others,” she says. “Those may be the ones which come in and get the foothold and get going with their evolution process more easily than ones [that] perhaps have a weaker interaction.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-rope-making-tool-ivory">A four-holed piece of ivory provides a glimpse into ancient rope-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mammoth ivory tool unearthed in central Europe has offered a peek at how teamwork enabled Stone Age folks to make thick, sturdy ropes.</p>



<p>Excavations and sediment screening at southwestern Germany’s Hohle Fels Cave in 2015 produced the rare find. Researchers assembled 15 mammoth ivory pieces recovered from the site <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh5217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into a nearly complete rope-making implement</a>. The final product, about 20 centimeters long, featured four circular holes containing carved spiral grooves, archaeologists Nicholas Conard and Veerle Rots report January 31 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The ivory fragments lay among stone tools and other artifacts from Eurasia’s ancient Aurignacian culture. Radiocarbon dating of animal bones bearing stone tool marks places these discoveries at between 35,000 and 40,000 years old.</p>



<p>To understand the tool’s use, Conard, of the University of Tübingen in Germany, and Rots, of the University of Liège in Belgium, turned to the literature. Suggestions that four similar mammoth ivory artifacts, previously found at other German Aurignacian sites, were ritual objects or tools for straightening wooden shafts or working leather left the researchers unconvinced.</p>



<p>Microscopic wear and plant residue on both the Hohle Fels artifact and an earlier find indicated that plant fibers had been pulled through the holes, guided by clockwise grooves, suggesting the tool was used for making rope. Evidence of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-made-oldest-known-string">string-making dates to between 52,000 and 41,000 years ago</a> among European Neandertals (<em>SN: 4/9/20</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers conducted rope-making experiments with four-holed replicas of the ancient finds made from wood, animal bones, a warthog’s split tooth and bronze. This process involved running animal sinews and five types of plant fibers through the tool openings. Thin, hand-twisted ropes, each held by one person, were fed through the holes. Another person held the implement while someone pulled and twisted the fiber strands exiting the openings into a single piece of rope.</p>



<p>Four or five people typically generated five meters of strong, flexible rope in 10 minutes, the scientists say. Cattail leaves, the team found, worked particularly well as rope material.</p>



<p>These findings do not tie up all the loose ends regarding ancient rope production. “But for the first time,” Conard says, “we have documented artifacts likely used to make rope and demonstrated how they worked.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-theory-qed-electric-fields">A pivotal quantum theory holds up even in extreme electric fields </a></h4>

              
                <p>To put one of physicists’ most important theories to the test, scientists go to extremes. Extremely strong electromagnetic fields, that is.</p>



<p>The theory of quantum electrodynamics, which describes interactions of electrically charged particles and light, has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/standard-model-particle-physics">checked to painstaking precision</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 2/23/23</em>). The theory correctly predicts properties of simple atoms, like hydrogen or helium. But it’s less carefully tested under intense electromagnetic fields, like those that exist around large atomic nuclei.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The theory’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06910-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictions hold up</a>&nbsp;even in those conditions, physicist Robert Lötzsch and colleagues report in the Jan. 25&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Quantum electrodynamics, or QED, looms large in physics. It’s an integral part of the standard model of particle physics, the theory of fundamental particles and their interactions. So testing it in all possible scenarios is key.</p>



<p>To probe QED’s prowess, Lötzsch and colleagues turned to uranium, which has a whopping 92 protons in its nucleus. That nucleus has a correspondingly mighty electric field, almost a million times that of a hydrogen nucleus, and much stronger than any field that can be produced by humankind. The tests used uranium that had been stripped of all but two of its normal swarm of 92 electrons to form an ion, or electrically charged atom. This uranium ion is termed “helium-like uranium,” because helium atoms normally have just two electrons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lötzsch and colleagues ran their experiments at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, accelerating uranium ions and sending them through a copper foil that peeled off all but one electron from each ion. When sent through nitrogen gas, the ions grabbed another electron to make helium-like uranium: a uranium nucleus with two electrons bound to it. This process left each uranium ion with one of its two electrons in a high-energy state. Those electrons quickly cascaded down in energy, through a sequence of jumps between energy levels. By measuring X-rays released from a particular jump, the researchers determined the energy of that transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The measured energy matched predictions based on QED — the theory held up.</p>



<p>In strong electromagnetic fields, “how QED has to be calculated completely changes from how it’s done in low fields,” says Lötzsch, of Friedrich Schiller University Jena in Germany. In general, QED calculations must consider the electrons’ interactions with “virtual” particles, which continually flit into and out of existence, according to quantum physics. That includes not only single interactions of this sort, but also two (or more) interactions. In strong electromagnetic fields around atomic nuclei, calculating the effect of two interactions becomes more complex. The electric field, rather than slightly tweaking the calculation as it does for hydrogen or helium, dramatically changes it.&nbsp;What’s more, in the case of helium-like uranium, the interactions of the two electrons must also be calculated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highly charged ions are “ideal mini laboratories that allow us to study the behavior of bound electrons in the extremely strong fields,” says theoretical physicist Aleksei Malyshev of St. Petersburg University in Russia, who was not involved with the research. That makes for an experiment that “is sensitive to the most sophisticated higher-order QED effects.”</p>



<p>Many physicists expect that another theory will eventually supplant the standard model, and a flaw in QED’s predictions could point the way. The new result is “a very unique and stringent test of the QED&nbsp;theory,” says physicist Fabian Heiße of the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, who was not involved with the research. “Such tests are very important for the search of physics&nbsp;beyond the standard model.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>To move along narrow branches, a parrot can hang from a branch with its beak, swing its body sideways and grab hold farther along with its feet. The newly described gait, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.231397" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dubbed beakiation</a>, expands the birds’ locomotive repertoire and underscores how versatile their beaks are, researchers report January 31 in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>.</p>



<p>Parrots “are specialized for climbing and moving around in the trees,” says biomechanist Michael Granatosky of the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury. But, he wondered, “what would happen if you flip a bird upside down or make them go onto the tiniest [branch] possible?”</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-6" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-6">So Granatosky and</span> colleagues put four rosy-faced lovebirds (<em>Agapornis roseicollis</em>) to the test. Birds placed on a suspended bar just 2.5 millimeters in diameter realized that the best way to shuffle along it was to use their beaks and feet in a cyclical side-swinging motion. The birds traveled 10 centimeters per second on average during each stride (beak touchdown to beak touchdown).</p>

<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-8" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-8"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-11" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-11">The bar was</span></span> segmented into three pieces, with the central bar hung from an instrument that measures force. Using those readings and other measurements across 129 strides, the researchers calculated beakiation’s energy efficiency. The birds lost most of the energy they put into a swing: The exchange of potential and kinetic energy during the slow but pendulumlike movement recovered, on average, about 24 percent of the energy expended.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-7" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-7"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-9" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-9">For comparison, gibbons</span></span> (Hylobatidae) recover nearly 80 percent of the energy put into a stride when they swing between branches using their arms. This movement, called brachiation, is fast and smooth. Beakiation, on the other hand, consists of careful movements that start and stop.</p>



<p>“I see this as one of many different beak-assisted gaits that parrots use,” says biomechanist David Lee of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved in the study. The birds typically live in dense forests where flying can be difficult, so sometimes vines and fine branches provide the only paths, he says. “They’re navigating complex 3-D environments all the time.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insects-artificial-light-moth-direction-pollution">Insects flocking to artificial lights may not know which way is up</a></h4>

              
                <p>The insects flying in circles around your porch light aren’t captivated by the light. Instead, they may have lost track of which way is up, high-speed infrared camera data suggest.</p>



<p>Moths and other insects naturally turn their backs toward light. But when insects turn their backs on artificial light sources, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44785-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their sense of direction seems to go topsy-turvy</a>, researchers report January 30 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The insects may lose track of where the ground is, leaving them flying in circles or diving toward the ground.</p>



<p>The findings are the first “satisfying answer to a long-standing phenomenon” of how moths and other insects flock to streetlamps and flames, says evolutionary biologist Florian Altermatt of the University of Zurich who was not involved with the study. “It was also interesting to see that it was an actually rather simple explanation, defying the previous, more complex ones.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Those hypotheses range from flying insects being blinded by light and becoming trapped, to insects interpreting light sources as a place to fly for a quick escape. Another idea suggests that the light of the moon serves as a compass, and nocturnal insects mistakenly use human-made lights to navigate the world. These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">lights can be deadly for insects</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as pilots flying planes have myriad tools to work out which way is up when they’re gaining speed, flying insects may turn their backs on the sky’s light to keep their feet pointing toward the ground. “It’s a really good idea until somebody invents the LED,” says entomologist Samuel Fabian of Imperial College London, “at which point it’s a very bad idea.”</p>



<p>Fabian and colleagues used high-speed infrared cameras to track how artificial lights affected the flight of a variety of insects. At a field station in Costa Rica, the team watched as wild insects from 10 orders, including moths and flies, circled endlessly around hanging or standing lights. Others flew upward in a steep climb, losing speed until they couldn’t fly any higher. When the light source pointed up, some individuals flipped over and headed for the ground.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In field experiments in Costa Rica, researchers used high-speed infrared cameras to track insect flight around artificial lights. When insects flew over a light source, they routinely turned on an axis and dove toward the ground (shown). These insects kept their backs to the light, even if they crashed. Other insects flew in circles around the light or flew up in a steep climb, losing speed until they couldn’t fly any higher. The observations suggest that artificial light messes with how insects orient themselves to the ground.</figcaption></figure>



<p>During flight, the insects consistently kept lights at their back, even if they ended up crashing. The same was true of moths and dragonflies observed in the lab.</p>



<p>The results “didn’t fit with any of the theories that had been proposed before,” says coauthor Yash Sondhi, an evolutionary biologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History’s McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity. The insects weren’t flying toward the light as they would if it symbolized an escape route. Nor were they flying in smooth spirals, which would suggest the light acted as a compass.</p>



<p>Instead, “it’s a bit like somebody’s grabbed [a pilot’s] joystick and is pulling it in the wrong direction,” Fabian says.</p>



<p>Normal flight was restored when the positioning of a&nbsp;skylike artificial light was opposite&nbsp;the ground. Crash landings were common when the team illuminated a white sheet on the floor. But when a white sheet stretched into a canopy above the floor was bathed in diffuse light, like the sky would be, insects flew through without getting trapped by the light.</p>

Insects aren’t drawn in by the artificial light in this setup, providing clues to how the insects orient themselves while flying.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135542">Sam Fabian</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the lab, there were some exceptions. Fruit flies (<em>Drosophila</em> species) — which can fly in the dark — weren’t strongly affected by the light. Oleander hawk moths (<em>Daphnis nerii</em>) could also fly over ultraviolet or LED lights without being thrown off course. In the wild, though, the moths still crash. It’s unclear why, Sondhi says, but one possibility is that the insects might sometimes suppress their response to light. Or it could be something that individuals learn over time.</p>



<p>While it’s clear that artificial light can put insects on a crash course, more research is needed to confirm if it’s happening because insects use the sky’s light for navigation, irrespective of the presence of artificial light, says animal and visual ecologist Brett Seymoure of the University of Texas at El Paso, who wasn’t involved with the research.</p>



<p>Seymoure, Sondhi and other scientists are also teaming up to explore other unanswered questions about light pollution’s effects on insects, such as how susceptible insects may be at different latitudes.</p>



<p>Another question Seymoure and colleagues are exploring is whether putting fixtures on lights, so insects can’t see much light at all, could make streetlights less attractive for flying by insects. “Now that we have the mechanism of how moths are flying to these lights, we can now better design light fixtures that will make it so that they’re not actually doing this behavior,” Seymoure says.</p>

                <p>Written by Lindsay Morton</p>



<p><em>Over 4 years: 74k+ eligible articles. Nearly 85k signed reviews. More than 30k published peer review history packages, almost 15k of them with at least one signed review.</em></p>



<p>A little over four years ago, PLOS <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">announced</a> Published Peer Review History, which offers accepted authors the option to have their peer review history&mdash;including editorial decision letters, with peer reviews, and the authors&rsquo; own responses to reviewer feedback&mdash;published alongside their article. If a reviewer chooses to sign their comments, their name also appears publicly. Our approach to published peer review is an example of how we work to embed Open Science directly into the day-to-day publishing program, making research transparency a natural part of researchers&rsquo; experience, while also respecting community norms and individual needs.</p>



<p>Since its introduction, about 40% of PLOS authors have opted-in each year, with a slight increase over time. About 20% of articles include both Published Peer Review History and one or more signed reviews.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/01/four-years-of-published-peer-review-history/#notes">*</a></p>

<h2>Author opt-in by journal and discipline</h2>



<p>In our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history/">2022 update</a> we presented data for the seven established PLOS journals (<em>PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine</em>, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, <em>PLOS Genetics</em>,<em> PLOS Pathogens</em>, <em>PLOS NTDs</em>, and <em>PLOS ONE</em>). Now we are pleased to include numbers for the new journals founded in 2021 as well (<em>PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Water</em>, and <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>).</p>

<p>In line with previously observed patterns, our highly selective journals, <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, tend to have the highest rates of author opt-in. Select journals in both the biology (<em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, <em>PLOS Genetics</em>) and health sciences (<em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>) fields also exhibited relatively high rates of opt in at or above 50%. The remaining titles hovered slightly below 40%.</p>



<p>Examining <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s author opt-in rate by topic area section shows a willingness to share Peer Review History among authors in medical and adjacent fields, perhaps because signed and published peer review is more common and therefore more normalized in the medical community.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/01/four-years-of-published-peer-review-history/#notes">**</a></p>

<p>When viewed by geographic region across the portfolio, opt-in rates are highest among authors affiliated with institutions in Africa (excluding the North African countries tallied as part of Middle Eastern and North Africa, or MENA), followed by Europe, Australasia, and the Americas.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/01/four-years-of-published-peer-review-history/#notes">***</a></p>

<h2>Reviewer signing</h2>



<p>The rate of reviewer signing has gradually increased from 15% to 21% since we began tracking this data in a reportable way, also in May 2019.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="615" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Percent-signed-reviews-over-time-1024x615.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22191" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Percent-signed-reviews-over-time-1024x615.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Percent-signed-reviews-over-time-300x180.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Percent-signed-reviews-over-time-768x461.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Percent-signed-reviews-over-time-1536x922.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Percent-signed-reviews-over-time.png 1654w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Reviewer signing by journal</h3>



<p>The percentage of individual reviewers who signed their comments varies by journal. Similar to the pattern observed in author opt-in rates, health sciences titles, including <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, and <em>PLOS Digital Health </em>tended to have higher rates of reviewing signing, while biological titles like <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>, <em>PLOS Genetics</em>, and <em>PLOS Biology</em>, and <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> were lower. Journal selectivity and editorial model do not appear to influence reviewer signing rates in the same manner that they impact author opt-in&mdash;perhaps because reviewers have less contact with journal staff editors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="617" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Reviewer-signing-rate-by-journal-1024x617.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22192" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Reviewer-signing-rate-by-journal-1024x617.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Reviewer-signing-rate-by-journal-300x181.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Reviewer-signing-rate-by-journal-768x463.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Reviewer-signing-rate-by-journal-1536x926.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Reviewer-signing-rate-by-journal.png 1651w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Reviewer signing by decision type</h3>



<p>Across the portfolio, the likelihood of reviewers signing their comments corresponds with their decision recommendation. Reviewers are most likely to sign when recommending an accept or minor revision decision, with the likelihood decreasing as recommendations become more critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This remains true whether or not the manuscript ultimately goes on to become a published research article, however it does mean that published articles are more likely to have at least one signed review than manuscripts that receive a reject decision.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/01/four-years-of-published-peer-review-history/#notes">****</a></p>

<h2>Looking ahead</h2>



<p>Over the past four years, PLOS has published more than 30,308 research articles with Peer Review History. When introducing the option four years ago, our initial expectation was that the practice would normalize over time and that we would see an increasing proportion of authors elect to make their Peer Review History open. This has generally not been the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS authors have chosen Published Peer Review History at a fairly consistent rate of about 40% (rising gently from 38% in 2019 to 42% in 2023). Despite the benefits inherent in a more open and transparent scholarly communication system, the stable rate of uptake suggests that concerns also persist. While we haven&rsquo;t encountered the realization of these concerns in our experience so far, the evidence base is still poor. As <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002255">Ross-Hellauer, Bouter and Horbach</a> have expressed recently, &ldquo;to responsibly open up peer review, there is an urgent need for additional evidence.&rdquo; We hope that the significant dataset of Public Peer Review Histories now available from PLOS can help support a research agenda in this important area.</p>

But after her father started working as a power plant operator at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, the family moved to the city. “That upbringing in a lower socioeconomic household in West Phoenix really made me think about what it meant to be a good advocate for my people and my community,” says Tsosie, who like other Navajo people refers to herself as Diné. Today, she’s a geneticist-bioethicist at Arizona State University in Tempe. The challenges of urban life for Tsosie’s family and others, plus the distance from the Navajo Nation, helped spark the deep sense of community responsibility that has become the foundation of her work.</p>

She remembers seeing posters at the Indian Health Service clinic in Phoenix warning against the dangers of rodents and dust. The posters were put up in response to cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, or HPS, in the Four Corners area. Though the disease had not been identified by Western science until that 1993 outbreak, it had long been known within the Navajo tradition. Learning how Navajo oral traditions helped researchers understand HPS made Tsosie want to work in a laboratory studying diseases, instead of becoming a practicing physician.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-2" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-2"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-4" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-4">Tsosie settled on</span></span> cancer biology and research after college, in part because of the health and environmental impacts of decades of uranium mining on the Navajo Nation. But after leaving Arizona for the first time after college, Tsosie was confronted with the profit-driven realities and what she calls the “entrenched, systemic racism” of the biomedical space. She saw a lack of Indigenous representation and disparities that prevented Indigenous communities from accessing the best health care. Tsosie began asking herself whether her projects would be affordable and accessible to her community back home. “I didn&#8217;t like the answer,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The need for Indigenous geneticists</h4>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-5" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-5"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-6" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-6">So Tsosie returned</span></span> to Arizona State to work on a master’s degree in bioethics with the intention of going to law school. But the more she learned about how much genetic research relies on big data and how those data are shared and used, the more Tsosie realized there was a huge need for Indigenous geneticists.</p>



<p>Around the world, scientific use of Indigenous genetic data has led to repeated violations of rights and sovereignty. For example, beginning in 1990, Havasupai Tribal members gave DNA samples to researchers from ASU, hoping to understand more about diabetes in their community. Researchers eventually used the Havasupai DNA in a range of studies, including for research on schizophrenia and alcoholism, which the Havasupai say they had not been properly informed about or consented to. In 2010, the Arizona Board of Regents settled with Tribal members for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/us/22dna.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$700,000 and the return of the DNA samples</a>, among other reparations.</p>



<p>The Havasupai case is perhaps the most high-profile example in a long history of Western science exploiting Indigenous DNA. “We have an unfortunate colonial, extractive way of coming into communities and taking samples, taking DNA, taking data, and just not engaging in equitable research partnerships,” Tsosie says.</p>



<p>This history prompted the Navajo Nation in 2002 to place a “moratorium on genetic research studies conducted within the jurisdiction of the Navajo Nation.” It has also, along with the growth of genomics, convinced Tsosie that Indigenous geneticists must play a big role in protecting Indigenous data and empowering Indigenous peoples to manage, study and benefit from their own data. “It’s the right of indigenous peoples to exercise authority, agency, autonomy, and self-direct and self-govern decisions about our own data,” she says.</p>

<p>Tsosie was determined to become one of those Indigenous geneticists, and in 2016, she began dissertation research at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Around that time, she met Keolu Fox and Joseph Yracheta, two other Indigenous scientists interested in genetics. Fox, who is Kānaka Maoli and a geneticist at the University of California, San Diego, believes Tsosie and others prioritizing Indigenous health and rights represent a paradigm shift in the field of genetics. “Minority health is not an afterthought to someone like Krystal, it is the primary goal,” Fox says. “We have not been allowed to operate large laboratories in major influential academic institutions until now. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s different.”</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-11" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-11">In 2018, Tsosie,</span> Yracheta and colleagues, with key support from Fox, <a href="https://nativebio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded the Native BioData Consortium</a>, an Indigenous-led nonprofit research institute that brings Indigenous scholars, experts and scientists together. The consortium’s biorepository, which Tsosie believes is the first repository of Indigenous genomic data in North America, is located on the sovereign land of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. The consortium supports various research, data and digital capacity building projects for Indigenous peoples and communities. These projects include researching soil health and the microbiome and creating a Tribal public health surveillance program for COVID that has <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/ivd-regulatory-assistance/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments</a> certification, as well as hosting workshops for Indigenous researchers.</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-12" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-12">The work may</span> be even more essential given current genomics trends: With Indigenous nations in the United States restricting access to their DNA, researchers and corporations seek DNA from Indigenous peoples in Latin America.</p>



<p>“We are now in the second era of discovery or the second era of colonization,” says Yracheta, who is P&#8217;urhépecha from Mexico, director of the consortium and a doctor of public health candidate in environmental health at Johns Hopkins University. “Lots of Indigenous spaces are small and shrinking and we&#8217;re trying to prevent that happening by asserting Indigenous data sovereignty not only over humans and biomedical data, but all data.”</p>



<p>Tsosie, Yracheta says, consistently works to bring Indigenous values and accountability to the consortium’s work and has an invaluable combination of skills. “She has a lot of really hard-core scientific background and now she&#8217;s mixing it with bioethics, law and policy and machine learning and artificial intelligence,” he says. “We make a really good team.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Training the next generation</h4>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-15" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-15">Today, Tsosie leads</span> the Tsosie Lab for Indigenous Genomic Data Equity and Justice at ASU. One lab project involves working with Tribal partners in the Phoenix area to create a multiethnic cohort for genomic and nongenomic data. The data, which will include social, structural, cultural and traditional factors, could provide a more complex picture of health disparities and what causes them, as well as a more nuanced understanding of Indigenous identity and health.</p>



<p>In addition to her own research, Tsosie spends time teaching, mentoring, traveling to speak about the importance of data sovereignty, and serving as a consultant for tribes who want to develop their own data policies. “We&#8217;re not just talking about doing research with communities,” she says. “We&#8217;re also helping to cocreate legal policies and resolutions and laws to help Tribal nations and Indigenous peoples protect their data and rights to their data.”</p>

<p>At ASU, Tsosie says, she is in the position to push back against some of the prevailing trends in Indigenous genomics, including the tendency to lump Indigenous people together, regardless of environmental, cultural and political factors. “This is an opportunity for my lab to really explore the fact that being Indigenous is not always a biological category. It&#8217;s one that&#8217;s mediated by culture, and also sociopolitical factors that have sometimes been imposed on us,” Tsosie says.</p>



<p>And while Tsosie’s goals are ambitious, she is equally committed to uplifting the next generation of Indigenous scientists. “Krystal puts in so much time and energy into ensuring that the next generation of students are getting ecosystems where they feel safe and protected to learn about new disciplines,” Fox says. “It&#8217;s just so special.”</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-20" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-20">To Tsosie, empowering</span> Indigenous communities to make decisions about their data and supporting Indigenous students are part of the same mission. “It just makes me happy to think about several academic generations in the future, how many of us will be occupying this colonial space that we call academia,” she says. “Then we can really start shifting this power imbalance towards something that is truly enriching and powerful for our peoples and our communities.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, has affected over seven hundred million people to date, leading to varied symptoms that can persist for weeks, months, or even years. Long COVID, officially termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), poses unique challenges for athletes, impacting their physical, cognitive, and mental well-being beyond the acute phase of the virus. Despite its relevance, the prevalence of these prolonged symptoms remains unstudied among student athletes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Infectious Diseases</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> delves into this issue, using surveys of 7,000 student athletes across 18 U.S. schools from spring 2020 to fall 2021.In spring 2020, 9.8% of student athletes tested positive for COVID-19, a figure that surged to 25.4% during the fall 2020 to spring 2021 academic year. Notably, 4% of those testing positive developed Long COVID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This study contributes crucial data on COVID-19 and Long COVID prevalence among young, physically active individuals. A significant percentage of infections resulted in symptomatic cases, ranging from 25.2% to 79.6%, depending on the timeframe. Additionally, 1.0% to 4.3% experienced Long COVID, challenging assumptions about its rarity in young, healthy adults. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The survey underscores the substantial impact of COVID-19 on collegiate student athletes, emphasizing the need for further research to validate these estimates and address the diverse experiences of Long COVID among athletes. These findings carry implications for athlete well-being, guiding future public health measures and supporting targeted interventions for those grappling with the aftermath of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the athletic community.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aquatic activities offer a spectrum of benefits, including physical activity, social connections, and a sense of wellbeing. However, the lack of swimming skills poses a significant risk of drowning, affecting approximately 37% of U.S. adults. The limited research on how learning to swim can impact the lives of adults warrants the need to investigate the importance of adult swim instruction programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Public Health</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> reports on the barriers to swimming and discusses Knowles&#8217; theory of adult learning to overcome these obstacles. The study focuses on the United States Masters Swimming Adult Learn to Swim (ALTS) program, designed to cater to adults interested in acquiring swimming skills. For the study, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted, and the collected data was interpreted into three key themes: life affordance, emotional affect, and interpersonal relationships. Participants expressed how learning to swim not only provides a life-affirming skill but also opens doors to various water-based activities, enhancing overall wellbeing. Overcoming the emotional barriers tied to past negative experiences results in a transformational shift, with participants experiencing feelings of excitement, accomplishment, and increased confidence. Interpersonal relationships emerge as a significant motivator, with many adults inspired to learn due to family influences or their desire to ensure their own children can swim. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In conclusion, adult swim instruction programs extend beyond imparting swimming skills. They serve as catalysts for positive life changes, breaking down emotional barriers, fostering healthy relationships with water, and promoting overall well being. Recognizing these broader impacts is crucial for designing effective programs and addressing public health concerns related to drowning and limited swimming ability.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common genetic disorders, is characterized by the presence of abnormal sickle-shaped hemoglobin affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Individuals with SCD, particularly adolescents and young adults (AYA), face unique challenges that contribute to high risks of mental health disorders. Despite the prevalence of depression and anxiety in this population, they face barriers to traditional treatments such as a lack of accessibility and cultural relevance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Digital Health</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> explores the potential of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to address the mental health needs of AYA with SCD, especially in low-resource settings. To enhance the relevance of a digital CBT program, researchers made modifications such as incorporating Afrocentric and urban-themed images and creating a video highlighting shared experiences among individuals with SCD. The study enrolled 21 SCD patients from the University of Pittsburgh Children’s and Adult clinics in a randomized trial and compared a standard mental health app with an enhanced version of the app, tailored for minorities living with SCD. While overall engagement with the app was suboptimal, the group-specific adaptation showed promise, with participants in the enhanced group demonstrating greater engagement and improvements in pain, self-efficacy, and depression symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the study&#8217;s limitations, such as a small sample size and challenges in participant engagement, it lays the groundwork for future research. The findings suggest that tailoring digital interventions for specific populations, like AYA with SCD, may be crucial for enhancing user engagement and treatment outcomes. The study underscores the potential of digital CBT as a scalable and accessible solution for addressing mental health disparities in vulnerable populations, urging further exploration and adaptation to meet the unique needs of those living with SCD.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Comprehensive maternal care challenges persist in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, impacting maternal and neonatal health. The World Health Organization recommends specific care components, but limited access and completion rates prevail. In Liberia, a post-Ebola Community Health Assistant (CHA) program launched in 2016 aimed to enhance healthcare access showing significant improvements in childhood treatment and facility-based delivery through the National Community Health Assistant Program (NCHAP). However, its impact on the full maternal continuum of care was less known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> assessed the association between NCHAP implementation and maternal continuum of care completion. The study utilized existing data from 2015, 2018, and 2021 collected from repeated cross-sectional household surveys of communities served by the CHA program in Rivercess County, Liberia. Rates of completing antenatal care, facility-based delivery, and postnatal care increased significantly post-implementation. Notably, the percentage of women receiving no steps in the continuum of care decreased remarkably. Factors influencing completion included distance from health facilities, wealth, and community accessibility. Living farther negatively impacted completion, emphasizing the program&#8217;s focus on reaching remote communities. Despite COVID-19 challenges, NCHAP demonstrated resilience, maintaining improved maternal care rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This study underscores the importance of community-based interventions, like the CHA program, in enhancing maternal care access. While achieving notable progress, there&#8217;s an ongoing need to address challenges for those living farthest from health facilities. These findings contribute valuable insights to inform and optimize future community-based initiatives, emphasizing the role of CHWs in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/empire-of-pain-a-review">Empire of Pain: A Review</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Emily Beswick reviews Patrick Keefe's <em>Empire of Pain</em>, an insight into the controversy surrounding Purdue Pharma and its supposed medical breakthrough narcotic, OxyContin.</strong></p>
<blockquote>The key takeaway from this book...is the power of data</blockquote><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_fe363badb366494f80042ef09031acfd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_625,h_765,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>Keefe presents a meticulous investigation into the rise and fall of the Sackler family, whose ownership of Purdue Pharma, during the creation of the pain-relieving drug OxyContin, contributed to the opioid crisis currently affecting America. Patrick Radden Keefe is a staff writer at the New York Times, whose role as an investigative journalist is evident in his diligent approach to authorship. The book itself expands upon Keefe’s 2017 article, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">,,<u>‘The Family That Built an Empire of Pain’</u></a>, in the New Yorker that is widely cited as one of the first exposés about the Sackler family.  </p>

<p>OxyContin is, at its core, an opioid, a type of drug that is effective in relieving pain but is highly addictive, and only previously prescribed to patients who were terminally ill. Purdue Pharma marketed OxyContin as ‘different’ to other pain medications due to its slow-release coating that released the opioid gradually which, in turn, reduced the risk of addiction. The problem was…that was not the case. </p>

<p>As Keefe details, the material used to market OxyContin as ‘non-addictive’ was an inaccurate representation of the real data collected, and the slow-release coating was nowhere near as effective as Purdue Pharma posited. More and more people across America were becoming addicted to opioids, with legally prescribed opioids starring in the beginning of many stories of addiction. </p>

<p>TV shows such as ‘Dopesick’ and ‘Pain Killers’ have highlighted the role of OxyContin prescribing in the opioid crisis, and the recent Netflix film ‘Pain Hustlers’ focused on the tactics used by pharmaceutical sales representatives responsible for ensuring the drug was prescribed. Whilst these series and films have been essential to draw public attention to this issue, Keefe’s book <em>Empire of Pain</em> goes into a greater level of detail about who should be held accountable for the opioid crisis. </p>

<p>The key takeaway from this book, and there are so many to choose from, is the power of data. To convince regulators to provide approvals, doctors to prescribe, and sales representatives to sell, Purdue misused data to convince others of the efficacy and safety of OxyContin. The data itself was usually accurate, but its representation was deliberately misleading. A clear example is the graph (Figure 1) used to indicate the release of opium into the bloodstream, which employed a logarithmic scale, rather than a traditional linear scale. This created the false image that OxyContin remained in the bloodstream for longer, without the sharp drop in opium levels that typically gives rise to addiction.</p>

<p><em>Image sourced from digitised citizen petition sent to the FDA at the Department of Health and Human Services, on behalf of the citizens of Mississippi attorney Philip W. Thomas. This petition (available at </em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-courts-secrecy-judges/thomas-motion-4.pdf" target="_blank" >,,<em>,<u>https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-courts-secrecy-judges/thomas-motion-4.pdf</u></em></a><em>) involves a request that the FDA remove, or amend, the graph from Oxycontin prescription packaging and outlines why it is misleading. </em></p>
<blockquote>...wealth and power were generated through capitalising on people’s pain.</blockquote>
<p><em>Empire of Pain</em> is an incredible exposé of the Sackler family, Purdue Pharma, and all those involved in the provision of OxyContin. Keefe is a reporter; he presents the facts and evidence of the case, whilst also telling an engaging story of how wealth and power were generated through capitalising on people’s pain. The book is also a reminder that we, as scientists, have a social responsibility. Research on health must be conducted to the highest ethical standards as, unfortunately, the OxyContin scandal shows we have learnt little since the Tuskegee experiment (an overview of this scandal is available at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm" target="_blank" >,,<u>https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm</u></a>). </p>

<p>This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the process of drug development, pain management, or just some next-level family drama.</p>

<p>Nearly two years after being warned one of its journals appeared to be the target of a paper mill operation, Taylor &amp; Francis has retracted 80 articles that appeared in that journal.</p>



<p>Last June, <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">Undark and Retraction Watch reported</a> on the efforts of a sleuth using the name Aishwarya Swaminathan to alert Taylor &amp; Francis and other publishers starting in April 2022 that a data scientist named Gunasekaran Manogaran allegedly runs “a research paper publishing scam” that targets special issues. Such issues appear to be <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">particularly vulnerable to paper mills</a>.</p>



<p>Another sleuth, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Nick Wise</a>, also worked to suss out the problems, and <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-10-05/spanish-university-administrator-and-colleagues-linked-to-factory-producing-fraudulent-scientific-studies.html"><em>El Pais</em> reported</a> on the links between Manogaran and a professor in Spain in October.</p>



<p>Now, <em>Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica, Section B — Soil &amp; Plant Science</em> has <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?AllField=%22Envisage+Computer+Modelling+and+Statistics+for+Agriculture%22+AND+retraction&amp;SeriesKey=sagb20">retracted 80 papers</a>, all with a notice that specifies the name of the relevant special issue:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alzheimers-disease-transmission-extremely-rare">Under very rare conditions, Alzheimer’s disease may be transmitted</a></h4>

              
                <p>Under extremely rare circumstances, it appears that Alzheimer’s disease can be transmitted between people. Five people who received contaminated injections of a growth hormone as children <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02729-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went on to develop Alzheimer’s unusually early</a>, researchers report January 29 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings represent “the first time iatrogenic Alzheimer’s disease has been described,” neurologist John Collinge said January 25 in a news briefing, referring to a disease caused by a medical procedure.</p>



<p>That sounds alarming, but researchers are quick to emphasize that Alzheimer’s disease is not contagious in everyday life, including caretaking and most medical settings.</p>



<p>“We are not suggesting for a moment that you can catch Alzheimer’s disease,” said Collinge, of the University College London&#8217;s Institute of Prion Diseases. “This is not transmissible in the sense of a viral or bacterial infection.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reassurance is echoed by Carlo Condello, a neurobiologist at the University of California, San Francisco who wasn’t involved in the study. “In no way do we believe sporadic Alzheimer’s disease is a communicable disease,” he says. “Only under incredibly artificial, now out-of-date, medical practices is this appearing. It’s no longer an issue.”</p>



<p>Most cases of Alzheimer’s disease arise spontaneously in older people (in the United States, for instance, about 1 in 9 people aged 65 and older have the disease). That’s part of what makes these newly described cases of Alzheimer’s so unusual. Symptoms started early for these five people with Alzheimer’s — between ages 38 and 55 — and in three for whom genetic data were available, researchers ruled out the presence of mutations known to cause early-onset forms of the disease. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The people in the study had all received growth hormone injections as children or teenagers. Used to treat various growth disorders, these hormones were extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers and combined into batches, a source that is no longer used. Some of these mixtures were later found to be contaminated with prions, infectious, misshapen proteins, that caused a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Globally, more than 200 people were affected. This type of growth hormone treatment stopped in 1985; doctors now use synthetic versions.</p>



<p>It turns out that those batches held another problem. In an earlier study, Collinge and his colleagues had found higher-than-expected levels of amyloid-beta in the brains of four people who had died with CJD. Accumulation of the sticky protein is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s and, in these cases, a worrisome signal that perhaps some of these proteins had been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/misfolded-proteins-implicated-more-brain-diseases">transferred, along with prions, from donors</a> (<em>SN: 9/9/15</em>). A-beta from some of the hormone batches could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alzheimers-protein-spread-growth-hormone-injections">spread in the brains of mice</a>, suggesting that the protein behaves in some ways like an infectious prion, the researchers reported in 2018 (<em>SN: 12/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>Now, the researchers report on eight more people who had received contaminated growth hormone and were referred to their clinical team. None of these people had CJD, but three had already received Alzheimer’s diagnoses. Further exams showed that two more people had the disease and two had signs of cognitive trouble. One person didn’t have symptoms.</p>



<p>The most likely cause of these Alzheimer’s cases seems to be the unusual introduction of A-beta early in life, the researchers conclude. “Taken as a whole, the only real explanation is the shared exposure” to contaminated growth hormone, neurologist Gargi Banerjee, also at UCL, said in the Jan. 25 briefing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That interpretation “is plausible,” says Condello. “What’s in those extracts could have done what they claim it did.”</p>



<p>Still, scientists can’t be certain that contaminated growth hormone caused these people’s Alzheimer’s disease. It’s possible, for instance, that the underlying childhood conditions that necessitated the growth hormone treatments, or other medical procedures such as radiation, contributed to early Alzheimer’s or cognitive problems. Several of the people suffered from seizures, which could perhaps influence cognitive problems or brain pathology. “The definitive answer may never come,” Condello says.</p>



<p>Beyond these rare circumstances, the results may hold clues about how Alzheimer’s disease can take hold in the brain, and whether A-beta, like a prion, incites other versions of A-beta to misfold. Untangling the details of how various forms of A-beta spread “lies ahead,” Collinge said. “A great deal more research needs to be done.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-covid-not-seasonal">Here’s why COVID-19 isn’t seasonal so far</a></h4>

              
                <p>The pandemic may no longer be a public health emergency, but plenty of my neighbors, friends and family are still having bouts and brushes with COVID-19.</p>



<p>Just this past summer, a relative got COVID-19 on a camping trip. One of my neighbors was sick. Another had no symptoms but kept his distance while a bright pink line appeared on his test strip each morning. He shouted updates across the street as we walked our dogs: “The line was a little fainter today.” “It’s gone.” And finally, “It’s been two days since the line disappeared.” We and the dogs rejoiced at the reunion.</p>



<p>In the fall and winter, the reports poured in again: coworkers stricken with the coronavirus; the sick neighbor’s family got COVID-19 in the fall long after he recovered; a friend got sick after visiting a relative and missed Christmas with her parents; another friend’s cousins tested positive just after spending the holidays together.</p>



<p>The experiences of the people in my circle mirror the peaks and valleys of contagion seen across the United States and other temperate zones of the world. All of this got me wondering if SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, will ever settle in to becoming a virus that primarily strikes during cold and flu season. Having a predictable season would make timing and formulation of vaccines easier. It might also convince people that it’s wise to take precautions like wearing a mask at certain times of year.</p>



<p>Some recent data suggest that, for now, COVID-19 may be a year-round problem, driven more by human behavior and immunity levels than weather patterns.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">COVID-19 is an all-weather spreader</h4>



<p>Many common respiratory viruses <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-easier-catch-cold-flu-covid-winter">spread better in cold, dry weather</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/23</em>). Like the flu viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is more stable when the temperature and humidity are low. But scientists didn’t know whether the stability of the virus in well-controlled lab conditions translated to better spread at certain times of year in the real world, says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont., part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.</p>



<p>Munster and colleagues set up experiments with hamsters as stand-ins for people. The researchers wanted to examine airborne transmission — the primary way COVID-19 spreads — without having to worry about other less likely possible modes of spread, such as large droplets or contaminated surfaces. So the team infected one hamster and put it in a cage 90 centimeters away from a cage housing an uninfected hamster. At that distance, only airborne viruses could reach the uninfected hamster.</p>



<p>The team tested a typical climate-controlled room temperature (22° Celsius, or about 72° Fahrenheit) with a comfortable 45 percent relative humidity. Other hamsters were tested in cooler 10° C temperatures mimicking fall and winter in many parts of the world. A third cohort of animals got the tropical treatment at 27° C and 65 percent relative humidity.</p>



<p>Those environmental conditions <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44298-023-00011-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t affect airborne transmission</a> of the coronavirus, the researchers report January 9 in <em>npj Viruses</em>. The virus spread between hamsters at similar rates across all the conditions tested.</p>



<p>“Most of the time, the environmental impact on these viruses is relatively limited because they only stay in the air for a relatively short time,” Munster says. He’s talking seconds to minutes rather than hours or days.</p>



<p>Aerosols can hang around in the air for hours, Munster and colleagues have previously shown, but infection probably happens much faster, he says. Usually, an infected person would breathe out an infectious virus and someone nearby would inhale it. There’s just not enough transit time for environmental conditions to have a big impact on viral spread in those cases.</p>



<p>For the researchers, Munster says, “the biggest question was, ‘Does that mean these viruses don&#8217;t have the propensity to becoming seasonal?’” He thinks the coronavirus may someday have a season, but the determining factor won’t be the calendar. Instead, people’s immunity to the virus — from vaccination, prior infections or both — and human behavior will determine when COVID season hits, he predicts.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It’s not strangers who create transmission danger</h4>



<p>Another recent study addresses that human behavior component. Researchers at the University of Oxford analyzed data collected from a cell phone app that was used to notify people when they had been a contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19. The team examined more than 7 million notifications issued during the study period from April 2021 to February 2022. The researchers wanted to know if they could accurately predict whether someone would catch COVID-19 from looking at how close people were to infected people and how long the sick and well were together.</p>



<p>People often think “stranger danger” poses the biggest risk of getting infected, but that’s not what the data say, says epidemiologist Christophe Fraser.</p>



<p>The app was set to notify people if they’d been less than two meters from an infected person for 15 minutes. “The risk of transmission was really quite low at that point,” he says. The probability of transmission rose <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06952-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1 percent per hour of exposure</a> and kept increasing with continued exposure over several days, Fraser and colleagues reported December 20 in <em>Nature</em>. Households made up only 6 percent of contacts but accounted for 40 percent of transmissions.</p>



<p>Brief, casual contacts with strangers, such as at the grocery store, accounted for a large number of contacts, but few infections. Instead, the person who poses the most danger is “somebody you&#8217;ve spent a lot of time with: You could have dinner with them, go to the cinema with them, or you live at home with them or you work next to them in an office,” he says. That’s because infected people are constantly breathing out the virus and you have a greater chance of getting infected the longer you’re exposed and the closer you are to the source.<br></p>

<p>Other respiratory viruses have seasons that are influenced by human behavior in addition to the weather, Fraser says. For instance, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) outbreaks tend to coincide with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">children returning to school</a> after summer and winter breaks (<em>SN: 8/12/21</em>). Perhaps COVID-19 will also settle into a similar pattern, but it may take decades, he says.</p>



<p>Human behavior can also quash seasonal viruses, at least for a time: Social distancing, mask-wearing and other COVID-prevention strategies severely tamped down the number of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">flu and RSV infections</a> in 2020 and 2021 (<em>SN: 2/2/21</em>). But the viruses rebounded once those restrictions were lifted.</p>



<p>Some of the rebound of those seasonal viruses researchers think is because of loss of collective immunity against the viruses, especially among young children who have no immunity and older people whose immune systems tend to be weaker. Immunity also wanes the farther you get from a booster shot or infection.</p>



<p>Changes in human immunity may be the major driver of COVID-19 seasonality in the future, says Fraser’s Oxford colleague Luca Ferretti. But that’s not what has happened so far.</p>



<p>Early in the pandemic no one was immune to the virus, so it could infect almost everyone. Once vaccines became available and many people had immunity from the shots or previous infections, the original strain of the virus could be stopped or slowed by the immune system.</p>



<p>If the coronavirus changed relatively slowly the way other respiratory viruses do, COVID-19 might have already become a seasonal illness. But the coronavirus continues to change fast, often in ways that help it barrel right past immune defenses and infect even those with prior immunity.</p>



<p>For instance, the JN.1 variant started appearing in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s reports in October. As of January 20, it made up <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 86 percent of cases</a> in the United States. The virus sent more than 30,000 people to the hospital in the week of January 7 to 13 alone.</p>



<p>So far, the biggest outbreaks of coronavirus happened when new variants, such as delta and omicron, that allow the virus to escape antibodies came along. No one knows whether the virus has such dazzling escape acts left in its bag of tricks.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Our immunity has shifted when we’re most infectious</h4>



<p>In addition to protecting us from COVID-19, human immunity has changed when people may be most infectious. Early in the pandemic, people produced the most virus and were most infectious in the first few days after infection, sometimes even before symptoms started. Now, immunity from vaccines and previous cases of COVID-19 have pushed back the peak of viral production until about <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciad582/7285011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four days after symptoms start</a>, researchers reported September 28 in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>The reason for the change comes from the immune system fighting the virus earlier in the infection and producing symptoms before viral replication really takes off, says Nira Pollock, a clinical diagnostics expert at Boston Children’s Hospital.</p>



<p>That’s a good thing. But it also may inadvertently lead to more infections because it can affect when people get a positive result on home tests. Getting a positive line on a home test requires producing enough virus for the test to detect. So with a delay in peak viral production, you might get a negative test result but actually have COVID-19 and be able to pass it to others. That’s why repeat testing is necessary if you have symptoms or have been exposed to someone who does.</p>



<p>“If you test negative on day one, you are not done,” Pollock says. “If you continue to be symptomatic, you should repeat your test, because it&#8217;s possible that your highest viral load will be on your fourth day of symptoms, or your third or your fifth.” Repeat testing “is the FDA recommendation. It&#8217;s on the box.”</p>



<p>Being able to mark COVID-19 season on the calendar would be nice. At least then we’d know if we need to don masks along with our hats and gloves or with our beachwear. And there wouldn’t be so much guesswork in timing vaccinations.</p>



<p>For now, though, the coronavirus is on its own ever-changing timetable. Whether it eventually settles into a seasonal virus may depend on us. The strength of our collective immune systems and our willingness to take precautions to not spread any illness to others may eventually wrestle it into seasonal submission.</p>

<p>Nearly three years after a university investigation committee recommended retracting several papers by a cancer researcher found guilty of research misconduct, the journal <em>Cancer Research</em> has pulled three of the offending articles.</p>



<p>The journal also retracted a fourth paper by the researcher, Samson Jacob, a former emeritus professor at The Ohio State University, which had been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E162C654EC638A4401721CA49E8E75">flagged on PubPeer</a>.</p>



<p>In 2021, the OSU committee reviewed dozens of allegations against Jacob&#8217;s work, and found <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/25/exclusive-osu-investigation-finds-dishonesty-and-permissive-culture-of-data-manipulation-in-cancer-research-lab/">14 of them met at least one of two evidence standards for research misconduct</a>, as we reported in 2022. The allegations mainly centered on figures that appeared to be spliced together from different experimental runs, which was not acknowledged in the studies – a concern the new retraction notices also mention.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128646"></span>



<p>Prior to the OSU’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/20210209-Final-Investigation-Report-Jacob-Redacted.pdf">investigation report</a>, which Retraction Watch obtained via a public-records request, Jacob had already <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/08/17/cancer-researcher-at-osu-up-to-nine-retractions/">racked up nine retractions</a> from the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The committee concluded “that there was a permissive culture of data manipulation in [Jacob’s] lab, with emphasis on the control lanes to minimize detection, and that this was not due to inadvertent error,&#8221; according to the report. As a result, the school revoked Jacob&#8217;s emeritus status and OSU &#8220;contacted relevant journals in 2021&#8221; to request retractions, Benjamin Johnson, assistant vice president of media and public relations, told Retraction Watch in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We emailed Christine A. Iacobuzio-Donahue, <em>Cancer Research</em>&#8216;s editor-in-chief, to ask why the journal waited nearly three years to retract the papers mentioned in OSU&#8217;s investigation report, but she did not respond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christine Battle, publisher and vice president of scientific publications at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which publishes the journal, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>The first three studies are among 10 papers the OSU committee advised retracting in its report. Each of the retraction notices for these papers cited the institutional review by OSU, and evidence of data manipulation. The papers have been cited a total of 661 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including 47 times since OSU made its findings of misconduct.</p>



<p>The fourth retracted paper<em>, </em>“<a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/83/24/4179/731555/Retraction-Loss-of-Metallothionein-Predisposes">Loss of Metallothionein Predisposes Mice to Diethylnitrosamine-Induced Hepatocarcinogenesis by Activating NF-κB Target Genes</a>,” has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E162C654EC638A4401721CA49E8E75">comments on PubPeer</a> that also expressed concerns about manipulation of the study&#8217;s Western blot analyses. That paper has been cited 44 times, including six times after 2021.</p>



<p>Jacob, who could not be reached for comment for this article, did not agree to any of the retractions. According to the retraction notices, he &#8220;stands by the reproducibility of the experimental data and the conclusions.&#8221;</p>



<p>Commenting on the retractions, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E162C654EC638A4401721CA49E8E75#8">an anonymous PubPeer user wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>With all due respect for Dr. Jacob, the concerns about the data presented in the paper are not about &#8220;reproducibility&#8221; or &#8220;conclusions.&#8221; The concerns are that the data presented shows signs of having been inappropriately manipulated &#8211; concerns which the editors apparently share (as do I).</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Simon O'Connor will give the talk &quot;Does combinatorial coding hinder the understanding of structure odour relationships in human olfaction?&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Since Malcolm Dyson first suggested a vibrational theory of smell in 1928 proponents of
the competing theories of olfaction have struggled for nearly a century to make sense of
how the chemical structure of odour molecules elicit the perception of odours. Here I will
give a short introduction to the olfactory system. I will then discuss a dataset that I
constructed from fragrance industry catalogues, Infrared Spectra simulations using
‘Gaussian’ modelling software and RDkit bit vectors based on the structure of the
molecules. Next, I will describe KNN and Random Forrest studies in which I probe the
dataset before moving on to hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. I will then talk
about Hyperbolic Hierarchical Clustering (HypHC) software and whether an embeddings-based
approach might be the right approach considering the combinatorial nature of the receptor
output.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/roman-empire-cold-climate-plague-archaeology">Cold, dry snaps accompanied three plagues that struck the Roman Empire</a></h4>

              
                <p>For those who enjoy pondering the Roman Empire’s rise and fall — you know who you are — consider the close link between ancient climate change and infectious disease outbreaks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Periods of increasingly cooler temperatures and rainfall declines <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coincided with three pandemics that struck the Roman Empire</a>, historian Kyle Harper and colleagues report January 26 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Reasons for strong associations between cold, dry phases and those disease outbreaks are poorly understood. But the findings, based on climate reconstructions from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 600, help “us see that climate stress probably contributed to the spread and severity of [disease] mortality,” says Harper, of the University of Oklahoma in Norman.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-3" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-3">Harper has previously</span> argued that the First Plague Pandemic (also known as the Justinianic Plague), combined with declining global temperatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-ancient-plagues-pandemics-lessons-society" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to weaken the Roman Empire</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new findings reinforce an idea that climate shifts can influence the origin and spread of infectious diseases, says Princeton University historian John Haldon. But it’s unclear whether a range of factors in the ancient Roman realm, including long-distance trade networks and densely populated settlements, heightened people’s vulnerability to disease outbreaks, says Haldon, who did not participate in the new study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To reconstruct the ancient climate, marine palynologist Karin Zonneveld and colleagues turned to an extensive sample of fossilized dinoflagellates. These single-celled algae had been preserved in radiocarbon-dated slices from a sediment core previously extracted in southern Italy’s Gulf of Taranto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dinoflagellates live in the sunlit upper part of the sea. Different species of this organism assume signature shapes in the late summer and autumn before settling on the ocean floor. Some species live only in cold waters, others only in warm waters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late summer and autumn, water temperature in the Gulf of Taranto closely aligns with southern Italy’s air temperature, says Zonneveld, of the University of Bremen in Germany. Her group tracked changes in the composition of dinoflagellate species in sediment slices to estimate late summer/autumn temperatures in southern Italy during the Roman Empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also used dinoflagellates to gauge changes in ancient rainfall. Plentiful rainfall in central and northern Italy causes rivers to discharge nutrient-rich water into the Gulf of Taranto. Dinoflagellate species known to rely on plentiful nutrients thrive under those conditions and end up on the sea floor. Other dinoflagellate species prefer nutrient-poor water. Their preservation in underwater sediment reflects stretches of scant rainfall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dinoflagellate analysis revealed that warm, stable temperatures and regular rainfall occurred from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 100, Zonneveld says. That time corresponds to the Roman Warm Period, a time of political and social stability for the Roman Empire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, phases of increasingly cold and dry conditions occurred shortly before or during three pandemics: the Antonine Plague, which spread from Egypt to Europe and the British Isles in the late 160s; the Plague of Cyprian, which struck during a time of Roman political turmoil in the mid-200s; and the Justinianic Plague, which reached Italy by 543. By the late 500s, average temperatures were about 3 degrees Celsius colder than the highest averages during the Roman Warm Period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unclear how high death rates climbed during these disease outbreaks and how they might factor into the fall of the empire. The Roman Empire’s power and influence fell dramatically by around the time of the Justinianic Plague, though the eastern half of the empire lasted until the fall of its capital in Constantinople in 1453.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And despite providing valuable new climate information from ancient Roman times, neither Zonnefeld’s team nor anyone else can say with certainty how temperature and rainfall shifts may have aided the spread of infectious diseases, says classical archaeologist Brandon McDonald of the University of Basel in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s known that the Justinianic Plague was caused by the Black Death bacterium <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, specific disease-causing agents for the Antonine Plague and the Plague of Cyprian remain unknown, McDonald says, further muddying attempts to explain how climate may have influenced those events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Economic and social historian Colin Elliott notes that many infectious microbes flourish under cold, dry conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-15" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-15"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-17" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-17">In Elliott’s new</span></span> book that focuses on the Antonine Plague, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691219158/pox-romana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pox Romana</em></a>, he argues that grain production in Italy and other parts of the Roman Empire <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691219158/pox-romana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered during cold years</a>. As a result, hungry people in the Italian countryside may have migrated to cities where imported grain was available, says Elliott, of Indiana University in Bloomington. “Diseases moved with migrants, but surges of malnourished and immunologically [vulnerable] populations into cities almost certainly increased pandemic virulence as well.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-16" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-16"><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-root-18" style="position: absolute;z-index: 10000"></span><span id="speechify-first-word-listening-nudge-18">Intriguingly, the new</span></span> study also raises the possibility that cooler and drier autumns reduced malaria cases, says Ohio State University historian Kristina Sessa. The milder climate may have impaired or killed temperature-sensitive mosquitoes that regularly transmitted the dangerous disease in southern Italy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The journal <em>Cureus </em>has retracted 56 papers nearly two years after it first began to suspect the works were of dubious lineage.</p>



<p>Cureus – an open access journal founded in 2009 and <a href="https://group.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/springer-nature-acquires-cureus/23793592">acquired by Springer Nature in 2022</a> – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/04/29/journal-issues-55-expressions-of-concern-at-once/">slapped 55 of the papers with expressions of concern</a> in April 2022. At that time, at least one author said they didn’t know anything about the work and <em>Cureus </em>noted the “articles were submitted and subsequently published purportedly as an effort coordinated by Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University to ensure all medical interns publish at least one peer-reviewed article in order to qualify for enrollment in a postgraduate residency program as stipulated by The Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS).”</p>



<p>At the time, <em>Cureus</em>’ founding editor in chief John Adler told us “The investigation has been frustratingly slow due to the relative unresponsiveness of Saudi gov officials.” Apparently, that remained the case. This week, the journal retracted 56 studies. All of the retraction notices read the same way:</p>



<span id="more-128650"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. Concerns were raised regarding the identity of the authors on this article. Specifically, Faisal Alhaway and Malak Shammari have stated that they were added to this article without their knowledge or approval. The identity of the other authors could also not be verified. As the appropriate authorship of this work cannot be established, the Editors-in-Chief no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions of this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Springer Nature why the move had taken nearly two years. Graham Parker-Finger, <em>Cureus</em>’ director of publishing and customer services, told us through a spokesperson:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We agree that editorial action on problematic content should happen as quickly as possible, but we need to ensure we are acting responsibly and appropriately.  Our initial investigation attempts stalled after we experienced protracted difficulties in communicating with the relevant parties.  Although all of the articles were reviewed by at least one independent peer reviewer and underwent several rounds of journal editorial review, based on the lack of follow-up and inability to connect with anyone related to the case, the journal made the decision to publish an expression of concern for each article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adler told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After a dozen or so failed attempts to communicate with Saudi Government authorities over the better part of a year, we decided to retract all these articles. The editorial team could not convince ourselves that anything in these articles was wrong, but neither could we vouch for their authenticity, especially with the primary authors simply vanishing. The circumstances here are so peculiar given the seeming lack of any clear motivation by the authors and the ghosting of us by Saudi authorities. So out of an abundance of caution we made the decision to retract and just move on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Parker-Finger continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is our position that our primary responsibility is to the public (and more specifically, the scientific community) to only publish credible medical science. While the authorship issues are undoubtedly suspicious, the journal still has no reason to doubt the scientific accuracy of the articles, which contributed to the delay to act as we worked through the most appropriate course of action. At the time these decisions were made, the journal was also engaged in acquisition talks with Springer Nature and we determined that the best course of action would be to work with Springer Nature’s research integrity and legal resources on next steps, given the level of uncertainty regarding the situation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He said the journal has “undertaken a number of activities to prevent a similar situation occurring in future:”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our system now has an automated function for the identification and rejection of submissions that include authors with illegitimate email domains such as <a href="http://boximail.com/">boximail.com</a>.  It also sends an automated notification to senior editorial staff if one author submits multiple submissions over a short period and these cases will be followed by inquiry and, if needed, full investigation.  Our submissions editors have been trained to identify and flag suspicious publishing activity of this type and senior editorial staff have been thoroughly briefed on details of case for awareness and advice on appropriate steps to take including contacting department leadership to authenticate identities.”</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parrot-intelligence-smart-brain-behavior">What parrots can teach us about human intelligence</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Bruce the kea is missing his upper beak, giving the olive green parrot a look of perpetual surprise. But scientists are the astonished ones.</p>



<p>The typical kea (<em>Nestor notabilis</em>) sports a long, sharp beak, perfect for digging insects out of rotten logs or ripping roots from the ground in New Zealand’s alpine forests. Bruce has been missing the upper part of his beak since at least 2012, when he was rescued as a fledgling and sent to live at the Willowbank Wildlife Reserve in Christchurch.</p>



<p>The defect prevents Bruce from foraging on his own. Keeping his feathers clean should also be an impossible task. In 2021, when comparative psychologist Amalia Bastos arrived at the reserve with colleagues to study keas, the zookeepers reported something odd: Bruce had seemingly figured out how to use small stones to preen.</p>



<p>“We were like, ‘Well that’s weird,’ ” says Bastos, of Johns Hopkins University.</p>



<p>Over nine days, the team kept a close eye on Bruce, quickly taking videos if he started cleaning his feathers. Bruce, it turned out, had indeed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97086-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invented his own work-around to preen</a>, the researchers reported in 2021 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>First, Bruce selects the proper tool, rolling pebbles around in his mouth with his tongue and spitting out candidates until he finds one that he likes, usually something pointy. Next, he holds the pebble between his tongue and lower beak. Then, he picks through his feathers.</p>



<p>“It’s crazy because the behavior was not there from the wild,” Bastos says. When Bruce arrived at Willowbank, he was too young to have learned how to preen. And no other bird in the aviary uses pebbles in this way. “It seems like he just innovated this tool use for himself,” she says.</p>



<p>Tool use is just one of parrots’ many talents. The birds are famous for emulating, and perhaps sometimes even understanding, human speech. Some species can also solve complex puzzles, like how to invade a secured trash bin, or practice self-control. Such abilities, on par with some primates, have earned parrots a place alongside members of the crow family as the “feathered apes.”</p>



<p>For a concept as abstract as intelligence, it’s challenging to develop a concrete definition that applies across animals. But researchers often point to features once thought to make humans special — enhanced learning, memory, attention and motor control — as signs of advanced cognition. Many of these capabilities are definitely seen in parrots, as well as in the crow family, and other animals like chimpanzees, dolphins and elephants.</p>



<p>“The question is, why is this kind of intelligence evolving multiple times?” says Theresa Rössler, a cognitive biologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna.</p>



<p>Exploring the parallels between parrots and people could provide clues. “Parrots are our evolutionary mirror image,” behavioral ecologist Antone Martinho-Truswell wrote in his 2022 book, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-parrot-in-the-mirror-how-evolving-to-be-like-birds-makes-us-human-antone-martinho-truswell/17417050?ean=9780198846109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Parrot in the Mirror</a></em>. With powerful brains and a proclivity for words, these birds are “the very best example,” he writes, of “nature’s ‘other try’ at a humanlike intelligence.”</p>



<p>It’s taken decades for cognitive scientists to realize this, says Irene Pepperberg, a parrot researcher and comparative psychologist at Boston University. At first glance, parrot brains look quite simple. And given the obvious physical differences and the fact that birds and humans last shared a common ancestor more than 300 million years ago, parrots are not an obvious candidate to help researchers understand human intelligence.</p>



<p>“When I started this work in the ’70s, my first grant proposal came back literally asking me what I was smoking,” Pepperberg says. That’s when she started working with Alex, an African gray parrot who, by the time of his death in 2007, had become renowned for his extensive vocabulary and knowledge of shapes, colors and even math.</p>



<p>Further supporting Pepperberg’s pioneering work, a slew of studies over the last decade highlight parrot smarts — and what these brilliant birds may teach us about how humanlike intelligence can emerge.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A vast skill set</h4>



<p>Parrots’ most well-known talent is their affinity for spoken words. Proficiency varies among species, but African grays (<em>Psittacus erithacus</em>) are particularly good at picking up words and speaking clearly, Pepperberg says.</p>



<p>These parrots <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24335-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can repeat up to 600 different words</a>, researchers reported in 2022 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. While some parrots simply mimic words, it is possible to train birds such as Alex, who had a vocabulary of more than 100 words, to communicate with people.</p>



<p>“It’s not like you can actually sit there and ask them, ‘Why did you do that? What were you thinking?’ ” Pepperberg says. “But because you can [train them to communicate], you can ask them the same types of questions that you ask young children.” Another one of her African grays, for example, can request time alone by saying “Wanna go back.”</p>



<p>Many of parrots’ other cognitive triumphs have come to light only more recently.</p>



<p>Like Bruce the kea, a variety of other parrots are also capable of incredible feats with a tool in claw or beak. Hyacinth macaws (<em>Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus</em>) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15248094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crack open nuts</a> by holding pieces of wood in their beak or foot to keep the food in just the right position.

<p>Overall, 11 of the nearly 400 parrot species, or about 3 percent, have been documented in scientific studies using tools. Crowdsourcing from YouTube videos, Bastos and colleagues <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.14.553302v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncovered 17 more tool-using species</a>, bringing the total to 28. After plotting the known tool users onto an evolutionary tree, the team estimates that 11 to 17 percent of parrot species may use tools.</p>



<p>Because the ability is more widespread across species than previously thought and found in all but one of the parrot families, it’s possible that tool use originated with the very first parrot, which lived more than 50 million years ago, Bastos argues. Why all the parrots in one major group, the family that includes common pet species like lovebirds and lorikeets, might have lost this proficiency is unclear.</p>



<p>“I’m hoping that future research can reveal why on Earth this one family of parrots doesn’t do it, whereas [every other family] seems to,” Bastos says.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, other researchers are investigating more subtle skills. Some parrots, for example, can practice restraint.</p>



<p>Griffin, one of Pepperberg’s current African grays, can pass a version of the marshmallow test. In the human version, children are offered a marshmallow as an immediate treat but are promised more if they can wait until later to devour it. Offered nuts instead of a marshmallow, Griffin can wait up to 15 minutes for better or more rewards, just like many preschoolers. Exactly what such self-discipline reveals about intelligence is debated, but self-control in humans may be a factor in decision making and planning for the future.</p>



<p>Among humans, how much trust people have in others and other factors such as socioeconomic status can influence responses to the marshmallow test. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fcom0000361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Different African grays also respond differently</a>, Pepperberg and colleagues reported in August in the <em>Journal of Comparative Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>A parrot named Pepper started out waiting for a larger treat, Pepperberg says. “Then she realized, ‘Wait a minute, if I take the smaller treats [really quickly], I get to go back to playing with my human, and I prefer that to the [big] treat.’ ”</p>



<p>Unlike Griffin, who receives near-constant interaction with people, Pepper is often left to her own devices. Because Pepper spends more time alone, perhaps she considers it unacceptable or unpleasant to wait to take a treat when people in the room are ignoring her.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The beauty of a bird brain</h4>



<p>A bird’s brain looks nothing like a primate’s. Most primate brains have curves and crinkles that twist into the elaborate patterns of the cerebral cortex. The nerve cells packed within these wrinkles help people think, remember and learn. A bird brain, on the other hand, “looks like a blob of protoplasm,” the jellylike substance that fills cells, Pepperberg says. Because of this simple-looking brain, it was long thought that to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/five-species-show-why-bird-brain-stupid-phrase">have a bird brain was to be stupid</a>.</p>



<p>But Pepperberg knew that was wrong. When she gave scientific talks in the 1980s about parrot accomplishments, people would say, “But it can’t be happening, there’s no cerebral cortex,” she recalls. “I was like, you’re the neurobiologists. Go find it.”</p>



<p>By the early 2000s, scientists had discovered that, in fact, parts of the avian brain are akin to the mammalian neocortex, the largest part of the cerebral cortex. Subsequent work has found that, compared with mammals, avian brains have “a higher total number of neurons for the same amount of skull space,” says neurobiologist and geneticist Erich Jarvis of Rockefeller University in New York City.</p>



<p>Parrot brains <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517131113#sec-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are especially densely packed</a>. Some species even have more neurons than some large-brained primates. This density may facilitate the formation of brain circuits not found in other animals, Jarvis says.</p>



<p>One of those circuits seems to be a major information highway comparable to one in human brains, says comparative neuro­biologist Cristián Gutiérrez-Ibáñez of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.</p>



<p>Human brains transfer information from the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum — a “little brain” at the back of the skull that in part coordinates movement — through clusters of neurons known as the pontine nuclei. This connection is crucial for cognitive functions like learning how to talk or making tools.</p>



<p>In birds, the similar pathway <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28301-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connects the avian equivalent of the neocortex to the cerebellum</a>, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez and colleagues reported in 2018 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. In addition to the pontine nuclei, birds shunt information through a second conduit, the SpM. It’s unclear what info gets transmitted via the SpM, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez says. But among birds, the parrot SpM is particularly large in size — a tantalizing hint that it may contribute to parrot intelligence.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Information highway</h3>



<p>Human and parrot brains look different but share a brain circuit that coordinates higher cognitive abilities. In this pathway, the cerebral cortex, or the avian equivalent, sends information to the cerebellum (pink arrows) via clusters of neurons called the pontine nuclei. Birds have an additional connection that shunts info via a conduit called the SpM, which is particularly big in parrots and might contribute to their brainpower.</p>

<p>Parrot and human brains <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218314179" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also share genetic underpinnings</a>, a team of researchers including Jarvis and behavioral neurobiologist Claudio Mello reported in 2018 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Parrots have acquired duplicate copies of various genes, some of which are known to be important for brain development and speech in people, says Mello, of Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. More copies could mean more ability. But parrot smarts may come down to how genes in the brain are regulated in addition to gaining more or new genes. Unlike other studied birds, parrots have genetic mutations in regions of DNA that provide instructions to switch genes on or off, perhaps to activate certain genes crucial for brain function and cognition.</p>



<p>This is reminiscent of humans, Mello says. We have mutations in these same gene regulators while other apes don’t. In us, the changes allow the regulators to kick-start genes related to growing big forebrains, a region important for complex cognition. If the same is true in parrots, it could point to a shared evolutionary process for humanlike intelligence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The evolution of intelligence</h4>



<p>To figure out the evolutionary origins of parrots’ brainpower, scientists have to go way back — all the way to the mass extinction that ended the Age of Dinosaurs. In the aftermath, as modern avian groups emerged, some birds rapidly evolved big brains.</p>



<p>That’s what paleontologist Daniel Ksepka and colleagues found by analyzing the skull casts of more than 2,000 living bird species, 22 extinct bird species and 12 nonavian dinosaurs. A large brain relative to body size is one indication, albeit imperfect, that an animal might be intelligent. Parrots, as well as members of the crow family, ended up with some of the largest brains of any birds.</p>



<p>Dinosaurs and early birds <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30430-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had similar sized brains relative to their bodies</a>, the researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Current Biology</em>. By the time of the mass extinction 66 million years ago, both groups were already beginning to form forebrains. Rapid environmental change in the wake of the asteroid impact that may have sparked the mass extinction could have pushed some avian brains further on the fast track to growth, says Ksepka, of the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn.</p>



<p>“The day after [impact] is going to be really hard,” he says. And then came forest fires and changes in the atmosphere and temperature as dust blocked out the sun.</p>



<p>Adaptable animals with relatively large brains — a group that probably included parrot ancestors — may have had a leg up over those without. Animals that figure out how to open pinecones with their beaks, say, will do better than the ones waiting for the next crop of berries that might never come, Ksepka says.</p>



<p>Today, having a big brain is just one thing humans and parrots have in common. In general, they also share long lives, monogamy and learning to sing or talk from others, a trait known as vocal learning. Researchers are investigating how these traits might relate to the evolution of intelligence. Right now, there are more hypotheses than answers.</p>



<p>For example, one line of thinking suggests vocal learning and a need for complex forms of communication may have paved the way to greater intelligence. Parrots “have very large, flexible vocal repertoires,” says behavioral ecologist Lucy Aplin of the University of Zurich and Australian National University in Canberra. “They can learn new vocalizations throughout their lives.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear what most parrot calls mean. But some parrots make signature sounds that declare who they are or what groups they belong to, Aplin says. If parrot talkativeness is indeed a driver of cognition, “that then begs the question, why do they need such complex communication, which then ties it back to their social systems,” she says.</p>



<p>Parrots live in large, cohesive groups. So having a good memory and enhanced intelligence may help the birds maintain relationships and strategically climb up the social ladder. Sulphur-crested cockatoos (<em>Cacatua galerita</em>), for instance, live in groups of hundreds of individuals yet maintain hierarchies that don’t seem to be based on physical characteristics. “The assumption is that they must be doing it based on memory, which is a big cognitive load,” Aplin says.</p>



<p>The possible connection between big brains and parrots’ social natures is a question that Aplin’s team is beginning to explore using MRIs of parrot brains. The goal, she says, is to identify how brain size as a whole — as well as regions particularly important in cognition — vary among species that differ in level of sociality.</p>



<p>In the case of songbirds, species with more complex vocal skills are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-complex-vocal-skills-problem-solvers">better at solving cognitive puzzles in the lab</a>, Jarvis and colleagues reported in September in <em>Science</em>. Jarvis, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, speculates that the same is probably true among parrots.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Birds with more complex vocal skills are better at problem-solving | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pI2-AfLzgJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">More than 200 birds from 23 species were given different cognitive tests to gauge their intelligence. One of the problem-solving tasks asked birds to pull a cork lid off a glass flask to access a tasty treat (bottom left). Comparing these tests with birds’ ability to learn songs and calls showed that the better vocal learners are also better at problem-solving.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Parrots and songbirds, as well as humans, have neural circuits involved in song and speech that evolved from nearby pathways that control body movements. Instead of controlling muscles that move wings or arms, the circuits are connected to sound-producing organs. Parrots have more sophisticated vocal communication skills than songbirds, thanks to an additional copy of this same circuit, Jarvis and colleagues reported in 2015. The extra dedicated brain space hints that vocally adept parrots may therefore be better problem solvers than songbirds. So far, Jarvis has only tested songbirds’ problem-solving skills.</p>



<p>Parrots’ dexterity in maneuvering objects with their feet <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05151-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also relate to the evolution of intelligence</a>, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez and colleagues reported in August in <em>Communications Biology</em>. “[Hand-eye coordination] is like a stepping stone into intelligence and higher cognitive ability,” he says.</p>



<p>Take primates. Monkeys and apes with better motor skills tend to have bigger brains, researchers reported in 2016. Finesse with handling objects as tools is key for accessing challenging food sources, like using sticks to crack open nuts or to pull ants out of anthills. Good motor skills, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez says, are also probably key for understanding an item’s physical properties, and big brains can mentally manipulate those objects.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Parrot intelligence in the wild</h4>



<p>How parrot intelligence plays out in the wild is mostly unknown. What scientists know about parrot smarts largely comes from captivity, where the absence of predators and the abundance of food might free up mental space, Pepperberg says.</p>



<p>Captive parrots are probably best viewed as what can be, not necessarily what always is. “We say humans are brilliant, and we point to Einstein, we point to Beethoven, we point to Picasso,” Pepperberg says. While the average human might struggle with calculus, musical theory or painting masterpieces, we still say <em>Homo sapiens</em> does great things.</p>



<p>It’s also possible that scientists are just missing the cognitive feats of wild parrots. It’s difficult to get wild parrot studies off the ground because the birds can fly away, and researchers can’t easily follow. (New Zealand’s kākāpō, the only flightless parrot, is the exception.) “Researching these highly mobile animals is a challenge in the wild,” says Rachael Shaw, a behavioral ecologist at Te Herenga Waka – Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Cognitive biologist Alice Auersperg of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and colleagues solved that problem by capturing wild Goffin’s cockatoos in Indonesia, placing them in a field-based aviary and then releasing them after studying how the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221011118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cockatoos make and use sets of wooden tools</a> to get seeds out of sea mangos.</p>



<p>Shaw and colleagues are working to improve another challenge of field studies — recognizing individual birds — by developing facial recognition software, which could also be useful in conservation. More than 100 parrot species are endangered or threatened because of habitat loss and the pet trade.</p>



<p>Studying parrot intelligence could help conservation efforts, Bastos says. A study from 2018 found that wild keas in New Zealand <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32363-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned to use sticks to tamper with egg-baited traps</a> intended for stoats — a relative of weasels that preys on keas. Some birds got stuck inside the boxes and died. Understanding the bird’s cognitive limits could lead to new, kea-proof trap designs.</p>



<p>Sometimes wild parrots aren’t in forests but in people’s yards. Across the Tasman Sea from New Zealand, in Sydney, sulphur-crested cockatoos can learn from one another <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoo-open-trash-cans">how to break into trash bins for food</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22, p. 10</em>). People retaliate with tricks of escalating difficulty to keep the birds out.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cockatoos raid trash bins in Sydney. People have come up with creative ways to deter the birds, with varying degrees of success.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These urban bird populations highlight the adaptability of parrots, Aplin says. Sydney has sprung up around cockatoos’ native habitat. “We can’t assume that cities are empty spaces where we only have to account for human wants and needs. We also have to be thinking about the animals that we’re supporting specifically in those cities.”</p>



<p>Some Goffin’s cockatoos escaped from the pet trade into urban settings in Singapore, where there is now a stable population. Seeing how the birds adapt in real time is “super exciting,” Rössler says. Scientists could learn how the new surroundings might spark new innovative behaviors. “That’s the evolution in the making.”</p>

<p>A Springer Nature journal <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/13204/articles">retracted 34 papers</a> earlier this month, including, ironically enough, one on how to detect fake news, which appeared in special guest-edited issues hacked by publication cheats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/handwriting-brain-connections-learning">Handwriting may boost brain connections more than typing does</a></h4>

              
                <p>Writing out the same word again and again in cursive may bring back bad memories for some, but handwriting can boost connectivity across brain regions, some of which are implicated in learning and memory, a new study shows.</p>



<p>When asked to handwrite words, college students showed increased connectivity across the brain, particularly in brain waves associated with memory formation, compared with when they typed those words instead, researchers report January 26 in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. The finding adds to growing evidence of handwriting’s benefits and could give fodder to laws that implement handwriting curricula, such as the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently enacted California law requiring the teaching of cursive</a> in grades 1 through 6.</p>



<p>The new study shows that “there is a fundamental difference in brain organization for handwriting as opposed to typing,” says Ramesh Balasubramaniam, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Merced who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Plenty of previous research has shown that handwriting improves <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-0663.82.1.159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spelling accuracy</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154193120905302218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory recall</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614524581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conceptual understanding</a>. Scientists think that the slow process of tracing out letters and words gives individuals more time to process the material and learn.</p>



<p>In the new study, psychologists Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel, both at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, recruited students from the university and stuck electrodes on their heads. The researchers asked the students to type out or handwrite in cursive with a digital pen a word that appeared on a computer screen. Sensors in a cap recorded electrical brain activity while participants carried out each task.</p>



<p>Then the scientists looked for coherence, which is when two brain areas are active with the same frequency of electrical waves at the same time. This parameter can reveal the strength of functional connectivity among different regions across the brain.</p>



<p>With handwriting, the researchers saw increased activity, specifically in low frequency bands called alpha and theta, not only in the expected motor areas due to the movement but also in others associated with learning. These low frequency bands have previously been shown to support memory processes. When the team compared the two tasks, they realized that handwriting — but not typing — increased the connectivity across parietal brain regions, which are involved in sensory and motor processing, and central ones, many of which are involved in memory. These findings suggest that there are distinct processes of brain activation happening while a person types or writes.</p>

<p>“Even when the movements are very similar, the activation seems much, much higher in handwriting,” Balasubramaniam says. “It shows that there&#8217;s more involvement of these brain regions when you’re handwriting, which might give you some specific advantages.”</p>



<p>The researchers posit that this boost of stimulation facilitates learning because these particular waves between these areas are implicated in <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30294-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory formation and encoding</a>.</p>



<p>Because the team did not test whether participants remembered the words, it’s not yet clear how exactly the increased activity impacts learning, says psychologist Kathleen Arnold of Radford University in Virginia. “[The study] warrants some follow up to see what exactly is causing those connectivity differences and whether or not they reflect learning outcomes.”</p>



<p>Balasubramaniam also notes that it’s possible the differences in brain activation are merely due to the unique movement required to type or write. “But that said, we&#8217;ve got to start somewhere, and these are the first results to actually show that these two things have different brain activation patterns.”</p>



<p>And although handwriting may help with learning processes, typing is often easier, faster and more practical. Students and teachers alike should therefore consider the task at hand to inform their decision to handwrite or type, van der Meer says. For example, using handwriting to take notes might help retain information better while typing out an essay may be easier.</p>



<p>Despite the need for more studies to determine the optimal learning strategy, experts say that handwriting shouldn’t be left behind in the digital age. “[Schools] need to bring in more writing into curriculum design,” Balasubramaniam says.</p>



<p>Van der Meer agrees. “[Writing is] so good for [young] brains, so we shouldn&#8217;t use [this generation] as guinea pigs to see how their brains end up without any handwriting,” she says. “And it&#8217;s important for them to be able to at least write a grocery list or a love letter. I really think that that is important for us humans.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-ends-mission">NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter officially ends its mission on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p>After nearly three years, NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter, the first spacecraft to undertake a powered flight on another world, has ended its mission. Officials at the agency confirmed on January 25 that the history-making quad-copter has sustained damage to one of its rotor blades and is no longer capable of flying.</p>



<p>&#8220;While we knew this day was inevitable, it doesn&#8217;t make it any easier,&#8221; said Lori Glaze, NASA&#8217;s planetary science division director, during a news conference on the status of the quad-copter.</p>



<p>Many on the Ingenuity team are already thinking back fondly on the mission&#8217;s many accomplishments. &#8220;[For] a helicopter that&#8217;s overperformed the way that this has, I don&#8217;t think you can really mourn it and be sad,&#8221; says Håvard Fjær Grip, the  mission&#8217;s chief pilot and an engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>



<p>Ingenuity — Ginny to its friends — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">hitched along with NASA’s car-sized rover Perseverance</a> as the rover landed on Mars in February 2021 (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). A few months later, the small helicopter spun its rotor blades, climbed into the thin Martian atmosphere, rose to a height of three meters, and took a picture of Perseverance during its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover">first test flight</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/21</em>).</p>

<p>The aerial robot vastly outperformed its initial expectations, which was to fly a handful of times over 30 days. The idea was to demonstrate flight was possible on Mars, and then ground itself. Ingenuity instead undertook a total of 72 flights, traveling 14 times farther than planned and logging more than two hours of total flight time. During its travels, the helicopter did far more than fly<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">: It became part of the science mission</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>). Ingenuity made 3-D elevation maps of its surroundings, went places that Perseverance couldn’t get to, and scouted potential sites for the rover’s scientific observations. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingenuity helped scientists discover that, unlike on Earth, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-two-sound-speeds-laser-helicopter">speed of sound in Mars’ atmosphere</a> depends on pitch, likely due to its carbon-dioxide rich nature (<em>SN: 4/11/22</em>). It also demonstrated the ability to autonomously choose landing sites, clean itself after dust storms, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-mars-nasa-flight-1-year-anniversary">snap tons of amazing photos of the Martian landscape</a>, often including its own shadow (<em>SN: 4/19/22</em>).</p>



<p>During the helicopter&#8217;s 70th flight in December near the rim of Jezero crater, the robot reached an area with sandy, mostly featureless terrain, posing a challenge for its autonomous navigation system, which uses features such as rocks to know where it is and how to get around. On its next journey, the helicopter ran out out of features to track and executed an emergency landing. &#8220;That&#8217;s when we realized that this is more challenging to navigate than we thought,&#8221; says Grip. The intent for its subsequent flight was to rise a bit in the air, hover over the terrain, and get a fix on its location. Unfortunately, things didn&#8217;t go as planned.</p>



<p>On January 19, NASA reported that <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1748883252604236281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ingenuity briefly lost communications</a> with the Perseverance rover as it was descending during its 72nd flight. While contact was soon restored, the small helicopter suffered damage from the fall that has permanently grounded it.</p>



<p>There was a moment of sadness when the team first received images that confirmed damage to the helicopter,  Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity&#8217;s project manager, said in the news briefing. &#8220;But that was very quickly replaced with happiness and pride and a feeling of celebration for what we&#8217;ve pulled off.&#8221;</p>

                <p>How did the ant steal the lion’s dinner? This isn’t the beginning of one of Aesop’s Fables. It’s the finding of a new study showing how the disruption of one tiny mutual relationship on the African savanna has big impacts on the food web — all the way to the lion’s den.</p>



<p>When big-headed ants (<em>Pheidole megacephala</em>) invade the savanna, they kill off native acacia ants (genus <em>Crematogaster</em>), robbing local whistling thorn trees of their valiant defenders against hungry elephants. Without ants to bite them, the elephants rip up the thorn trees, opening up the grassland, which makes it harder for lions to catch their preferred zebra meals. Lions end up hunting buffalo instead. The findings, published online January 25 in <em>Science</em>, show that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg1464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invasive species’ effects can be very indirect</a> — and suggest that changes in different low-level mutualisms might also echo up food webs in other ecosystems.</p>



<p>Over the past 15 years or so, wildlife ecologist Jake Goheen and his colleagues at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya, have been studying <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forget-mice-elephants-intimidated-ants" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forget-mice-elephants-intimidated-ants">how acacia ants protect whistling thorn trees</a> (<em>SN: 6/15/10</em>). When an elephant tries to eat the tree, “ants swarm up inside its nostrils and bite from the inside out,” Goheen says.</p>



<p>The scientists were also examining what the lions in the conservancy eat as part of a separate study. “One of the things that we found … was that lions are much more effective, they&#8217;re more successful with their hunts in areas where tree cover is high,” Goheen says.</p>



<p>But what happens when tree cover is suddenly low? To find out, Goheen and his colleagues collared six lionesses from the local prides to track their activity and kills. The team also set up experimental plots where big-headed ants had invaded, and where the native ants still held sway.</p>



<p>The big-headed ant arrived in the conservancy between 2002 and 2005, Goheen says. “We think it probably was imported on produce,” brought into the houses or tourist camps in the area. The invading insects kill local acacia ants wherever they find them. And other studies have shown that without defending ants, pachyderms tore down the thorn trees five to seven times more often.</p>

<p>In the new study, the scientists could have used drones or satellite images to study tree cover, but “we don’t have that kind of money,” Goheen says. Instead, the researchers tracked their collared lions, and then got down on hands and knees near the lions’ recent kills, using a range finder to measure the openness of the area. Areas with big-headed ants, the team showed, had 2.67 times higher visibility than areas without — meaning that lions could see farther, but so could their prey.</p>



<p>Lions relied on the cover of trees to pounce on hapless zebras nearby: Where visibility was low, the probability of a zebra kill was 62 percent. But when visibility was high, the lion’s chance of taking down a zebra dropped to only 22 percent.</p>



<p>Over the three years of the study, zebra dinners decreased from 67 percent to 42 percent of lion kills. But the lions didn’t go hungry. Instead, they went for beef. Buffalo kills increased from zero to 42 percent of kills over the study period. It’s a risky diet, Goheen says. Buffalo “are big and feisty,” and lions hunting buffalo are more likely to be injured.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study shows that “the disruption of a mutualism can have cascading effects on other species in the community,” says Emilio Bruna, a plant ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “Those effects can be unexpected and indirect.”</p>



<p>It’s a clue, Bruna says, that ecologists should be looking out for other pairs like the acacia ant and the thorn tree, where a single special relationship is a foundation for an ecosystem and a single anthill could cause a savanna-wide shift in who is eating who.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/organisation-in-your-phd">Organisation in Your PhD</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Rachel McKeown shares her learned experience of the importance of organisation and timekeeping, whilst completing a PhD, and how to ensure you maintain a good work/life balance.</strong></p>
<blockquote>No two people, or two PhDs, are the same...</blockquote>
<p>When thinking about the skills required to take on a PhD, there are a lot of buzzwords that crop up over and over. Determination, teamwork and critical thinking are common themes you’ll encounter in any major project. </p>

<p>One of the most valuable assets for any PhD candidate, that might not come to mind so quickly, is the ability to organise. This doesn’t just refer to the planning of your project, but also planning how to ensure that you remain in the best frame of mind throughout. When I was an undergraduate student, I had a strong grasp on the former, but a much more tenuous sense of the latter. I had a handle on how to keep track of multiple overlapping deadlines, churning out essays never a day late, but the toll the course took on me was far greater. I couldn’t engage my mental ‘brake’. On starting my postgraduate studies, I was resolute that I would extend my organisational capacity, finding ways to build my own defences as I set out to face my greatest academic battle thus far. Here are a few lessons I have picked up along the way related to organising my work, and my life around it.</p>

<p><strong><u>Control your calendar</u></strong></p>

<p>The day-to-day life of a PhD student often differs significantly to the undergraduate lifestyle, with the independence and freedom allowing you to break free of the rigidity of a structured course. There are a few fixtures that can’t be shuffled, such as weekly lab group meetings but, by and large, your time is yours to arrange. This can be a little overwhelming to anyone who is used to living life according to a timetable. However, flexibility is your friend, if you’re willing to embrace it. </p>

<p>Without a one-size-fits-all workday, find a schedule that best matches your rhythm. Are you perkiest in the early hours, or a denizen of the night? Personally, I’m the type who likes to get the hands-on lab tasks out of the way first, pushing admin and desk tasks to later in the afternoon to give me time to reflect with a freshly brewed mug of tea. Some of my lab mates prefer to meander into work a little later in the day and let the coffee machine work its magic, before slowly ramping up their productivity throughout the day. We all get our work done in the way that suits us.</p>
<blockquote>Are you perkiest in the early hours, or a denizen of the night?</blockquote>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shift your general patterns around either. I’m certainly guilty of trying to turn a blind eye to the impact of the changing seasons. In the summer I can rise well before 7AM, head out for a run and still make it to the lab before 9AM. Writing this piece in January, I already dread the call of tomorrow’s pre-dawn alarm, knowing the energetic barrier I will face to leave my duvet and brace for the predicted sub-zero journey to work. When the sun rises after I do, the weariness permeates throughout the day. Interestingly, one day this week, an alarm-setting mishap turned out to be a blessing in disguise as, waking up naturally an hour later to sunlight trickling through my curtains, I went about my day with a little extra spring in my step. I was more alert, more focused and far more productive. I’ll be making a note of this to battle the winter blues. </p>

<p><strong><u>Keep on track</u></strong></p>

<p>I may be doing a PhD in neuroscience, but sadly I am far from unlocking any memory-related superpowers. With a relentless barrage of tasks, from setting up an experiment, preparing for a meeting or replying to an all-important email, it is all too easy for a few to slip by uncompleted. This isn’t so bad when the job is trivial, but a crucial deadline sneaking up on you is much more unpleasant and is best avoided. </p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_0a6c1796f9d84d208e6fe162a9649b4e~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_262,h_405,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>The way I try to get around this is based on an old adage my mum used to say – if you need to remember something, write it down. The written word is far less fickle than my memory. In today’s technocentric society, there are many digital tools out there that will get the job done, but as an Apple convert, the in-built Reminders app is my daily lifesaver. I use it to log anything and everything that I need to get done, neatly partitioned into sections for PhD work, general life and University societies I’m involved with, in particular the running of Bluesci, the University of Cambridge science communications platform. The seamless synchronisation between my laptop, phone and watch means I’m never far away from checking my uncompleted tasks. I’m trying to get into the habit of inputting tasks as soon as they pop into my mind – as soon as I accepted writing this piece, it went straight into 				      <em>Reminders.</em></p>
<p>Reminders, along with a handy alert for a week’s time to make sure I had a first draft in place. Though, tying my work responsibilities to my everyday tech does run the risk of struggling to disengage and fully relax, which I’ll come to shortly.</p>
<blockquote>The written word is far less fickle than my memory.</blockquote>
<p>For setting daily goals, I take a more traditional approach and instead rely on my trusty notebook. At the start of each day, I take a few moments to write a list of everything that I want to accomplish by the time I come to winding down. Let me tell you, the satisfaction that comes from seeing a full set of ticks at the end of the day is a real motivational boost, like receiving a shiny gold star from a teacher when you were little. Rather than pushing myself to complete a task, I feel the pull of this self-imposed incentive. This has worked wonders for my short-term productivity as I give myself a real-time pat on the back.</p>

<p><strong><u>Balancing act</u></strong></p>

<p>PhDs are notorious for consuming your time in ways you don’t initially expect. This is sometimes part of the package you sign up for, and the sense of reward from looking at the horde of precious data you’ve just acquired more than makes up for it. However, I’ve found more insidious ways that work has tried to extend into other aspects of my life. In the early days, I found myself trawling through (likely unimportant) papers late into the night, just for the sake of feeling productive, when I should have been resting. Sapping my energy like this wasn’t sensible as I pushed myself too hard without need, bringing myself dangerously close to the burnout I so wanted to leave behind. </p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_e05111d76f4e4d4fa64396950c6c81f6~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_393,h_723,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>I have developed a curated calendar system, again using Apple Calendar as a personal choice, where I enter all of my work commitments colour-coded in red. These could be practical lab experiments, or desk-based work, such as writing up experimental notes, preparing a presentation and analysing data. This lets me plan a few days into the future, or sometimes even weeks, so that my project keeps its momentum. If something takes more time than I initially budgeted for, then I update the calendar retrospectively for the increased working hours and may use this to set aside a little extra time for myself on other, less demanding days. For example, on days I prepare hydrogel substrates for neuron culture, I’m typically working constantly in the lab for an extra two to three hours, so ending my work day an hour earlier later in the week, to catch the last of the winter daylight, doesn’t incur quite so much guilt as it used to in my undergraduate days. </p>
<p>								                   <em>Midweek calendar – work by day and relax by  </em>The red blocks need a healthy counterweight in 			          <em>evening.</em></p>
<p>the form of green blocks, representing my social and recreational activities. Recurring ones include gym sessions, quiz nights with my friends or simply taking a walk along the river to the tune of my latest favourite podcast - sometimes to expand my scientific scope (e.g. <em>New Scientist Weekly)</em>, or sometimes to completely depart from it to broaden my interests (I’m currently flitting through the centuries by listening to <em>The Rest is History</em>). When the red and the green are in harmony, my routine is much more sustainable and burnout is kept at bay. Seeing my week ahead in full colour-coded glory has both aesthetic appeal and practical benefit.</p>

<p>There also must be time set aside for a complete detox. When the holiday season hits, rest and recuperation become the priority. In a mastery of self-kindness, give yourself the gift of completely tuning your mind out of experimental mode – those projects will still be waiting upon your return, and you’ll be more refreshed to take them on. You might even be able to see a problem in a new light or pick up on a small, but crucial, detail that previously remained under the radar. I’m writing this having just returned from Christmas break, where I fully immersed myself in quality family time and tackling the seemingly never-ending stack of unread novels I’ve been meaning to get to. Any emails that cropped up during this time were syphoned off into the Reminders app for the first day back. </p>

<p><strong><u>Master your toolset</u></strong></p>

<p>No two people, or two PhDs, are the same, so what works for one person may not work for another. This is why it’s important to take the time to play around with organisational approaches and find a system that’s fine-tuned to the way you work. It takes a little effort and a little self-experimentation, but harnessing this skill in your PhD toolkit is one you will be grateful for further down the line. As the thesis write-up dawns upon me, it’s time to engage my own organisational toolset to face it. But first, it’s time to put a big red tick next to ‘Complete first draft of blog’…</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quasicrystal-einstein-tile-hat-shape">A predicted quasicrystal is based on the ‘einstein’ tile known as the hat</a></h4>

              
                <p>The “hat” wowed mathematicians. Now the shape is shaking up physics.</p>



<p>In 2023, mathematicians reported that the 13-sided tile was the first known “einstein.” That’s a shape that can perfectly cover an infinite plane — no gaps or overlaps — but can do so only <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">without a repeating pattern</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/23</em>).</p>



<p>Now, scientists have predicted the properties for a two-dimensional material based on the hat. It’s a quasicrystal, a material that is orderly like a crystal, but in which the arrangements of atoms don’t repeat. Intriguingly, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/33074Yb3Ufa1478fd33b049723e53c7a8d73f77b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hat-based material shares properties with graphene</a>, a crystalline material, the researchers report in a paper to appear in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s got lots of properties that we associate with quasicrystals, but then it acts strangely like crystals,” says physicist Sinéad Griffin of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the research. “It’s a really fun study.”</p>



<p>Previously, mathematicians needed more than one shape to cover an infinite plane in this nonrepeating way, known as an aperiodic tiling. Some earlier aperiodic tilings have connections to real-world materials. Penrose tilings, based on sets of two tiles discovered in the 1970s by mathematician Roger Penrose, look like a 2-D slice through a quasicrystal. Such quasicrystals have been found in meteorites and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">atomic bomb test debris</a>, in addition to being made in the lab (<em>SN: 5/17/21</em>).</p>



<p>So scientists wanted to know what a material based on the hat tiling might be like. Physicist Adolfo Grushin and colleagues calculated the properties of electrons in a 2-D material in which atoms sit at the hats’ vertices.</p>



<p>To characterize a material, scientists can look at the relationship between the energies of its electrons and their wavelengths. (According to quantum physics, electrons travel through materials as waves; the wavelength denotes the size of those waves.) In this energy–wavelength relationship, the researchers found striking similarities between the hat quasicrystal and graphene, a 2-D crystal of carbon.</p>



<p>That’s because many of the vertices of the hat tiling fall along a hexagonal grid like that of graphene, says Grushin, of Institut Néel of CNRS in Grenoble, France.</p>



<p>The fact that the hat tiling is made up of a single tile shape, rather than multiple shapes, also helps explain how it straddles the worlds of crystals and quasicrystals. The use of a single tile means it’s closer to being periodic than other aperiodic tilings, without actually repeating.</p>



<p>Unlike graphene, however, the hat material is chiral, which means that the electrons would behave differently if you were to flip the material as if reflected in a mirror. In a real material, that chiral property might affect how light interacts with the substance, for example, by rotating the light’s polarization, the orientation of its electromagnetic waves.</p>



<p>More interesting features popped up when the researchers investigated what would happen if the material were placed in a magnetic field. In the hat tiling, a fraction of the hat tiles are mirror images of the others. Electrons, specifically those with zero energy, became trapped around the flipped hats at certain values of magnetic field. “We found it quite beautiful that this happens,” Grushin says.</p>



<p>Although the material is entirely theoretical for now, the researchers proposed some ways that the material could be brought to reality. For example, scientists could manually place molecules on a surface in a pattern matching the hat tiling. That would be the ultimate hat trick.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-outbreak-influenza-panzootic-galapagos">A bird flu outbreak is sweeping the globe. Its long-term effects are unclear</a></h4>

              
                <p>As I step among poop-covered rocks toward the plateau of a small island in the Galápagos, a part of me rejoices. Not only am I about to see the archipelago’s famed blue-footed boobies for the first time, but the sight of guano everywhere, and birds to make fresh batches, serves as a reminder: The ongoing avian influenza outbreak has not yet ravaged this picturesque place.</p>



<p>Ghostly, leafless Palo Santo trees and saltbushes sprinkle the island, surrounded by boulders in varying shades of red-tinged black and brown. White splotches of guano splattered on rocks are hard to miss against this arid landscape on North Seymour Island in November, the tail end of the dry season. The poop’s sources are similarly difficult to overlook.</p>



<p>The island is known for hosting a large colony of magnificent frigatebirds (<em>Fregata magnificens</em>), some of which hang suspended in the air above tourists’ heads as we disembark from a dinghy and scramble up the rocky path. As I admire the birds’ fabulous red throat sacs — which males inflate like balloons to attract females — I hope that none deposit excrement on my head.</p>

<p>A short walk along a dusty trail brings us to, in my opinion, the stars of the show, blue-footed boobies (<em>Sula nebouxii)</em>. The dopey looking birds show no sign of fear even as we cluster around their nests eagerly snapping photos.</p>



<p>That I had the chance to visit these birds on North Seymour at all — amid all their poop — was a relief after traveling more than 5,000 kilometers for a vacation in Galápagos National Park. Just two months before, at the end of September, news broke that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/deadly-avian-flu-reaches-galapagos-islands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deadly avian influenza had reached the archipelago</a>.</p>



<p>The virus’ presence posed a grave threat. The islands are home to birds like the Galápagos penguin that are found nowhere else in the world. National park and government officials closed some islands to tourists to protect endemic seabirds — an understandable tactic that left me selfishly thinking about the possibility of not getting to see iconic birds up close. To track the virus, “we have eyes watching the whole archipelago,” wildlife veterinarian Gustavo Jiménez-Uzcátegui of the Charles Darwin Foundation told <em>Science </em>in September.</p>



<p>The concern is warranted. Outside the Galápagos, the global bird flu panzootic has been destructive. (Panzootics are the animal equivalent of human pandemics.) It’s unclear why the archipelago has so far escaped the worst of avian influenza, Jiménez-Uzcátegui told me when we met in the island town of Puerto Ayora. Also unknown are the effects the outbreak could permanently imprint on bird populations and the ecosystems that they’re a part of around the globe.</p>



<p>“Most people have no idea that we are in the middle of a wildlife emergency, an animal pandemic, and that this may be the nail in the coffin for some species,” says Michelle Wille a viral ecologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, who studies avian influenza. “It’s very concerning.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bird flu has killed millions of animals</h4>



<p>While the viral variant behind the outbreak <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06631-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerged in Europe in 2020</a>, the outbreak itself didn’t take off until late 2021. Since then, avian flu has likely killed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">millions of wild birds</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). In Peru, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320723003737" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of thousands of wild birds</a> have died. Places like <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/12/23-0330_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.05.574233v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> have documented tens of thousands of deaths. In the United States, roughly 9,000 wild birds have <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-wild-birds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested positive for avian flu</a>, some of which were reported after being killed by hunters.</p>



<p>In October, bird flu <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/first-confirmed-cases-of-avian-influenza-in-the-antarctic-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived in the Antarctic region for the first time</a> when unexplained mortality of brown skuas on Bird Island was pinned on the virus.</p>



<p>But birds aren’t the only animals in the flu’s crosshairs. “If you can imagine thousands of dead birds, you can imagine how this is an ‘all day buffet’ for scavengers,” Wille says. Avian predators all over the world, including bears and foxes, have tested positive. Marine mammals such as seals and sea lions that swim with or eat infected birds have experienced mass die-offs. In the Arctic, a polar bear died in October after contracting the virus. And on January 11, researchers confirmed that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/bird-flu-found-mammals-near-antarctica-first-time-scientists-say-2024-01-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elephant and fur seals in South Georgia</a>, a sub-Antarctic island, had been infected.</p>



<p>By the time of my trip in mid-November, fears of birds dying en masse in the Galápagos hadn’t yet come to fruition. To date, there have been just 34 confirmed flu infections in red- and blue-footed boobies, Nazca boobies, frigatebirds and tropicbirds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Thirty-four birds have tested positive since the virus was first detected in September.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135311">Galápagos National Park Directorate</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That the global outbreak is happening at all is a chapter in a predictable story, says Nichola Hill, a disease ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. And the virus’s incursion into some mammals is “absolutely on track with being the worst-case scenario you could have imagined for this.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The flu’s long-term effects remain unclear</h4>



<p>Researchers have long understood that avian influenza viruses — which normally cause mild disease in waterfowl like ducks — can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-flu-flies-coop">turn deadly after spreading and evolving</a> on poultry farms (<em>SN: 9/2/05</em>). Close relatives of the virus responsible for the ongoing panzootic have been “simmering away” in Eurasia for more than a decade, Hill says. “And now in the last three years, it’s had major consequences for wildlife.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, researchers are focused on documenting the sheer scale of avian and mammalian deaths. “We will probably not know the true extent of this for years to come,” Wille says. The ripple effects on ecosystems will likewise take years to unravel.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Death rates vary among bird species. Waterfowl such as ducks are key spreaders of bird flu and have at least some built-in protection from the virus. Because their immune systems have coevolved with influenza viruses, the animals have a “head-start on immunity” compared to other animals, Hill says. Meanwhile, birds like bald eagles and red-tailed hawks that don’t have such a long history with influenza are “just getting hit really hard.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That disparity has Hill wondering how long it might take for infections to become less deadly, as wild birds develop immunity against the virus. Her lab aims to explore how birds’ immune systems have coevolved with avian flu, including which parts of the immune response are crucial for preventing the virus from running rampant and causing death in some species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of now, Wille says, there are no signs that the panzootic is slowing down. But there are glimmers of hope.</p>



<p>In October, researchers announced <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-condors-vaccine-avian-influenza-65e27a0751666eee0e3ab3b82ae18251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some early results from a bird flu vaccine trial</a> in California condors. After 10 birds had received two doses of the vaccine, six of them had antibody levels high enough to provide at least partial protection against death. “If it works, it demonstrates that we may be able to limit the impact on highly endangered species,” Wille says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Climate may be protecting the Galápagos</h4>



<p>Why avian flu has been less “aggressive” in the Galápagos compared with most everywhere else — and whether it will stay that way — remains a big question, Jiménez-Uzcátegui says. But he has one intriguing hypothesis.</p>



<p>“The unique difference from the other parts [of South America], like Peru, Ecuador,” he says, “is the habitat.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline3.jpg?resize=680%2C510&#038;ssl=1" alt="A small, rocky island covered in dry vegetation, including tall cacti and crystal blue water" class="wp-image-3135312" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline3.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline3.jpg?resize=511%2C383&amp;ssl=1 511w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline3.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline3.jpg?resize=248%2C186&amp;ssl=1 248w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline3.jpg?resize=263%2C197&amp;ssl=1 263w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01224_eg_bird_flu_inline3.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3135312">November is the tail end of the dry season in the Galápagos, so landscapes lack lush greenery.

<p>Flu in both people and birds <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-easier-catch-cold-flu-covid-winter">tends to largely be a cold-season disease</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/23</em>). Last year, El Niño <a href="https://www.weather.gov/news/230706-ElNino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived in the Galápagos</a>, bringing warmer than average waters to the islands’ part of the Pacific Ocean. Normally, the climate pattern reduces the marine food supply, affecting many of the animals that swim in the waters around the islands. The more moderate temperatures may have also made it harder for avian flu to spread, Jiménez-Uzcátegui says.</p>



<p>Piecing together the relationship between the local climate and influenza infections could help determine if Jiménez-Uzcátegui’s hunch is correct. He and his team also hope to examine the immune systems and genetics of birds that call the archipelago home. For now, though, researchers and officials continue to keep an eye out for influenza on the islands.</p>



<p>On the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s easy to center humans in worries about infectious diseases, especially because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/epidemics-infectious-disease-influenza-covid-pandemic">influenza outbreaks can be devastating</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/21</em>). But my visit to Galápagos National Park — a truly special place for nature lovers — underscored that wild birds around the globe are enduring the worst flu outbreak yet. And despite small signs of hope in these iconic islands, the virus’s impacts could reverberate for years to come.</p>

<p>A journal quietly retracted two papers after a six-month Retraction Watch investigation linked them, and two of the journal’s editors, to the Indian paper mill iTrilon.</p>



<p>Based in Chennai, iTrilon hawks authorship of “readymade” publications to scientists “struggling to write and publish papers in PubMed and Scopus-Indexed Journals.” The company, whose website disappeared following <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">our exposé</a> in <em>Science</em>, claims to have connections at journals that allow it to guarantee acceptance of many of its papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two retracted papers – “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Beniwal-et-al.-2023.pdf">Evaluation of the neuroprotective activity of citral nanoemulsion on Alzheimer’s disease-type dementia in a preclinical model: The assessment of cognitive and neurobiochemical responses</a>” and “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lorenzo-et-al-2023-quercetin.pdf">Therapeutic effects of quercetin-loaded phytosome nanoparticles in a preclinical model of Parkinson&#8217;s disease: The modulation by antioxidant pathways and BDNF expression</a>” – had both been put up for sale by iTrilon before they appeared last year in the non-indexed journal <a href="https://lifeneuro.de/"><em>Life Neuroscience</em></a>. </p>



<p>We published the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-1.jpg">matching</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_Quercetin-Neuro-Life.jpg">ads</a> last week in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/18/exclusive-paper-mill-articles-buoyed-spanish-deans-research-output/">a companion piece</a> to the <em>Science</em> article that linked a professor and dean at a university in Spain to several iTrilon papers. The dean, <a href="https://archive.fo/G1bac">Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas</a> of Universidad Fernando Pessoa-Canarias, in Las Palmas, acknowledged paying the paper mill, but said he thought the money was meant to cover article-processing charges. He has since taken down <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/dionisio-lorenzo-lorenzo-villegas-9562463a">his LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>



<span id="more-128640"></span>



<p>The editor-in-chief of <em>Life Neuroscience</em>, Nasrollah Moradikor of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231016053222/https:/georgianeuroscience.com/nasrollah-moradikor/">International Center for Neuroscience Research</a>, in Tbilisi, Georgia, confirmed the journal had pulled Lorenzo’s two papers, although it has not issued retraction notices.</p>



<p>“Today, I asked our managing editor and told them about Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas, his article retracted from our journal website [sic],” Moradikor wrote in a January 22 email to Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>But as we reported in <em>Science</em>, Moradikor was the corresponding author of the paper about Alzheimer’s disease, which was touted by iTrilon after being accepted by the journal and just two weeks before publication. As such, he should have known about author additions.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ad_citral-Neuro-Life_Screenshot_20230706-2.jpg">a WhatsApp exchange</a> about the paper, iTrilon’s scientific director,<a href="https://archive.fo/F0Iww"> Sarath Ranganathan</a>, described it as “a collaborative research carried out at Georgia [sic]. Authors from any country are allowed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moradikor, who stopped answering emails in October after we told him we were interested in discussing “your work as an editor and your connection with iTrilon,” now denies any links with the paper mill.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m shocked, that you mentioned me and Dr. Indranath Chatterjee [a coauthor on the Alzheimer’s paper] on this News,” he wrote in his email. “We don&#8217;t have any relation with Itrilon and Dionisio Lorenzo Lorenzo Villegas in Spain.”</p>



<p>But last autumn, Chatterjee gave<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Seminar-chatterjee-moradikor-itrilon.jpg"> a talk</a> on scientific publishing organized by iTrilon and the International Center for Neuroscience Research, as we reported in <em>Science</em>. And in an October interview, Chatterjee, who is also an editor at <em>Life Neuroscience</em>, said Lorenzo had been involved in the work for the Alzheimer’s paper “mostly like for the supervising and also kind of reviewing and like checking the paper and the manuscript are properly written or not.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked how he had met Lorenzo, Chatterjee said, “Actually, like, you know, it was in connection with the International Center for Neuroscience, not with me.”</p>

Could cats be the solution? At the same time, many humane societies have more cats to rehome than they can manage. Could lonely older adults be the solution?</p><p>Researchers at the University of Georgia and Brenau University developed a novel program where older adults were paired with a foster cat coming from a local humane society, with the opportunity to adopt. A Human-Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI)-funded feasibility study explored the impact of this program on the older adult participants and the cats. Researchers explored how fostering a shelter cat could impact loneliness and well-being in older adults living alone. They also wanted to learn if these older adults would be more likely to adopt their foster cat after common barriers, such as pet deposit fees, were paid by the study. Could it really be a win-win situation?</p><p>The study enrolled adults aged 60 and older living alone and without any pets. Participants completed health surveys before placement with cats and completed follow-up surveys at 1-month and 4-months post-placement. Participants could choose to adopt their foster cat any time between 1- and 4-months post-placement. If participants chose to adopt their foster cat, the study paid the adoption fee, and a 12-month post-placement survey was completed.</p><p>Findings from the study revealed that loneliness scores significantly decreased at the 4-month mark after the cat fostering began. A similar 4-month improvement that approached statistical significance was observed for mental health. However, at the 12-month follow-up, loneliness scores were no longer statistically significant. The researchers suggest that these one-year reports were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a substantial proportion of older adults experiencing elevated levels of loneliness.&nbsp;</p><h2>Alexis Winger and Ambi</h2><p>Alexis states that before she got Ambi, “<em>I lived alone, and the loneliness was becoming oppressive. Ambi has brought an end to oppressive loneliness. There are still times when I am away from people too long, when I have no one to talk to and lonelines settles in, but then Ambi settles into my lap or just runs through the room, and I am not alone.

Dr. Sherry Sanderson, the team lead and Associate Professor at the University of Georgia’s College of Veterinary Medicine, noted: “Our results show that by removing some perceived barriers to pet ownership, including pet deposit fees, pet adoption fees, pet care supplies and veterinary support, we can not only help older adults live healthier, happier lives but we can also encourage the fostering and adoption of shelter cats into loving homes”.</p><p>Dr. Kerstin Emerson, a Gerontologist in the College of Public Health’s Institute of Gerontology, Health Policy &amp; Management at the University of Georgia, and an investigator from the study states, “In May of 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General stated that loneliness and isolation is an epidemic in this country, and their report placed an emphasis on the urgent need for a cure.” Dr. Don Scott, a Geriatrician and Campus Director of Geriatrics and Palliative Care from the Augusta University-University of Georgia Medical Partnership and also a researcher from the study, added, “The ill effects of loneliness and social isolation, particularly for older adults, are well-documented, and more strategies are needed to improve health outcomes for this population.” The investigators from this study plan to do a larger scale study. The hope is when an older adult seeks to prevent or ward off loneliness and isolation, they will collaborate with a support team prepared to explore feline companionship as part of an individualized holistic approach to care, and there will be programs in place and funding available to support this new approach to treating loneliness in older adults.</p><h2>Judith Atkins and Bashi</h2><p>Judith is semi-retired from nursing, but she still provides nursing care to some of the residents in the Senior Living Residence that she lives in. When recently asked what Bashi means to her, Judith sent back the following reply:</p><p>“He (Bashi) has been a comfort to two of my neighbors. While providing nursing care to a resident who was in hospice care, Bashi stayed with her until she died. I also took him to visit a resident with cancer and breathing problems when I went to visit. I also took Bashi to the nursing home to visit two people I took care of there.”</p><p>Judith went on to say, “He still enjoys catching balls and batting them into the hall closet, continues to steal straws from my drinks and claims all boxes. Best of all, he still likes my left shoulder to put his head on to make sure his world is okay. At night at times, I find him asleep on a pillow by my head. His love of people is unlimited, and he will try and go in any apartment with the door open to be loved on by strangers. He escapes into the hall to force me to exercise chasing him, and needless to say he is always the winner.”</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-design-5.jpg" /></figure></div><blockquote><div><p>Judith was ready to enroll in the study just days before the Pandemic occurred, and the Foster Cat Study was shut down for six months.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aquifers-losing-water-climate-change-overuse">Many but not all of the world’s aquifers are losing water</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world’s precious stash of subterranean freshwater is shrinking — and in nearly a third of aquifers, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06879-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that loss has been speeding up in the last couple of decades</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 25 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>A one-two punch of unsustainable groundwater withdrawals and changing climate has been causing global water levels to fall on average, leading to water shortages, slumping land surfaces and seawater intrusion into aquifers. The new study suggests that groundwater decline has accelerated in many places since 2000, but also suggests that these losses can be reversible with better water management.</p>



<p>It’s the first effort to synthesize global-scale groundwater data collected on site, rather than assessed by satellite. Previous studies have quantified the scope of global groundwater loss by analyzing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-earths-groundwater-basins-run-deficits">data collected by a pair of NASA satellites known as GRACE</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/15</em>). But while satellites can scan the entire globe, some of the nuance of water loss — and recovery — in regional aquifers can be hard to detect from space, the researchers say.</p>



<p>To assess how groundwater is changing in aquifers, hydrologist Scott Jasechko of the University of California, Santa Barbara and colleagues analyzed water level data collected since 1980 in about 170,000 monitoring wells around the globe. Those wells offer glimpses into the state of almost 1,700 of the world’s largest aquifer systems.</p>



<p>Using the well data, the team identified where groundwater loss was most quickly accelerating. In 12 percent of the aquifers the team studied, water levels are now dropping by more than half a meter per year. And in 36 percent of the aquifer systems, the water level is dropping by a tenth of a meter per year. The fastest declines were detected in some of the world’s most arid regions, including central Chile, Iran and the western United States.</p>

<p>But there are signs of hope, the researchers say. In some areas, groundwater levels have begun to climb in the last two decades, even after shrinking at the end of the 20th century. Those recoveries are probably due to changes in regional water management. Groundwater losses from an aquifer in Thailand’s Bangkok basin, for example, reversed this century thanks to regulatory measures that include charging fees on groundwater pumping and licensing wells. The Abbas-e Sharghi basin of Iran, meanwhile, is now recovering after water was diverted to the basin from a large dam in the west of the country.</p>



<p>These reversals suggest that “long-term groundwater losses are neither universal nor inevitable,” the team says.</p>



<p>The results are also important for understanding discrepancies between GRACE data and local observations of groundwater levels, which have long been a thorn in the side of water management, says environmental scientist Li Xu, who was not involved in the study. Studies like this can be a big help in identifying where and why those discrepancies occur, he says, and “will definitely contribute to creating a global baseline for sustainable groundwater management.”</p>



<p>By identifying hot spots that need the most urgent attention, this work also helps highlight which parts of the world are most at risk of involuntary human migration due to water shortages, says Xu, of the University of Saskatchewan’s Global Institute for Water Security in Saskatoon, Canada. “Water is the key trigger for human migration or displacement worldwide, and those populations in low- and middle-income countries and in dry regions are most vulnerable.” Identifying those regions most at risk could lead to timely policy interventions, he says, “especially cross-border [aquifers] that could further increase the risk of armed conflicts.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lawn-sprinklers-suck-water-physics">What happens when lawn sprinklers suck in water? Physicists answer that quirky question</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physicists are fascinated with heady puzzles, from the nature of space and time to how the universe came to be. But spinning lawn sprinklers? Yes, that too.</p>



<p>A new experiment provides an answer to a quirky physics quandary popularized by physicist Richard Feynman in the 1980s. The puzzle centers on a style of sprinkler that works by squirting water out the ends of an S-shaped tube. The sprinkler spins away from the escaping water due to conservation of angular momentum. That much is straightforward.</p>



<p>But what happens if you stick the sprinkler in a tank of water and have it suck the water in? The question seems simple. But complex fluid flows and subtleties of momentum conservation have led different physicists to argue that it should either spin in the opposite direction as it does when operated normally, or not move at all. Different experiments likewise clashed.</p>



<p>So applied mathematician Leif Ristroph and colleagues gave it a whirl. “It ended up being one of the hardest problems our lab has ever worked on,” says Ristroph, of New York University. The team performed experiments with a painstakingly crafted transparent sprinkler, alongside mathematical calculations that backed up their measurements. The device floats in a tank of water to reduce friction, an effect that confounded earlier experiments. When run in reverse, the sprinkler <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/bd07eYb2Ma914376272d01f749b26c02e305d7e13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indeed spins the opposite </a>way, the researchers report in a paper accepted to <em>Physical Review Letters.</em> Further experimentation revealed why.</p>



<p>Whereas the normal sprinkler spews jets of water outward, in the reverse operation, jets form within the sprinkler itself. These jets stir up vortices, observed using lasers to illuminate microparticles added to the water. Importantly, the jets and their vortices aren’t symmetrical. When the jets collide in the sprinkler’s middle, they continue at an angle, suggesting they made a glancing collision, rather than hitting head-on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This high-speed video shows fluid moving inside a sprinkler as it sucks in water (made visible by laser-illuminated microparticles). As the water enters the sprinkler, two jets form and collide at glancing angles, forming four asymmetric vortices. In this part of the study, the sprinkler was fixed in place, rather than being allowed to rotate. But when released, the jets’ momentum sends the sprinkler spinning in the opposite direction of a normal sprinkler that spews water out, solving a longstanding physics puzzle.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s because, even though the arms of the sprinkler are perfectly aligned, the internal jets aren’t. The trip through the curved arms displaces the flow of water in each jet. That asymmetry sets the sprinkler rotating backward to conserve angular momentum.</p>



<p>The sprinkler puzzle’s solution just demanded a spritz of insight.</p>

<p>The journal a publication ethics watchdog threatened with sanctions for taking years to retract articles will pull four more related papers, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last July, the Committee for Publication Ethics (COPE) sent a warning letter to Elsevier regarding 10 papers by Yoshihiro Sato and Jun Iwamoto, who hold positions four and six on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a> of retractions, that the publisher had said it would retract three and a half years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/10/exclusive-cope-threatens-elsevier-journal-with-sanctions-for-clear-breakdown-before-seven-retractions/">reported previously</a>, seven of the papers were retracted from <em>Journal of the Neurological Sciences</em> in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following our reporting on COPE’s letter to Elsevier, the publisher has decided to retract the remaining three articles, plus a letter regarding one of the retracted papers, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. </p>



<span id="more-128635"></span>



<p>Andrew Grey, a professor at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who first contacted the <em>Journal of Neurological Sciences</em> about concerns with Sato’s papers in 2017, told us the move is “a good outcome for publication integrity, albeit long overdue. I am sure we will never know what happened to cause the absurd delay.”</p>



<p>Elsevier has not responded to repeated requests since January 12 for comment about these four upcoming retractions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/20/the-notices-are-utterly-unhelpful-a-look-at-how-journals-have-handled-allegations-about-hundreds-of-papers/">work of Grey and colleagues</a> Alison Avenell and Mark Bolland to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/09/analysis-casts-doubt-on-bone-researchers-body-of-work/">expose problems</a> in Sato’s research has led to more than 120 retractions, but in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2023.2295996">recent analysis</a> they found publishers have yet to assess nearly a third of the papers about which they have raised concerns. Yesterday, Science published a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/whistleblowers-flagged-300-scientific-papers-for-retraction-many-journals-ghosted-them">detailed report</a> on the saga to date. “Retractions come slowly—often years after complaints arise, if at all—in part because journals may defer to institutional investigations, which can be slow, unreliable, or absent,” Science noted. “Journals’ decisions also lack transparency.”</p>



<p>In June 2020, after Elsevier hadn’t acted on his concerns and Grey sought help from COPE, the publisher said it would retract the 10 papers he had flagged. When it still <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/23/an-elsevier-journal-said-it-would-retract-10-papers-two-years-ago-it-still-hasnt/">hadn’t years later</a>, and had apparently stopped responding to COPE’s inquiries, the organization sent Elsevier a warning letter stating that the journal’s behavior was “inconsistent with the standards that we expect from COPE members.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher subsequently retracted seven of the articles, but in a January 12, 2024 email seen by Retraction Watch, Mihail Grecea, a senior expert in publishing ethics at Elsevier, wrote that COPE’s letter hadn’t included “a detailed enough ‘Summary of concern’ which would grant for retraction” of three of the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grey informed Grecea that Kurume University had recommended retracting one of them for authorship misconduct, and the other two articles shared coauthors with that paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“More broadly, 119 of Dr Sato’s publications have now been retracted,” Grey wrote. “Why should readers have any confidence that any of his remaining publications are reliable? In the absence of robust evidence of reliability, they should all be retracted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He requested Elsevier also retract a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022510X98003116">letter</a>, “Reply to Davie and Sharp: different mechanisms of bone metabolism between patients with stroke and with spinal cord injury,” that Sato and his coauthors had written in 1999. Grey wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It refers to the now-retracted paper J Neurol Sci 1998;156:205–10, and cites 7 other retracted papers (refs 5-11) by the Sato research group.</p>



<p>It is rather clearly not reliable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Grecea responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given the rather scarce evidence regarding the three papers in the document provided by COPE, I tried to contact myself the Kurume University and the Futase Social Insurance Hospital (both listed by the three papers as the affiliations of the authors of the three papers).</p>



<p>Kurume University has responded at the end of December and I am currently working on the three retractions. I would estimate the 3+1 retractions to appear online around the end of this month.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/honeybees-italy-steal-pollen-bumblebees">Some honeybees in Italy regularly steal pollen off the backs of bumblebees</a></h4>

              
                <p>Honeybees rely on plant pollen as a protein-packed food source. And some are even willing to steal from other bees to get it.</p>



<p>Pollen stealing has been seen before, in the United States. But now, researchers in Italy have also observed honeybees <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-023-01049-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snatching pollen off the backs of bumblebees</a>. The observations, published December 21 in <em>Apidologie</em>, are among the most extensive documentation of bee-on-bee larceny to date.</p>



<p>On a summer trip in 2019 to Mount Antola, in the northern Italian region of Liguria, independent naturalists Tiziano Londei and Giuliana Marzi, both based in Milan, recorded video of what they thought were honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) trying to push bumblebees off the flower of a woolly thistle (<em>Cirsium eriophorum</em>). A closer look at the video, however, revealed that this wasn’t a case of competitive harassment — it was a full-blown robbery. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch a honeybee steal pollen off the backs of bumblebees | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mPE17Qci1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A thieving honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) snags pollen off the body of a red-tailed bumblebee (<em>Bombus lapidarius</em>). Because honeybees aren&#8217;t good at collecting pollen from woolly thistle, the bumblebees — which get pollen stuck on their hairy bodies — appear to be too good a target to pass up. This behavior, previously seen in several areas in the United States, has now been observed in Italy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As red-tailed bumblebees (<em>Bombus</em> <em>lapidarius</em>) scrounged around the flowers for nectar and pollen, some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollen-hitches-ride-bees-all-right-spots">pollen grains stuck to their hairy bodies</a> (<em>SN: 9/6/17</em>). Londei and Marzi witnessed honeybees shamelessly snagging this pollen for themselves. The thieves tended to target male bumblebees slightly more than females, as the males appeared less bothered by the pilfering (though even females didn’t react aggressively).</p>



<p>“Honeybees are well-known as pollen pigs,” says Avery Russell, a biologist at Missouri State University in Springfield who was not involved in the study. So stealing pollen from the bodies of bumblebees, he says,&nbsp;&#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem like a far stretch.”</p>



<p>To see how common the criminality is, the researchers went back to the scene twice in the following three years and also observed bees at two other sites about 25 kilometers away. Honeybees at these other sites were not seen stealing from bumblebees, but bees at the first site continued their larcenous ways year after year. For instance, honeybees collected pollen from only three of the 31 flowers the researchers observed in 2021, but stole from 28 of the available 66 bumblebees.</p>



<p>Scrutinizing the differences between these sites, the researchers suspect honeybees resort to theft in areas where pollen is hard for them to get from flowers (the honeybees struggled to collect pollen from the woolly thistle), but where there are plenty of other bees around.</p>



<p>Pollen stealing by honeybees has previously been observed only in North America, first <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25083029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Kansas</a> and then later in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25084015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-the-kansas-entomological-society/volume-78/issue-2/0406.15.1/Quantifying-a-Rare-Event--Pollen-Theft-by-Honey-Bees/10.2317/0406.15.1.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana</a>. Discovering the behavior in Italy suggests this may be a global crime spree. Russell says it would be nice to next learn whether pollen theft negatively impacts bumblebees, or the flowers they pollinate. He’s also curious if other bee species ever steal pollen, too. “We do notice that in the hive, bumblebees will nibble on each other&#8217;s pollen baskets,” he says.</p>

The application of microfluidics in the biomedical field covers many different aspects, including sensing, cell manipulation and micropumping. These devices also serve as tissue/organ culture platforms. The concept of organ-on-a-chip allows such complex systems to be reproduced in a smaller and simpler platform, holding massive potential for the study of intercellular communications as well as an alternative to animal models. Micropumps find applications as drug delivery systems, as well as being a fundamental component of microfluidic devices. These are but a few examples of the potential these technologies hold in the biomedical field.</p>
