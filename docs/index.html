The global BWiS Network is volunteer-led and aims to provide a safe space for Black women to seek advice and support in their career journeys and through changing legislation, generating tangible change in the STEM industry. Tomi’s role involves running the day-to-day activities of the BWiS network and managing a team of amazing volunteers that help to keep the important work running.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi graduated from BSc Neuroscience at the University of Nottingham, before becoming a Medical Laboratory Assistant for the NHS and then a Research Technician at UKDRI Imperial Care Research and Technology Centre. She is now completing her PhD at the University of Cambridge, studying the mechanisms of inflammation caused by aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi was asked to be Head Judge because “she is a passionate advocate for equality and representation in the scientific landscape, with a strong commitment to supporting underrepresented groups”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Presenting our winner of the Inclusive Workplace Development Award:</strong></span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_91b4997735d64f309c9562021e9cdcd9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_356,h_210,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Associate Professor Becky Trueman, University of Nottingham"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Associate Professor Rebecca ‘Becky’ Trueman works at the University of Nottingham and was the winner of the Inclusive Workplace Development award! Becky’s role is split between teaching and research, both of which she enjoys. Studying Neuroscience as an undergraduate at Cardiff University, Becky’s research career began with work on Huntington’s Disease, before moving into stroke research later on. More recently, her work has been focused on drug discovery for Myotonic Dystrophy, another genetic disorder, and she is working within a fantastic multidisciplinary team. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky was nominated for this award because she strives to create an inclusive environment in her research group, believing that science is a team sport. Within her teaching endeavours, Becky has worked on a number of initiatives to improve inclusivity, including work with Emily Herrod (British Neuroscience Association, BNA, Placement student 2021), Anne Cooke (BNA), Hannah Thurgur (BNA) and Emily Sena (University of Edinburgh) to develop anti-racist tools for Neuroscience, helping to develop a Faculties Inclusive Curriculum toolkit.</span></span></p>

<p>Dr Katie Long is a Research Fellow at King’s College London, where she started her own lab with an MRC Career Development Award in 2019. Her lab investigates how the human brain develops to the right size and shape. She works with many fantastic basic science and clinical colleagues to address these questions in human foetal development using an interdisciplinary approach – from biomechanics and computational modelling to cell biology and immunology.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Katie studied Biomedical Science at Sheffield University before going on to do a PhD in developmental neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh (with Charles ffrench-Constant), exploring how brains are ‘built’ during development. She then moved to the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden (with Wieland Huttner) where she began working on brain development in different species, becoming interested in how brains have evolved into such unique anatomical structures.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Katie was nominated for this award because diversity is a key part of her research, from the experimental approaches she uses to the people she works with. Her commitment to an inclusive and open workplace includes, but is not limited to: hosting ethics lab meetings, encouraging open dialogue in her weekly lab meetings, highlighting important equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) topics, prioritising the career development of her lab members, providing a platform for anonymous feedback, establishing a mentoring programme and collaborating on Routes Collective. This is an organisation dedicated to supporting refugee and asylum-seeking women in London.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dr Kamar ‘Kam’ Ameen Ali has been a Senior Lecturer in Biomedical Science at Teesside University since 2022. Kam splits her time between teaching and pursuing an independent programme of dementia research. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam gained her PhD in behavioural neuroscience and neurobiology at Durham University, using an animal model to understand complex forms of memory. Her first postdoctoral position at the University of Sheffield investigated cognitive and neuropathological changes in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Following this, Kam decided to gain some experience outside of academia, taking up a position as regional programme manager for the NC3Rs, a research funder in the UK. Gaining this type of experience helped her to reflect on her career and fuelled her decision to return to academia. Kam then took two successive postdoctoral positions, firstly at Newcastle University, looking at the relationship between stroke and dementia using human post-mortem brain tissue, and then at the University of Glasgow looking at the relationship between traumatic brain injury and dementia, again using human post-mortem brain tissue. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam was asked to be a judge for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because she is a passionate advocate for academic researchers, and regularly contributes to the Dementia Researcher Blog to share her insights on life as a researcher. She is also a committed mentor as part of the BNA Scholars Programme and through ARUK’s cross centre mentorship scheme. </span></span></p>

<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_2dfa56466184448889883fb01f1e9d64~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Associate Professor Jo Jones, University of Cambridge"></figure>
<p>Dr Joanne ‘Jo’ Jones is an Associate Professor in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge and an Honorary Consultant Neurologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, specialising in the care of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Her lab is a translational neuroimmunology lab, focusing on understanding tissue immunity and immune regulation in health and disease, including in the brain. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jo completed her undergraduate medical training at Bristol University, where she was fortunate to receive MRC funding for an intercalated BSc. This confirmed her passion for immunology and medical research. So, after initial postgraduate medical training in the Southwest, in 2003 she moved to Cambridge to study for a PhD with Professors Alasdair Coles and Alastair Compston, working on a novel immune therapy for MS (Campath-1H – now licensed as Lemtrada). She thought the project was incredible, with a fantastic supervisor and research team.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Following Jo’s PhD, she returned to full-time neurology training for a few years before being appointed as a Clinical Lecturer in Neurology – a role made possible by a newly established national scheme. This allowed her to develop her research ideas and to generate the data needed to secure a Wellcome Trust Intermediate Clinical Fellowship, which provided the time and funding she needed to establish her own lab. After her fellowship, she was appointed as an Assistant Professor, and later promoted to Associate Professor, the role that she currently holds. Jo was awarded tenure last year. Over the years her group has grown; Jo now leads an outstanding team of talented individuals including a lab manager, five post-doctoral researchers and six PhD students. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jo was nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because “she is not only inspiring as a scientific leader in her field, she is an exceptional leader with a true dedication to mentoring and empowering the next generation of scientists”. Jo&apos;s lab truly celebrates an inclusive environment, championing gender and racial equity both in the lab and the wider department: “She ensures everyone feels welcome, is given support (both career and more broadly) and she stands out in her support of early-career researchers, whatever their chosen career path, after their time in her lab”. She leads the EDI group in her department, which has included sessions on parental leave, and actively promotes the representation of women in neuroscience through organising, supporting and participating in conferences, workshops, and outreach efforts.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dr Hilary Richardson is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and a developmental cognitive neuroscientist. Most of her research examines the neural correlates of social cognitive development in childhood. She is interested in the development of brain regions that take on particular cognitive functions, and the role of intrinsic and experiential factors on this development. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, she worked as a research assistant in a developmental psychology lab led by Professor Henry Wellman and contributed to studies on children’s ‘theory of mind’ development (‘theory of mind’ describes the human ability to reason about others’ internal mental states – their beliefs, desires, and emotions). When Hilary graduated from university, she took a full-time research assistantship position at MIT; this position provided her with more experience in development social cognitive neuroscience research,using fMRI as a key method. She stayed at MIT to complete her PhD in Neuroscience (with Professor Rebecca Saxe) and then completed a postdoctoral research fellowship at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School (with Professor Charles Nelson). During the fellowship, Hilary learned how to use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to study social brain development in young children. Hilary started as a Lecturer in the Psychology Department at the University of Edinburgh in 2020.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary was nominated because she is a dedicated mentor, supporting her most senior PhD student through two first-author publications, a prior MSc student with a first-author publication, four undergraduate/MSc students to obtain PhD positions and a postdoctoral researcher to a Lectureship position. She tailors her advice to suit each of her mentees and makes professional development a priority in her lab meetings and one-to-ones. Hilary promotes an inclusive and supportive environment by organising group activities with low/no financial costs, hosting open lab meetings, and celebrating both small and big achievements through announcements in monthly lab meetings. </span></span></p>

<p>Dr Emma Cahill has been a Lecturer in Neuroscience at the University of Bristol since 2021, where she teaches undergraduate courses on the brain, neuropharmacology and behaviour, as well as leading a research team conducting  experimental work on the neurological mechanisms underlying memory.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her undergraduate degree was in Neuroscience, from Trinity College Dublin, where she first discovered her love for lab work (her summer project investigated how exercise could enhance object recognition memory in rats!). Emma then travelled to France for her Masters and PhD research. Her PhD programme was for international students, so she met people from lots of different countries and made lifelong friends. Her PhD thesis was on understanding the effect of cocaine on the NMDA-type glutamate receptor and Dopamine type 1 receptor and involved mostly wet-lab work and cell culture. It had ups and downs, but Emma recalls enjoying working in a team and leading a research project to completion. She also got her French up to scratch and started teaching in the University Paris VI.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Post-PhD, Emma decided she wanted to continue to study glutamate and dopamine interactions, but this time in the context of fear memories. She was aiming to secure a post-doctoral position, and she reflected on how she “pretty much stalked relevant groups at big conferences” and managed to secure a position with a team focused on behaviour analysis in Cambridge. As a postdoctoral researcher, Emma continued to teach and perform experiments on how dopamine regulates fear memory persistence. She obtained her own research funding from the BBSRC and an Industry collaborative grant, so she stayed in Cambridge on a temporary lectureship for three years, during which time her first PhD student started. These grants helped Emma to pave the way for her own research that she now continues in Bristol.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Emma was nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’ for her investment in the scientific development of her mentees, sharing curated opportunities, facilitating networking and assisting in the gain of a wide variety of skills. She is incredibly inclusive of all students, believing in them equally, treating them as individuals and never assuming ability. Her nominator particularly appreciates that “personal flair is always encouraged and you never feel as if you’re being pushed into a mould” and truly believes that “neuroscience, and science at large, would be vastly improved if more people mentored like Emma”.</p>

<p><u><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>The Importance of Mentorship</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In our research roles, it can often feel as though we are being stretched too thin, with teaching, meetings and all the other essential tasks required of us! Trying to fit being a mentor into our busy schedules can be incredibly difficult, but it is one of the most invaluable uses of your time. There’s a reason that universities often have mentorship schemes for individuals all the way from undergraduate students up to Professors - there’s always something we can learn or teach. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi was in agreement and also recognised that everyone’s journey is different, even if we end up in similar positions eventually. She remarked that mentorship is important because “it allows people to expand their knowledge - it’s a true personification of “a problem shared, is a problem halved”.” Tomi also recognised that mentorship opens the door to sponsorship opportunities, which are an “ever-growing important part of scientific career progression.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky has been lucky enough to consider many wonderful people to have been mentors throughout her career, sharing that they are the people “who give great practical advice and push you to do things you didn’t think you were quite ready for, and the ones who are there for fantastic emotional support when nothing seems to be working.” She reflected that she has always tried to “search out mentors who hold similar values to [her] and strive to create a positive research culture” and that mentors are “hugely important to help you navigate the rocky road of academia”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie shared that we are not always the best at providing guidance and support for ourselves, instead we are “often much better at seeing the good in other people and their work than we are at seeing our own. Having a mentor (or better yet more than one!) is so important to help you see your own strengths and to navigate your career in a way that you enjoy”. It is equally as important to help those you mentor to do the same. Being a mentor to others can highlight just how critical we can all be of ourselves sometimes. Having that outside perspective really can make all the difference.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Similarly, Kam commented that “mentorship is important now more than ever, because we know that women and people from under-represented groups face structural inequalities in academia and are disproportionately affected by things such as precarious contracts and work casualisation”. She explained that mentorship is an “effective way of supporting early- and mid-career researchers through providing guidance and enabling them to develop and make choices that will allow them to progress in their careers”. Whilst Kam has tried to model many of the skills and qualities she sees in her mentors, she acknowledges that “it’s important to be flexible and tailor your mentorship for the needs of each mentee”. After all, we’re all different and require different types of support!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Jo has learned that mentorship is a dynamic, two-way process, stating that “mentors provide guidance, but they also learn from their mentees. Effective mentorship requires active listening, tailored support, and encouragement of independence”. She highlighted how although it is tempting to solve every problem brought to you, “often it is just helpful for someone to be able to talk issues through. As a mentee, I’ve benefited from mentors who not only provided technical expertise but also encouraged me and helped me navigate career challenges”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary asserted, “Mentorship is hard! It is a skill to be continually refined”. Recognising how crucial supporting and advising others is, she observed that mentorship is the part of her job that feels most impactful: “No one is an island in academia; my mentors provided me with training and access to opportunities that changed the way that I think and helped me define and push me towards my professional goals”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Emma recognised that being a mentor has not only benefited her mentees, but has also helped her to develop new ways to manage herself, saying “it’s always a two-way process and there is something to be gained by both mentee and mentor.” She shared that being a mentor involved being flexible and adapting your approach, depending on the mentee’s requirements, as “there is not a one-fit rule either. As a mentor, you may need to adjust your approach for different situations or different persons, and your own experience might not be relevant. So, it helps to be flexible. In the same way, search out different mentors for different aspects of support.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Essential Advice for Early Career Researchers</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Since we all have to start somewhere, we asked our seven neuroscientists to give some useful words of advice to the early career researchers out there:</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi wants you to remain authentic and to ask for help (because it’s OK not to know everything!). She also imparts that no goals are “too big” - set goals that you truly want to achieve!</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Becky would like you to “believe in yourself, do not be afraid to take up space, your thoughts and opinions are valid. Find mentors – they don’t have to officially be mentors and don’t need to be in your field – but people who you can knock on the door of and will reassure you when you need it, push you to take those next big steps and help you find the connections and network you need”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie acknowledges that “research can be such a fun and rewarding career path, despite the challenges” and recommends that you “find the things that you enjoy, the questions that you love to work on, the surprise directions that excite you and the people who will support and motivate you. You may find these things in places you weren’t expecting to, so be open to new directions and opportunities to enjoy what you do”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam shares the advice that she always gives to ECRs: “Have an idea of what you’re interested in, but keep your mind open to different opportunities that come your way. If you follow what you’re interested in, you can’t go wrong, but be open for that to change. In academia we develop such a variety of skills, and we have a range of different career options open to us because of that. Even if you decide to pursue one option, you are not committing yourself to that path forever. More and more people are moving between academic and non-academic jobs, and employers are increasingly seeing the benefit of researchers who have worked across sectors”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">For Jo, prioritising “building a strong network, collaborations and mentorship” is one of the most invaluable things you can do throughout your career. “Be proactive in seeking opportunities, but also learn to say no sometimes to protect your time. Resilience is key; setbacks are inevitable in research, but they offer valuable learning experiences. Finally, advocate for yourself - whether it’s for funding, authorship, or career progression, don’t be afraid to make your contributions and ambitions known!”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary emphasises the importance of pursuing questions that “excite you, with people who challenge and support you. Scientific outputs take a lot of time and effort; being genuinely interested in ‘the answer’ that a particular project provides is a good sign that a project is worth doing”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Emma stressed the value of some inner reflection: “Know what works for you and what you need help with, [so that you can] search out people who are excited by your science”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><span style="color: rgb(191, 125, 167);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We also chatted to them about their thoughts and feelings surrounding their award category.</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Tomi wanted to be Head Judge for the ‘Inclusive Workplace Development Award’ because she thinks it is great to acknowledge the work of others; “Often this work is done without reward, whilst the nominees do this work without expectation, it is wonderful to be part of highlighting these individuals”. Along with her panel of judges, Tomi selected Becky Trueman and Katie Long as the finalists. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite all of the fantastic work Becky has done to create a supportive environment for her team, she remarked that she was “surprised [to be nominated], and to be honest did not feel deserving, as much of [her] work to create a more inclusive environment has been done with others. I want to acknowledge the many incredible individuals I&apos;ve had the privilege to collaborate with in my inclusivity work, as well as those whose open conversations, social media posts, books, and other media have made me consider my own biases. A significant number of these have been women from minoritised groups, whose contributions have been instrumental in driving progress in this area. As we continue to work to improve inclusion for women in our field, it’s crucial to recognise the importance of intersectionality. Different groups experience unique and often compounded barriers to advancement, and we must be mindful of these nuances.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I would not be here if it was not for the work of others, and to name a few key people:  Errolinda Ward, who started the inclusive curricula project within my School; Yvonne Mbaki and Rakesh Patel, who led our faculty toolkit; and the fantastic Emily Sena, University of Edinburgh, who suggested we approach the BNA when I was discussing resources for decolonising Neuroscience teaching with her. And all the teams who worked with me on these projects, along with the groups of students who have helped co-create resources”. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Katie was really grateful to be nominated for the ‘Inclusive Workplace Development Award’: “I’m very lucky to have the support from my colleagues, mentors and team to help make our environment more inclusive, and to have seen some fantastic examples of improving inclusivity, diversity and accessibility of science, many of them driven by amazing women that I work with. They are an incredibly inspiring group and I hope together we can continue to help show that science is a space for everyone”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam made the decision to be Head Judge for ‘Mentor of the Year’ because she “fully supports the work of WiNUK and thought it was an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of some outstanding female neuroscientists and provide greater visibility for them and their work”. Kam and the rest of the judges selected Jo, Hilary and Emma as the finalists.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Jo remarked that she was “Delighted!” to be nominated for ‘Mentor of the Year’, explaining that she “had no idea [she] had been nominated - the first I heard was when I received an invitation to the awards ceremony saying I’d been short-listed. I’m incredibly grateful to those who took the time out of their busy lives to put me forward.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hilary also felt “grateful and honoured [to be nominated]! I’m so lucky to work with my team”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As did Emma, who was “really happy and appreciative of the effort of a nomination” and “was excited to meet other people through the network too”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></span></u></p>

<p>The editor-in-chief of a journal updated a retraction notice to acknowledge the data in the paper were “completely plagiarized” following allegations in a letter to the editor that were the subject of a Retraction Watch post last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original retraction, requested by the authors, cited only “major errors in data.” The <a href="https://www.ijccm.org/doi/IJCCM/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-24548">notice</a> for the October 2023 paper, which is signed by the <em>Indian Journal for Critical Care Medicine (IJCCM) </em>editor-in-chief Atul Kulkarni, now reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following scrutiny of the article further and other facts brought to the notice of the IJCCM, I have decided to change the reason for the retraction. This article is withdrawn after having been found that the data was completely plagiarized (in toto) from the work of another researcher.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-130900"></span>



<p>The undated notice was updated January 23, a day after our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/22/researcher-alleges-group-stole-thesis-data-presented-at-conference/">reporting</a> about the journal noted that a letter to the editor of the journal had claimed that the work had been stolen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But according to Sundara Kannan, the researcher mentioned in the notice who wrote the <a href="https://www.ijccm.org/doi/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-24766">letter to the editor</a> in November 2024, the researchers had plagiarized the data from his 2022 post-graduate <a href="https://www.eventscribe.net/2023/UltraCon/fsPopup.asp?PresentationID=1195173&amp;mode=presinfo">thesis</a>. The data were presented at a 2022 conference, which required electronic submission to the India Society for Critical Care Medicine, an organization associated with <em>IJCCM, </em>according to their <a href="https://www.isccm.org/">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Kulkarni or managing editor Prashant Kaushik responded to our immediate request for comment. Neither did Kannan nor the paper’s corresponding author, Nitesh Gupta.</p>

                Cricket frogs were once thought to hop on the water’s surface. They actually leap in and out of the water in a form of locomotion called porpoising.

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is pleased to once again partner with the Einstein Foundation Berlin for this awards program. Watch this space in the coming weeks for profiles of last year&rsquo;s finalists prior to the award ceremony of the 2024 winners in March. Below is the Einstein Foundation&rsquo;s announcement calling for entries.</p>



<p>The annual &euro;350,000 <strong><em>Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</em></strong><em> in cooperation with the </em><strong><em>QUEST Center for Responsible Research at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charit&eacute; (BIH) </em></strong>is inviting applications and nominations again.</p>



<p>The international award is open to any researcher, or group of researchers, institution, organization, and early career researcher around the globe whose work helps to fundamentally advance the quality, transparency, and reproducibility of science and research.</p>



<p><a href="https://award.einsteinfoundation.de/for-applicants-nominators">&rarr; Submit online</a></p>



<p><strong>The deadline for entries is April 30, 2025 (10:00 pm UTC).</strong> The awardees will be announced by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>The award recognizes successful candidates in the following three categories:</p>



<p><strong>Individual Award (&euro;150,000):</strong> Individuals or small teams who have outstandingly contributed to fostering research quality can be nominated. Nominators are strongly encouraged to consider a diverse set of criteria, including gender, race/ethnicity, geography, and career stage.</p>



<p><strong>Institutional Award (&euro;100,000):</strong> Governmental and non-governmental organizations, institutions, or other entities that have notably enhanced research quality can apply or be nominated. Successful governmental organizations or institutions will not receive any funds in addition to the award itself.</p>



<p><strong>Early Career Award (&euro;100,000):</strong> Individuals or teams can submit a project proposal that seeks to foster research quality and value. Eligible candidates must hold a doctorate or have equivalent research experience and should have been an independent researcher for no longer than five years. In the case of a team entry, the majority must be Early Career Researchers.</p>



<p>In 2024, Dutch microbiologist and science whistleblower<strong> Elisabeth Bik </strong>won the Individual Award. Bik has uncovered the use of fraudulent or erroneous data for more than 7,600 scientif&shy;ic papers and has shed light on the practice of selling authorship for fabricated studies. &nbsp;The Institutional Award went to <strong>PubPeer, </strong>a platform for rapid post-publication review and discussion of published scientific data which helped identify flaws in the work of eminent scientists, combatted fraud, and fostered the emergence of an international, multidisciplinary community of research integrity experts. The Early Career Award was won by<strong> PixelQuality</strong> the project led by <strong>Christopher Schmied </strong>and<strong> Helena Jambor</strong>. The team aims to improve scientific image reproducibility.</p>

<p>The Individual and Institutional Awards are funded by W&uuml;bben Stiftung Wissenschaft, while the BIH QUEST Center for Responsible Research supports the Early Career Award. Additional resources are made available by the State of Berlin. The publisher Nature Portfolio, the Public Library of Science (PLOS), the National Academy of Sciences, the Berlin University Alliance, the Max Planck Society and the Max Planck Foundation support the Einstein Foundation Berlin and the BIH QUEST Center for Responsible Research in promoting and implementing the award.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gracewlindsay.com/2025/01/24/2025-agency-gained-and-lost/">2025: Agency gained and lost</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve had even a passing glance at tech journalism over the past few months, you know the top buzzword for AI in 2025 is <em>agentic</em>. Agentic AI (according to many think pieces and press releases at least) is going to revolutionize industry. It’s going to streamline complex pipelines and maximize efficiency. It will make corporations smarter, better, faster, and for cheaper. What makes agentic AI so powerful? Agentic AI can take action. These models—equipped with language modules, external databases, and ‘chain of thought’ reasoning—are designed to set goals, make plans, and execute actions. As a result they can have real impact in the world.</p>



<p>But what about us?</p>



<p>2025 is not just the year of agentic AI but also the start of a second Trump administration.  In the short time since the Nazi-salute-containing inauguration day, the administration has enacted a slew of executive orders impacting everything from prescription drug prices to offshore drilling. ICE agents are conducting raids in previously safe spaces like churches and hospitals and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/24/ice-raid-newark-new-jersey-immigration-us-citizens">sweeping up US citizens in the process</a>. Government employees are actively encouraged to snitch on their peers. Scientists are being silenced and their funding requests halted or even canceled. Combined with the legacy of the first Trump administration, we are currently facing an upheaval in our access to everything from healthcare to voting to clean energy.</p>



<p>Each of these efforts constricts the space around every one of us, making our possible set of actions smaller and smaller. Thinking of expressing an opinion on diversity at work? Be careful, your co-worked may report you. Want to attend a Spanish mass in Chicago? They’re canceled, for fear of raids. Need to look up a fact about climate change or Jan. 6 investigations? The government websites are gone. </p>



<p>The result (and intention) of these rules and actions are to create a learned helplessness in us&#8212;to reduce our own sense of agency. And in fact we see signs of it working. Voter turnout dipped by about 5 million people in 2024 compared to 2020. The Women’s March and other protests that mobilized hundreds of thousands after the first Trump inauguration dwindled to a much smaller trickle this year.</p>



<p>Even the simple act of social media activism has been constrained. The owners of the largest information sharing channels in the world sat as esteemed guests at the inauguration, and their actions within their companies suggest the invitation was a welcome one. X (formerly twitter) won’t be of much use unless the actions you want to take are to the right. Threads has always been clear that it is not interested in political content, preferring to support the brand-rot banter of social media interns at large corporations instead. And should you manage to actually get a useful and actionable post out, say about how women can access Plan C, onto Instagram or Facebook, it will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/instagram-facebook-abortion-pill-providers.html">taken down</a> before many people can see. </p>

<p>So it seems the same people who want to push AI agents on us in their tech also want desperately to remove our own agency in real life. Wouldn’t Instagram be a nicer place if all the pesky, politically-motivated humans just sat back and observed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/03/meta-ai-powered-instagram-facebook-profiles">(fake) actions of AI-generated social media accounts</a>? Perhaps the writers of Wall-E had the most accurate take on the future: an Earth so covered in trash it is abandoned, but nobody really cares because they’re given a constant stream of personalized entertainment without having to lift a finger, or even make a decision. Leave the agency to the robots. </p>



<p>The truth is, it can actually be a lot more fun to be an observer than an agent. I know, because I spent much of my life not feeling like an agent at all. Perhaps because I grew up in a cornfield-filled suburb where nobody really did anything that mattered, I never expected I would either. And so I simply observed. I observed the physical world and human behavior and patterns of thought. And this turned me into a scientist. But even doing science can feel like not really <em>doing</em> anything. A lot of academic scientists joke about getting a “real job” some day.</p>



<p>But through a combination of events personal, professional, and political, my perspective began to change. When my dad died shortly before I finished my PhD I was confronted with the uncomfortable possibility that I was now the adult in the room. When the pandemic struck and global chaos abounded I realized that people in power are—terrifyingly—just like me. And when I published a book and eventually heard from young people that this book impacted them, sometimes to the point of changing their careers, I realized that I was already acting in the world. And so I decided to take on the identity of an agent more strongly.</p>



<p>And this is how I know that living as an agent is both essential and life-giving, and also an unbearable burden. With agency comes responsibility. If you have the power to change the world then why aren’t you? ‘Can’ quickly becomes ‘ought’. Even after deciding to <a href="https://gracewlindsay.com/2022/10/19/an-introduction-to-the-lindsay-lab-what-we-are-researching-and-why/">shift my career towards climate change</a> (an agentic move if I ever made one), I still wonder if I’m doing enough. Even when I became directly involved in political campaigning (including overcoming my millennial phone-phobia to make calls for the Harris campaign), there was always the sense that I could have, and should have, done more. If modern AI agents had to experience<em> true </em>agency, with the moral weight that is intrinsically tied to it, their chains of thought would snap under the pressure.</p>



<p>Counterintuitively, this moral weight can feel even more acute the more constrained your action space is. I don’t have billions of dollars to invest in clean energy and so instead I agonize over every decision to take a flight or use a disposable cup. There is a stifling sadness in these small actions. When those with power take action free from moral constraints, you can feel like an ant moving grains of sand in the shadow of a bulldozer. You still can act. In fact you must act, but will your tiny actions matter?</p>



<p>I think a lot about the phrase “May you live in interesting times”, wrongly claimed to be a Chinese curse. If it is a curse, it is only a curse for the agent. To an observer, interesting times are entertainment: think of all the gripping movies that have been written about past times of turmoil and will be written about the current one. To the agent, though, who is actively trying to write the story as they live in it, interesting times are a minefield of potential wrong decisions and wasted efforts. At the same they also present the very real possibility of <em>impact</em>.</p>



<p>When we think of the current moment we have to remember why so many people in power want to constrict our agency. It is obviously because our actions <em>do </em>matter. Uncertain times present many possible futures. We, individually and collectively, do have the power to set the course. If our efforts were like a child playing with a toy cellphone, pressing buttons that lead to no outcomes, there would be no reason to take them away. The game of finding your route to greatest impact has certainly gotten harder, with more hurdles and dead-ends added along the way. But all that means is that we need to be cleverer, more committed, and take more action. In short, we need 2025 to be the year not of agentic AI but of <em>agentic</em> <em>humans, </em>operating with the full moral urgency that comes with that term and that the moment demands.</p>

<p>Nearly 20 years after the publication of a paper on phytoestrogens in postmenopausal women, one of the authors said the study had never been performed, according to a recently published retraction notice.</p>



<p>The retraction is the second for two of the authors. It comes after sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">Ben Mol</a> and his colleagues initially <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/high-profile-ob-gyn-accused-of-duplicating-data-threatens-to-sue-critic/">discovered data similarities between the recently-retracted study and another by the same group</a>, as we reported last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two papers that seem to share data appeared in <em>Fertility and Sterility</em>, an Elsevier publication, in 2004 and 2006.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130892"></span>



<p>Table 1 of the 2006 paper “<a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)04214-7/pdf">Psychological assessment of the effects of treatment with phytoestrogens on postmenopausal women: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study</a>” was identical to Table 1 of the 2004 article “<a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(04)00530-8/fulltext">Endometrial effects of long-term treatment with phytoestrogens: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a threefold difference in participant number between the two studies, both groups of women represented in the tables had a 165.5 centimeter mean height and the same standard deviation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only the 2006 article was <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282%2824%2902432-4/fulltext">retracted</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The corresponding author did not reply to inquiries; however, one of the coauthors did respond and admitted that the study published above was not actually performed. Inquiries were made to the coauthors and their institutions, who did not provide any information to alter or contradict this admission. Therefore, the [Publications] Committee has determined to retract the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 104 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meredith Sauls, managing editor of <em>Fertility and Sterility</em>, said in an email to <em>Retraction Watch</em> the journal has “nothing to add to the published retraction.” She did not respond to our questions regarding a potential investigation of the 2004 paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two papers shared two co-authors, <a href="https://unicamillus.org/en/lecturers/vittorio-unfer/">Vittorio Unfer</a>, a professor at the International Medical University in Rome, and <a href="https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1691836/cv_casini_maria_luisa_05042022.pdf">Maria Luisa Casini</a>, currently a pharmacologist at Italian Medicines Agency in Rome. At the time of the publications, both were researchers at Sapienza University in Rome. Neither responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year, a 2001 paper by Unfer, Papaleo, and Guido Marelli, a co-author of the retracted 2006 article, received an <a href="https://karger.com/goi/article/89/1/71/894474/Expression-of-concern-Low-Dose-of-Ethinyl">expression of concern</a>. Gian Carlo Di Renzo, a co-author of the 2004 study and a researcher at the University of Perugia, was also an author of the <a href="https://karger.com/goi/article-abstract/51/2/120/151478/Low-Dose-of-Ethinyl-Estradiol-Can-Reverse-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext">paper</a>, which was published in <em>Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation</em>. The notice cites concerns about “similarities between the results presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2,” and states the corresponding author stood by the data, blaming “local data storage regulations” for why the original data were lost. </p>



<p>Grainne McNamara, a publication ethics manager at Karger Publishers, said <em>Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation</em> is “aware” of the 2006 article. “We immediately contacted the research integrity team at the publisher of <em>Fertility and Sterility</em> in December 2024 to request more information and the investigation remains ongoing.”</p>

<p>The decision to abandon a process to re-evaluate a review recommending exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) has reignited calls for the article to be withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2019 version of the Cochrane Library <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003200.pub8/full">review</a>, “Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome,” has accumulated 67 citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The review recommends exercise therapy to treat ME/CFS, a treatment approach that drew widespread criticism from the patient community and researchers, who say physical activity isn’t an adequate remedy for the condition. According to the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cochrane-withdraw-the-harmful-2019-2024-exercise-therapy-for-cfs-review">petition</a>, <em>Cochrane</em>’s former editor-in-chief admitted the review in question wasn’t “fit for purpose,” although the editor-in-chief’s <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/cfs">statement</a> did not use that phrase.</p>



<span id="more-130875"></span>



<p>Following outcry, <em>Cochrane</em> then launched a pilot project in October 2019 to take a second look at the review, which involved creating an independent advisory group and a public consultation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But following delays stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and after <em>Cochrane </em>lost much of its funding in the UK, the publication <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/update-exercise-therapy-chronic-fatigue-syndrome">announced December 16</a> it is abandoning the update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This was due to insufficient new research in the field and a lack of capacity to oversee the work required, which significantly exceeded the resources normally allocated to an individual review,” a <em>Cochrane</em> spokesperson told <em>Retraction Watch</em>. “We have no plans to revisit this decision.”</p>



<p><em>Cochrane </em>abruptly ceased communication and made little effort to explain why the pilot was abandoned, said <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/04/01/hilda-bastian-scientific-research/">Hilda Bastian</a>, a meta-scientist, writer and cartoonist in Australia who was a founding member of the Cochrane Collaboration. “It’s hard to find a word to describe how badly they treated everybody involved in this,” she said. “It’s been pretty appalling behavior.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The review is of “extremely poor quality,” added <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/3029-jonathan-edwards">Jo Edwards</a>, an emeritus professor of Connective Tissue Medicine at University College London. Edwards said he has seen several past versions of the review. “It produces a message, which is contrary to what the <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng206/chapter/Recommendations#managing-mecfs">NICE [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] assessment</a> has made and is simply not in the patients’ interest,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cochrane-withdraw-the-harmful-2019-2024-exercise-therapy-for-cfs-review">petition</a> calling for the review to be withdrawn started in September 2023 and has so far attracted more than 14,000 signatures from concerned patients and researchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Covid-19 pandemic has created even more need for evidence-based assessments of proposed therapies for ME/CFS,” the petition reads. “Many of the millions of people who are developing Long Covid meet ME/CFS criteria and have the symptom of post-exertional malaise, contraindicating Graded Exercise Therapy.”</p>



<p>An update to the petition <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cochrane-withdraw-the-harmful-2019-2024-exercise-therapy-for-cfs-review/u/33119411">posted December 18</a> stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Sadly, we are not at all surprised by Cochrane&#8217;s reneging on their promise of a new updated review while they leave the 2019 review in place. They are clearly influenced by some of their leaders who are well known to support the psychobehavioural view of ME/CFS. No prospect of a new Cochrane review makes removal of the harmful 2019 review even more vital.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Guidelines released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/management/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/treatment/index.html">also state</a> exercise therapy is not a cure for ME/CFS, and note exercise routines for healthy people may be harmful for patients with the condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Edwards, the general experience of ME/CFS patients is also that exercise therapy doesn’t work. “Not only do they not work, but they seem to upset people badly and make them worse,” he said. “It’s not quite clear why that should be but it seems to be the case.”</p>



<p>Edwards said the review in question was “being widely cited and used for these purposes” but did not have at hand an example of the document being cited in policy documents.</p>



<p>The <em>Cochrane </em>spokesperson said the journal changed its editorial policy in July 2019 to no longer withdraw reviews if they are superseded by another systematic review or if the review question was considered outdated or no longer relevant. By our count in the database, from 2009 on, Cochrane has retracted or &#8216;withdrawn&#8217; over 500 reviews and their revised versions.</p>



<p>“Our <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/editorial-policies*withdrawal__;Iw!!NLFGqXoFfo8MMQ!sRxXF3rhbWcAocDbOHdnX5RGZ_wTQR-dqo5Yf2p1HKyAzrDsFwkc1zNeXIOHijq9skrUq632tvPAET1cpf1v$">withdrawal policy</a> now aligns with journal retraction policies and COPE best practice,” the spokesperson added. “<a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines">COPE guidance</a> states that retraction might be warranted if an article contains such seriously flawed or erroneous content or data that their findings and conclusions cannot be relied upon. Cochrane has assessed requests to withdraw the review in question, none of which meet the criteria for retraction.”</p>



<p>According to Bastian, while the review has “really severe problems,” it doesn’t meet the threshold for withdrawing review articles under the journal’s new policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A number of the original <em>Cochrane</em> founders are very enthusiastic about things like exercise therapies that can be managed in general practice,” Edwards said. “There’s a clear indication that an easier part of the motivation for Cochrane was to try and reduce the hype over high-tech pharmaceutical interventions.”</p>



<p>Edwards said the review should be retracted. “It’s misleading and shouldn’t be there,” he said. “It’s now about 14 years out of date.”</p>

                H5N1 vaccines have been previously licensed, and millions are in the national stockpile. But even with the news of the country’s first human death due to bird flu, vaccination isn’t yet recommended.

<p>A researcher in India has asked a journal to amend a retraction &#8220;for major errors in data&#8221; because, he says, the data weren&#8217;t wrong – they were stolen.</p>



<p>The October 2023 paper, “Prediction of Weaning Outcome from Mechanical Ventilation Using Ultrasound Assessment of Parasternal Intercostal Muscle Thickness,” was originally published in the <em>Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine (IJCCM).</em> The journal is published by JP Medical, and is indexed in Clarviate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The undated retraction <a href="https://www.ijccm.org/doi/IJCCM/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-24548">statement</a> says the authors “wish to withdraw the article . . . due to major errors in data.” The DOI no longer links to the article, and the full text is no longer available online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ijccm.org/doi/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-24766">letter to the editor</a> published Nov. 30, 2024 in <em>IJCCM,</em> researcher Sundara Kannan alleged the authors stole his data.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130865"></span>



<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0009-7954-269X">Kannan</a>, a junior consultant at Kovai Medical Center and Hospital in Tamil Nadu, said the authors of the retracted paper plagiarized his post-graduate <a href="https://www.eventscribe.net/2023/UltraCon/fsPopup.asp?PresentationID=1195173&amp;mode=presinfo">2022 thesis</a>, “Role of Parasternal Intercostal Muscle Ultrasound during Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation and Prediction of Extubation Success in ICU—A Prospective Observational Study.”</p>



<p>In the editorial, Kannan said the <em>IJCCM </em>study contained the “exact same data of the thesis including demographic characters, baseline data, and the primary and secondary objectives.” He noted his study findings were presented at the EuroAsia 2022 conference and that he had <a href="https://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?EncHid=NDM1MTc=&amp;Enc=&amp;userName=CTRI/2020/07/026427">registered</a> with the Clinical Trial Registry of India, as well as obtained clearance from the Institutional Ethics committee. The thesis was submitted electronically to the India Society for Critical Care Medicine (ISCCM), which examined the abstracts submitted to EuroAsia 2022 “anonymously,” according to the <a href="https://www.esicm.org/events/euroasia-2022/">event website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>IJCCM</em> is associated with the ISCCM, according to the organization’s <a href="https://www.isccm.org/">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profile.nexogic.com/profile/drarjunramaswamy">Arjun Ramaswamy</a>, an associate consultant with Apollo Hospital Enterprises in Mumbai, was lead author of the now-retracted study. Ramaswamy’s employer profile page <a href="https://www.apollohospitals.com/xh/doctors/pulmonologist/mumbai/dr-arjun-ramaswamy">claims</a> he won the “Best First Paper Award 2023” at IJCCM for the article. He also has ties to Kovai Medical Center, where Kannan is currently employed, and has not responded to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Kannan and his team came across the study in May 2024 and confronted the corresponding author, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5842-5584">Nitesh Gupta</a>,&nbsp;“with evidence of data theft/plagiarism, after which they decided to withdraw the manuscript,” Kannan wrote in his letter. He did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gupta, an associate professor at Vardhman Mahavir Medical College &amp; Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kannan’s letter to the editor said the authors “demand the retraction of the article citing the proper reason,” claiming they were in the process of submitting the data for publication at another journal. “If we publish our findings, which include more secondary objectives and analysis, that should be considered the original data and can be used anywhere for publication by the original authors,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the published paper, which has been cited five times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, had received criticism before. In March 2024, a different <a href="https://www.ijccm.org/doi/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-24665">letter to the editor</a> raised “certain points for further clarification of their reported observation,” questioning whether COVID-19 patients were included, among other critiques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ramaswamy and his co-authors <a href="https://www.ijccm.org/doi/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-24671">responded</a> to the editorial in April 2024: “We appreciate their engagement with our study and welcome further discussion,” the response reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked why the journal decided to publish the letter but not update the retraction notice, Prashant Kaushik, managing editor of <em>IJCCM, </em>told us he was “looking into this and will keep you posted” but did not respond to our repeated follow-up attempts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Atul Kulkarni, a professor and critical care division head at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai and editor-in-chief of the journal, did not respond to our request for comment. An article accompanying an <a href="https://medicaldialogues.in/mdtv/medicine/videos/know-about-the-indian-journal-of-critical-care-medicine-138023">interview</a> he gave about the journal in November 2024 states <em>IJCCM </em>is “renowned for its rigorous peer review process and for publishing high-quality, impactful research.”</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal has pulled three articles after the publisher determined an author had been “involved in the peer review and decision making” as managing guest editor of the special issues in which they appeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The author, botany researcher <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=rERy_8wAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Vijay Kumar</a> of Lovely Professional University in Punjab, India, told Retraction Watch his apparent involvement in assigning reviewers was “purely unintentional” and a “foolish mistake.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the articles appeared in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/south-african-journal-of-botany/vol/149/suppl/C">special issue section</a> of the <em>South African Journal of Botany</em> in 2022. They were:</p>

<p>After a thorough investigation, the Editor and publisher have concluded that the Managing Guest Editor of the Special Issue, Dr. Vijay Kumar, was also an author of the article and involved in the peer review and decision making.</p>



<p>As such this represents an abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.</p>

<p>The corresponding author of one of the articles “claimed that they were unaware that Dr. Vijay Kumar was involved in the peer review process for the paper, and do not agree with the retraction,” according to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629922002046?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a>. The author, Namrata Misra of the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology in Odisha, India, declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the webpages for the notices themselves contain different text than what appears on the article pages. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629924007609">One</a> includes what appears to be an internal communication, with instructions to “​​Specify details needed for R&amp;R panel to evaluate the case.” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629924007579">Another</a> states the article “is an accidental duplication” of an article previously published in the journal, and has been withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kumar told us other co-guest editors had handled the papers and assigned reviewers. Then, during revisions, “the revised manuscript was assigned to me by the journal (as a managing guest editor) and by mistake I sent to the same reviewers, which was purely unintentional.” He continued, “I agreed with these retractions with my full responsibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253617">other</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11240-023-02572-w">papers</a> on which Kumar was a coauthor were retracted in 2023 after PubPeer users raised concerns about duplicated images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An Elsevier spokesperson confirmed the publisher was investigating how Kumar’s apparent involvement in the processing of his own manuscripts could have escaped notice before publication. The spokesperson referred us to <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/editor/role/guest/guide">updated journal policies</a> on guest editors, which state:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The guest editor must not be involved in the handling or decisions about papers which s/he has authored or co-authored him/herself, or have been written by family members, colleagues, or which relate to products/ services in which other conflicts of interest are present. Furthermore, any such submission must be subject to all the journal’s usual procedures. Peer review must be handled independently of the relevant author/editor and their research groups, and there will be a clear statement to this effect on any such paper that is published.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The policy also states a guest editor should not submit more than one article to their special issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Kumar’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214662824000902">recent articles</a> in <em>Current Plant Biology</em>, another Elsevier title, contains the following statement as part of the section on competing interests:&nbsp;</p>

For each post, we are interviewing women in neuroscience to discuss the gaps and the health inequalities relating to different areas of neuroscience, as well as the exciting new research that is attempting to bridge these gaps. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>For our new article, we talked to Rachel Horne, journalist and co-chair of the Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement Group for the NIHR Policy Research Unit in Dementia and Neurodegeneration at Queen Mary University of London, where she is also an Honorary Research Fellow at the Wolfson Institute of Population Health.

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Its symptoms include difficulty walking, blurred vision, spasms and fatigue, and its onset ranges between 20 and 40 years of age. However, it is a highly heterogeneous disease, with symptom occurrence and health outcomes varying across individuals. For example, MS affects women three times more than men – a gender gap that has been progressively increasing over the last decades. Despite this, there is still little understanding of the factors influencing multiple sclerosis (read</span></span><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/bridging-the-gap-ruth-dobson" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></a><u><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/bridging-the-gap-ruth-dobson" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">here</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> our interview with MS researcher and neurologist Professor Ruth Dobson) and there has been a lack of clinical and biomedical research on MS in women. It is fundamental to address women-specific issues to fully understand and treat MS, and to do so, it is critical to centre the lived experiences of women with MS.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With her work as a journalist and a patient advocate and her efforts in funding women-led research, Rachel Horne advocates for more inclusive and representative research that looks at the impact of gender and ethnicity in the diagnosis and treatment of MS.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>&quot;In recent years, we have seen globally an assault on women&apos;s healthcare rights and we have sadly realised we can’t take anything for granted. &quot;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Can you tell us about your background and your story?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">First of all, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me. I think the work Women in Neuroscience UK do is incredibly important. For too long, women scientists and women patients have been overlooked. Something I only realised when I was diagnosed with MS in 2009 after a severe attack - seemingly out of nowhere - left me paralysed on one side of my body. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Luckily I recovered, but the diagnosis came as a huge shock. I knew nothing about the disease. At first I was fine, but as my symptoms became more pronounced, I started researching more about MS. I am a journalist by training so I also began to write about it as well as interviewing people in the MS community, attending conferences and doing lots of reading and listening.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Women’s health needs have been historically overlooked, even when some conditions, including MS, disproportionately affect so many more women compared to men. What are some of the issues that people with MS, in particular women, face?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The more I started learning about MS - including care and treatment - the more I was struck by this gender disparity and how it was barely mentioned. In particular, I noticed two things. MS is a disease that overwhelmingly affects women and it is often diagnosed around the age of 30. This is a very crucial time in women’s life: they are young adults, their careers are starting, they may be thinking about starting or expanding their family. The first thing I noticed is there didn&apos;t seem to be a lot of focus on our unique health needs - from menstruation, managing contraception, pregnancy, breast-feeding through to menopause - while we were managing a serious disease. We were seriously understudied and under researched. For example, there was a scoping review in</span></span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.812147/full" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></a><u><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.812147/full" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">2022 in Frontiers Neurology</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> showing that between 1980 and 2020, there were just ten studies on menopause and MS, which I think is pretty galling considering every woman with the disease who lives long enough, will go through it. Therefore, neurologists have struggled to give data-driven advice to their female patients about this stage of their life - and how it will affect their MS care. To me, that is just plain bad medicine, ignoring a huge chunk of the MS population. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Your work is quite diverse; you do a lot of different things to tackle MS challenges from different perspectives, including through your advocacy for patients’ involvement. How do you think that people’s lived experiences can inform clinical practices in MS? And how can their involvement contribute to mitigating the disparities you mentioned?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’ve been really cheered about the growing “nothing about us without us” movement in medicine - and how it emphasises the importance of including patient’s perspectives and experiences when it comes to medical research. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there was, by necessity, a sudden shift to providing remote care to treat MS patients at home. For many health care professionals, telemedicine was seen as a panacea which should continue post-pandemic. However, when I spoke to patients with MS, some of them were not nearly as enthusiastic. With MS there are a lot of invisible symptoms that are very difficult to show over a screen or describe by phone. Also some people do not have access to Wi-Fi, are not digitally savvy or might have issues with language. To them, they much prefer to see a neurologist or their MS nurse face-to-face. That’s why I think it is so key to speak with patients to get the full picture when it comes to any issues surrounding changes in treatment and care. Here’s a</span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></em><u><a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/09/14/covid-19-induced-changes-in-the-management-of-multiple-sclerosis/" target="_blank"><em><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">BMJ</span></span></em></a></u><u><a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/09/14/covid-19-induced-changes-in-the-management-of-multiple-sclerosis/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> blog post</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I helped to write.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Another example: I was also involved in a study called</span></span><a href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/attackms/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></a><u><a href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/attackms/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">AttackMS</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. The aim of the study is to see if it is possible to diagnose and start someone on a highly-effective MS drug within 14 days of showing up in A&amp;E with MS symptoms. I had some interesting discussions with clinicians about how best to tell a person they have a serious, incurable, life changing  disease in a busy hospital setting. For example, making sure this key conversation happens in a private room, that ideally the patient has someone to support them and how vital it is for the doctor to let the person speak, or cry or ask any question. I remember saying: “They will remember it for the rest of their lives, so it&apos;s really important to get it right”.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>How can women’s lived experience with MS inform research?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One thing that surprised me when I started looking into MS research was that almost all clinical trials stop at age 55. But at the same time there is evidence that women with MS find their disease course gets worse post-menopause. So should women at that age stop being given disease-modifying drugs? Should they be switched to less effective drugs? Why is there so little data on this? </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">At the same time, I think in MS research men and women patients are pretty much seen as the same, even though women have specific health issues - including menstruation,   pregnancy, IVF, breastfeeding and menopause. We are not small men with boobs and tubes! I would absolutely love to see the drug companies start focusing on clinical trials that involve looking at women and at men and seeing the differences. To me, it just seems quite logical to focus on the role of hormones and cell differences. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Also there has been a tendency in MS research to focus on white patients because MS was generally considered a disease affecting people from a white European or North American background. However, there has been increasing evidence this is not the case at all. MS is a genetically diverse disease. But the big international trials continue to focus on studying people from white ethnic backgrounds. </span></span><u><a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/research/explore-our-research/search-our-research-projects/which-genes-people-different-ancestral" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The Adams Study</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, conducted by Professor Ruth Dobson and Dr Ben Jacobs, is hoping to correct that by investigating how genes from different ethnic backgrounds affect the risk of getting MS.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>You are also involved in funding research yourself, in particular women led research. What led you to establish the </strong></span></span><u><a href="https://www.rachelhorneprize.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Rachel Horne Prize for Women’s Research in MS</strong></span></span></a></u><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think the big trigger point for me was in 2017 when I attended</span></span><a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/research/latest-research/research-blog/ectrims-highlights-2024" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></a><u><a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/research/latest-research/research-blog/ectrims-highlights-2024" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">ECTRIMS</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, the largest annual MS research conference in the world. I noticed how few women neurologists and neuroscientists (less than 30%) were speaking on expert panels. That was a shock. Also, I assumed there would be much more discussion of women’s specific health issues in treating MS, since about 70% of patients who have MS are women. So you imagine my surprise when I didn&apos;t see that at all. I started doing research into this gender gap and realised women neurologists are paid, published and promoted less compared to their male counterparts. They also win far fewer prizes. My answer was to set up an award only for women scientists for their work in focusing on women’s health issues in MS. Less than 20% of the</span></span><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><u><a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/for-professionals/for-researchers/research-funding-opportunities/awards-prizes/barancik" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Barancik Prize</span></span></a></u><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">winners are women; less than 10% of the </span></span><u><a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/for-professionals/for-researchers/research-funding-opportunities/awards-prizes/john-dystel" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">John Dystel Prize</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">, endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology, goes to women; and the Sobek Prize, Europe&apos;s largest MS research award, has never been solely won by a female scientist. The RH Prize, worth US$40,000, is also my way to say to all those women neurologists and neuroscientists working out there - a big thank you. You deserve to be recognised and rewarded for all you do. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Who is the latest winner of the Rachel Horne Prize?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This year&apos;s prize winner was Professor Kerstin Hellwig, a neurologist specialising in pregnancy and MS. When Dr Hellwig came back from maternity leave, she realised she was unable to provide answers to the questions her female patients were asking about pregnancy and MS - such as what MS drugs they could safely take, which ones would allow them to breastfeed and whether they could deliver healthy babies. If you think about it, Dr Hellwig wasn&apos;t just dealing with one patient, she was actually counselling for two - the mother and the child. You can&apos;t afford to make a mistake when it comes to pregnancy. So, she set up the first German MS Pregnancy Register, which now has data on more than 5,000 pregnancies. For the first time, clinicians were able to refer to that and see what has worked and what was unsuccessful. She&apos;s also been pushing drug companies to do trials for women while they are pregnant. I think she was an incredibly popular choice among researchers, but also among women with MS. Because, you know, up until very recently women with MS were told by their neurologists not to have children. Now we know we can - but we want to be able to do it safely and with confidence.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>That shows how important it is to develop and share new resources so that everyone can benefit from the information. Speaking of novelties, how do you think the field is changing and advancing?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I do believe, and I hope I&apos;m not being naïve, that there is change in the air. In recent years, we have seen globally an assault on women&apos;s healthcare rights and we have sadly realised we can’t take anything for granted. We must be vigilant. That’s why I am so appreciative of all the young women scientists coming through, being aware and calling out sexism and misogyny in medicine. I also think there has been a shift in the amount of research looking at women&apos;s issues, especially in MS. For example, one area that I have actually started looking into is MS and domestic violence and abuse (read Rachel’s recent article</span></span><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span><u><a href="https://www.neurologylive.com/view/hiding-plain-sight-ms-domestic-violence-abuse" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">here</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">). We know women are much more likely to be victims (and survivors) of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) and we know that people who are disabled are also at greater risk - yet, research into this complex issue is almost non-existent. So, I have funded the </span></span><u><a href="https://msdva.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">MS Domestic Violence and Abuse Research Initiative</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> at the University of Leeds and Nottingham to find out more. This includes how health care professionals can recognise DVA in their MS patients and how best to support them.  </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Thank you for talking about this. It reminds us that a person is often experiencing much more than just their condition. Our issues are complex, and they intersect with one another, so they should be looked at as such, even by researchers, scientists and doctors.  </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I agree. I mean, on one hand, it&apos;s difficult. Most people with MS see their neurologist for just 15 minutes a year. We also ask a lot from our MS nurses. On top of that, we also have an overstretched healthcare system. But as you said, I think we should see if we can pivot and have a system which has a more holistic and intersectional approach. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>To conclude, is there anything that you&apos;re particularly excited about that you see happening in the field?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Yes, absolutely. One thing I am really excited about is research around social determinants of health and MS. We always talk about the postcode lottery when it comes to healthcare. Why do some people get better treatment in the UK versus others? What can we do to make it equal? Is care dictated by a person’s education, gender, ethnic background, age or where they live? Or all of these? We need to pick these things apart and ask “what can we do to try and make it better and more equal for all patients.”  </span></span></p>

<p>A psychology journal has retracted an article on IQ tests nearly 50 years after publication — and more than 35 years after an investigation found the lead author had fabricated data in several other studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stephen Breuning, a former assistant professor of child psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.2881355">gained notoriety</a> after a 1987 National Institute of Mental Health <a href="https://legacyfileshare.elsevier.com/legal/NIMH-Breuning-Investigation-final-report.pdf">report</a> found that he “knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly engaged in misleading and deceptive practices in reporting results of research.” The report concluded Breuning had “engaged in serious scientific misconduct” by fabricating results in 10 articles funded by NIMH grants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five of Breuning’s articles published in the 1980s have been retracted; three in the 1980s, one in 2022, and another in 2023. Retraction Watch reported on one of them, “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/13/in-1987-the-nih-found-a-paper-contained-fake-data-it-was-just-retracted/">Effects of methylphenidate on the fixed-ratio performance of mentally retarded children</a>,” published in 1983 in <em>Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior </em>(now published by Elsevier) and retracted in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The newly retracted article predates those papers. Published in 1978 in the <em>Journal of School Psychology</em>,&nbsp; “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022440578900043?via%3Dihub">Effects of individualized incentives on norm-referenced IQ test performance of high school students in special education classes</a>,” found record albums, sporting event tickets, portable radios, and other incentives boosted scores on IQ tests.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130811"></span>



<p>To many, including research psychologist Russell Warne, who has been investigating Breuning’s work since late 2021, these seemingly simple results appeared “too good to be true.” In early 2022, Warne emailed the journal’s editor-in-chief Craig Albers, raising concerns about the article&#8217;s validity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, nearly three years later, the journal, an Elsevier title, has retracted the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022440578900043?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a>, issued in December 2024, acknowledged the NIMH investigation, and continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Within this Journal of School Psychology article, the research was reported to have been conducted in seven suburban Chicago high schools across four school districts. Although the above article was not part of the NIMH investigation as it fell outside the scope of NIMH funded research, the NIMH Panel report identified an ongoing pattern of scientific misconduct by Dr. Breuning that introduces substantial concerns regarding the trustworthiness of this article. Despite several attempts, Dr. Breuning has not responded to requests for an explanation. The co-author confirmed that he (the co-author) was only involved in statistical analysis and not in data collection. This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief due to concerns about the integrity of the data reported and other issues identified within the NIMH Final Report that clearly established a pattern of ongoing scientific misconduct.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we reached out to Albers for comment, an Elsevier spokesperson responded with a statement that reiterated the retraction notice. We followed up to ask why it took several years to issue the retraction, and they said via email, “The journal team took all necessary steps during the investigation, including notifying the author, which can often cause delays before the final decision is made.”</p>



<p>Warne said he believes several factors contributed to the delay, including Albers’s recent appointment as editor and his initial email being mistakenly sent to the wrong folder. “I don&#8217;t know why it takes so long, and I really wish the COPE ethics guidelines would put recommended deadlines,” Warne said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In <a href="https://russellwarne.com/2022/01/25/unfinished-business-breuning-fraud-case-left-articles-unretracted/">January</a> and <a href="https://russellwarne.com/2022/02/22/more-articles-by-stephen-breuning-that-need-retraction/">February 2022</a>, Warne published blog posts outlining Breuning’s unretracted and potentially fraudulent work, including studies that weren’t part of NIMH’s 1980s investigation because they had different funding sources. This research led him to Breuning’s 1978 article.</p>



<p>Among several concerns, the most striking to Warne was the rapid speed and scale of the experiments, as well as the results showing significant IQ score increases with such simple incentives. He said, “If it were that easy to raise IQ, I think we would know that by now.”</p>



<p>While gathering evidence, Warne also spoke with the study’s co-author, William Zella. Breuning and Zella were in graduate school at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the 1970s, and Zella told Warne that Breuning had enlisted him as a coauthor to analyze the data and assist with the write-up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Warne spoke with him, Zella “agreed that the study probably never happened.” More than four decades had passed since the study was conducted, so understandably, Zella could not recall many details. “He was not pleased that his co-author classmate from graduate school decades before had done this and that his name was attached to it,” Warne said. Zella clarified that he had no involvement in administering the tests or coordinating the volunteers.</p>



<p>In the 1980s, Breuning made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/us/us-study-finds-fraud-in-top-researcher-s-work-onmentally-retarded.html">major headlines</a>, but since then, his name has largely faded away. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/380979">1990 study</a> by Eugene Garfield and Alfred Welljams-Dorof found Breuning’s work was largely rejected by the academic community. While Breuning&#8217;s research was cited often, few articles were in agreement with his methods or findings.</p>



<p>But his unretracted work remains in the scientific record and is still cited in meta-analyses and other studies. Breuning and Zella’s 1978 article has been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%E2%80%9CEffects+of+individualized+incentives+on+norm-referenced+IQ+test+performance+of+high+school+students+in+special+education+classes&amp;btnG=">cited 12 times</a>, according to Clarviate’s Web of Science. And a 2011 meta-analysis in <em>PNAS</em>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21518867/">&#8220;Role of test motivation in intelligence testing,&#8221;</a> includes data from the paper and has been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=Role+of+test+motivation+in+intelligence+testing&amp;btnG=">cited more than 200 times</a>. Breuning’s work significantly influenced the results of that meta-analysis, Warne said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warne said he has reached out to the lead author, Angela Lee Duckworth, and to <em>PNAS</em>, and was informed by the publisher that the journal is investigating the matter. When Retraction Watch reached out to <em>PNAS </em>for comment, Prashant Nair from the news office responded via email with the same sentiment: “We are aware of the matter and looking into it.”</p>



<p>Warne believes the journal should first publish an expression of concern to clarify that Duckworth and her co-authors are not at fault.</p>



<p>Warne sees Duckworth and her collaborators, as well as Breuning’s coauthor Zella, as victims of Breuning’s fraud. One of Warne’s primary objectives in all of this is to highlight how long-buried fraudulent articles can continue to cause harm and “re-victimize people.”</p>

<p>A case of mistaken identity among sharks has led to a correction that changed, among other content, an article’s title, its abstract and the discussion section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, published in February 2024 in <em>Environmental Biology of Fishes</em>, was originally titled “Expanded vertical niche for two species of pelagic sharks: depth range extension for the dusky shark <em>Carcharhinus obscurus</em> and novel twilight zone occurrence by the silky shark <em>Carcharhinus falciformi</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But after re-examining the data, the authors concluded: “the dusky shark from the published paper was misidentified, and instead, it is most likely a bignose shark,” according to an <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-024-01610-6">October 2024 correction</a> to the article.</p>



<span id="more-130815"></span>



<p>The title is now “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-024-01527-0">Novel deep-sea observations reveal twilight zone occurrence for two species of pelagic sharks: the bignose shark <em>Carcharhinus altimus</em> and the silky shark <em>Carcharhinus falciformis</em>.</a>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The changes to the title amend the name of the shark and revoke the range extension for the dusky shark. The updated species ID also required changes in the abstract, paragraphs in the introduction, results, and discussion, a figure caption, and references. The original text, including its original title, is no longer available online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article has been cited twice, once under each version of the title. The journal is indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Olivia Dixon, the research coordinator at <a href="https://beneaththewaves.org/people/">Beneath the Waves</a> and corresponding author of the study, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://umanitoba.ca/science/directory/biological-sciences/margaret-docker">Margaret Docker</a>, a professor at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, was editor-in-chief at the time of the correction. In an email to <em>Retraction Watch</em>, she justified the issuing of a correction rather than a retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[E]ven though the original identification of a dusky shark led to an erroneous depth range extension for this species,” Docker said, “in consultation with the authors and Advisory Editor, we felt that enough of the original study was still valid that correcting the misidentification was more appropriate than retracting the whole paper.”</p>



<p>Springer Nature’s <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/editorial-policies/corrections-and-retractions?srsltid=AfmBOooNYAA8C7Bfhcxi7pDbEYP5wpO3jBim6M_q8gRjehcYHRl6BMs-">policy</a> on retractions and corrections addresses cases of scientific misconduct, but not cases of mistaken species identification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In most of the corrections, “the bulk of these sections were unchanged,” Docker said, and the second species, the silky shark, “was not affected at all.”&nbsp;</p>
