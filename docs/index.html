                <p>The idea that meditation is a "mind science" is popular, but in this interview Canadian philosopher Evan Thompson argues that this claim does not stand up to either scientific or philosophical scrutiny. As one of the pioneers of the Embodied Cognition movement Thompson reminds us that the Mind is not restricted to the Brain and we must also consider how other recent discoveries in neuroscience fail to support the claim that meditation provides neutral scientific insight into how the Mind really works.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li>Evan Thompson's <a href="https://evanthompson.me" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">website</a></li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Oj0f7g" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Why I am not a Buddhist</em></a> by Evan Thompson</li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Oj0f7g" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers</em></a> by Kwame Anthony Appiah</li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3N7Vwmr" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience</em></a> by Francisco J.

<h5><strong>Background</strong></h5>



<p>For much of ancient Roman history, Roman mints produced coins featuring portraits of current emperors. In 1713, a group of such coins was allegedly discovered in Transylvania, some of them featuring a portrait labeled with the name &ldquo;Sponsian,&rdquo; although there are no other historical records that a Roman emperor named Sponsian ever existed.</p>

<p>While the Transylvanian coins follow the general style of mid-third century Roman coins, they diverge in certain stylistic characteristics and in how they were manufactured, leading many experts to dismiss them as forgeries created to sell to collectors. However, the coins are also uncharacteristic of the forgeries that would have been of interest to past collectors. Additionally, in 1713, &ldquo;Sponsian&rdquo; was not yet known to be a name that had ever existed in ancient Rome.</p>



<h5><strong>Study Design and Findings</strong></h5>



<p>To further investigate the Transylvanian coins&rsquo; authenticity, Pearson and colleagues conducted a deeper assessment of the physical characteristics of four of the coins, including the Sponsian coin. They applied visible light microscopy, ultra-violet imaging, scanning electron microscopy, and reflection mode Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy to the four coins and, for comparison, two undoubtedly authentic Roman gold coins.</p>



<p>The analysis revealed deep micro-abrasion patterns typically associated with coins that were in circulation for an extensive period of time. The researchers also analyzed earthen deposits on the coins, finding evidence that after extensive circulation, the coins were buried for a prolonged period before being exhumed. Together, the new evidence strongly suggests the coins are authentic.</p>



<h5><strong>Conclusions</strong></h5>



<p>Considering the historical record alongside the new evidence from the coins, the researchers suggest that Sponsian was an army commander in the Roman Province of Dacia during a period of military strife in the 260s CE.</p>



<p>Lead author of the paper, Paul N. Pearson of University College, London, adds: &ldquo;Scientific analysis of these ultra-rare coins rescues the emperor Sponsian from obscurity. Our evidence suggests he ruled Roman Dacia, an isolated gold mining outpost, at a time when the empire was beset by civil wars and the borderlands were overrun by plundering invaders.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Curator of Numismatics at The Hunterian, Jesper Ericsson, adds: &ldquo;This has been a really exciting project for The Hunterian. Not only do we hope that this encourages further debate about Sponsian as a historical figure, but also the investigation of coins relating to him held in other museums across Europe.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-bright-blazar-space">Here’s why some supermassive black holes blaze so brightly</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed how certain supermassive black holes launch jets of high-energy particles into space — and the process is shocking.</p>



<p>Shock waves propagating along the jet of one such blazar <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05338-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contort magnetic fields that accelerate escaping particles</a> to nearly the speed of light, astronomers report November 23 in <em>Nature</em>. Studying such extreme acceleration can help probe fundamental physics questions that can’t be studied any other way.</p>



<p>Blazars are active black holes that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/source-blazars-super-brightness-comes-focus">shoot jets of high-energy particles toward Earth</a>, making them appear as bright spots from millions or even billions of light-years away (<em>SN: 7/14/15</em>). Astronomers knew that the jets’ extreme speeds and tight columnated beams had something to do with the shape of magnetic fields around black holes, but the details were fuzzy.</p>





<p>Enter the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer, or IXPE, an orbiting telescope launched in December 2021. Its mission is to measure X-ray polarization, or how X-ray light is oriented as it travels through space. While previous blazar observations of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">polarized radio waves and optical light</a> probed parts of jets days to years after they’d been accelerated, polarized X-rays can see into a blazar’s active core (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>“In X-rays, you’re really looking at the heart of the particle acceleration,” says astrophysicist Yannis Liodakis of the University of Turku in Finland. “You’re really looking at the region where everything happens.”</p>



<p>In March 2022, IPXE looked at an especially bright blazar called Markarian 501, located about 450 million light-years from Earth.</p>



<p>Liodakis and colleagues had two main ideas for how magnetic fields might accelerate Markarian 501’s jet. Particles could be boosted by magnetic reconnection, where magnetic field lines break, reform and connect with other nearby lines. The same process <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">accelerates plasma on the sun</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>). If that was the particle acceleration engine, the polarization of light should be the same along the jet in all wavelengths, from radio waves to X-rays.</p>



<p>Another option is a shock wave shooting particles down the jet. At the site of the shock, the magnetic fields suddenly switch from turbulent to ordered. That switch could send particles zooming away, like water through the nozzle of a hose. As the particles leave the shock site, turbulence should take over again. If a shock was responsible for the acceleration, short wavelength X-rays should be more polarized than longer wavelength optical and radio light, as measured by other telescopes.</p>

The inset illustrates how particles in the jet hit a shock wave (white) and get boosted to extreme speeds, emitting high-energy X-ray light. As they lose energy, the particles emit lower energy light in visible, infrared and radio wavelengths (purple and blue), and the jet becomes more turbulent.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119559">Pablo Garcia/MSFC/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s exactly what the researchers saw, Liodakis says. “We got a clear result,” he says, that favors the shock wave explanation.</p>



<p>There is still work to do to figure out the details of how the particles flow, says astrophysicist James Webb of Florida International University in Miami. For one, it’s not clear what would produce the shock. But “this is a step in the right direction,” he says. “It’s like opening a new window and looking at the object freshly, and we now see things we hadn’t seen before. It’s very exciting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2022/11/23/eeg-microstates-functional-significance-and-short-term-test-retest-reliability.html">EEG Microstates: Functional Significance and Short-Term Test-Retest Reliability</a></h4>

              
                <p>This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper &quot;EEG Microstates: Functional Significance and Short-Term Test-Retest Reliability&quot; and his related work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>EEG microstates, reflecting discrete topographical organization of the EEG
signal power, may have clinical relevance; however, their functional
significance and test-retest reliability remain unclear. To investigate the
functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes and their
pairwise transitions, and to establish their within-session test-retest
reliability, we recorded 36-channel EEGs in 20 healthy volunteers during three
eyes-closed conditions: mind-wandering, verbalization (silently repeating the
word 'square' every 2 s), and visualization (visualizing a square every 2 s).
Each condition lasted 3 min and the sequence of three conditions was repeated
four times (two runs of two sequence repetitions). The participants' alertness
and their sense of effort during the experiment were rated using
visual-analogue scales. The EEG data were 2textendash 20 Hz bandpassfiltered
and analysed into the four canonical microstate classes: A, B, C, and D. EEG
microstate classes C and D were persistently more dominant than classes A and B
in all conditions. Of the first-order microstate param- eters, average
microstate duration was most reliable. The duration of class D microstate was
longer during mindwandering (106.8 ms) than verbalization (102.2 ms) or
visualization (99.8 ms), with a concomitantly higher coverage (36.4% vs.
34.7% and 35.2%), but otherwise there was no clear association of the four
microstate classes to particular mental states. The test-retest reliability was
higher at the beginning of each run, together with higher average alpha power
and subjective ratings of alertness. Only the transitions between classes C and
D (from C to D in particular) were significantly higher than what would be
expected from the respective micro- states' occurrences. The transition
probabilities, however, did not distinguish between conditions, and their
testretest reliability was overall lower than that of the first-order
parameters such as duration and coverage. Further studies are needed to
establish the functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes.
This might be more fruitfully achieved by looking at their complex syntax
beyond pairwise transitions. To ensure greater testretest reliability of
microstate parameters, study designs should allow for shorter experimental runs
with regular breaks, particularly when using EEG microstates as clinical
biomarkers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rats-bop-their-heads-to-the-beat-music">Rats can bop their heads to the beat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans aren’t the only animals known to move to a musical beat.</p>



<p>For instance, parrots do it, too. And now rats have been observed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo7019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bopping their heads</a> in time with the music of Mozart, Lady Gaga, Queen and others, researchers report on November 11 in <em>Science Advances</em>. </p>



<p>What’s more, the animals seem to respond to the same tempos that get humans’ feet tapping. The study could help reveal the evolutionary foundations of humans’ sense of rhythm.</p>





<p>“Some of us believe that music is very special to human culture. But I believe that its origin is somehow inherited from our progenitors,” says Hirokazu Takahashi, a mechanical engineer at the University of Tokyo, who studies how the brain works.</p>



<p>The ability to recognize the beat of a song and synchronize the movements of one’s body to it is known as beat synchronization. It’s a mystery why some species, like humans and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-bust-move-musical-beats">parrots</a>, have the innate ability and others do not (<em>SN: 4/30/09</em>).</p>



<p>For rats in the lab, Takahashi and his colleagues put on Mozart’s “Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major” (K. 448). The team sped up and slowed the tempo, as well as played it at its normal speed, observing the rats’ motions not only visually, but also with wireless accelerometers, which were surgically placed on the rats.</p>



<p>The team initially thought that body size might determine the tempos that triggered any head bopping. Humans tend to prefer foot tapping to music that’s between 120 to 140 beats per minute, but a small animal like a rat would probably need a quicker tempo to get that same reaction, the researchers hypothesized.</p>



<p>“There’s lots of reasons to think maybe [rats] would prefer faster rhythms. But that’s not what they found. And that’s intriguing,” says Aniruddh Patel, a psychologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., who was not involved in this research. He studies music cognition, the mental processes involved in perceiving and responding to music.</p>



<p>In the video recordings, the rats’ head bobbing was more pronounced when the sonata played at its usual tempo, around 132 beats per minute. The same was true for 20 people who listened through headphones with accelerometers.</p>





<p>For both humans and rats, the head bopping was consistent at about 120 to 140 bpm. When the music was played faster or slower, then there was no head bopping. That suggests that there is something fundamental about how the animal brain is tuned or wired to respond to rhythm, Takahashi says.</p>



<p>The team also played some of their favorite pop songs for the rats, including Lady Gaga&#8217;s &#8220;Born This Way&#8221; and Michael Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Beat It,&#8221; and saw a similar response.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Mice bob their heads along to music like people do | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8fmN2zAD0R4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>Researchers used motion capture cameras to track how rats move to a musical beat. The colored dots indicate markers that helped the cameras track the rodent’s subtle movements as it hears different musical pieces, including a Mozart piano sonata and Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way.”</figcaption></figure>



<p>While Patel agrees that rats seem to prefer beats that humans like, he is not convinced that the rats can synchronize to the beat like humans do.</p>



<p>“I think that that study actually raises more questions than answers in some sense,” Patel says. Humans and parrots show beat synchronicity through big, voluntary movements like head bobbing, dancing or foot tapping. The rats displayed very tiny movements that needed to be captured with special devices like a head-mounted accelerometer and motion capture technology. </p>



<p>The behavior was also more observable when the researchers lured the rats to stand on their back legs by putting their water bottle up high, compared with being on all fours.</p>



<p>“The fundamental nature of beat perception and synchronization is that you predict the timing of the beat and you move predictably” he says. “So, we land right on beat or a little ahead of it.” Since the rats’ movements are so tiny, it’s not clear if rats can predict the beats or if they’re just reacting to it.</p>



<p>Both Takahashi and Patel stress that this study does <em>not</em> show that rats like to dance to human music. “Music stimulus is very appealing to the brain,” Takahashi says. “But it is not evidence [that] they enjoy or they perceive music.”</p>



<p>Next, Takahashi is looking to see what other aspects of music we might share with rodents and other animals. “I&#8217;d like to maybe reveal how other properties, like melody and harmony, also relate to the dynamics of the brain.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-monkeys-remains-ancient-diplomacy-maya-mexico">A spider monkey’s remains tell a story of ancient diplomacy in the Americas</a></h4>

              
                <p>A sacrificed spider monkey is shedding new light on an ancient Mesoamerican relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The remains of a 1,700-year-old monkey found in the ancient city of Teotihuacan outside modern-day Mexico City suggest the primate was a diplomatic gift from the Maya. The find is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2212431119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the earliest evidence of a primate held in captivity in the Americas</a>, researchers report November 21 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unearthed in 2018 at the base of a pyramid in Teotihuacan, the monkey’s skeleton lay beside the corpses of other animals — including an eagle and several rattlesnakes — in an area of the city where visiting Maya elites may have resided.</p>





<p>Evidence of animal sacrifices, including of predators like jaguars, have been found in the city before. But “up to that point, we did not have any instances of sacrificed primates in Teotihuacan,” says Nawa Sugiyama, an anthropological archaeologist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>



<p>Chemical analysis of the spider monkey’s bones and teeth showed that the female had likely been captured in a humid environment at a young age sometime in the third century. The monkey then lived in captivity for a few years before meeting her end between the years 250 and 300.</p>



<p>The highlands around Mexico City are a long way from the natural habitat of spider monkeys (<em>Ateles geoffroy</em>), which require wet tropical forests to thrive. This fact, along with the presence of Maya murals and vessels, suggests to Sugiyama and her colleagues that the spider monkey was a gift from elite Mayas to the people of Teotihuacan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The find is an example of diplomatic relations between two cultures that sometimes had violent interactions. Maya hieroglyphs indicated that military forces from Teotihuacan invaded the Maya city of Tikal in 378, marking the start of a roughly 70-year period in which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lasers-lidar-mexican-pyramid-maya-teotihuacan-temple-feathered-serpent-tikal">Teotihuacan meddled in Maya politics</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>The “striking” discovery of the monkey shows that relationship between these two cultures far predates the invasion, says David Stuart, an archaeologist and epigraphist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“The war of 378 had a long history leading up to it,” he says. “The monkey is a really compelling illustration of this long relationship.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marsupials-complex-social-lives-evolution">Long considered loners, many marsupials may have complex social lives</a></h4>

              
                <p>Marsupials may have richer social lives than previously thought.</p>



<p>Generally considered loners, the pouched animals have <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide diversity of social relationships</a> that have gone unrecognized, a new analysis published October 26 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em> suggests. The findings could have implications for how scientists think about the lifestyles of early mammals.</p>



<p>“These findings are helpful to move us away from a linear thinking that used to exist in some parts of evolutionary theory, that species develop from supposedly simple into more complex forms,” says Dieter Lukas, an evolutionary ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who was not involved with the study.</p>





<p>Mammals run the gamut of social organization systems, ranging from loose, ephemeral interactions like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jaguars-brazil-wetland-huge-numbers-fish-hunt-play">aggregations of jaguars</a> in the South American wetlands to the antlike subterranean societies of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/naked-mole-rats-colonies-territory-pups">naked mole-rats</a> (<em>SN: 10/13/21</em>; <em>SN: 10/20/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But marsupials — a subgroup of mammals that give birth to relatively underdeveloped young reared in pouches — have traditionally been considered largely solitary. Some kangaroo species were known to form transient or permanent groups of dozens of individuals. But among marsupials, long-term bonds between males and females were thought rare and there were no known examples of group members cooperating to raise young. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1238677" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous work</a> on patterns of mammalian social evolution regarded about 90 percent of examined marsupial species to be solitary.</p>



<p>“If you look at other [studies] about some specific species, you will see [the researchers] tend to assume that the marsupials are solitary,” says Jingyu Qiu, a behavioral ecologist at CNRS in Strasbourg, France.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Sorting social lives</h4>



<p>Qiu and her colleagues developed a database of field studies that illuminated marsupial social organization, taking into account how populations vary within a species and delving into the evolutionary history of marsupial social lives. The researchers compiled data from 120 studies on 149 populations of 65 marsupial species, categorizing each population as solitary, living in pairs — such as one male and one female — or falling into four kinds of group living, including one male and multiple females (or vice versa), multiple males and females, or single sex groups.</p>



<p>While 19 species, or 31 percent of those studied, appear to go strictly solo, nearly half of the species always live in pairs or groups. The team also found lots of variation within species; 27 of the 65 species — more than 40 percent — fell into multiple social organization classifications.</p>





<p>When the researchers looked at this social variation against climatic conditions in Australia, they found that social variability was more common in drier environments with less predictable rainfall. It’s possible that being able to switch between solitary and group living acts as a buffer against resource unpredictability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers’ focus on social flexibility “highlights that there is nothing simple even about a supposedly solitary species,” Lukas says.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Implications for the earliest mammals</h4>



<p>Qiu and her colleagues also ran computer analyses comparing the evolutionary relationships of the marsupials with how they form social relationships. This let the team predict the social organization of the earliest marsupials, which split from placental mammals about 160 million years ago. Because modern marsupials have been considered solitary, the marsupial ancestors — and the earliest mammals on the whole — have generally been assumed to be solitary as well.</p>



<p>The team found that solitary was the most likely social category of the ancestral marsupials, a 35 percent probability. But Qiu points out that the varied combinations where pair and group living are possible options make up the other 65 percent. So “it is more likely that the ancestor was also non-solitary,” she says. The findings also give insights into the range of possible lifestyles experienced by the earliest mammals, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Robert Voss, a mammalogist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, questions the analyses’ insights about a potentially social ancestral marsupial. The uncertainty about the solitary alternative, he says, is largely due to the researchers’ benchmarks for what does and what doesn’t constitute social behavior — thresholds that Voss views as too permissive. For example, Voss disagrees with the team’s characterization of opossum social organization.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Anecdotal observations of [members of the same species] occasionally denning together is not compelling evidence for social behavior,” says Voss. &#8220;None of the cited studies suggest that opossums are anything other than solitary.”</p>



<p>Future work, Qiu says, will involve gathering data on a larger subset of mammals outside of marsupials to get a clearer picture of how social traits have evolved among mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-improve-urinal-nautilus-shell">How physics can improve the urinal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Restroom visitors can expect cleaner knees and tidier floors, if they happen to use a new urinal inspired by curves in nature.</p>



<p>The key to making <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/U12.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a splashless urinal</a> is ensuring that a person’s pee stream hits the porcelain at a shallow angle no matter where it is aimed, researchers report November 22 at the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in Indianapolis. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“For a small enough angle, there is no splash,” says mechanical engineer Zhao Pan of the University of Waterloo in Canada. Pan calls the angle where splashing ceases “the critical angle.” Keeping the angle that a fluid strikes the surface at the critical angle or lower prevents the splash.</p>





<p>Pan and colleagues’ design — a tall, narrow urinal with a curving inner surface — employs the same geometry as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-shell-spirals">nautilus shell</a> (<em>SN: 4/1/05</em>). “There’s a smooth flow across the surface,” says Waterloo mechanical engineering student Kaveeshan Thurairajah, which prevents droplets from flying out.</p>



<p>In experiments involving dyed fluids sprayed into conventional urinals, the team found significant splash that, in the real world, would have ended up on a person’s legs and feet and on the floor nearby. When the researchers repeated the experiments with prototypes of the new design and inspected the surrounding surfaces, “I couldn’t find even a single droplet,” Thurairajah says.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether people using the new urinals will still somehow find a way to make a mess. To tell how well the urinals work in eventual real-world tests, Pan says, “just look at the floor.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on Monday, November 21, 2022</p>



<p>San Francisco-&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unam.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Universidad Nacional Autonoma Mexico</a>&nbsp;(UNAM) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Public Library of Science</a>&nbsp;(PLOS) today announced a one-year agreement,&nbsp;brokered by <a href="https://www.accucoms.com/">Accucoms</a> (PLOS&rsquo; regional representative),that will allow UNAM researchers to publish in&nbsp;<em>PLOS ONE</em> and other select PLOS journals<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> without incurring article processing charges (APC). <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-iii-flat-fees/">Flat fee agreements</a> and PLOS&rsquo; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">other models</a> shift publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history and anticipated future growth with PLOS. The agreement with UNAM starts on January 1, 2023.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to be collaborating with UNAM, our first flat fee institution in Mexico, which furthers our global outreach that will continue on through Latin America,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the largest research institution in Mexico, UNAM is uniquely well-positioned to demonstrate the benefits of Open Access publishing and Open Research practices.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Dr Susana Lopez Charreton, a virology researcher from the Biotechnology Institute of the UNAM, comments, &ldquo;This agreement is great news for UNAM researchers as it helps to bring their findings to a wider audience in excellent OA journals. It is not uncommon to resort to publishing our work in other, less prestigious journals due to APC payments that are often too high for the budgets we have. The opportunity to publish in the PLOS family will greatly benefit our research.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Dr. Alejandro Zentella-Dehesa, a cancer cell biologist and principal investigator of the department of Genomic Medicine and Environmental Toxicology of the Institute for Biomedical Research of the Autonomous National University of Mexico (UNAM), said &ldquo;Incorporation of UNAM to this agreement with PLOS will help a lot to communicate the results generated in original research as the final step of the academic activity of university researchers. UNAM is one of the most prominent and productive academic institutions in Latin America with an active and significant number of publications in all fields of scientific and humanistic research. However, publication of high-quality manuscripts in international journals with demanding peer review committees is frequently hampered by a combination of high publication fees and budget limitations. This agreement between UNAM and PLOS represents a valuable opportunity for UNAM researchers to publish high quality results in journals from this prestigious editorial group, free from budget limitations. All this will contribute to make knowledge generated at UNAM available to the international community.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It is exciting to see and be part of the early developments towards OA publishing agreements in Latin America, and to work closely with UNAM as a pioneer institution in the region in this aspect. I&rsquo;m happy to have been able to facilitate conversations between PLOS and UNAM to reach this important and unprecedented agreement, that will undoubtedly serve as an example for many other institutions in Mexico and Latin America in the years to come,&rdquo; said Anouk Snijders, Commercial Manager Latin America at Accucoms.</p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; Flat Fee model enables APC-free publishing with many of PLOS&rsquo; titles, which creates efficiency and reduces administrative overhead for managing gold APC funds. UNAM and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.</p>



<p>UNAM joins a growing list of institutions to sign agreements with PLOS. Others include the <a href="https://consortium.ch/?lang=en">Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries</a> (CSAL), the <a href="https://btaa.org/">Big Ten Academic Alliance</a>, the University of California system, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester), <a href="http://nerl.org/">&nbsp;NorthEast Research Libraries</a> (NERL) and the <a href="https://www.crl.edu/">Center for Research Libraries</a>, the Canadian Research Knowledge Network <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a> to support their researchers through publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> last year honored PLOS as the co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/device-electric-field-scare-sharks-fishing-hooks">These devices use an electric field to scare sharks from fishing hooks</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new gadget takes advantage of sharks’ sixth sense to send the fish scurrying away from deadly hooks.</p>



<p>Sharks, rays and their relatives can detect tiny electric fields, thanks to bulbous organs concentrated near their heads called ampullae of Lorenzini. So researchers developed SharkGuard, a cylindrical device that attaches to fishing lines just above the hook and emits a pulsing, short-range electric field. The <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01427-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">device successfully deters sharks</a> and rays, probably by temporarily overwhelming their sensory system, the scientists report November 21 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>While many people are afraid of sharks, the fear makes more sense the other way around; numerous shark species are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-ocean-fish-population-recovery-extinction">at risk of extinction</a>, largely due to human activities (<em>SN: 11/10/22</em>).</p>



<p>One major problem facing sharks and rays is bycatch, where the creatures get accidentally snagged by fishermen targeting other fish like tuna, says David Shiffman, a marine biologist and faculty research associate at Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>



<p>Whether sharks and rays would be repelled or attracted by the electric fields generated by SharkGuard devices was an open question. The animals use their extra sense when hunting to detect the small electrical fields given off by prey. So marine biologist Rob Enever of Fishtek Marine, a conservation engineering company&nbsp;in Dartington, England, and his colleagues sent out two fishing vessels in the summer of 2021 — both outfitted with some normal hooks and some hooks with SharkGuard — and had them fish for tuna.</p>



<p>In short, the sharks wanted nothing to do with the SharkGuard gadgets. Video reveals blue sharks approaching a hook with SharkGuard and veering away with no apparent harm. When encountering an unadorned hook, sharks took the bait, becoming bycatch.</p>

</div><figcaption>Sharks and their relatives can detect electric fields using organs in the skin called ampullae of Lorenzini. So researchers tested whether attaching a SharkGuard device, which emits a pulse of electricity every two seconds, to a fishing line just above the hook could deter a shark. The results, showing a shark taking the bait of a normal hook but other sharks veering away from hooks with the device, could hold promise for preventing millions of sharks from becoming bycatch.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hooks with the electric repellant reduced catch rates of blue sharks (<em>Prionace glauca</em>) by 91 percent compared with standard hooks, dropping from an average of 6.1 blue sharks caught per 1,000 hooks to 0.5 sharks. And 71 percent fewer pelagic stingrays (<em>Pteroplatytrygon violacea</em>) were caught using SharkGuard hooks, going from seven captured rays per 1,000 hooks on average to two rays.</p>



<p>A typical fishing boat like those used in the study has approximately 10,000 hooks. So a boat whose entire set of hooks were outfitted with SharkGuard would go from catching about 61 blue sharks to 5, and 70 pelagic rays to 20.</p>





<p>When you scale those numbers up to the millions of sharks and rays that are accidentally caught in longline fisheries every year, Enever says, “you’re going to have massive recovery of these pelagic shark populations.”</p>



<p>“It’s definitely a notable and significant effect,” says Shiffman, who was not involved with the study. “If [the devices] went into effect across the fishing fleet that interacts with blue sharks, it would certainly be good news for [them].”</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean that SharkGuard is ready to be rolled out. Tuna catch rates were unseasonably low across the board in this study, which made it impossible to determine yet whether tuna are also bothered by the device. If they are, it wouldn’t make sense for fishermen to use the device in its current form.</p>



<p>The team is also working to make SharkGuard smaller, cheaper and as easy to manage as possible, so that fishermen can “fit and forget” it. For example, the current battery, which needs to be changed every couple of weeks, will be swapped for one that can be induction charged while the fishing line is not in use, “like a toothbrush, basically,” Enever says.</p>



<p>Shiffman would like to see SharkGuard tested in different environments and on other types of sharks. “There are a lot of shark species that are caught as bycatch on these longlines,” he says.</p>



<p>And while this invention seems effective so far, no technology will serve as a silver bullet for shark conservation. “Fixing this problem of bycatch is going to require a lot of different solutions working in concert,” Shiffman says.</p>



<p>The need for solutions is urgent. “We’re at a situation now where many of our pelagic species are either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable,” Enever says. But the new findings are “a real story of ocean optimism,” he says. They show that “there’s people out there … trying to resolve these things. There’s hope for the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-weakens-lungs-immune-defenses">Pollution mucks up the lungs’ immune defenses over time</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lungs’ immune defenses can wane with age, leaving older adults more susceptible to lung damage and severe bouts of respiratory infections. New research reveals one reason why this might happen: Inhaled particulate matter from pollution <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02073-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gunks up the works over time</a>, weakening the lungs’ immune system, researchers report online November 21 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Air pollution is a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30505-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major cause of disease and early death</a> worldwide and disproportionately <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-neighborhoods-40-years-worst-air-quality-pollution">impacts poor and marginalized communities</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/20</em>). Particulate matter — a type of pollution emitted from vehicle exhaust, power plants, wildfires and other sources — &nbsp;has been tied to health harms including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/list-diseases-linked-air-pollution-growing">respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases</a> (<em>SN: 9/19/17</em>).</p>





<p>In the new study, researchers from Columbia University analyzed lung immune tissue from 84 organ donors, ranging in age from 11 to 93 years old. The donors were nonsmokers or had no history of heavy smoking. With age, the lungs’ lymph nodes — which filter foreign substances and contain immune cells — became loaded with particulate matter, turning them a deep onyx, the research team found.</p>



<p>“If the [lymph nodes] build up with so much material, then they can’t do their job,” says Elizabeth Kovacs, a cell biologist who studies inflammation and injury at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.</p>



<p>The lymph nodes are home to an array of immune cells, including macrophages. These cellular Pac-Mans gobble up pathogens and other debris, including the particulate matter. Filled with the pollutant, the macrophages’ production of cytokines, proteins the cells secrete to activate other immune cells, decreased. The cells also showed signs of having a diminished capacity for more gobbling.</p>



<p>The new study indicates that older people have accumulated so much debris, “they may not be able to accumulate more,” impairing their ability to deal with inhaled material, says Kovacs, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Pollution “is an ongoing and growing threat to the health and livelihood of the world’s population,” the research team writes. Their work finds that threat includes “a chronic and ubiquitous impact” on respiratory immunity with age.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-weird-symptoms-tongue-toe-virus">Got a weird COVID-19 symptom? You’re not alone</a></h4>

              
                <p>As we head into our third pandemic winter, most people are all too familiar with the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> signs of COVID-19</a>. The disease wears many different faces and can show up as chills, cough, difficulty breathing or other troublesome jumbles of symptoms. But sometimes, this illness can look positively peculiar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On rare occasions, SARS-CoV-2 rears its head in body parts not typically touched by respiratory viruses. From head to COVID toe, doctors have seen a bevy of bizarre cases. Patchy tongues, puffy digits, hair loss — such issues can be worrisome for patients, says Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases physician at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>





<p>But the outlook doesn’t have to be. That’s because such symptoms can end up going away on their own, says Chin-Hong, who has treated hundreds of people with COVID-19.</p>



<p>No one knows exactly how often <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/infection/covid-tongue#causes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID tongue</a>, <a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/coronavirus/covid-toes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID toe</a>, <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/is-covid-eye-thing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID eye</a> or other rare conditions occur — and it’s not always clear that COVID-19 is the actual culprit. Still, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-pandemic-long-term-imprint-health">sheer scale of coronavirus infections</a> means that SARS-CoV-2 has had many chances to show its stuff (<em>SN: 9/8/22</em>). The United States is now closing in on<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 98 million confirmed cases</a>. Such a staggering case count means that “statistically speaking, you’re going to find people with more and more weird things,” Chin-Hong says.</p>

<p>Doctors rely on medical case reports for leads on potential treatments and hints about how long symptoms may last. Even just knowing that someone else has had splotchy mouth sores or tender toes can be helpful, Chin-Hong says. That lets him tell his patients, “You’re not the only one,” he says. “That means a lot to a lot of people.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internal medicine doctor Saira Chaughtai published one such study in October in the <em>Journal of Medical Case Reports</em> after one of her primary care patients came in with a symptom Chaughtai had never seen. Ten days after testing positive for COVID-19, the patient’s <a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-022-03519-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tongue began to swell</a>, eventually erupting in white-ringed lesions.</p>



<p>Certain spots looked “denuded,” says Chaughtai, of Hackensack Meridian Health in Neptune, N.J. It was as if some of the tongue’s surface bumps had been sandpapered away. The patient wasn’t someone doctors would typically consider vulnerable, either. She was 30 years old, fit and healthy.</p>



<p>“I was like, ‘Oh my god, COVID can do anything,’” Chaughtai remembers thinking.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Oral sores can look different among patients. Chin-Hong has seen people with tongues coated white, as if they’d chewed a mouthful of tortilla chips. For Chaughtai’s patient, COVID tongue felt sensitive and irritated, with flare-ups that burned. Chaughtai wasn’t sure how to treat it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She searched the scientific literature and prescribed an assortment of mouthwashes, which helped. But six months in, the patient’s tongue hadn’t fully healed. So Chaughtai got creative. She teamed up with a sports medicine doctor, who beamed low-level laser light at the patient’s tongue. He had previously used this photobiomodulation therapy to treat muscle injuries.</p>



<p>Laser light therapy makes blood vessels dilate, enhancing blood flow to treated areas, which could promote healing, Chaughtai says. It seemed to work for her patient. The tongue lesions began to heal and flare-ups subsided. The woman still occasionally feels some tongue sensitivity when stressed, but never as bad as her initial outbreak.</p>



<h4>The effects of COVID toe</h4>



<p>About 1,300 kilometers west, a podiatrist in Crown Point, Ind., also dilated a patient’s blood vessels to treat a curious coronavirus condition: COVID toe. After infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients’ fingers and toes can plump up, sometimes painfully, and turn pink or reddish purple.</p>



<p>“We were seeing cases of these lesions that look like chilblains, which is something you get when you’re exposed to cold weather,” says Michael Nirenberg of Friendly Foot Care. But his patients hadn’t been in the cold — they’d been exposed to the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nirenberg has seen as many as 40 people with the symptom, which he’s found tends to clear up in a month or two. But one of his patients, a 59-year-old man, just couldn’t kick COVID toe. It ultimately lingered for nearly 670 days — the longest documented case Nirenberg has seen. “The term we used was<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cup.14240" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> long COVID toe</a>,” he says. Nirenberg and colleagues reported the case this spring in the <em>Journal of Cutaneous Pathology</em>.&nbsp;</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Nirenberg prescribed daily application of a nitroglycerin ointment to boost blood flow to the toes. That may have helped, Nirenberg says, “but I don’t know if time also did the trick.” After 22 months, the condition may have finally resolved on its own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The number of COVID toes Nirenberg encounters these days has gone down, but he’s still seeing people come in with the condition. And though Chaughtai has not treated another case of COVID tongue, a man recently e-mailed her saying that he had suffered from a similar affliction for two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UCSF’s Chin-Hong says he thinks it’s important for people to know that COVID-19 can cause such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-why-covid-19-hits-differently">a variety of symptoms</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/22</em>). “We can’t really predict who’s going to get what,” he says. But in his experience, strange symptoms have tended to crop up more often in people who haven’t been vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such symptoms may not be as serious as COVID-affected hearts or lungs, but they can certainly look scary, Chin-Hong says. “If this is a reason why some people might get vaccinated,” he says, “I think that would be great.”</p>

<h4>Tell us a bit about yourself</h4>
<p>I am a public health specialist and presently the Director of International Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR), Delhi. I have a rich experience in public health and I am particularly interested in implementation of epidemiological and clinical research based projects centered around Maternal and Child health with great relevance to national policies and programmes.</p>
<p>My goal is to mentor students and young professionals who can be the change agents in future &#8211; those who can see through problems directly or indirectly impacting health, explore them scientifically, and engage in advocacy. I seek to nurture researchers and bring people together who could be effective linkages between disciplines, generate synergy between research and programs and promote interdisciplinary research in the country.</p>
<h4> How does your work relate to the SDGs? Which SDGs specifically?</h4>
<p>Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality. It contributes to low birth-weight infants (birth weight less than 2500 grams), who are prone to deaths and diseases while they are young. Such babies are prone to chronic health problems such as diabetes and heart disease later in life.</p>
<p>Target 2.2 of SDG states that by 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons. The WHO global targets call for a 50% reduction in anaemia in women of reproductive age by 2025 relative to 2010 prevalence. Anaemia affects more than 50% of pregnant women in India.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key modalities towards reduction of prevalence of anemia include accurate diagnosis and institution of proper treatment. Several modalities for diagnosis and treatment of anaemia exist. For instance, oral iron has been a part of national program in India for decades with no major impact. Parenteral iron came to the aid of practitioners who were looking for a viable alternative for management of anaemia in pregnancy. However, it could not be included in the national programs due to paucity of reliable evidence on its effectiveness. This gap paved the way for designing and implementing a randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of parenteral iron sucrose compared to oral iron during pregnancy. The study was supported by WHO, India on the request of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This trial on more than 2,000 women in a pragmatic set up has been the largest ever trial on anemia in pregnancy, not only in India but in the world. The findings resulted in high impact publications that have been instrumental in bringing about an amendment in the national policy. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X19304279?via%3Dihub">1</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-abstract/35/10/1339/5999227?redirectedFrom=fulltext">2</a>, <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1447-0756.2012.02033.x">3</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13224-014-0588-2">4</a>)</p>
<p>For diagnosis of anemia, several invasive and non-invasive devices are in circulation. However, in the absence of robust evidence on efficacy and effectiveness, a country-level policy decision could not be taken. A need was felt to identify an accurate and cost-effective point-of-care device. We conducted Health Technology Assessments on such devices in community settings in collaboration with medical colleges, supported by Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health. The assessment included diagnostic accuracy when used by the grassroots-level functionaries in different weather conditions, operational issues, cost factors and scalability. The findings have helped in revising the national guidelines. (<a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05329-9">5</a>, <a href="https://htain.icmr.org.in/images/pdf/5_Policy_Brief_Hemoglobinometer.pdf">6</a>, <a href="https://jcp.bmj.com/content/69/2/164">7</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398422000367?via%3Dihub">8</a>)</p>
<p>These studies have been instrumental in guiding policies at national, regional and global levels.</p>
<h4>What challenges have you faced in your research? How did you work to overcome these?</h4>
<p>In busy medical colleges, getting hospital staff to get involved in research is quite difficult. Research staffs recruited specifically for the study were also simultaneously engaged in routine hospital work, thus sometimes trading-off with their roles in the study. It required a lot of motivation to support studies where regular hospital staff do not get any direct financial or tangible benefit. Needless to say, hospital staff play an important role in such type of clinical studies. Though their salary structure was guided by the Government norms, which was less than their expectations, the frequent dialogues and get-togethers with the core team throughout the study duration ensured that they remained motivated and committed towards their respective roles in the studies.</p>
<p>Follow up of patients was very critical in these studies but was not very easy as women in India normally visit their parents’ house during birth or give birth at home or in private set ups, rather than in hospitals where they can be monitored. Counselling by the research staff reduced the attrition rate to less than 5%, which otherwise could have been higher.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately it is sheer perseverance and grit that is needed to complete any research study successfully.</p></blockquote>
<p>We undertook the trial when ethical guidelines for conduct of clinical research, particularly trials, were undergoing extensive revisions in India. Frequent changes and lack of timely communications to the medical colleges for some period of time created communication gaps and misunderstandings at all levels. Amidst this confusion, the Ethics Committees also remained indecisive on certain matters, thereby extending the duration of the trial for several months with obvious ramifications in terms of smooth conduct of the study, retaining trained staff, staff attrition and exceeding overall budget of the study.</p>
<p>We were constrained by the budget and hence could not provide additional staff that the hospital wanted. Moreover, the contractual agreements were made for defined time periods and extensions were granted only after all official formalities were over. This led to several breaks in the contracts and we had to devise our internal arrangements to take care of the operational expenses.</p>
<p>Conducting a clinical trial spanning a period of ten years came with its own share of operational difficulties. I vividly remember the days when all the research staff came over demanding for a hike in their salaries. This was compounded by wastage of resources as the trial was halted and extended. Other challenges like study sites reporting about increased workload, the team falling short of meeting the timely deliverables to the Ministry, constraints in formalizing agreements with the state government who had generously supported the study, institutional pressure to recover the funds obtained from internal resources, etc. were encountered during this journey. There were differences of opinion within the team at multiple stages throughout the duration of the trial which, though resolved eventually, added to the many impediments which I had to face as a researcher.</p>
<p>Working on these projects has been a Herculean task in the true sense. However, the constant encouragement of Technical Advisory Group and senior faculty members of our Institute helped us to reach a successful conclusion. No wonder, this project has taught us many things which no textbook can ever match. Ultimately it is sheer perseverance and grit that is needed to complete any research study successfully.</p>
<h4>What does success in achieving the SDGs look like in your field of research?</h4>
<p>India is committed to address the problem of anemia. The flagship program of the Prime Minister, Anemia Mukt Bharat (Anemia Free India), is a testimony to this effect. With a great thrust emanating from political commitment and backed by strong evidence, the whole process of planning and programming for anaemia and its implementation has undergone radical changes. I am sure the momentum thus gained will go a long way in addressing the problem of anemia in the country.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carvings-australia-boab-trees-lost-history">Carvings on Australia’s boab trees reveal a generation’s lost history</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brenda Garstone is on the hunt for her heritage.</p>



<p>Parts of her cultural inheritance are scattered across the Tanami desert in northwestern Australia, where dozens of ancient boab trees are engraved with Aboriginal designs. These tree carvings — called dendroglyphs — could be hundreds or even thousands of years old, yet have received almost no attention from western researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is slowly starting to change. In the winter of 2021, Garstone — who is Jaru, an Aboriginal group from the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia — teamed up with archaeologists to find and document some of these carvings.</p>



<p>For Garstone, the expedition was a bid to piece back together the disparate parts of her identity. These pieces were scattered 70 years ago when Garstone’s mother and three siblings were among the estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children taken from their families by the Australian government. Like many others, the siblings were sent to live at a Christian mission thousands of kilometers from home. It would take decades of effort and a series of unconnected events — including the gift of an heirloom and a researcher’s quest to find out what happened to a missing 19th century European naturalist — for Garstone’s family to reclaim its birthright.</p>

O’Connor</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When the siblings returned to their mother’s homeland as teenagers, their extended family gave Garstone’s aunt, Anne Rivers, a coolamon, a type of shallow dish, decorated with two bottle trees, or boabs. Rivers, who was only 2 months old when she was sent away, was told that the trees were a part of her mother’s Dreaming, the cultural story that connected her and her family to the land.</p>



<p>Now, in a study published October 11 in <em>Antiquity</em>, researchers have <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/art-in-the-bark-indigenous-carved-boab-trees-adansonia-gregorii-in-northwest-australia/A0D28A02BF4966DA6C9611DBE7AC8510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meticulously described 12 boabs with dendroglyphs in the Tanami desert that have links to Jaru culture</a>. And just in time: The clock is ticking for these ancient engravings as their host trees succumb to the ravages of time and growing pressure from livestock and possibly climate change.</p>





<p>The race to document these engravings before it’s too late isn’t just a matter of studying an ancient art form. It’s also a matter of healing the wounds inflicted by policies intended to erase the connection between Garstone’s family and the land.</p>



<p>“To find evidence that ties us to the land has been amazing,” she says. “The puzzle we’ve been trying to piece together is now complete.”</p>



<h4>An outback archive</h4>



<p>Australian boabs (<em>Adansonia gregorii</em>) proved pivotal to this project. Found in the northwestern corner of Australia, boabs are a species of tree easily recognizable by their massive trunks and iconic bottle shape.</p>





<p>Anthropologists have written about the existence of trees carved with Aboriginal symbols in Australia since the early 1900s. These records indicate that people were continuously carving and recarving some trees until at least the 1960s. But compared with other forms of Aboriginal art — such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-key-dating-12000-year-old-aboriginal-rock-art">visually spectacular paintings also found in the area</a> (<em>SN: 2/5/20</em>) — “there does not appear to be a wide general awareness of this art form,” says Moya Smith, curator of anthropology and archaeology at the Western Australia Museum in Perth, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Darrell Lewis has come across his share of carved boabs. The historian and archaeologist now at the University of New England in Adelaide has worked in the Northern Territory for half a century. Lewis has spotted engravings made by cattle drovers, World War II soldiers and Aboriginal peoples. He calls this eclectic bag of engravings “the outback archive” — a physical testament to the people who have made this rugged part of Australia their home.</p>



<p>In 2008, Lewis was searching the Tanami Desert for what he hoped would be his biggest addition to the archive. He’d heard rumors that a cattle drover working in the area a century earlier had found a firearm stashed in a boab marked with the letter “L.” A roughly cast brass plate from the firearm — later bought by the National Museum of Australia — was stamped with the name of the famed German naturalist Ludwig Leichhardt, who disappeared in 1848 while traveling across western Australia.</p>



<p>The Tanami is generally considered to be outside the boab’s natural range. So in 2007, Lewis rented a helicopter and crisscrossed the desert in search of the Tanami’s secret stash of boabs. His flyovers revealed roughly 280 centuries-old boabs and hundreds of younger trees scattered across the desert.</p>



<p>“Nobody, not even locals, really knew there were any boabs out there,” he recalls.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Finding lost boab carvings</h3>



<p>Boab trees grow in the northwestern corner of Australia. A survey (green rectangle) of a region on the edge of the Tanami Desert revealed a patch of boab trees carved with dendroglyphs, which tie the region to the path (gray arrow) of the King Brown Snake Dreaming, or Lingka Dreaming. This ancient trail connects cultural sites and stories across thousands of kilometers and mirrors the journey of Lingka, one of the spiritual beings that shaped the landscape into its present form. &nbsp;</p>

<p>His 2008 ground expedition to find the elusive “L” came up empty-handed. But the search did uncover dozens of boabs marked with dendroglyphs.</p>



<p>In a report for the National Museum of Australia, which had hired him to search for the “L” carving, Lewis recorded the location of these trees. That information sat untouched for years until one day, it fell into the hands of Sue O’Connor, an archaeologist at Australian National University in Canberra.</p>



<h4>Crumble into dust</h4>



<p>In 2018, O’Connor was part of a group of archaeologists who were growing increasingly concerned about the survival of boabs. That year, scientists studying baobabs in Africa — a close relative of boabs — noticed that some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-african-baobabs-are-dying-and-no-one-knows-why">older trees were dying out at a surprisingly high rate</a>, potentially due to climate change (<em>SN: 6/18/18</em>).</p>



<p>The news alarmed O’Connor. Dendroglyphs are often engraved on the largest and oldest boabs. While nobody knowns exactly how old these trees can get, researchers suspect that their lifetimes could be comparable to their African cousins, which can live up to 2,000 years.</p>



<p>When these long-lived trees do die, they pull a disappearing act. Unlike other trees, whose wood can be preserved for hundreds of years after death, boabs have a moist and fibrous interior that can quickly disintegrate. Lewis has witnessed boabs crumble into the dust a couple of years after being struck by lightning.</p>



<p>“You would never know there’d been a tree there,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether Australian boabs are threatened by climate change is unclear. But the trees are coming under attack from livestock, which peel back boabs’ bark to get to the wet interior. “We put all this together and thought we better try and locate some of the carvings because they probably won’t be there in a few years,” says O’Connor.</p>



<p>Lewis’ report provided a good jumping-off point for this work. So O’Connor reached out to the historian and suggested they collaborate.</p>



<p>Around that same time, Garstone was four years into her own research into her family’s heritage. The long and meandering search led her to a small museum that a friend of Lewis’ happened to run. When Garstone mentioned she was from Halls Creek — a town near where Lewis did his fieldwork in 2008 — the curator told her about the carved boabs.</p>



<p>“I was like, ‘What? That’s a part of our Dreaming!’” she recalls.</p>

<p>Dreamings are a western term used to refer to the vast diversity of stories that — among other things — recount how spiritual beings formed the landscape. Dreaming stories also pass down knowledge and inform rules of behavior and social interaction.</p>



<p>Garstone knew from the oral history passed down through her family that her grandmother had ties to the Bottle Tree Dreaming, as indicated by the trees painted on her aunt’s coolamon. The Bottle Tree Dreaming is one of the eastern-most manifestations of the Lingka Dreaming track (Lingka is the Jaru word for the King Brown Snake). This path runs for thousands of kilometers from the western coast of Australia and into the neighboring Northern Territory, marking Lingka’s journey across the landscape and forming a byway for people to travel across the country.</p>



<p>Eager to confirm that the boabs were a part of this Dreaming, Garstone, along with her mother, aunt and a scattering of other family members, joined the archaeologists on their mission to rediscover the boabs.</p>



<h4>Into the Tanami</h4>



<p>On a winter day in 2021, the group set out from the town of Halls Creek and set up camp on a remote pastoral station mainly populated by cattle and feral camels. Every day, the team climbed into all-wheel-drive vehicles and headed out to the last known location of the engraved boabs.</p>



<p>It was hard work. The crew often drove hours to the supposed position of a boab, only to have to stand on top of the vehicles and scan for trees in the distance. What’s more, wooden stakes sticking out of the ground constantly shredded the vehicles’ tires. “We were out there for eight or 10 days,” says O’Connor. “It felt<em> longer</em>.”</p>



<p>The expedition was cut short when they ran out of tires — but not before finding 12 trees with dendroglyphs. To document the finds, the archaeologists took thousands of overlapping pictures, capturing an image of every centimeter of each tree.</p>

Unlike other trees, boabs quickly disintegrate after death, leaving little evidence of their presence behind. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119216">S. O’Connor</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The team also spotted grinding stones and other tools scattered around the base of the trees. Considering that large boabs provide shade in a desert with little cover, the prevalence of these objects suggests that people probably used the trees as resting spots as well as navigational markers while traveling across the desert, the researchers report in their study.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the carvings on the boabs were of emu and kangaroo tracks. But an overwhelming majority of the engravings were of snakes, some of which undulated across the bark while others coiled onto themselves. The knowledge provided by Garstone and her family, along with historical records from the area, points toward the carvings being linked to the King Brown Snake Dreaming. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was surreal,” Garstone says. Seeing the dendroglyphs confirmed the stories passed down in her family and is “pure evidence” of the ancestral connection to country, she says. The rediscovery has been healing, especially for her mother and aunt, both now in their 70s. “All of this was nearly lost because they didn’t grow up in their homeland with their families,” she says.</p>



<h4>Maintaining the connection</h4>



<p>The work to find and document carved boabs in the Tanami and in other parts of the country has just begun. But this initial foray reveals the “vital importance” of scientists working in collaboration with First Nations knowledge holders, says Smith.</p>



<p>O’Connor is organizing another expedition to find the rest of the engravings that Lewis spotted, though she intends to take better wheels or — ideally — a helicopter. Garstone is planning on coming along with more of her extended family in tow.</p>



<p>In the meantime, O’Connor says that their work appears to have stimulated interest among researchers and other Aboriginal groups to rediscover the lost art form and preserve it for future generations.</p>



<p>“Our connection to country is so important to maintain because it makes us who we are as First Nations people,” adds Garstone. “To know that we have a rich cultural heritage and to have our own museum in the bush is something we will treasure forever.”</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap">Great scientists become immortalized in various ways.</p>



<p>Some through names for obscure units of measurement (à la Hertz, Faraday and Curie). Others in elements on the periodic table (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/periodic-table-history-chemical-elements-150-anniversary">Mendeleev</a>, Seaborg, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-atom-went-quantum">Bohr</a>, among many others). A few become household names symbolizing genius — like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/celebrating-newton">Newton in centuries past</a> and nowadays, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einsteins-genius-changed-sciences-perception-gravity">Einstein</a>. But only one has been honored on millions and millions of cartons of milk: the French chemist, biologist and evangelist for experimental science Louis Pasteur.</p>





<p>Pasteur was <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/chemistry-biographies/louis-pasteur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born 200 years ago</a> this December, the most significant scientist birthday bicentennial since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/january-31-2009">Charles Darwin’s in 2009</a>. And Pasteur ranked behind only Darwin among the most exceptional biological scientists of the 19th century. </p>



<p>Pasteur not only made milk safe to drink, but also rescued the beer and wine industry. He established the germ theory of disease, saved the French silkworm population, confronted the scourges of anthrax and rabies, and transformed the curiosity of vaccination against smallpox into a general strategy for treating and preventing human diseases. He invented microbiology and established the foundations for immunology.</p>

<p>Had he been alive after 1901, when Nobel Prizes were first awarded, he would have deserved one every year for a decade. No other single scientist demonstrated more dramatically the benefit of science for humankind.</p>



<p>He was not, however, exactly a saint. A Pasteur biographer, Hilaire Cuny, called him “a mass of contradictions.” Pasteur was ambitious and opportunistic, sometimes arrogant and narrow-minded, immodest, undiplomatic and uncompromising. In the scientific controversies he engaged in (and there were many), he was pugnacious and belligerent. He did not suffer criticism silently and was often acerbic in his responses. To his laboratory assistants, he was demanding, dictatorial and aloof. Despite his revolutionary spirit in pursuing science, in political and social matters, he was conformist and deferential to authority.</p>



<p>And yet he was a tireless worker, motivated by service to humankind, faithful to his family and unwaveringly honest. He was devoted to truth, and therefore also to science.</p>



<h4>How Pasteur developed pasteurization</h4>





<p>In his youth, Pasteur did not especially excel as a student. His interests inclined toward art rather than science, and he did display exceptional skill at drawing and painting. But in light of career considerations (his father wanted him to be a scholar), Pasteur abandoned art for science and so applied to the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris for advanced education. He finished 15th in the competitive entrance examination, good enough to secure admission. But not good enough for Pasteur. He spent another year on further studies emphasizing physical sciences and then took the École Normale exam again, finishing fourth. That was good enough, and he entered the school in 1843. There he earned his doctoral degree, in physics and chemistry, in 1847.</p>



<p>Among his special interests at the École Normale was crystallography. In particular he was drawn to investigate tartaric acid. It’s a chemical found in grapes responsible for tartar, a potassium compound that collects on the surfaces of wine vats. Scientists had recently discovered that tartaric acid possesses the intriguing power of twisting light — that is, rotating the orientation of light waves’ vibrations. In light that has been polarized (by passing it through certain crystals, filters or some sunglasses), the waves are all aligned in a single plane. Light passing through a tartaric acid solution along one plane emerges in a different plane.</p>



<p>Even more mysteriously, another acid (paratartaric acid, or racemic acid), with the exact same chemical composition as tartaric acid, did not twist light at all. Pasteur found that suspicious. He began a laborious study of the crystals of salts derived from the two acids. He discovered that racemic acid crystals could be sorted into two asymmetric mirror-image shapes, like pairs of right-handed and left-handed gloves. All the tartaric acid crystals, on the other hand, had shapes with identical asymmetry, analogous to gloves that were all right-handed.</p>

PASTEUR/ANNALES DE CHIMIE ET DE PHYSIQUE 1848</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Pasteur deduced that the asymmetry in the crystals reflected the asymmetric arrangement of atoms in their constituent molecules. Tartaric acid twisted light because of the asymmetry of its molecules, while in racemic acid, the two opposite shapes canceled out each other’s twisting effects.</p>



<p>Pasteur built the rest of his career on this discovery. His research on tartaric acid and wine led eventually to profound realizations about the relationship between microbes and human disease. Before Pasteur, most experts asserted that fermentation was a natural nonbiological chemical process. Yeast, a necessary ingredient in the fermenting fluid, was supposedly a lifeless chemical acting as a catalyst. Pasteur’s experiments showed yeast to be alive, a peculiar kind of “small plant” (now known to be a fungus) that caused fermentation by biological activity.</p>



<p>Pasteur demonstrated that, in the absence of air, yeast acquired oxygen from sugar, converting the sugar to alcohol in the process. “Fermentation by yeast,” he wrote, is “the direct consequence of the processes of nutrition,” a property of a “minute cellular plant … performing its respiratory functions.” Or more succinctly, he proclaimed that “fermentation … is life without air.” (Later scientists found that yeast accomplished fermentation by emitting enzymes that catalyzed the reaction.)</p>



<p>Pasteur also noticed that additional microorganisms present during fermentation could be responsible for the process going awry, a problem threatening the viability of French winemaking and beer brewing. He solved that problem by developing a method of heating that eliminated the bad microorganisms while preserving the quality of the beverages. This method, called “pasteurization,” was later applied to milk, eliminating the threat of illness from drinking milk contaminated by virulent microorganisms. Pasteurization became standard public health practice in the 20th century.</p>



<p>Incorporating additional insights from studies of other forms of fermentation, Pasteur summarized his work on microbial life in a famous paper published in 1857. “This paper can truly be regarded as the beginning of scientific microbiology,” wrote the distinguished microbiologist René Dubos, who called it “one of the most important landmarks of biochemical and biological sciences.”</p>



<h4>The germ theory of disease is born</h4>



<p>Pasteur’s investigations of the growth of microorganisms in fermentation collided with another prominent scientific issue: the possibility of spontaneous generation of life. Popular opinion even among many scientists held that microbial life self-generated under the proper conditions (spoiled meat, for example). Demonstrations by the 17th century Italian scientist <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/classics-science-redi-disproves-spontaneous-generation">Francesco Redi challenged that belief</a>, but the case against spontaneous generation was not airtight.</p>

<p>In the early 1860s Pasteur undertook a series of experiments that should have left no doubt that spontaneous generation, under conditions encountered on Earth today, was an illusion. Yet he was nevertheless accosted by critics, such as the French biologist Charles-Philippe Robin, to whom he returned verbal fire. “We trust that the day will come when M. Robin will … acknowledge that he has been in error on the subject of the doctrine of spontaneous generation, which he continues to affirm, without adducing any direct proofs in support of it,” Pasteur remarked.</p>



<p>It was his work on spontaneous generation that led Pasteur directly to the development of the germ theory of disease.</p>



<p>For centuries people had suspected that some diseases must be transmitted from person to person by close contact. But determining exactly how that happened seemed beyond the scope of scientific capabilities. Pasteur, having discerned the role of germs in fermentation, saw instantly that something similar to what made wine go bad might also harm human health.</p>



<p>After disproving spontaneous generation, he realized that there must exist “transmissible, contagious, infectious diseases of which the cause lies essentially and solely in the presence of microscopic organisms.” For some diseases, at least, it was necessary to abandon “the idea of … an infectious element suddenly originating in the bodies of men or animals.” Opinions to the contrary, he wrote, gave rise “to the gratuitous hypothesis of spontaneous generation” and were “fatal to medical progress.”</p>



<p>His first foray into applying the germ theory of disease came during the late 1860s in response to a decline in French silk production because of diseases afflicting silkworms. After success in tackling the silkworms’ maladies, he turned to anthrax, a terrible illness for cattle and humans alike. Many medical experts had long suspected that some form of bacteria caused anthrax, but it was Pasteur’s series of experiments that isolated the responsible microorganism, verifying the germ theory beyond doubt. (Similar work by <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/robert-koch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Koch in Germany</a> around the same time provided further confirmation.)</p>



<p>Understanding anthrax’s cause led to the search for a way to prevent it. In this case, a fortuitous delay in Pasteur’s experiments with cholera in chickens produced a fortunate surprise. In the spring of 1879 he had planned to inject chickens with cholera bacteria he had cultured, but he didn’t get around to it until after his summer vacation. When he injected his chickens in the fall, they unexpectedly failed to get sick. So Pasteur prepared a fresh bacterial culture and brought in a new batch of chickens.</p>



<p>When both the new chickens and the previous batch were given the fresh bacteria, the new ones all died, while nearly all of the original chickens still remained healthy. And so, Pasteur realized, the original culture had weakened in potency over the summer and was unable to cause disease, while the new, obviously potent culture did not harm the chickens previously exposed to the weaker culture. “These animals have been vaccinated,” he declared.</p>



<p>Vaccination, of course, had been invented eight decades earlier, when <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/edward-jenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British physician Edward Jenner</a> protected people from smallpox by first exposing them to cowpox, a similar disease acquired from cows. (Vaccination comes from cowpox’s medical name, vaccinia, from <em>vacca</em>, Latin for cow.) Pasteur realized that the chickens surprisingly displayed a similar instance of vaccination because he was aware of Jenner’s discovery. “Chance favors the prepared mind,” Pasteur was famous for saying.</p>



<p>Because of his work on the germ theory of disease, Pasteur’s mind was prepared to grasp the key role of microbes in the prevention of smallpox, something Jenner could not have known. And Pasteur instantly saw that the specific idea of vaccination for smallpox could be generalized to other diseases. “Instead of depending on the chance finding of naturally occurring immunizing agents, as cowpox was for smallpox,” Dubos observed, “it should be possible to produce vaccines at will in the laboratory.”</p>



<p>Pasteur cultured the anthrax microbe and weakened it for tests in farm animals. Success in such tests not only affirmed the correctness of the germ theory of disease, but also allowed it to gain a foothold in devising new medical practices.</p>



<p>Later Pasteur confronted an even more difficult microscopic foe, the virus that causes rabies. He had begun intense experiments on rabies, a horrifying disease that’s almost always fatal, caused usually by the bites of rabid dogs or other animals. His experiments failed to find any bacterial cause for rabies, leading him to realize that it must be the result of some agent too small to see with his microscope. He could not grow cultures in lab dishes of what he could not see. So instead he decided to grow the disease-causing agent in living tissue — the spinal cords of rabbits. He used dried-out strips of spinal cord from infected rabbits to vaccinate other animals that then survived rabies injections.</p>



<p>Pasteur hesitated to test his rabies treatment on humans. Still, in 1885 when a mother brought to his lab a 9-year-old boy who had been badly bitten by a rabid dog, Pasteur agreed to administer the new vaccine. After a series of injections, the boy recovered fully. Soon more requests came for the rabies vaccine, and by early the next year over 300 rabies patients had received the vaccine and survived, with only one death among them.</p>



<p>Popularly hailed as a hero, Pasteur was also vilified by some hostile doctors, who considered him an uneducated interloper in medicine. Vaccine opponents complained that his vaccine was an untested method that might itself cause death. But of course, critics had also rejected Pasteur’s view of fermentation, the germ theory of disease and his disproof of spontaneous generation.</p>

<p>Pasteur stood his ground and eventually prevailed (although he did not turn out to be right about everything). His attitude and legacy of accomplishments inspired 20th century scientists to develop vaccines for more than a dozen deadly diseases. Still more diseases succumbed to antibiotics, following the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming — who declared, “Without Pasteur I would have been nothing.”</p>



<p>Even in Pasteur’s own lifetime, thanks to his defeat of rabies, his public reputation was that of a genius.</p>



<h4>Pasteur&#8217;s scientific legacy</h4>



<p>As geniuses go, Pasteur was the opposite of Einstein. To get inspiration for his theories, Einstein imagined riding aside a light beam or daydreamed about falling off a ladder. Pasteur stuck to experiments. He typically initiated his experiments with a suspected result in mind, but he was scrupulous in verifying the conclusions he drew from them. Preconceived ideas, he said, can guide the experimenter’s interrogation of nature but must be abandoned in light of contrary evidence. “The greatest derangement of the mind,” he declared, “is to believe in something because one wishes it to be so.”</p>



<p>So even when Pasteur was sure his view was correct, he insisted on absolute proof, conducting many experiments over and over with variations designed to rule out all but the true interpretation.</p>



<p>“If Pasteur was a genius, it was not through ethereal subtlety of mind,” wrote Pasteur scholar Gerald Geison. Rather, he exhibited “clear-headedness, extraordinary experimental skill and tenacity — almost obstinacy — of purpose.”</p>

<p>His tenacity, or obstinacy, helped him persevere through several personal tragedies, such as the deaths of three of his daughters, in 1859, 1865 and 1866. And then in 1868 he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage that left him paralyzed on his left side. But that did not slow his pace or impair continuing his investigations.</p>



<p>“Whatever the circumstances in which he had to work, he never submitted to them, but instead molded them to the demands of his imagination and his will,” Dubos wrote. “He was probably the most dedicated servant that science ever had.”</p>



<p>To the end of his life, Pasteur remained dedicated to science and the scientific method, stressing the importance of experimental science for the benefit of society. Laboratories are “sacred institutions,” he asserted. “Demand that they be multiplied and adorned; they are the temples of wealth and of the future.”</p>



<p>Three years before his death in 1895, Pasteur further extolled the value of science and asserted his optimism that the scientific spirit would prevail. In an address, delivered for him by his son, at a ceremony at the Sorbonne in Paris, he expressed his “invincible belief … that science and peace will triumph over ignorance and war, that nations will unite, not to destroy, but to build, and that the future will belong to those who will have done most for suffering humanity.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pasteur.fr/en/bicentenary-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two hundred years after his birth</a>, ignorance and war remain perniciously prominent, as ineradicable as the microbes that continue to threaten public health, with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">the virus causing COVID-19</a> the latest conspicuous example. Vaccines, though, have substantially reduced the risks from COVID-19, extending the record of successful vaccines that have already tamed not only smallpox and rabies, but also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/epidemics-infectious-disease-influenza-covid-pandemic">polio, measles and a host of other once deadly maladies</a>. </p>



<p>Yet even though vaccines have saved countless millions of lives, some politicians and so-called scientists who deny or ignore overwhelming evidence <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccine-hesitancy-history-damage-anti-vaccination">continue to condemn vaccines</a> as more dangerous than the diseases they prevent. True, some vaccines can induce bad reactions, even fatal in a few cases out of millions of vaccinations. But shunning vaccines today, as advocated in artificially amplified social media outrage, is like refusing to eat because some people choke to death on sandwiches.</p>



<p>Today, Pasteur would be vilified just as he was in his own time, probably by some people who don’t even realize that they can safely drink milk because of him. Nobody knows exactly what Pasteur would say to these people now. But it’s certain that he would stand up for truth and science, and would be damn sure to tell everybody to get vaccinated.</p>

                <p>We’re very excited to announce that Hugging Face has collaborated with arXiv to make papers more accessible, discoverable, and fun. Starting today, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces">Hugging Face Spaces</a> is integrated with arXivLabs through a Demo tab that includes links to demos created by the community or the authors themselves. By going to the Demos tab of your favorite paper in the arXiv categories of computer science, statistics, or electrical engineering and systems science, you can find links to open-source demos and try them out immediately.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1317" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2022/11/Recording-2022-11-15-at-13.05.28.gif" alt="Gif showing how to navigate to the demo tab" width="2256" height="1502" /></p>
<p>Since its launch in October 2021, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces">Hugging Face Spaces</a> has been used to build and share over 12,000 open-source machine learning demos crafted by the community. With Spaces, Hugging Face users can share, explore, discuss models, and build interactive applications that enable anyone with a browser to try them out without having to run any code. These demos are built using open-source tools such as the Gradio and Streamlit Python libraries, and leverage models and datasets available on the Hugging Face Hub.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest arXiv integration, users can now find the most popular demos for a paper on its arXiv abstract page. For example, if you want to try out demos of the BERT language model, you can go to the BERT paper’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">arXiv page</a>, and navigate to the demo tab. You will see more than 200 demos built by the open-source community &#8212; some demos simply showcase the BERT model, while others showcase related applications that modify or use BERT as part of larger pipelines, such as the demo shown above.</p>

<p>Demos allow a much wider audience to explore machine learning as well as other fields in which computational models are built, such as biology, chemistry, astronomy, and economics. They help increase the awareness and understanding of how models work, amplify the visibility of researchers&#8217; work, and allow a more diverse audience to identify and debug biases and other issues. The demos increase the reproducibility of research by enabling others to explore the paper&#8217;s results without having to write a single line of code. We are thrilled about this integration with arXiv and can’t wait to see how the research community will use it to improve communication, dissemination and interpretability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maya-rulers-attract-subjects-guatemala-tamarindito">Some Maya rulers may have taken generations to attract subjects</a></h4>

              
                <p>Commoners may have played an unappreciated part in the rise of an ancient Maya royal dynasty.</p>



<p>Self-described “divine lords” at a Maya site called Tamarindito in what’s now Guatemala left glowing hieroglyphic tributes to themselves as heads of a powerful “Foliated Scroll” dynasty.</p>



<p>But new findings indicate that the bigwigs at Tamarindito spent many generations waiting for their subjects to show up, or perhaps hatching plans to attract followers, say archaeologist and epigrapher Markus Eberl of Vanderbilt University in Nashville and colleagues.</p>





<p>Tamarindito’s kings founded their capital by about the year 400 as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-antiquity/article/early-classic-genesis-of-the-royal-maya-capital-of-tamarindito/602DDA6CDE88FD72A13077BB75AC11DA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mere hamlet of perhaps a few dozen individuals</a>, consisting of a royal court and a couple of residential clusters for non-elites, the scientists report November 4 in <em>Latin American Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>It took about 150 years for enough people to trickle in to Tamarindito to enable the site’s rulers to expand their power, Eberl says. At that point, Foliated Scroll rulers founded a smaller, second capital and several other settlements in northern Guatemala. Those rulers went on to achieve peak power roughly between the years 550 and 800.</p>



<p>Royal art and writing at Tamarindito and other Classic Maya sites misleadingly suggest that kings wielded absolute power, Eberl contends. “In the case of Tamarindito, Maya rulers had to legitimize their authority and build power, likely negotiating with and convincing non-elites” to become subjects.</p>



<p>Hieroglyphics proclaiming the divine power and mythological origins of Foliated Scroll rulers have been studied since Tamarindito’s discovery in 1958. The hieroglyphic emblem of those rulers depicted the curly stalk of a water lily native to lowland Guatemala. Over seven field seasons beginning in 2009, Eberl’s group excavated and surveyed much of the site and documented all surviving royal inscriptions.</p>



<p>Illegal logging at Tamarindito made it possible to identify most of the site’s structures in ground surveys.</p>



<p>No signs of a precursor settlement to Tamarindito were found, making the site a good place to study how Maya rulers constructed a power center from scratch, Eberl says.</p>





<p>Early activity at Tamarindito focused on building a ceremonial center that consisted of a pyramid, a royal palace and a large plaza atop a 70-meter-high hill. That ritual area, with the plaza as its centerpiece, was a relatively small-scale project. From 23 to 31 laborers could have built those structures in 25 years, the researchers estimate.</p>



<p>But Foliated Scroll rulers’ royal ambitions, as expressed at the ritual center, far outpaced demographic reality. Despite a sparse number of locals, Tamarindito’s plaza initially provided space for around 1,650 people to gather, Eberl says. Any public assembly would have fallen far short of the plaza’s crowd capacity, he suspects.</p>



<p>Decorative styles of pottery recovered from 43 groups of non-elite dwellings at Tamarindito largely date to between 600 and 850, when most of the site’s residents arrived, the investigators say — several hundred years after the city was founded. The ritual plaza was expanded during that time span.</p>



<p>Maya people constructed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-reveals-oldest-biggest-ancient-maya-structure-found-mexico">even larger ceremonial plazas than the one at Tamarindito</a> by around 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 6/3/20</em>). Those ritual centers may have been periodically attended by groups scattered across vast regions, says archaeologist Francisco Estrada-Belli of Tulane University in New Orleans.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether enough ancient settlements existed within a day’s walk of Tamarindito to have supported large plaza gatherings on special occasions, says Estrada-Belli, who did not participate in the new study. Tamarindito’s rulers signified their power over a wide area by constructing an impressive ritual center, he suspects.</p>



<p>Even at its peak, no more than several thousand people lived at Tamarindito, Eberl says. That’s a surprisingly limited number considering that aerial laser maps reported by Estrada-Belli and colleagues have revealed large, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">interconnected Maya cities now obscured by forests</a> in other parts of northern Guatemala (<em>SN: 9/27/18</em>).</p>



<p>The next step, Estrada-Belli says, is to assemble an aerial laser map of at least 100 square kilometers around Tamarindito to see if it was built in relative isolation.</p>
