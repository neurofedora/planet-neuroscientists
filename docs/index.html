                Using embankments, channels, and dikes, so-called “green roads” help control floods, harvest excess water for irrigation, and slash maintenance costs. A movement to retrofit existing roads is gathering steam.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reindeer-sleep-eat-chew-arctic">Reindeer can sleep while they chew</a></h4>

              
                <p>In this busy holiday season, many of us multitask. Arctic reindeer are no exception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reindeer can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.12.012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eat and sleep at the same time</a>, a new study suggests. This timesaving strategy, described December 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>, adds to the number of ingenious ways <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinstrap-penguins-sleep-seconds-micronaps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animals can catch some z’s</a> under tough conditions (<em>SN: 11/30/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arctic reindeer are quite busy in the summer — eating when the sun shines around the clock and the food is abundant. Like other ruminants, reindeer spend a considerable amount of time chewing on regurgitated food, making it smaller and easier to digest. Finding time to sleep amid all this cud chewing might be tough. But not if the reindeer could sleep while they chewed. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To find out if the reindeer could actually sleep-eat, neuroscientist Melanie Furrer and chronobiologist Sara Meier, along with their colleagues, trained four female Eurasian tundra reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus tarandus</em>) to tolerate a pen and electrodes on shaved patches of skin. The process involved some kicks and lots of lichen treats, “which is like candy to them,” says Meier, of the University of Zurich.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers were looking for the brain waves that appear during non-REM sleep, a deep, restorative sleep phase. These waves appeared when the reindeer were chewing cud, though the chewing motion itself made it hard to say whether the signal was identical to that of a regular sleep session. “We couldn’t go into detail by looking only at the brain waves, because we have this chewing in there that disturbs it a bit,” says Furrer, also of the University of Zurich.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, other signs also pointed to sleep while chewing. The reindeer were calm while chewing, often with their eyes closed. “They were in a very relaxed state that resembles the body position of non-REM sleep,” Furrer says. Ruminating reindeer were also harder to disturb; rustling from neighboring reindeer was less likely to get a look from a ruminating reindeer. When reindeer are kept awake, they need catch-up recovery sleep. But time spent chewing decreased this time spent in recovery sleep, the researchers found.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Together, these strands of evidence “convincingly demonstrate that reindeer are able to sleep while ruminating,” says neurobiologist Niels Rattenborg of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Seewiesen, Germany, who was not involved in the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike fur seals, ducks and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frigate-birds-fly-nonstop-months" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-haul flying frigatebirds</a>, the reindeer show signs of sleeping with both sides of their brains while chewing (<em>SN: 6/30/16</em>). Figuring out exactly how reindeer pull this off would be interesting, Rattenborg says. Studying various forms of sleep might lead to insights on sleep walking in people, “a poorly understood and potentially dangerous sleep disorder,&#8221; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neuroscientist and study coauthor Gabi Wagner notes that Indigenous reindeer herders have a concept that roughly translates to “pasture peace.” Reindeer “need time and space to be quiet and to have peace, to ruminate,&#8221; says Wagner, of the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research in Tromsø. “This paper for the first time shows that this is a very real, physiological requirement to have enough peace to ruminate undisturbed in order to cover the sleep requirements.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, let’s all be cheered that reindeer can take good care of themselves. Some of them might be busy this Christmas Eve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/give-a-good-gift-science">Here’s how to give a good gift, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>‘Tis the season of giving. ‘Tis also the season of returning.</p>



<p>American consumers are projected to spend roughly $960 billion this holiday season, according to the National Retail Federation. But retailers expect returns to account for almost <a href="https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/winter-holidays/winter-holiday-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 percent</a> of those sales.</p>



<p>That return frenzy arises, at least in part, because people tend to make a lot of mistakes when giving presents, says Julian Givi, a marketing expert and psychologist who has been studying gifting practices, and when they go awry, for roughly a decade.</p>





<p>When Givi went into this line of research, he assumed that gift givers were simply motivated by a desire to please recipients. Not so much, he quickly discovered. Instead, people often give gifts that satisfy their own desires — for uniqueness, societal approval or as a gag — rather than the desires of recipients, says Givi, of West Virginia University in Morgantown.</p>



<p>In other words, people would be a whole lot better at giving gifts if they could just get their own egos out of the way. Givi and colleagues reviewed research into <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all things gift giving</a> in the July <em>Journal of Consumer Psychology.</em></p>



<p>Giving good gifts may not seem like a research-worthy topic. But positive gift exchanges can help businesses struggling to deal with the sheer volume of returns, as well as cement social relationships. Perhaps most importantly, giving better gifts could take pressure off the environment. By <a href="https://theconversation.com/fast-fashion-why-your-online-returns-may-end-up-in-landfill-and-what-can-be-done-about-it-188090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one estimate</a>, in 2020, some 2.6 million tons of returned products in the United States wound up in a landfill.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke to Givi about research on gift giving — and how that translates to advice to help last-minute shoppers avoid common gifting pitfalls this holiday season. <em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Your review touches on the many ways that gift givers go astray due to social norms. Can you provide some examples?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>There’s probably hundreds of norms in gift giving. Generally, givers tend to overweigh the importance of these given norms. For example, we would never want to give a used thing. But for recipients, if this used thing is what they want to receive, that’s fine. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another example is gift wrapping. Say we have $50 to spend. We could either spend $40 on the gift and $10 on the gift wrapping or we could spend $50 on the gift and nothing on gift wrapping. We tend to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618761373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go with the nicer wrapping</a>. Recipients would rather have $10 put into the gift. But the norm out there says wrap and present your gift nicely.</p>



<p>Or consider partial gifts. For example, you go to a wedding registry. You see that the couple requested eight dinner plates. Each dinner plate is $25. You can give them $100 worth of dinner plates but you are only giving them four out of the eight things. As givers we don’t like giving gifts that aren’t complete. But recipients don’t mind as much as we think.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: One seeming success story in people overriding norms involves experiential gifts. Can you explain?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>There are a few different papers on this topic. One shows that <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we don’t give experiential gifts</a> as often as recipients want. Another shows that the majority of the time people give material gifts, but experiences actually <a href="https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/1017575/volumes/v42/NA-42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make people happier</a> than material gifts. That’s a finding throughout the consumer world. It’s called the experiential advantage. A third finding is that experiential gifts <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/43/6/913/2632328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring recipients closer to givers</a> than to material items.</p>





<p>I think this is a rare instance in which academics and society have converged. The academic side is saying experiences are really valued as gifts at the same time as a societal push in recent years against materialism.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You wrote in an article in <em>The Conversation </em>about how givers should <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-4-biggest-gift-giving-mistakes-according-to-a-consumer-psychologist-195169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resist the urge to give a novelty item</a> like a chocolate fondue fountain. Why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>This falls under temporal focus. Gift givers tend to focus on that “aha” moment, the moment when the ribbons and bow come off. Recipients focus more on long-term utility. Research shows that people are misguided on how much surprise is important. Recipients actually like things that they request better.</p>



<p>The chocolate fondue fountain is an example that I think makes so much sense. Sure a person would go ‘Wow, a chocolate fondue fountain!’ But think about how often throughout the year they might use that. Whereas if somebody gave them a coffee maker, they’d be thrilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What are some of the gaps in this area of research?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>The vast majority of these studies were also done in either the U.S. or maybe U.K. What I can say is that cultural norms trump my study findings.</p>



<p>For instance, we oftentimes give superficial gifts around the holidays. But what we find is that recipients actually prefer sentimental gifts more than what givers anticipate. Part of the reason this mismatch occurs is because superficial gifts are a pretty safe bet. I live in Pittsburgh, for example. If I give someone a Steelers jersey, I know that they are going to appreciate it to some extent. If I give someone a scrapbook for photographs of the two of us, it could be great or it could be weird.</p>



<p>But if in a culture if you are going to get ridiculed for giving a sentimental gift, then I would say don’t give a sentimental gift.</p>



<p>Another limitation on this body of work is that it’s focused on adults. It’s a lot easier to get [institutional review board] approval to do research on people who are 18 and older.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What about times when you know the recipient wants that new, non-sentimental and non-experiential gift under the tree?</strong></p>





<p><strong>Givi: </strong>We are studying at the population level, or on average what gift givers should do versus not do. But there are individual differences. Even if on average this research is saying givers should go with the used thing, if the giver knows they are dealing with someone who would very much not appreciate used things, it’s certainly fine to go against what the research is telling you.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How should gift givers handle picky or difficult recipients?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>I don’t have an answer for you when it comes to very difficult people. My understanding of that research is that researchers have examined how givers behave when they are dealing with difficult recipients. But they don’t necessarily get the recipients’ perspective. It would probably be hard to get a bunch of difficult people to participate in a study.</p>



<p>But here’s something you could potentially do with a difficult recipient. One of my papers shows that it’s a lot easier to make people happy when you’re giving in the <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absence of a special occasion</a>. What we find in the paper is you can spend $10 on a random Tuesday in March giving a person a gift versus $50 on Christmas for gifts, and that generates similar levels of happiness.</p>



<p>What you could do with difficult people is sprinkle gifts throughout the year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/endangered-species-act-50-anniversary-success">The Endangered Species Act is turning 50. Has it succeeded?</a></h4>

              
                <p>While growing up in California in the 1980s, Winifred Frick never saw a condor in the wild. The population of North America’s largest bird, <em>Gymnogyps californianus</em>, had dwindled to nearly zero by 1987 because so many were shot, poisoned or captured.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The few remaining wild condors <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/last-wild-condor-caught">were brought into zoos</a> in the early 1980s as part of a captive breeding program aimed at restoring the condor population (<em>SN: 4/25/87</em>). A small group of the birds reproduced, and eventually many of the condors <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/california-condors-released-wild">were released back into the wild</a> (<em>SN: 1/25/92</em>).</p>





<p>Today, Frick — now a conservation biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz — and her 14-year-old son can admire soaring condors while hiking along the Pacific coast. Nearly 350 of these majestic scavengers, whose wings can span nearly 3 meters, once again fly over parts of California and Arizona.</p>



<p>The condors’ happy ending is thanks in large part to the U.S. Endangered Species Act, or ESA, enacted on December 28, 1973. The act currently protects <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/report/boxscore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 2,300 species</a>. This includes more than 900 plants and upwards of <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species-directory/threatened-endangered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">160 marine species</a>.</p>



<p>When it comes to preventing plants and animals from going extinct, the ESA is “one of the most powerful laws we have,” says Frick, who is also the chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group based in Austin, Texas. She should know: 12 bat species fall under ESA’s protection, and more than half of North America’s 154 bat species <a href="https://www.batcon.org/press/2023-north-american-state-of-the-bats-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are at risk of declining over the next 15 years</a>, according to the group’s 2023 report. The ESA is “about protecting wildlife for our future generations,” Frick says.</p>



<p>If a species is deemed threatened or endangered with going extinct, it goes through a rigorous vetting process to determine whether it should be added to the endangered species list. Once a species makes the list, government agencies create a plan to help it recover. This might mean describing ways to restore its habitat or identifying ways to halt threats to a species. For instance, being listed under the act makes it illegal to harass, kill or catch any of these organisms. It also bans the import of any endangered foreign animals, as well as any meat or products made from them.</p>



<p>The ESA has catalyzed plenty of success stories over the past half-century. It has helped large predators recover, including grizzly bears (<em>Ursus arctos horribilis</em>), gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and American alligators (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>).</p>



<p>It has also benefited tiny creatures, such as a brown snail called the <a href="https://www.doi.gov/photos/magazine-mountain-shagreen-snail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magazine Mountain shagreen</a> (<em>Inflectarius magazinensis</em>). In 2013, this snail became the first endangered invertebrate to graduate off the federal endangered species list. Its numbers recovered after the Arkansas forest where it lives was protected from logging and construction.</p>



<p>Thanks to the ESA, Southern California’s <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/2068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island night lizard</a> (<a href="https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/night-lizard.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xantusia riversiana</a>) — which has no eyelids — also has recovered. And on islands near Toledo, Ohio, the act has helped <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/8515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake Erie water snakes</a> (<em>Nerodia sipedon insularum</em>) slither back from the brink.</p>



<p>Some endangered plants have bounced back, too. In 1997, only 20,000 <a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2023-07/golden-paintbrush-delisted-endangered-species-act-due-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golden paintbrush</a> plants (<em>Castilleja levisecta</em>) remained in the wilds of Washington and Oregon. Now more than 325,000 of the bright wildflowers grow there — enough that the species no longer needs ESA protection. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, the act has helped <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/6803/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep 99 percent of species</a> under its protection from extinction, researchers concluded in a 2019 study in <em>Peer J</em>.</p>



<p>But it’s not all good news.</p>





<p>Across the globe, some <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one million species of plants and animals are at risk of going extinct</a>, warned a 2019 United Nations report. These species range from parrots and oak trees to giraffes and seaweed. As a U.S. law, the ESA can attempt to help only a small fraction of these.</p>



<p>For many of the species it can protect, the ESA tends to come into play too late in the game. If not given this protection soon enough, species that are now threatened could soon become endangered. And once they reach that critical state, they become far harder to save.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Species success stories</h4>



<p>Even amid its shortcomings, the ESA has racked up plenty of important wins for wildlife.</p>



<p>In 2014, the pinky-sized Oregon chub (<em>Oregonichthys crameri</em>) was the <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/first-living-fish-leaves-endangered-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first fish to graduate off the endangered species list</a> (<em>SNE: 2/13/14</em>). Only 1,000 of these silver minnows were left when the chub was put on ESA’s list in 1993. Landowners and government agencies restored bogs and ponds where these fish live. Then scientists reintroduced the chub to these places. Today, more than 160,000 of the tiny fish swim wild in Oregon’s Willamette River Valley.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="448" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121323_br_Endangered-Species-Act_inline3.jpg?resize=680%2C448&#038;ssl=1" alt="Two silvery fish swimming." class="wp-image-3134362" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121323_br_Endangered-Species-Act_inline3.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121323_br_Endangered-Species-Act_inline3.jpg?resize=581%2C383&amp;ssl=1 581w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121323_br_Endangered-Species-Act_inline3.jpg?resize=282%2C186&amp;ssl=1 282w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134362">Tiny Oregon chub again swim through Northwest bogs and ponds, thanks to protections offered by the Endangered Species Act.

Swart/Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife/Flickr (CC BY-NC 2.0 DEED)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The status of 60 other species has improved enough that the ESA no longer lists them as endangered with extinction, though they remain listed as threatened with extinction. This is the case for the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/species/american-burying-beetle-nicrophorus-americanus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American burying beetle</a> (<em>Nicrophorus americanus</em>), a carrion beetle native to many states.</p>



<p>A great example of the act in action is how it has protected some of the world’s largest animals: whales. Eight whale species, including the humpback (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>), were among the first animals added to the U.S. endangered species list. In the North Pacific, whaling had reduced the number of humpbacks to an estimated 8 percent of their historic levels, from around 15,000 whales to just 1,200.</p>



<p>In 1985, with U.S. support, the <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/international-affairs/international-whaling-commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Whaling Commission</a> banned the commercial harvest of whales. Since then, nine out of 14 populations of humpbacks are no longer considered threatened.</p>



<p>One of the biggest humpback success stories is the Hawaiian-born population, which migrates each summer to dine in Alaska. Now numbering about 11,000 animals, they have “likely met or exceeded their historic abundance,” says Suzie Teerlink, a humpback whale biologist based in Juneau, Alaska, who works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>





<p>The Endangered Species Act gives whales and their habitats additional protections from other human-related threats, Teerlink points out. These include laws aimed at reducing injuries to whales from being struck by ships or tangled in fishing lines, such as enforcing speed limits for vessels in certain waters.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Criticism of ESA</h4>



<p>One important way that ESA protects at-risk plants and wildlife is by requiring the U.S. government to consider <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tough-choices">how development might affect threatened or endangered species</a> (<em>SN: 11/27/01</em>). Such projects could include new roads, bridges or pipelines, as well as logging, mining or building wind turbines.</p>



<p>This law &#8220;makes people stop and look first,” before they tear up or through the environment, says Derek Goldman, national field director out of Missoula, Mont., for the Endangered Species Coalition, a mix of 400 groups that works to protect imperiled species.</p>



<p>But this stop-and-look requirement has critics. “They believe it slows down development,” Goldman says. He stresses, however, that the ESA isn’t intended to prevent projects from happening. It just asks developers to find ways to limit harm to the local plants and animals that might be affected. For instance, the company developing <a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/vineyardwind-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s largest offshore wind project</a> 24 kilometers off the coast of Massachusetts is undertaking a host of actions to minimize its impacts on endangered marine species. This includes using bubble curtains to dampen construction noise, employing an observer to keep an eye out for endangered species during turbine installation, and driving their vessels slowly to prevent whale strikes.</p>



<p>Another criticism of the ESA is that, for many species, its protections come too late. As a case in point, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2023-10/21-species-delisted-endangered-species-act-due-extinction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took 21 species off the list</a> in October because they are now extinct. This includes eight species of&nbsp;birds endemic to Hawaii&nbsp;as well as eight species of freshwater mussels.</p>



<p>A 2022 study published in <em>PLOS ONE</em> found that most plants or animals on the endangered species list only<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275322" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> received protection after their numbers reached “dangerously low” levels</a>.</p>



<p>Under the law, species recommended for ESA listing should wait no more than two years before the U.S. government decides whether to list a species. However, for most species, that wait is longer — sometimes much longer, the study found. From 2010 to 2020, the median wait time was three years. In the 10 years before that, it was 9.1 years.</p>



<p>Overwhelmed government agencies are one reason for the delay in listing species, the study suggests. The more species recommended for listing, the longer the wait. It appears that in recent decades, agencies lacked enough people and money to move faster.</p>

<p>And, the study points out, for species “with very small or rapidly declining populations, a multi-year delay in receiving protection increases the risk of extinction.”</p>



<p>“The Endangered Species Act has two parallel goals,&#8221; says ecologist Erich Eberhard of Columbia University and coauthor of the <em>PLOS ONE </em>study. “One is to prevent the extinction of species. The other is to recover listed species.”</p>



<p>When it comes to that second goal, he says, the act “isn&#8217;t succeeding.” Just 3 percent of listed species have recovered enough to come off the list, Eberhard and his colleagues found.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Helping troubled species recover</h4>



<p>One way to help species rebound is to direct more money toward protecting them and their ecosystems. That’s why many biologists are championing the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recovering America’s Wildlife Act</a> as a companion law that could bolster species before they require listing under ESA.</p>



<p>This proposed law was introduced in the U.S. Senate in March. It would invest $1.4 billion each year to help states and tribal nations keep wildlife populations healthy. It would help pay for habitat conservation and state research programs. And that money would benefit more than just species on ESA’s list; it would also help out 12,000 species of concern on the lists of individual states. Such species include the monarch butterfly (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>), western bumble bee (<em>Bombus occidentalis</em>) and dwarf shrew (<em>Sorex nanus</em>).</p>



<p>If the Endangered Species Act is an emergency room for species whose numbers have gotten critically low, then the proposed law would provide preventive care, working to keep wildlife populations and their habitats healthy.</p>



<p>Frick of Bat Conservation International believes that passing the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act could be “a game changer” for conserving wildlife.</p>



<p>As ESA celebrates its 50th anniversary in December 2023, Frick hopes a lot more healthy species will “graduate” from an endangered status.</p>



<p>Teerlink, who focuses on ocean critters, agrees. “Extinction is forever. The future depends on us being considerate and intentional in what we leave behind.”</p>

<p>Pleading emails requesting papers are regular visitors to one’s inbox. These unsolicited and flattering requests promise rapid publication and tempt authors to part with their work. Even master’s and doctoral students, after graduation, receive sweet-talking requests to publish their dissertations as a book, a book chapter, or as a paper. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y">Predatory journals</a> and publishers are easy to spot and ignore at these low ends. </p>



<p>The danger lies with well-established and efficient predatory publishers. These ‘efficient’ publishers hide in the open on allowlists, such as South Africa’s Department of Higher Education and Training (DHETs) list of approved journals, and reputable indices such as Scopus and the WoS. They embellish their websites with claims of peer review and even state that they comply with <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.1.12">requirements</a> set by the Committee on Publication Ethics. Their websites tick all the boxes, providing a strong veneer of an authentic scholarly journal. </p>



<p>One of my colleagues alerted me to a suspected predatory publisher. I looked into the case and thought it sensible to share my results, with the hope of sensitising postgraduate students and fellow authors.</p>



<span id="more-128432"></span>



<p>I was asked to look at a suspicious acceptance letter from the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1994"><em>Journal of Namibian Studies</em></a> and a $365 invoice for article processing charges. The journal is listed on the 2023 DHET list of approved journals but was delisted by Scopus in 2023 due to quality issues. See Scopus’s <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/excel_doc/0015/91122/extlistJune2023.xlsx">Source Title List</a> for the discontinued titles.</p>



<p>Words in the journal’s acceptance letter, “to enlighten you” and “manuscript reviewed and appraised by the review committee members,” raised suspicion. In addition, the invoice requested payment to be made to a conference business in India. Payment to a business on the sub-continent is at odds with what one would expect from a journal with links to Namibia and Germany. For example, papers in volume 31 of the journal (2022) list a German academic as the editor, and academics from Namibia, Germany, and South Africa, amongst others, as editorial advisory board members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I explored further and discovered the following: The publisher changed on 1 January 2023 from Otjivanda Presse to the Society of Cultural Studies and Social Sciences (Hong Kong)<em>. </em>The <a href="https://namibian-studies.com/index.php/JNS/announcement/view/1">notice date</a> on the journal website is 16 May 2023. I was not able to trace this society on the Hong Kong government <a href="https://www.icris.cr.gov.hk/csci/">website</a> (a person must register before being able to search for a company). The invoice, in contrast, lists ARDA Conference Private Limited as the publisher. The new publisher also removed and replaced the editor, sub-editor, and editorial board members. For example, a <a href="https://namibian-studies.com/index.php/JNS/about/editorialTeam">Dr Jimmy</a> with no affiliation is listed as a new sub-editor.</p>



<p>Earlier papers, pre-2023, were in line with the journal’s narrow <a href="https://namibian-studies.com/index.php/JNS/about/">focus</a>, namely humanities and the social sciences, devoted exclusively to Namibian studies. The pre-2023 journal only published seven papers in 2021 and 14 papers in 2022, in addition to reviews and reports. The journal, under the new publisher, <a href="https://namibian-studies.com/index.php/JNS/issue/archive">produced</a> 224 papers by mid-July 2023 (the first two papers in 2023 were published by the original publisher). There are currently five special issues listed for 2023, with about 800 papers. Most of these papers are outside the journal’s scope and show no connection to Namibia. The original publisher’s copy-editing work is notably better when compared to the new publisher.</p>



<p>A visit to the Academic Research and Development (ARDA) <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/">website</a>, the journal’s new publisher, revealed a&nbsp; larger issue. Their website lists many journals that appear to be under their control – 39 of these journals, for example, are listed as Scopus-indexed. The new publisher’s <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1994">link</a> for the <em>Journal of Namibian Studies</em> informs a reader that acceptance is within two days, followed by publication in ten days. I looked at some journals on the ARDA&nbsp; website and noticed the same trend. Authors are promised acceptance within two days for the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1195"><em>Journal of Survey in Fisheries Sciences</em></a> and ten to 15 days for the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1192"><em>European Chemical Bulletin</em></a>. Both journals publish a large number of papers – most outside the journals’ scope. There is no editorial team for the <em>Journal of Survey in Fisheries Sciences</em> and an opaque and questionable editorial team for the <em>European Chemical Bulletin</em>. As with the <em>Journal of Namibian Studies</em>, the copy-editing work differs quality-wise from earlier editions. Both these journals are on the 2023 DHET accredited list.</p>



<p>ARDA promises rapid acceptance and publication for the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1193"><em>International Journal of Professional Business Review</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1195"><em>Journal of Survey in Fisheries Sciences</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1190"><em>Res Militaris</em></a>. Scopus discontinued these journals in 2023 but they are still on the 2023 DHETs list.</p>



<p>Another questionable journal under ARDAs control is the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1191"><em>Russian Law Journal</em></a>. Scopus only covered this journal from <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/21100455574">2013 to 2021</a> but the journal still appears on Scopus’s <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/excel_doc/0015/91122/extlistJune2023.xlsx">Source Title List</a> and on the DHET list. I emailed <a href="https://www.russianlawjournal.org/index.php/journal/about/contact">Dr. Anna Dmitri</a>, “<a href="about:blank">Publisher and Owner RLJ</a>” and asked about article processing charges and how long it takes to publish a paper after submission.&nbsp; The Editorial Team replied: “Registration fee&nbsp;for an article&nbsp;is USD 190/ INR 17k. Your article will be published within 15 working days after completion of the registration process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>ARDA also provides <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/thesis-writing-services">writing services</a>. Regarding thesis and dissertation writing, they promise to “deliver well-researched thesis papers without any mistakes and plagiarism. Thesis writing is, without a doubt, a challenging and time-consuming undertaking that requires a ton of time. With ARDA, you will get access to a global network of knowledgeable researchers who will assist your needs.”</p>



<p>Some predatory publishers and their <a href="https://doi.org/10.11613/BM.2021.030201">facilitators</a> operate in plain sight. The danger is no longer the poorly worded and pleading emails in our inboxes but journals with a respectable façade. We should not trust a journal at face value. Authentic scholarly journals, even those on reputable indices, may <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08999">discard appropriate editorial practices</a> and become income-generating instruments for their owners.</p>



<p>What I don’t know is how the publisher acquired the <em>Journal for Namibian Studies</em> and the other journals listed on their website. Were there hostile takeovers, did a founding editor unwittingly sell the journal, or cede control?</p>



<p>Selecting a journal for disseminating one’s work requires more than checking if the journal appears on the DHET’s list or a reputable index. We must sensitise ourselves to <a href="https://www.interacademies.org/project/predatorypublishing">predatory indicators</a> such as a high volume of papers, opaque editorial members, poor copy editing, papers outside a journal’s scope, and promises of rapid publication.</p>

<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects more than one in 100 people worldwide. ASD can be reliably diagnosed by the age of 2 years, but developmental screenings are expensive and not readily available for low- and middle-income economies. Since early detection is crucial for timely interventions and support, there is a need to find more cost-effective screening methods to assist under-resourced primary health care settings.</p>
<p>A new study published in <em>BMC Digital Health </em>introduces a time- and cost-efficient telehealth approach to detect behavioral differences between children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children using snack time activities. In this study, children aged 1-6 years, previously diagnosed with ASD, and TD children were filmed for one minute during structured snack time activities. Three clinical experts identified 17 ASD-related behaviors covering social interaction, communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. These were then further converted into 62 behavior indicators (e.g., counts, duration, rate) and translated into a behavior coding system.</p>
<p>Using this easy and cost-effective method, trained examiners were able to identify distinct behavioral differences between children with ASD and TD children. These included eye gaze, pointing, facial expressions, vocalization, verbalization, and giving behaviors. A clinical prediction model further confirmed the method’s ability to predict ASD with a sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 86.6%. While acknowledging the study&#8217;s limitations due to a relatively small sample size, the authors assert that their newly developed telehealth tool shows great promise for diagnosing ASD in primary health care settings in an easy, reliable, and cost-effective manner.</p>

<p>Biodiversity loss is one of the is the most pressing issues the world is currently facing. According to the WWF’s <a href="https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-GB/#:~:text=The%20Living%20Planet%20Report%202022,in%20species%20populations%20since%201970.">Living Planet Report 2022</a>, 69% of global wildlife populations have disappeared since 1970.  Human land use for food production is still the major driver of biodiversity loss, but climate change and rising temperatures play an increasingly significant role as well. Elevated temperatures change the availability and distribution of existing ecosystems, often forcing animals and plants to move to higher latitudes, where they further disrupt existing ecosystems. It is, therefore, crucial to take climate change into consideration when planning species conservation and management efforts.</p>
<p>In a study recently published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em>, researchers used species distribution models to predict the future extent of suitable habitats for geladas in the Ethiopian highlands. These high-altitude primates are extremely range-restricted and already in decline due to human disturbances. By comparing historic occurrence data collected after 1999 and considering a total of 13 environmental factors (e.g., climate change, land cover, and slope) the authors were able to create a model to predict where geladas might live under 2050 and 2070 climate change scenarios.</p>
<p>Their model revealed that, over the past two decades, geladas had already shifted to higher elevations as a response to agricultural expansion and significant anthropogenic pressures. It further confirmed that the geladas were highly vulnerable to global climate change and would lose a significant part of their current habitat. Factors like temperature, precipitation, and slope were most influential when shaping these projections. The authors concluded that taking predicted future habitat outlines into account to create protected areas would be crucial when planning conservation efforts for this species. In addition, given that geladas are already living in areas that are less ideal for them, protecting their current habitats is important, even if they will become unsuitable in the future.</p>

<p>The Faroe Islands, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, constitute an archipelago that operates as a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Many Faroese are descendants of Norwegian Vikings, who colonized the islands about 1200 years ago. Because of the remote nature of the islands, the population has remained relatively isolated, and genetic inbreeding has resulted in a high incidence of recessive allele disorders, such as the very rare Primary Carnitine Deficiency (PCD). Over the past decade, several nationwide screening programmes using whole genome and exome sequencing were initiated to better understand the occurrence of PCD and other rare diseases in the Faroese population.</p>
<p>A study in <em>BMC Genomics</em> used high-coverage data to explore the genomic variation and demographic history of the Faroese population. The analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from eight unrelated Faroese genomes, alongside runs of homozygosity (ROHs), minor allele frequency (MAF), and population structure, revealed intriguing differences. While all eight participants were deemed unrelated, a level of relatedness akin to sibling or parent-offspring pairs was detected. However, a closer look at ROHs suggested this relatedness had ancient origins. The study also revealed a bottleneck and inbreeding event, starting between the 1st and 4th century and peaking around the 6th century—about 2-3 centuries earlier than previously thought based on archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>While the sample size of this study was relatively small, the author is confident that most modern Faroese are likely descendants of primarily European farmers (&lt;99%) with a minor influence of Admixed Americans (&gt;1%). Due to the relative isolation of the islands, inbreeding remained high, providing an opportunity to study ancient communities through the modern Faroese population.</p>

<p>Unprofessional behaviors (UB) among healthcare staff represents a global problem, with a negative impact on staff well-being and patient safety. UB can be defined as “any interpersonal behavior by a staff member that acutely or frequently undermines, humiliates, intimidates, or drives distress or harm to other staff, in the healthcare workplace” and includes incivility, microaggressions, harassment, and bullying. While rates of UB vary worldwide, data consistently show that women, individuals with disabilities, and those from ethnic minority backgrounds experience UB to a greater extent.</p>
<p>A new study published in <em>BMC Health Service Research</em> explores the contributors and drivers of UB in healthcare, to better understand how and why UB develops and how it negatively impacts staff and patient care. A systematic database search with data extracted from 109 reports found that UB can lead to adverse outcomes such as loss of self-worth, burnout, desire to leave the workplace, and even suicidal ideation. Minoritized groups were indeed more severely impacted. Furthermore, UB was linked to distraction, lower confidence, reduced capacity to speak up about errors, and ultimately affecting patient safety and care quality.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that dysfunctional workplace processes, toxic cultures, disempowerment, inhibited social cohesion, and manager unawareness were the main contributors to UBs. Understanding where UBs are arising and improving workplace culture are essential in eliminating UBs and avoiding negative impacts on communication, concentration, and the ability to speak up about errors. Further research is needed to understand why certain demographics (e.g., female staff, minorities, individuals with disabilities) are particularly susceptible to UB.</p>

<p>The use of Nicotine Vaping Products (NVPs) or e-cigarettes are considered a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes and are often used to quit smoking. However, concerns exist, especially regarding their use among young people. NVPs can serve as gateways for those who would not have otherwise smoked or those who previously quit smoking conventional cigarettes and start again because they see NVPs as a healthy alternative. <a href="https://pophealthmetrics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12963-021-00250-7#Sec16">A previously published study</a> introduced the so-called Smoking and Vaping Model (SAVM) &#8211; a tool to assess the potential harm-reducing or harm-increasing effects of NVPs on the American population.</p>
<p>A recent study published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> tested the SAVM on the German population, where the use of NVPs is demonstrably increasing. The authors built the adapted model using three publicly available databases (WHO, United Nations, and GEDA). They compared two different scenarios (No-NVP and NVP) to estimate the public health impact in terms of smoking-attributable deaths (SADs) and smoking-and-vaping-attributable deaths, as well as life years lost (LYLs). Assuming that the excess NVP mortality risk is 5% that of smoking, the model estimated a reduction of 4.7 million LYL and almost 300,000 deaths due to NVP use.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that, since data on tobacco use in Germany may be incomplete and information on the long-term effects of NVPs on public health is lacking, these results should be interpreted with caution. Despite these pitfalls, the SAVM is considered valuable as it was specifically designed to be accessible to non-experts. It will help policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders understand the impact of NVPs on public health and guide tobacco control efforts, especially in countries like Germany, which are currently undergoing changes in tobacco regulations.</p>

<p>On March 12, a senior administrator at a university in India sent a business proposal to a prolific economist in Ethiopia. If he joined the school’s stable of adjunct professors, the administrator promised, easy money could be made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the economist had to do was “add our affiliation for incentives in your papers,” explained <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-lakshmi-t-492295186">Lakshmi Thangavelu</a>, dean of international affairs at <a href="https://www.saveetha.com/aboutus">Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMATS)</a>, in Chennai, in a written exchange.</p>



<p>“Surely I will do that. Not a big deal,” replied <a href="https://et.linkedin.com/in/dr-mohd-asif-shah-04148a93">Mohd Asif Shah</a>, an associate professor at Kebri Dehar University, in eastern Ethiopia.</p>



<p>But the deal turned sour. Although Shah listed SIMATS as an affiliation on at least two <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aess/2023/8891070/">research</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10942912.2023.2254021">papers</a> he published this fall, in December he still hadn’t received any payments from the school, he complained. Then he turned to LinkedIn to share his frustration in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Asif_Shah_Evidence.pdf">post</a> that included screenshots of his conversation with Thangavelu, who is also a professor at Saveetha Dental College, part of SIMATS.</p>



<span id="more-128453"></span>



<p>“Hello Guys,” Shah began, “I am here today exposing one of the biggest scams done by a few higher educational institutions in India.”</p>



<p>According to the post, which has now been deleted, Thangavelu:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>contacts professors across the globe for working as an adjunct faculty for her institution and asks them to publish the research papers for her institution by using the affiliation.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In exchange for this she is promising money by mentioning incentives.</p>



<p>This is all done to get good national and international rankings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">SIMATS’ dental school, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/saveetha-ad.jpg">advertises itself</a> as the world’s most published institution of its kind, has a track record for manipulating publication metrics. A Retraction Watch investigation published earlier this year in <em>Science </em>found Saveetha Dental College had soared to the top of India’s national rankings thanks in part to a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">massive self-citation scheme</a> involving thousands of student papers.</p>



<p>Paying researchers to be added on publications from other institutions may be yet another way the school is gaming the system to get ahead in the rankings. While the extent of the scheme is not clear, according to <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f8a85fc2ad7a514c3fdaf60/t/62909340d9307717906078c9/1653642052592/AQAR+Report+2020-21.pdf">a status report</a> from 2021:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The institution encourages students and faculties to publish their work in high-impact factor journals by providing incentives. The institution has spent Rs. 4.8 crores [about US$ 584.000] as publication incentives.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The tactic is not unique to SIMATS. In 2011, <em>Science</em> described how Saudi universities offered tens of thousands of dollars to highly cited researchers overseas <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.334.6061.1344">to boost their academic standing</a>. Although European institutions have recently <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-11-08/spanish-national-research-council-investigates-five-scientists-for-manipulating-university-rankings.html">pushed back</a> against this practice, scientists in other parts of the world may face less scrutiny and still be attractive targets for universities hungry for publications.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Neither Thangavelu nor SIMATS’ chancellor replied to requests for comment. Shah told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I wanted to bring to your attention that the LinkedIn post/message was inadvertently shared in a public group, it was a private message. I would like to clarify that I do not endorse the content of the statement and do not consent to the use of my message for any publication in any form.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With Shah onboard, SIMATS would have had access to a very productive author. In 2023 alone, Shah published <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;tzom=-60&amp;user=RIa9dpMAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">more than 100 research papers</a> on everything from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35154-z">the fabrication of graphene-based nanocoatings</a> to <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aess/2023/8891070/">predatory arthropods in rice fields</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10942912.2023.2254021">the sensory profile of spiced yogurt</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mohd_Asif_Shah_0000-0002-0351-9559_-_ORCID_-_2023-12-19_17.38.42-cropped.jpg">his ORCID profile</a>, Shah is trained in economics and is an adjunct professor at 10 different universities in Afghanistan, India, Malaysia and Iran, in addition to his position at Kebri Dehar University. SIMATS is not among those institutions because, as Shah wrote on LinkedIn, “as you publish the research papers, you are not paid.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/12/21/accessibility-update-arxiv-now-offers-papers-in-html-format/">Accessibility update: arXiv now offers papers in HTML format</a></h4>

              
                <p>arXiv’s goal is equitable access to scientific research for all – and to achieve this, we have been working to make research papers more accessible for arXiv users with disabilities. We are happy to announce that as of Monday, December 18<sup>th</sup>, arXiv is now generating an HTML formatted version of all papers submitted in TeX/LaTeX (as long as papers were submitted on or after December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023 and HTML conversion is successful – more on this below).</p>
<p>HTML is not replacing PDF but will be an additional format available for arXiv users. Submitters will be invited to preview the HTML version of their papers during submission time, the same way they have always done with PDF.</p>
<p>When accessing a paper’s abstract page, readers will see a link to view the HTML paper right under the PDF link:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1530" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper-300x122.png" alt="" width="300" height="122" srcset="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper-300x122.png 300w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper.png 404w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The request to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from scientists with disabilities who face barriers to accessing the research they need. HTML formatted papers are more easily and accurately read by screen readers and other technologies, which can assist researchers with reading disabilities, including blindness, low vision, dyslexia, and more.</p>
<p>We know that the HTML conversion isn’t perfect yet – right now our HTML is in the “experimental” phase as we work to make conversion more accurate. Currently, not every paper will be able to be correctly converted into HTML. However, researchers with disabilities have told arXiv that HTML is needed *now* for accessibility, and so we wanted to offer that accessibility as quickly as possible, while we continue to work on improving conversions with the help of our community. arXiv will *not* prevent or hold submissions where the HTML conversion has failed, but we do hope that authors will carefully review the HTML version of their submission, as sometimes small changes in the source TeX code can improve the HTML rendering.</p>
<p>Experimental HTML is a big step towards making science accessible to all. We want to thank everyone who collaborated on arXiv’s pilot <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessible_HTML.html">HTML Papers project</a> which includes <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">The LaTeX Project</a>, and the <a href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a> team from NIST. If you are familiar with <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html">ar5iv, an arXivLabs collaboration</a>, our HTML offering is essentially bringing this impactful project fully “in-house”. Our ultimate goal is to backfill arXiv’s entire corpus so that every paper will have an HTML version, but for now this feature is reserved for new papers.</p>
<p>And a big thank you to all the arXiv users who have taken the time to fill out bug reports for arXiv&#8217;s HTML Papers project – our team is currently reading and analyzing the bug reports and hope to make our first round of improvements in the new year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/record-breaking-science-discovery-2023">These scientific discoveries set new records in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2023, researchers made plenty of discoveries for the record books — and the history books. This year’s scientific superlatives shed new light on our ancient ancestors, our planet and the animals we share it with.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Least sleep among mammals</h4>



<p>However sleep-deprived you may be, you’re probably still better rested than a northern elephant seal. During monthslong hunting trips at sea, these seals nap less than 20 minutes at a time and average just two hours of total sleep per day. That rivals African elephants for the title of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/northern-elephant-seals-sleep-sea">mammal that sleeps the least</a> (<em>SN: 4/20/23</em>).</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Earliest equestrians</h4>



<p>The Yamnaya people may have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-worlds-earliest-horseback-riders">the world’s earliest horseback riders</a>, mounting steeds as far back as 3000 B.C., centuries before the earliest known depictions of horseback riding (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 12</em>). Yamnaya skeletons unearthed in Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary show telltale signs of horsemanship, including marks on the femur and pelvis that could come from sitting astride and vertebral damage from falling off.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sunniest place on Earth</h4>



<p>Visitors to the Altiplano plateau in Chile’s Atacama Desert should be sure to pack sunscreen. This high-altitude region gets hit with an average of 308 watts of sunshine per square meter — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-intense-sunlight-earth-atacama-desert">the most intense sunlight anywhere on Earth</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 5</em>). Sometimes, solar radiation exceeds 2,000 watts per square meter, rivaling the amount of sunshine expected to beat down on Venus, which is much closer to the sun than Earth is.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Oldest black hole</h4>



<p>A supermassive black hole some 13.2 billion light-years from Earth is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf7c5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most distant, most ancient supermassive black hole</a> ever observed. The monster dates to when the universe was just 470 million years old, making it about 200 million years older than <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/surprising-science-records-superlatives-2021">a record breaker announced in 2021</a> and 100 million years older than a black hole that claimed the title in July (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 29</em>). Because the newfound black hole boasts about the same heft as its surrounding galaxy, researchers think the black hole could have formed only through the collapse of a massive gas cloud. The finding could help shed light on how the universe’s first generation of juggernaut black holes were born.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Snappiest claws</h4>



<p>Famously fast adult snapping shrimp have nothing on their young. High-speed video reveals that youngsters can snap their claws up to about 600 kilometers per second per second — an acceleration 20 times as fast as their elders achieve. A 1-month-old shrimp’s claw acceleration is on the same order of magnitude as a 9-millimeter bullet blasting out of a gun and is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snapping-shrimp-fastest-claw-biology">the highest acceleration for a reusable body part underwater</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 5</em>).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Oldest wooden structure</h4>



<p>Despite what happened to the second little pig’s house, wood has long proved a sturdy, reliable construction material — for perhaps as long as half a million years. Carved, interlocking logs uncovered in Zambia date to nearly 480,000 years ago, making them <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/logs-evidence-oldest-wood-structure">the oldest known wooden structure</a> (<em>SN: 9/20/23</em>). The structure — possibly a remnant of a walkway, seating area or storage unit — hints that some human relatives may have led a less nomadic lifestyle than previously thought.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Heaviest animal ever </h4>



<p>The animal kingdom appears to have a new heavyweight champion. An extinct whale aptly named <em>Perucetus colossus</em> might have weighed up to 340 metric tons, about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colossal-ancient-whale-heaviest-animal">twice as much as the heaviest blue whales</a>, an analysis of fossils found in Peru suggests (<em>SN: 9/9/23, p. 5</em>). The mighty mammal is thought to have prowled shallow waters 39 million years ago — but what it could have eaten to maintain its size remains a mystery.</p>

<p><strong>Flipper joins the navy</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ocean-sciences"><em>Science News</em></a>, December 22, 1973</p>



<p>Porpoises, sea lions and even whales have been trained to retrieve dummy rockets and other objects from the bottom of the ocean…. The animals, guided by a homing device, would carry grappling hooks to submerged objects.… But whales became too expensive and kept running off to mate, so research now concentrates on smaller sea mammals such as porpoises.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Today, the U.S. <a href="https://www.niwcpacific.navy.mil/About/Departments/Intelligence-Surveillance-and-Reconnaissance/Marine-Mammal-Program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navy Marine Mammal Program</a>, based in San Diego, trains bottlenosed dolphins and California sea lions to protect ships and harbors. Sea lions help retrieve equipment from the ocean floor, dolphins locate underwater mines and both species detect unauthorized swimmers. Animals in the program have also helped researchers understand dolphin echolocation, assess the impacts of human-generated noise on wildlife and more. Current projects are testing whether it’s possible to <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/152/4_Supplement/A106/2839622/Machine-learning-models-can-predict-bottlenose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judge dolphins’ health based on their whistles</a> and whether a <a href="https://www.navy.mil/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Print.aspx?PortalId=1&amp;ModuleId=2892&amp;Article=3388169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video game system</a> can provide Navy sea lions with cognitive enrichment.</p>

                <p><em>Science News</em> drew over 21 million visitors to our website this year. Here’s a look back at the most-read and most-watched stories of 2023.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Top news stories</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">1. Fungi that cause serious lung infections are now found throughout the U.S.</h5>



<p>An analysis of Medicare records from 2007 through 2016 reveals that <em>Histoplasma</em>,<em> Coccidioides</em> and <em>Blastomyces</em> fungi <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-cause-serious-lung-infections-found">have become more widespread in the United States</a>. The fungi, which cause serious lung infections, were once thought to be confined to certain regions of the country (<em>SN: 1/14/23, p. 32</em>).</p>





<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2</strong>. A new look at Ötzi the Iceman’s DNA reveals new ancestry and other surprises</h5>



<p>Ötzi the Iceman’s ancestors<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-otzi-iceman-dna-ancestry-genome"> may have been Neolithic farmers</a>, a new genetic analysis indicates. Previous studies suggested that the roughly 5,300-year-old frozen mummy had ancestors from the Pontic-Caspian steppe. Ötzi also had male-pattern baldness and darker skin than previously thought (<em>SN: 9/23/23, p. 5</em>).</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3</strong>. Mathematicians have finally discovered an elusive ‘einstein’ tile</h5>



<p>A newfound 13-sided shape dubbed the hat is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">the first true “einstein,”</a> a tile that forms a pattern that can cover an infinite plane but does not repeat (<em>SN 4/22/23, p. 7</em>). Mathematicians had been searching for an einstein <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-first-discovery-research-2023">for half a century</a>.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4</strong>. Earth’s inner core may be reversing its rotation</h5>



<p>Earth’s heart <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-reverse-rotation">may have temporarily stopped spinning</a> relative to the mantle and crust in 2009 (<em>SN: 2/25/23, p. 7</em>). Now, the inner core <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-discoveries-2023-big-if-true">may be reversing its spin</a> as part of a cycle that happens every few decades.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5</strong>. Astronomers spotted shock waves shaking the web of the universe for the first time</h5>



<p>Shock waves <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shock-waves-shaking-universe-first">ripple along the magnetic fields that permeate the cosmic web</a> — the tangle of galaxies, gas and dark matter that fills the universe (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 14</em>). Studying these shock waves, which were revealed by hundreds of thousands of radio satellite images, could help astronomers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-first-discovery-research-2023">better understand those mysterious magnetic fields</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Top long reads</h4>





<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1</strong>. A massive cavern beneath a West Antarctic glacier is teeming with life</h5>



<p>A vast, water-filled “cathedral” roughly 500 meters beneath the Kamb Ice Stream, a glacier in West Antarctica, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cavern-west-antarctic-glacier-life/">bustles with marine organisms</a>. The cavern provides a window into the continent’s warmer ancient past (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 18</em>).</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">2. Why scientists are expanding the definition of loneliness</h5>



<p>Social scientists now increasingly recognize that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/expanding-definition-loneliness-belonging/">loneliness results not just from isolation from people</a>, but also from animals, places, routines, rituals and more. That view may lead to new ways to manage the feeling, which is becoming a public health concern in the United States (<em>SN: 11/4/23, p. 24</em>).</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">3. How brain implants are treating depression</h5>



<p>Deep brain stimulation, a technology that pulses electricity deep into the brain, may be the only hope for relief for some patients with severe depression. In this series, the stories of Jon Nelson and three other patients undergoing the experimental treatment <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery/">offer an intimate look at how it has changed their lives</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/23, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">4. A chemical imbalance doesn’t explain depression. So what does?</h5>



<p>Depression is often blamed on a “chemical imbalance” in the brain. In reality, despite decades of sophisticated research, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression/">scientists still don’t have a great explanation of what depression is</a> or what causes it (<em>SN: 2/11/23, p. 18</em>).</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">5. How one device could help transform our power grid</h5>



<p>Coal-fired power plants across the United States are shutting down as society shifts toward clean energy sources. A smooth transition to renewables <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/one-device-transform-power-electical-grid-inverter/">could depend in large part on grid-forming inverters</a>, devices that hook up solar and wind farms to the existing power grid and stabilize the system (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 22</em>).</p>

<p>A U.S. federal agency that oversees research misconduct investigations and issues sanctions appears to be doling out punishments fairly, according to researchers who analyzed summaries of the agency’s cases from the last three decades. </p>



<p>But the authors of the study also found more than 30 papers the ORI said should be retracted have yet to be.</p>



<p>The researchers looked for associations between the severity of penalties the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) imposed on scientists it found responsible for research misconduct and their race and ethnicity, gender, academic rank, and other qualities. The researchers published their findings in late November in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/08989621.2023.2287046?"><em>Accountability in Research</em></a>, as the agency is in the process of <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/HHS-OASH-2023-0014-0001">revising its key regulations</a>,&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the new analysis, ORI’s sanctions correlated with factors indicating the seriousness of the misconduct, such as being required to retract or correct publications, but not with demographics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We did not find evidence of bias,” <a href="https://dlmp.uw.edu/faculty/fang_ferric">Ferric Fang</a>, a professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine and one of the study’s authors, said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fang, also member of the board of directors of The Center For Scientific Integrity, Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit organization, told us: </p>



<span id="more-128449"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The ORI states that the severity of administrative actions should be based on the circumstances and severity of misconduct as well as the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors, such as repeated behavior, the impact of the misconduct on the research record and public health, retaliatory behavior, and whether the individual committing misconduct was directly responsible and accepted responsibility for their actions. Our findings suggest that the ORI has been consistent in applying these criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“In light of ongoing concerns about disparities in research funding and the STEM workforce, our findings should provide some reassurance that the ORI is applying its administrative actions in an even-handed manner,” Fang said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, the researchers found “factors related to the severity of the misconduct or aggravating factors, such as whether the person interfered with the investigation, had violated a prior agreement with ORI, or was required to retract papers, were positively associated with the severity of the administration action,” said <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/bioethics/bioethicist/index.cfm">David Resnik</a>, the study’s corresponding author and a bioethicist with the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences. He further summarized the group’s findings:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Whether the person had committed plagiarism only (viewed by many as less serious than data fabrication/falsification) and whether the person admitted wrongdoing (a mitigating factor under most systems of punishment) were negatively associated with the severity of the administrative action.  Factors unrelated to the severity of the misconduct or aggravating or mitigating factors, such as the person’s race/ethnicity, gender, academic position, education, or institutional affiliation were not associated with the severity of administrative actions.   </p>
</blockquote>



<p>The researchers found a three year period of research supervision or funding ban was the most common sanction ORI levied, accounting for 65% of cases. ORI has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/31/feds-ban-ex-duke-lab-tech-from-funding-after-she-faked-data-linked-to-60-nih-grants/">occasionally banned</a> researchers from federal funding <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4259663/">for life</a>, and more recently issued a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/cancer-researcher-banned-from-federal-funding-for-faking-data-in-nearly-400-images-in-16-grant-applications/">10-year funding ban</a> and a pair of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/07/weill-cornell-cancer-researchers-committed-research-misconduct-feds-say">seven-year penalties</a>.</p>



<p>“I suppose that this is the default length of time,” Fang said of the three-year sanction, “and may represent a penalty that imposes a true hardship on a researcher without necessarily being career-ending.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked how the findings might be relevant to ORI’s current proposals for revising its regulations. Resnik, a Federal employee, declined to speculate. Fang said: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am aware that some of the recently proposed updates to ORI policies have been controversial, but I don’t believe that the administrative actions examined in our study will be substantially changed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The researchers also found that 32 papers ORI said should be retracted as part of its sanctions have not been pulled from the literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We should be concerned” about this finding, Resnik said. “It means that the literature has not been properly corrected and that scientists may be unwittingly relying on fraudulent research.&nbsp; Moreover, these are people who were caught committing misconduct, were sanctioned by their institutions and ORI, and were required to correct or retract papers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fang said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The fact that some papers that the ORI asks to be retracted are not necessarily retracted reflects that fact that only journals can retract publications, and unfortunately, not all appear to take this responsibility seriously.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steve-airglow-complex-physics">STEVE and other aurora-like glows perplex scientists with their complex physics</a></h4>

              
                <p>From the pristine dark of his backyard in rural Alberta, Canada, Alan Dyer has taken stunning photos of a rare sky glow called STEVE. To capture this ribbon of mauve, he and other citizen scientists typically let their cameras collect light for seconds at a time. Long exposures smear out STEVE’s finer details in favor of making its color pop. But when a STEVE stretched over his house one August night in 2022, Dyer tried a different approach.</p>



<p>He zoomed in on the sky glow with his camera and took a video of STEVE’s nitty-gritty details at a rate of 24 snapshots per second. Instead of the largely smooth drift of purple seen in past images, Dyer’s footage exposed STEVE as a frenetically flickering torrent of purplish-white fuzz.</p>





<p>“It didn’t look that beautiful,” Dyer says, but on the off chance it might be scientifically useful, he sent the video to Toshi Nishimura, a space physicist at Boston University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I said, ‘Oh my God, no one has ever seen this before,’” says Nishimura, who was eager to analyze such a high-resolution view of STEVE. But upon inspection, STEVE’s fine details didn’t jibe with scientists’ tentative understanding of the atmospheric chemistry behind the airglow. “This fine-scale structure gave us a huge headache, actually,” Nishimura says.</p>



<p>That confusion is par for the course when it comes to the science of STEVE — short for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement. Ever since citizen scientists first showed researchers their images of STEVE a few years ago, they&#8217;ve raised more questions than they answered.</p>



<p>“Every time we find something new [about STEVE], the number of physics questions that it opens up is triple what we expected,” says Bea Gallardo-Lacourt, a space physicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>



<p>At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, on December 14, Nishimura’s team presented the <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1353477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new high-res view of STEVE</a>. Other researchers described similarly perplexing observations that <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1430434" data-type="URL" data-id="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1430434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another non-aurora sky glow can morph into STEVE</a>. But there was a glimmer of clarity too: a computer model shared by still other sky detectives may explain <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1402618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what causes the “picket fence”</a> of green stripes that sometimes appears below STEVE.</p>



<p>“STEVE and the picket fence are arguably the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2023.1087974/full%23B27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest mystery in space physics</a> right now,” says space physicist Claire Gasque of the University of California, Berkeley. And because satellite signals can be affected by the conditions in Earth’s atmosphere where STEVE appears, explaining this airglow could have uses beyond understanding a pretty light show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">STEVE’s mysteries are multiplying</h4>



<p>When aurora chasers in Canada first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steve-aurora-makes-its-debut-mauve">introduced STEVE to the scientific community</a> in 2016, researchers knew it was no aurora (<em>SN: 3/15/18</em>). Auroras form when charged particles from the magnetic bubble, or magnetosphere, around Earth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-dunes-pulsating-cusp-steve">rain down into the atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/20</em>). Those particles crash into oxygen and nitrogen near Earth’s poles, painting the sky with brushes of red, green and blue. But STEVE was purple. And it appeared closer to the equator than the northern and southern lights do.</p>



<p>“For us here in southern western Canada,” Dyer says, “the aurora is typically to the north.” STEVE, meanwhile, can come right overhead.</p>



<p>STEVE was later <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-causes-aurora-glow-known-steve">linked to a river of charged particles</a> surging through the atmosphere (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>). That plasma stream, moving at several kilometers per second, is thought to energize the air around 200 kilometers off the ground to the point of glowing purple — but what molecules give STEVE its signature color remain unclear, especially in light of Dyer’s new footage.</p>





<p>Dyer’s video captured details of STEVE down to about 90 meters across — fairly small for an airglow that can span thousands of kilometers. The footage showed a clumpy, speckled stream of purple rushing westward at about 9 kilometers per second, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JA032008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sporting variations in brightness as small as a few kilometers across</a>, some of which popped in and out of view within seconds, Nishimura and colleagues reported in the December <em>JGR Space Physics</em>.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This high-res video of STEVE taken in August 2022 reveals smaller structures in the purple glow than researchers could see before in long-exposure photos.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“The leading theory of the STEVE emission is that there’s nitric oxide that is excited by the fast plasma stream,” Nishimura says. That nitric oxide is thought to give off the purple light. But excited nitric oxide can glow for an hour, Nishimura notes. That’s about how long STEVE lasts overall; the granular bursts of brightness that last mere seconds add a wrinkle to that idea.</p>



<p>Firing a sensor-strapped rocket through STEVE could identify the molecules responsible, Nishimura says. “But the challenge is that we need to know when and where STEVE is going to happen, and that’s extremely difficult.”</p>



<p>STEVE can appear just after the peaks of substorms, which are disturbances in the magnetosphere that can stir up spectacular auroras. “STEVE generally appears after the main aurora show has kind of faded,” Dyer says. But not every substorm comes with a STEVE encore, and research presented by Gallardo-Lacourt and her colleagues at AGU suggests <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1399930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not all STEVEs need a substorm to appear</a>.</p>



<p>One thing that might help researchers refine their STEVE predictions, Nishimura says, is better understanding the light show’s relationship to another non-auroral airglow called a stable auroral red (SAR) arc — which citizen science photos now suggest can morph into STEVE.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How STEVE and SAR arcs interact</h4>



<p>In March 2015, citizen scientist Ian Griffin set out to photograph a particularly dazzling auroral display near Dunedin, New Zealand. But just north of the southern lights, he spotted something strange — a wide, red sky glow that morphed into the mauve strand of STEVE. Griffin’s footage offered researchers their <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL098511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first glimpse of a STEVE blooming out of a SAR arc</a>. Space physicist Carlos Martinis of Boston University and colleagues reported it in June 2022 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Scientists have studied SAR arcs for decades. Like STEVE, these airglows stretch east-to-west across the sky closer to the equator than the northern and southern lights. But unlike STEVE’s roughly hour-long set, SAR arcs can stain the sky for hours to days at a time — visible with cameras, though usually too dim to see with the naked eye.</p>



<p>SAR arcs form when disturbances in Earth’s magnetosphere cause charged particles thousands of kilometers out in space to collide, creating heat that seeps down into the ionosphere — the layer of the atmosphere home to STEVE. That heat energizes electrons to excite oxygen atoms to shed red light that’s normally about one-tenth as bright as auroras. But the SAR arc that Griffin saw was radiant enough to rival red southern lights.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In March 2015, citizen scientist Ian Griffin captured this footage of a red SAR arc mutating into a purple STEVE streak.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It was just stunning,” says Megan Gillies, who studies auroras at the University of Calgary in Canada. Griffin’s footage inspired her to search for <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL101205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cases of STEVE emerging from SAR arcs</a>. Her team found one spotted by the Transition Region Explorer, or TREx, Spectrograph at Lucky Lake, Saskatchewan in April 2022. The group reported it in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> in March. STEVE’s bright purple streak emerged from a SAR arc’s red glow, hung around for about half an hour, then gave way to more red.</p>





<p>“It’s like watching a fire smoldering, and then you throw more wood on it and then it blazes up … Whoosh, there it goes! And then it kind of dies back down,” says Gillies, whose group described the SAR arc–STEVE connection at the AGU meeting. “There’s something that happens that triggers a STEVE,” she says, but because not all SAR arcs mutate into STEVEs, it’s not clear what causes this transition.</p>



<p>It might have something to do with the plasma torrent that powers STEVE. SAR arcs have similarly been linked to westward plasma flows in the atmosphere — though not as fast as the plasma flows that power STEVEs, Martinis notes. As the SAR arc seen in 2015 evolved into STEVE, satellite data did show a wide stream of plasma in the atmosphere narrow and quicken into the kind of intense filament typical of STEVE. But what triggered this switch remains an open question, Martinis says. Further complicating matters: citizen scientists have also spotted STEVEs and SAR arcs <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL092169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing alongside but seemingly independent of each other</a>.</p>



<p>With researchers left scratching their heads over these observations, “this is where modeling comes in,” Gillies says. Theorists can use computers to test whether the physics they think is happening produces light patterns resembling STEVE, she explains. Computer models are already helping piece together another STEVE-related puzzle: the source of the picket fence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The picket fence may be built right in Earth’s backyard</h4>



<p>At first, researchers thought STEVE’s sometimes sidekick of green stripes was a plain old aurora. After all, the picket fence’s bright green glow is a similar hue as some normal northern lights. But the specific wavelengths of light emanating from the picket fence hint that it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steve-light-sky-glow-atmosphere-different-typical-aurora">might not be an aurora</a>, after all (<em>SN: 11/12/20</em>).</p>

<p>Showers of charged particles from way out in the magnetosphere light up normal auroras. “When they collide with the atmosphere, they’re going to create a pretty wide spectrum of colors,” Gasque says. That includes green from oxygen and red and blue from nitrogen. “That blue is kind of the smoking gun that we didn’t see with the picket fence,” Gasque says. Its absence hints that the picket fence’s green spires don’t arise from the same process as auroras.</p>



<p>An alternative explanation for the picket fence might be electric fields embedded within Earth’s atmosphere that run parallel to the planet’s magnetic field, Gasque says. Those fields could energize local electrons to excite oxygen into glowing green and coax nitrogen to give off a bit of red but not blue. Gasque and colleagues ran a computer model of Earth’s atmosphere with electrons energized by electric fields. The team compared the light produced inside their simulated atmosphere with light from a picket fence seen by the TREx Spectrograph at Lucky Lake in April 2018.</p>



<p>The model did indeed reproduce the ratio of red to green light seen in the real-life picket fence without a tinge of blue — bolstering the idea that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL106073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atmospheric electric fields could construct the picket fence</a>, the researchers reported November 16 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> and at the AGU meeting. But scientists need to confirm that such electric fields actually exist at the altitudes where picket fences appear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The plan now is to try and fly a rocket through one of these structures,” says Gallardo-Lacourt. Gasque and her colleagues have just proposed such a mission to NASA. The rocket wouldn’t fly through the picket fence — which, like STEVE, is too hard to predict. Instead, it would target phenomena with similar coloring that are far more common: enhanced auroras.</p>

<p>“With enhanced aurorae, you have kind of these sharp, bright layers within the aurora,” Gasque says. The sharpness of those variations in auroral light and their picket fence–like color scheme hints that they might be powered by electric fields as well. If a future rocket mission detects electric fields threaded through enhanced auroras, that would help confirm that similar fields build the picket fence.</p>



<p>NASA’s <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/resources/stdts/geospace-dynamics-constellation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geospace Dynamics Constellation</a> mission will also launch a fleet of spacecraft as early as 2027 to probe Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere — which might yield more data that help explain aspects of STEVE, Gallardo-Lacourt notes. In the meantime, STEVE’s dedicated paparazzi of citizen scientists will continue snapping photos of the phenomenon from the ground.</p>



<p>“We’re out specifically looking for STEVE and knowing that there’s scientific interest in it,” Dyer says. “Prior to the era of STEVE … you might have thought, well, there’s nothing amateurs can contribute now to aurora research, it’s all done with rockets and satellites and the like. But nope! There’s a lot we can contribute” — even if those contributions are often new puzzles for scientists to solve.</p>

<p>Prior research has shown that smartphone use among adolescents has increased in recent years, and that this usage may be associated with higher risk of adverse health&mdash;such as psychiatric disorders, sleep issues, eye-related problems, and musculoskeletal disorders. However, growing evidence suggests that at least some daily internet usage may be associated with better physical and mental health for adolescents.</p>



<p><strong>Study Design</strong></p>



<p>To deepen understanding of the relationship between adolescents&rsquo; use of smartphones and health, Jin-Hwa Moon and Jong Ho Cha of Hanyang University Medical Center, Korea, and colleagues analyzed data on more than 50,000 adolescent participants in the ongoing Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey collected in 2017 and in 2020. The data included the approximate number of daily hours each participant spent on a smartphone as well as various health measures. The statistical analysis employed propensity score matching to help account for other factors that could be linked to health outcomes, such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status.</p>



<p><strong>Findings and Insights</strong></p>



<p>The researchers found that in 2020, the percentage of adolescents in the study who used a smartphone more than 2 hours per day was 85.7 percent&mdash;up from 64.3 percent in 2017. Adolescents who used a smartphone for more than 4 hours per day had higher rates of stress, thoughts of suicide, and substance use than those with usage below 4 hours per day. However, adolescents that used a smartphone 1-2 hours per day encountered fewer problems than adolescents who did not use a smartphone at all.</p>



<p>The authors note that this study does not confirm a causal relationship between smartphone use and adverse health outcomes. Nonetheless, the findings could help inform usage guidelines for adolescents&mdash;especially if daily usage continues to rise.</p>



<p>The authors add: &ldquo;This research shows the impact of using smart devices for more than 4 hours a day on adolescent health.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-creature-research-discovery-2023">These are our favorite animal stories of 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>From birds repurposing antiavian architecture to jellyfish that can learn, here are dispatches from the animal kingdom that we went wild for in 2023.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Intelligent jellies</h4>



<p>No brain? No problem. The fingernail-sized Caribbean box jellyfish (<em>Tripedalia cystophora</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brainless-jellyfish-eyes-nerves-learn">uses its clusters of eyes and nerve cells to learn</a> to avoid bumping into things, experiments in an aquatic obstacle course suggest (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>). In the box jelly’s natural habitat, where the creature must swerve to dodge mangrove roots in murky water, it pays to be a good pupil.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Prehistoric pout</h4>



<p><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>’s menacing grin may have been less toothy than previously thought. Artistic renderings commonly depict the ravenous reptile as lipless, constantly baring its pearly whites. But <em>T</em>. <em>rex</em> may actually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trex-lips-modern-lizards-dinosaur">have had a pout</a> that kept rows of pointy teeth covered, similar to Komodo dragons, an analysis of the skulls and teeth of dinosaurs and modern reptile suggests (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 6</em>).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Revenge of the birds</h4>



<p>City life can be hostile for birds. Municipalities across the world have put up spikes to prevent birds from roosting — and pooping — on streetlights, buildings and other structures. But some Eurasian magpies (<em>Pica pica</em>) and carrion crows (<em>Corvus corone</em>) in parts of Europe found a way to stick it to humans. The birds rip up antibird spikes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-use-antibird-spikes-build-nests">build nests with them</a> (<em>SN: 9/9/23, p. 4</em>). Magpies may even use the spikes as humans do, to ward off avian pests.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-2_bird.jpg?resize=680%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="A Eurasian magpie nest made out of antibird spikes in a tree" class="wp-image-3134236" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-2_bird.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-2_bird.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134236">A Eurasian magpie nest made partly out of more than 1,500 antibird spikes sits in a sugar maple tree in Antwerp, Belgium.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134236">Auke-Florian Hiemstra</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Swashbuckling spiders</h4>



<p>Pirates on the high seas would be proud of their landlubbing arachnid counterparts. A species of cannibalistic pirate spider in Costa Rica tricks prey into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cannibal-pirate-spiders-web-arachnid">walking the plank, right into its clutches</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 11</em>). <em>Gelanor siquirres</em> casts a silk thread to intercept that of an unsuspecting orb weaver trying to build a web. When the eight-legged victim scuttles across its own silk thread to secure the other end, the orb weaver finds impending doom rather than harmless vegetation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-3_spider.jpg?resize=680%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="A Gelanor siquirres spider" class="wp-image-3134237" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-3_spider.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-3_spider.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134237">The spider&nbsp;<em>Gelanor siquirres</em> has a seemingly unique way of hunting other arachnids, tricking them into walking right into a trap.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134237">G. Barrantes, L. Segura-Hernández and D. Solano-Brenes/<em>Animal Behaviour</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Desperate flies, desperate measures</h4>



<p>Snow flies (<em>Chinoea </em>spp.) have a macabre method to survive the frigid mountains and forests they call home. Dozens of flies that researchers subjected to below-zero temperatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trick-snow-flies-survive-self-amputation">self-amputated their limbs</a>, but only when the limbs began to freeze (<em>SN: 7/15/23, p. 14</em>). The flies probably shed the appendages to keep ice crystals from reaching the rest of the body.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Snow flies may drop one or more legs to prevent themselves from freezing. Even missing multiple limbs, one fly (shown here) can navigate over snow in the wild.</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Self-aware fish</h4>



<p>When it comes to brainpower, this fish is no small fry. Not only can the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (<em>Labroides dimidiatus</em>) recognize itself in a mirror, the fish can also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-recognize-photo-self-aware">identify a picture of itself out of a lineup</a> (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 13</em>). The finding suggests the wrasse forms a mental image of itself — similar to what humans do — and that self-awareness may be more common in the animal kingdom than once thought.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-4_fish.jpg?resize=680%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="a Bluestreak cleaner wrasse" class="wp-image-3134238" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-4_fish.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121623_YE_animals_inline-4_fish.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134238">Bluestreak cleaner wrasse can recognize photos of themselves, a possible sign that the fish have self-awareness.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3134238">marrio31/iStock/Getty Images Plus</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tight-gilled sharks</h4>



<p>Regulating body temperature in chilly water is a challenge even for scalloped hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>). To stay warm while hunting in the deep ocean, the sharks use a method normally seen in diving mammals: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-gills-thermoregulate">They hold their breath</a> (<em>SN: 6/17/23, p. 10</em>). Keeping gills closed holds in body heat, preventing the predators from becoming fish ice pops.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Big-mouthed snake</h4>



<p>This African egg-eating snake redefines what it means to open wide. The Gans’ egg-eater (<em>Dasypeltis gansi</em>) can open its mouth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snakes-big-gulp-gans-egg-eater">wider than any other snake</a> relative to its size, lab experiments suggest (<em>SN: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 36</em>). An egg-eater with a 1-centimeter-wide head could fit a cylinder 5 centimeters across in its mouth. The reptile edges out the previous record holder: the Burmese python (<em>Python molurus bivittatus</em>).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Disaster dogs</h4>



<p>The irradiated zone around Ukraine’s Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant might be off-limits for humans, but other animals didn’t get the memo. Packs of feral dogs that for years have roamed the area abandoned since 1986 are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-chernobyl-dogs-revealed">genetically distinct</a> from canines of similar breeds that live outside the zone (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 15</em>). The differences probably aren’t due to radiation, researchers say. Whether Chernobyl’s radioactivity has had any effect on the dogs remains to be seen, but knowing their genetic makeup will help scientists spot potential radiation damage.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Landscaping ants</h4>



<p>Many ants are expert navigators who use local landmarks to find their way around. But what’s an ant to do when the world around them is almost completely flat and featureless? Desert ants (<em>Cataglyphis&nbsp;fortis</em>) in Tunisia’s salt pans take matters into their own mandibles. Workers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-build-tall-nest-hills-landmarks">build tall mounds over their colonies’ nests</a> so wayward foragers can find their way home (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 16</em>).</p>

                <p>To the moon, asteroids and beyond, robotic explorers racked up the mileage in 2023. Here’s the latest status of space missions that made headlines this year.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer</h4>



<p><strong>April 14:</strong> The European Space Agency launched the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Juice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juice mission</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> There’s not much progress to report yet; it will take about eight years for the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, to reach its destination. But once there, the spacecraft will fly by the Jovian moons Callisto, Europe and Ganymede numerous times before settling into orbit around Ganymede. Closely scrutinizing these moons will help verify whether they host liquid oceans beneath their icy outer shells and gauge whether these underground seas could host life.&nbsp;</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Euclid space telescope</h4>



<p><strong>July 1:</strong> The ESA launched the Euclid space telescope.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Euclid’s aim is to create a 3-D map of the universe</a> to help astronomers better understand dark matter, the mysterious substance that accounts for most matter in the universe, and dark energy, the unknown force that’s accelerating the universe’s expansion. In November, the telescope showed off what it’s capable of when it sent back its first full-color images, dazzling beauty shots of far-off galaxies.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Chandrayaan-3 </h4>



<p><strong>August 23:</strong> India became only the fourth country to successfully land on the moon when the Chandrayaan-3 mission’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/india-chandrayaan-moon-landing">Vikram lander touched down near the lunar south pole</a>, the first spacecraft to do so (<em>SN: 9/23/23, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> High on the mission’s to-do list was testing the capabilities of the lander and its rover, named Pragyan, to prep for future lunar missions. The duo also collected measurements, such as the temperature and chemical makeup of the surface. The data could prove useful to space agencies like NASA that intend to send astronauts to the south pole, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">a tantalizing region that appears to harbor water ice</a> in shadowed craters (<em>SN: 12/3/22, p. 14</em>). The mission ended in early September when Vikram and Pragyan entered sleep mode.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">OSIRIS-REx</h4>



<p><strong>September 24:</strong> After collecting rock from the asteroid Bennu in October 2020, NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth">OSIRIS-REx spacecraft flew by Earth</a> to drop off its precious cargo (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> About 250 grams of Bennu safely parachuted to Earth in a protective capsule. So far, scientists have analyzed some bonus material that stuck to the outside of OSIRIS-REx’s sample canister before the outer capsule closed. These bits of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-asteroid-bennu-first-look-sample">Bennu mostly consist of water-bearing clay minerals</a> — perhaps the same kind of minerals that made Earth a watery world (<em>SN: 11/4/23, p. 6</em>). As of early December, investigations of the bulk of the sample hadn’t begun; NASA workers have been unable to remove two of the fasteners that sealed the canister shut. Meanwhile, the mission continues under a new name, OSIRIS-APEX, as the spacecraft travels to the asteroid Apophis with an arrival date of 2029.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Psyche</h4>



<p><strong>October 13:</strong> NASA’s Psyche mission took off.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> The spacecraft has a long way to go before arriving at asteroid 16 Psyche in 2029. It’s worth the wait, though, because the mostly metal space rock may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-nasa-mars-asteroids-spacecraft">be the exposed core of an early planet</a> that lost its outer layers (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 34</em>). Studying 16 Psyche could be the closest scientists get to directly examining a planet’s normally inaccessible heart.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lucy</h4>



<p><strong>November 1:</strong> After two years in space, NASA’s Lucy spacecraft flew by its first asteroid.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Lucy’s goal was to have close encounters with 10 asteroids over a roughly 10-year period. But it turns out that its first target, called Dinkinesh, is actually two asteroids — a large one with a smaller one in orbit around it. Dinkinesh and its tagalong reside in the main asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter. But most of Lucy’s targets are Trojan asteroids, which share a path around the sun with Jupiter. Studying those space rocks could offer new <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">clues to the origins of the giant planets in our solar system</a> (<em>SN: 10/15/21</em>).</p>

<p><em>Retraction Watch readers may know that the U.S. Office of Research Integrity, which has oversight of misconduct investigations of work funded by the National Institutes of Health, has proposed changes to its regulations. It’s the first such proposal since 2005, and has </em><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/should-government-disclose-university-misconduct-findings-academics-are-split"><em>generated discussion</em></a><em> in </em><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/08/research-misconduct/"><em>various quarters</em></a><em>. We’re pleased to present this guest post by James Kennedy, a longtime observer of these issues.</em></p>



<p>One of the most controversial points about the federal policies for research misconduct is the extent to which a laboratory director, principal investigator, or lead author is held responsible for misconduct by others on their research team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is surprisingly common in cases of extensive research fraud that the person who committed the offense cannot be identified. Data management in such cases is usually uncontrolled, with no tracking of changes to the data or preservation of the original data. The principal investigator is often at the center of the pattern of misconduct, but should they also be held accountable for it when the only provable fact is that they allowed a work environment that was vulnerable to bad behavior?</p>



<p>The regulations for handling misconduct in research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service are currently being modified, and the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), which implements the rules, is asking for public comment. This opportunity to influence the handling of misconduct is all the more important given that the regulations are often used as a model for misconduct policies at universities and research institutions. The comment period was recently extended until <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/blog/ori-extends-nprm-comment-deadline">Jan. 4, 2024</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Are you responsible for misconduct by others?</strong></p>



<span id="more-128440"></span>



<p>As a scientist who <a href="http://jeksite.org/psi/jp17.pdf">once helped expose fraud</a> and has experience developing regulations, I have already submitted <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2023-0014-0051">detailed comments</a> on the proposed regulatory changes. My perspective is that the current legal precedent regarding the responsibility of PIs in misconduct cases is problematic. This precedent, which was established in 2018 <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/dab/decisions/alj-decisions/2018/alj-cr5109/index.html">in a case involving the ORI</a>, holds that principal investigators and lead authors on papers will be held accountable for any fraudulent results they report. Their accountability extends to data provided by collaborators that were not under the management of the principal investigator or lead author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The judge apparently expects researchers to delve deeply into the possibility of fraud at all collaborating laboratories, without realizing that such an effort can take months and would make scientific collaboration impractical.</p>



<p>This assignment of responsibility for principal investigators and lead authors is established precedent for ORI but is not addressed in the proposed regulations. I believe it should be, and the new rules should be more realistic than the current precedent. In my view, laboratory directors and principal investigators are responsible for ensuring persons they directly manage follow good research practices, but not for collaborators who are not under their direct management. My comments to the regulator include a more complete description of my proposal (see point 2).</p>



<p>Another controversial topic is whether the final report of a university investigation of research misconduct should be made public for open discussion and evaluation like any other evidence and claims in science. The fact that allegations of misconduct have been made does not turn off the principles of open, transparent science. The justification and rationale for this point are described in point 4 of <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2023-0014-0051">my comments</a>.</p>



<p>Those who support, oppose, or would qualify the ideas discussed here should also consider submitting comments to ORI.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Making regulatory comments effective</strong></p>



<p>Submitting comments about proposed regulations will be more effective if the following practices are followed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Multiple comments making the same point bring more attention to the point. The number of positive and negative comments will be considered. It is useful to be redundant even though a similar point has been made by others.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Provide information about your credentials and experience. It is fine for a person with no direct experience in research to express an opinion. That lets an agency such as ORI know the public perception. Opinions by those who have direct experience in research are also needed. The agency needs to be able to distinguish between these two cases.</li>



<li>Providing evidence to support your view is valuable. A personal experience that pertains to the need for or effect of a regulation can significantly influence a regulatory decision. References to relevant research findings are also useful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The comments can be short and focused, or more extensive. My comments are more extensive because I have experience developing regulations and want to address the full thought process of the agency. This includes describing a problem, proposing a solution, and providing a legal rationale. Most comments focus on describing a problem, and may or may not suggest a possible solution. Presenting a legal rationale is not needed for most comments.</li>
</ul>



<p>When regulations are proposed or adopted, they are posted in the Federal Register. In general, the preamble to the regulations in the Federal Register must be read to obtain a good understanding of the intended meaning and rationale for the regulations.</p>



<p>Read the proposed rules for misconduct <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-10-06/pdf/2023-21746.pdf">here</a>, see instructions for submitting comments <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/blog/submitting-comment-regulationsgov">here</a>, and read comments posted so far <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/HHS-OASH-2023-0014-0001/comment">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-water-navigate-light-find-land">Here’s how spiders that go overboard use light to find land</a></h4>

              
                <p>Biologist Brian Gall was flinging stowaway spiders out of his kayak when he noticed an interesting pattern: After landing on the water’s surface, the arachnids quickly darted to the nearest shoreline, no matter how far he paddled from dry land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The passengers, elongate stilt spiders (<em>Tetragnatha elongata)</em>, spin their webs on the edges of ponds to catch prey. When the spiders tumble into the water, which happens often, they rely on surface tension to evade predators and skitter to shore. But just how the stilt spiders navigate the water’s surface has been unclear — until now. The arachnids appear to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944200623000648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use light reflected off the water to pinpoint the less-reflective shoreline</a>, Gall and his team at Hanover College in Indiana report in the December <em>Zoology</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Scientists have studied the navigation skills of only a handful of the approximately 51,000 known species of arachnids. Spiders have been shown to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ogre-faced-spider-hearing-catch-insects-prey-air-sound-sight">rely on sound</a>, vibrations, chemical signals and, of course, their eight eyes (<em>SN: 10/29/20</em>). Some species can see and use polarized light, which can occur naturally when light waves flatten as they reflect off a surface such as water.</p>



<p>“Spider vision is completely different than ours,” says Sidney Goedeker, who worked with Gall as an undergraduate and is currently a research technologist at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. “And it’s not something that we can perceive because we don’t have what they have.”</p>



<p>Perhaps, Gall thought, the stowaways could offer a way to study the elongate stilt spider’s homing senses. His team built test arenas in an outdoor tank and a natural pond in Gall’s backyard, using a film suspended over the water to polarize incoming sunlight before it hit the surface, creating areas without glare that mimicked what land might look like to a spider. Then, the researchers dropped 68 spiders into the arenas and recorded their movements.</p>



<p>Spiders in the tank overwhelmingly raced to covered areas. In the pond, spiders dropped between the shore and the covered areas chose both options with equal frequency, making circular passes until they found land. In both arenas, spiders that chose covered areas would often circle in and out of the film’s shadow, searching for the promised shoreline.</p>



<p>In previous pond experiments without the film, elongate stilt spiders unerringly zipped toward land, Gall says.&nbsp;Taken together with the new findings, the species probably perceives polarized light and uses it as a “not-land” landmark, the team says.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to overstate how crazy these results are,” Gall says. “I have dropped probably one thousand spiders onto the water’s surface, and I’ve almost never seen them make the wrong choice.”</p>



<p>There is still much to learn about the navigation skills of other similar spiders, says Eileen Hebets, an arachnologist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, who was not involved in the study. “An orb-weaving spider with evidence of using visual cues opens up lots of new questions about other groups,” she says. “We tend not to think of vision as being very important for web-building spiders.”</p>



<p>Gall is delighted that a day spent lobbing spiders from his kayak led to this discovery. “It just highlights how watching and asking really basic questions can lead to really cool stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/speed-bumps-thwaites-glacier">Speed bumps under Thwaites Glacier could help slow its flow to the sea</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong> — Most of the news regarding the Thwaites Glacier, a Florida-sized slab of ice that is melting and currently contributing about 4 percent of global sea level rise, is bad. But a bit of good news may have emerged.</p>



<p>A seismic survey of the bed beneath an upstream section of Thwaites has revealed <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1336054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rough high-rises of earth under the Antarctic glacier</a>, which are comparable in height to the Manhattan skyline, glaciologist Coen Hofstede reported December 12 at a news conference during the American Geophysical Union fall meeting. These rugged rises may be snagging the glacier’s underbelly, slowing its flow toward the ocean and mitigating global sea level rise.</p>





<p>Glaciers flow somewhat like rivers, but much slower. Where Thwaites outlets into the ocean, it connects to a floating shelf of ice that braces and partially restrains the glacier. That ice shelf was once pinned upon <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">an underwater mountain</a>, which helped stabilize it (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). But now the shelf is so deteriorated that it’s basically unhitched, Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, said at the news event.</p>



<p>Fortunately, though, the glacier “is not going to suddenly flow off land,” thanks partly to what’s been discovered upstream, said Pettit, who was not involved in the discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 70 kilometers inland from Thwaites’ ice shelf, Hofstede and his colleagues conducted a seismic survey to probe the glacier’s underbelly. The team attached a 1.5-kilometer-long daisy-chain of seismometers to a vehicle equipped with a vibrating plate. Then they drove a roughly 200-kilometer-long stretch of the glacier, using the plate to generate seismic waves and the seismometers to record the waves’ reflectance off layers of ice and earth below. “It’s almost like radar,” said Hofstede, of the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.</p>

<p>The seismic waves revealed rises under Thwaites that are 10 to 20 kilometers long and toothed with blocks of sediment. These blocks stood up to 100 meters tall above the rises and stretched for up to several kilometers horizontally.</p>



<p>The data showed that the upstream faces of these blocks appear to be under greater pressure than their downstream sides, and that there might be layers of deformed ice within the glacier above the rises. Hofstede hypothesizes that the rises and blocks are slowing Thwaites’ flow as its ice presses against them.</p>



<p>Using computers to simulate the flow of Thwaites glacier shows that “it gets hung up on tall features,” said glaciologist Ben Smith of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>The rises are probably related to a rift system, an area where tectonic forces have pulled the ground apart, Hofstede said. Under Thwaites, these rifts run roughly perpendicular to the glacier’s ice flow, sort of like speed bumps on a street.</p>



<p>The findings will allow for more nuanced simulations of the glacier’s evolution, Hofstede said, which are crucial for understanding rates of sea level rise.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-history-stories-2023">History buffs will dig these 5 science stories from 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>Science occasionally gives us clearer views of the distant past. This year, researchers opened windows into the life and times of ancient Romans, impressionist painters and other towering historical figures.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Huygens’ hazy telescopes </h4>



<p>Christiaan Huygens, the 17th-century Dutch astronomer best known for his studies of Saturn’s moons and rings, may have needed glasses. That would explain why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-christiaan-huygens-flawed-telescopes-solved">the telescopes he designed</a> weren’t as sharp as those of his peers, a researcher argues (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 5</em>). A closer look at Huygens’ telescope lenses suggests the scientist was nearsighted. The lenses probably overmagnified his view of the cosmos, making distant objects appear clear to him but fuzzy to others.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Vintage essence</h4>



<p>What did the ancient Romans smell like? Chemical analyses of a 2,000-year-old perfume bottle from an elite woman’s grave suggest <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-roman-perfume-smell-patchouli">a familiar earthy scent: patchouli</a> (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 14</em>). Patchouli oil permeates modern fragrances, but its use in ancient Rome had been unknown. Perfume extracts that are this old typically dissipate and become lost to history. But the quartz flask was found intact with a bitumen seal that adsorbed some of the perfume molecules, preserving them for millennia.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Forgery fighter</h4>



<p>Infrared and X-ray scans of more than 600 paper bills made by Benjamin Franklin’s prolific printing press revealed<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/benjamin-franklin-money-counterfeiter"> colorful threads and shiny mineral residues</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 5</em>). The additives, used to stymie counterfeiters and boost the bills’ durability, helped set the standard for paper currency in colonial America, researchers say.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Decoding Beethoven’s coda</h4>



<p>Ludwig van <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beethoven-hair-dna-composer-death">Beethoven’s DNA</a> supports what many historians have suspected: The composer likely died of liver failure (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 16</em>). Until now, the theory largely rested on reports that Beethoven had been drinking a lot of alcohol shortly before his death in 1827. While reconstructing Beethoven’s genome from samples of his hair, researchers discovered he also had a genetic risk for liver disease. The composer also suffered from a hepatitis B infection, the team determined, further compounding his susceptibility to liver damage.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Shrouded in smoke</h4>



<p>The Industrial Revolution may have shaped impressionist art — literally. An analysis of more than 100 paintings by artists such as Claude Monet and Joseph Mallord William Turner found that changes in contrast, color and visibility track over time with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-impressionist-monet-painters">rising air pollution</a> in London and Paris (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 4</em>). Particles in smog absorb and scatter light, reducing contrast and making colors whiter. As air pollution worsened throughout the 19th century, impressionist paintings grew paler and hazier just as artists’ views of their subjects did.</p>

<p>Over the past year, amid announcements of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">thousands of retractions</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">journal closures</a> and a major index <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">delisting several titles</a>, executives at the troubled publisher Hindawi have at various times mentioned a “<a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/04/guest-post-addressing-paper-mills-and-a-way-forward-for-journal-security/">new retraction process</a>” for investigating and pulling papers “at scale.”&nbsp; The publisher has declined to provide details – until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far in 2023, Hindawi has retracted <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8">over 8,000 articles</a> – more than we’ve ever seen in a single year from all publishers combined. And Hindawi is not done cleaning up from paper mills’ infiltration of its special issues, according to a new report from its parent company, Wiley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reckoning with Hindawi’s paper mill problem has cost Wiley, which bought the open-access publisher in 2021, an estimated $35-40 million in lost revenue in the current fiscal year, Matthew Kissner, Wiley’s interim president and CEO, said on the company’s most recent earnings call. Wiley will <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/06/wiley-to-stop-using-hindawi-name-amid-18-million-revenue-decline/">stop using the “Hindawi” name</a> next year, Kissner told investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher has  issued a whitepaper, “<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/network/publishing/research-publishing/open-access/hindawi-publication-manipulation-whitepaper">Tackling publication manipulation at scale: Hindawi’s journey and lessons for academic publishing</a>,” which explains “what happened at Hindawi” and the process the company developed to investigate and retract thousands of articles from special issues.  </p>



<span id="more-128430"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to the whitepaper, Hindawi’s research integrity staff identified “suspicious patterns” in multiple special issues around the same time as “independent researchers with an interest in research integrity, also began noticing indicators of large-scale systematic manipulation.” </p>



<p>In September 2022, the publisher announced an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">initial batch of 500 retractions</a>. Then, the whitepaper states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These initial investigations coupled with the findings of independent researchers pointed to the infiltration of Hindawi [special issues] SIs at an even greater scale than first anticipated, making it clear that thousands of manuscripts would need to be investigated.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">halted publication of special issues</a> for a few months beginning in October 2022, and reassessed all special issue manuscripts with “a comprehensive checklist of specific hallmarks of papermill papers.” Hindawi also “carried out a thorough review and strengthening of our existing checks on editors, authors and reviewers,” according to the whitepaper. To investigate thousands of already-published papers, it developed “a new protocol aimed at detecting manipulation patterns and retracting papers rapidly and at scale.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hindawi essentially created a checklist of criteria for scoring articles, and all that met a certain threshold were retracted. The whitepaper lists several “indicators of manipulation” Hindawi has been using as evidence to retract articles:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Discrepancies in scope.</li>



<li>Discrepancies in the description of the research reported.</li>



<li>Discrepancies between the availability of data and the research described.</li>



<li>Inappropriate citations.</li>



<li>Incoherent, meaningless, and/or irrelevant content included in the article.</li>



<li>Compromised or manipulated peer-review.</li>
</ol>



<p>The publisher explained:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The decision to retract, given this evidence, is based on the rationale that the publication process has been undermined and we can no longer vouch for the integrity of the article. We have intentionally limited the specific details of what is under investigation in the retraction notice, in part because it is essential that the intelligence shared with bad actors is restricted. Moreover, to proceed expeditiously and communicate with thousands of authors, standardized wording of retraction notices was essential.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hindawi outsourced the work of assessing individual papers to outside vendors. At least two people, trained by the publisher’s staff, evaluated each paper according to Hindawi’s criteria and filled out a questionnaire in a “bespoke software application.” In addition:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>computational tools were used to provide additional supporting evidence about fabricated content, plagiarized peer-review reports, and suspect peer review turn-around times. We also built on the valuable work done by independent research integrity sleuths, by collecting, evaluating, and categorizing comments provided on PubPeer as part of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YL5rMrZoUcp3rn1mP7B_X9QE08VPGXehhK-dlkFN_Iw/edit#gid=0">Smut Clyde’s list</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides retracting thousands of papers, Hindawi has used the results of its investigation to ban “several hundred” guest editors of special issues from future editorial roles and publishing articles. The publisher has also instituted “much more stringent checks” on proposals for special issues and guest editors, as well as “much greater scrutiny of peer review.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as continuing retractions, Hindawi plans to issue expressions of concern for entire special issues “to alert readers that they should take additional care interpreting all papers” when the publisher suspects more articles in a particular issue “are likely to be problematic” but has not yet investigated or found proof of issues. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Multiple sleuths Retraction Watch asked to comment on the whitepaper complimented Hindawi for taking action and sharing information, but also questioned whether the publisher had really learned its lesson, and pointed out further work to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think it’s a good thing they’re documenting what they’re doing and putting out information about it,” Adam Day, developer of the <a href="https://clear-skies.co.uk/">Papermill Alarm</a>, said. “I hope it’s something other publishers take a lead from and feel encouraged to deal with their own problems openly as well, because this is affecting a huge number of publishers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Day noted that he had still seen papermill articles in Hindawi journals as of this spring, after the publisher resumed special issues. “I think they’ve definitely made a big impact on the problem, but I don’t know that they’ve completely solved it yet,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/19/turned-cancer-researcher-literature-watchdog/">Jennifer Byrne</a>, leader of the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/research-centres/publication-and-research-integrity-in-medical-research-primer.html">Publication and Research Integrity in Medical Research</a> group at the University of Sydney in Australia, said that Hindawi’s practice of intentionally limiting the information in retraction notices should be balanced with the need for transparency. “It would be helpful for future retraction research scholars if at least some specific information about the reasons for retraction were disclosed,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne also said verifying the identities of guest editors for special issues is not enough to ensure quality, as “many guest editors could have superficially convincing credentials, ‘supported’ by publications from paper mills.” The difficulty will grow “as publications from paper mills become increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect,” she predicted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather, the topics submitted with proposals for special issues “deserve more stringent scrutiny,” she said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Catch-all, duplicative special issue topics invite paper mill submissions, particularly in fields where genuine research remains very difficult, expensive and/or slow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">Cyril Labbé</a>, who with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/09/how-thousands-of-invisible-citations-sneak-into-papers-and-make-for-fake-metrics/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/16/whats-in-a-name-made-up-authors-are-penning-dozens-of-papers/">Alexander Magazinov</a> developed the <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, praised the whitepaper’s acknowledgement of sleuths who “are working daily, most often pro-bono, to fix the work that has not been done properly by publisher.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac added to the whitepaper’s list of recommendations for other publishers: “fund sleuths and credit them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/scientific-publishing/retraction-she-wrote-dorothy-bishops-life-after-research/">Dorothy Bishop</a>, who has examined paper mill activity in Hindawi special issues <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6mbgv">in depth</a>, said she was “very pleased to see the publisher has at last grappled with the need for retractions ‘at scale.’” Banning editors and authors associated with paper mills is “a great step in the right direction, especially if they can share information about banned individuals with other publishers,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Bishop critiqued the framing of the document:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The report presents Hindawi as a victim of an &#8220;academic culture of ‘publish or perish’, which has incentivized unethical behaviour&#8221;. What it omits is the influence of the commercial publisher culture of greed, which aims for massive growth in the number of published papers, with associated growth in profits.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By her calculations, Hindawi would have brought in millions of dollars from article processing charges for now-retracted papers: “The authors of these articles don&#8217;t get their money back.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comet-tails-mucus-marine-snow">Invisible comet tails of mucus slow sinking flakes of ‘marine snow’</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — Tiny, sinking flakes of detritus in the ocean fall more slowly thanks to the goop that surrounds each flake, new observations reveal.</p>



<p>The invisible mucus makes “comet tails” that surround each flake, physicist Rahul Chajwa of Stanford University reported November 19 at the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting. Those mucus tails slow the speed at which the flakes fall. That could affect the rate at which carbon gets sequestered deep in the oceans, making the physics of this sticky goo important for understanding Earth’s climate.</p>





<p>Although scientists knew the goo was a component of the “marine snow” that falls in the ocean, they hadn’t previously measured its impact on sinking speed.</p>



<p>Marine snow is made of dead and living phytoplankton, decaying organic matter, feces, bacteria and other aquatic sundries, all wrapped up in mucus that&#8217;s produced by the organisms. Like the gunk known for clogging airways during respiratory virus season, the mucus is what’s called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-feather-sperm-flock-together">viscoelastic fluid</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/16</em>). That’s something that flows like a liquid but exhibits elastic behavior as well, springing back after being stretched.</p>



<p>This underwater blizzard is not easy to study. When observed in the ocean, the particles sink swiftly out of view. In the laboratory, the particles can be viewed for longer periods, but the trek ashore degrades the delicate marine snow and kills the living organisms within it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Marine snow TK | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pz52ysYeX58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tiny particles (white dots) within a seawater-filled chamber were used to measure the rate at which fluid flows around this flake of marine snow as it falls. The chamber is designed to keep the sinking snowflake in view of the camera.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So Chajwa and colleagues built a physics lab at sea. Aboard a research vessel in the Gulf of Maine, the team collected marine snow particles in traps 80 meters below the water’s surface. Then they loaded their catch into a device onboard, designed to observe the particles falling.</p>



<p>Nicknamed “the gravity machine,” it’s a fluid-filled wheel that rotates in order to keep an individual flake in view of a camera. It’s a bit like a hamster wheel for falling debris. As the flake sinks, the wheel turns so as to move the snow in the opposite direction, allowing the snowfall to be observed indefinitely. The gravity machine was itself mounted on a gimbal designed to stave off sloshing from the rocking of the ship.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a very nice compromise between the real marine snow that you get in the ocean versus what you can do practically in the lab,” says biophysicist Anupam Sengupta of the University of Luxembourg, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>To observe how the fluid flowed around the particles, the researchers added tiny beads within the fluid in the gravity machine. That revealed the rate of fluid flow around the particles. The speed of fluid flow was slowed in a comet tail–shaped region around the particle, revealing the invisible mucus that sinks along with the particle.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3134330" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121123_ec_marine-snow_inline1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="525" class="image-compare__image-before" /><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3134338" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121123_ec_marine-snow_inline2-1.jpg?resize=680%2C525&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="525" class="image-compare__image-after" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><figcaption>Marine snow particles (one shown) are surrounded with invisible mucus.

Slower speeds (yellow) reveal mucus that trails the flake in a comet tail–shape (red dotted line). <span class="credit">Left: Rahul Chajwa and Manu Prakash/PrakashLab/Stanford University</span><span class="credit">Right: Rahul Chajwa and Manu Prakash/PrakashLab/Stanford University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The particles sank at speeds up to 200 meters per day. The mucus played a big role in sinking speed. “The more the mucus, the slower the particles sink,” Chajwa says. On average, the mucus causes the marine snow particles to linger twice as long in the upper 100 meters of the ocean as they otherwise would, Chajwa and colleagues determined.</p>



<p>If it falls deep enough, marine snow can sequester carbon away from the atmosphere. That’s because living phytoplankton, like plants, take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. When phytoplankton form marine snow, they take that carbon along with them as they sink. If a flake reaches the ocean floor, it can settle into a scum at the bottom that caches that carbon over long time periods. The faster the particles sink, the more likely they are to make it to the abyss before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-squid-fossil-ancestor-cephalopod-fierce-hunter">being eaten by critters</a> (<em>SN: 6/23/22</em>).</p>





<p>Knowing how fast the particles sink is important for calculating the ocean’s impact on Earth’s climate, and how that might change as the climate warms, the researchers say. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/southern-ocean-human-carbon-dioxide-emissions-sink-climate">The oceans are major players</a> in the planet’s carbon cycle (<em>SN: 12/2/21</em>), and scientists estimate that oceans have taken up roughly 30 percent of the carbon dioxide released by humans since industrialization. Chajwa and colleagues hope that their results can be used to refine climate models, which currently do not take the mucus into account.</p>



<p>So this mucus is nothing to sneeze at. “We’re talking about microscopic physics,” says Stanford physicist Manu Prakash, a coauthor of the work, which is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also reported in a paper</a> submitted October 3 at arXiv.org. “But multiply that by the volume of the ocean &#8230; that’s what gives you the scale of the problem.”</p>

<p>Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the former president of Stanford University who <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/19/stanford-president-resigns-over-manipulated-research-will-retract-at-least-3-papers/">resigned</a> earlier this year after an <a href="https://boardoftrustees.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/07/Scientific-Panel-Final-Report.pdf">institutional research misconduct investigation</a>, has retracted a paper from <em>Nature</em>. The journal’s editorial office marked another of Tessier-Lavigne’s articles with an expression of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two <em>Nature</em> papers – which have together been cited more than 1,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – were among five the university investigation examined on which Tessier-Lavigne was the principal author. The other three have been retracted – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/31/stanford-president-retracts-two-science-papers-following-investigation/">two from <em>Science</em></a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/05/former-stanford-president-retracts-1999-cell-paper/">one from <em>Cell</em></a>. In a <a href="https://tessier-lavigne-lab.stanford.edu/issues-five-papers-and-planned-actions">statement</a> posted to his lab website July 19, Tessier-Lavigne wrote that he planned to correct the two papers in <em>Nature</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07767">APP binds DR6 to trigger axon pruning and neuron death via distinct caspases</a>,” appeared in 2009. It has been cited 816 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06943-3">retraction notice</a> stated: </p>



<span id="more-128437"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors have retracted this article. Our subsequent work confirmed aspects of the article, notably that DR6 and APP interact and function in a genetic pathway involving caspases to control axon pruning and neuron death. However, our later research also showed that certain conclusions reached in the article were incorrect, notably the role of caspase-3, the necessity for beta-secretase enzyme activity for APP-DR6 binding, and the model for the APP-DR6 interaction.</p>



<p>More recently, the following anomalies were identified:</p>



<p>Figure 1d: the NGF-deprived +IgG panel appears to be identical to the NGF-deprived, 24h + Control IgG panel of Figure 5e.</p>



<p>Supplementary information Figure 9c: the NGF-deprived + Bax inhibitor control panel appears to be identical to the + anti-NGF control panel of Supplementary information Figure 17c.</p>



<p>Supplementary information Figure 6d: the fourth beta-Actin blot for Casp-3 siRNA appears to be identical to the first beta-Actin blot for Casp-6 siRNA.</p>



<p>Certain biostatistical calculations underlying some figures contained errors.</p>



<p>We believe that these additional anomalies do not affect the conclusions presented in the affected figures. However, given the lack of original data for several of these figures due to the age of the paper, and since our subsequent research showed that certain specific claims in the original article were not correct and we reported a correction for those claims elsewhere, we consider that the appropriate course of action is to retract the article. All the authors agree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The listed “anomalies” refer to images <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B6410F2AF1398E6F379B244E7520A1#2">PubPeer users raised concerns</a> about in February and March of this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne did not immediately respond to our request for comment. In his statement from July, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Importantly, the Panel found that allegations of fraud regarding this paper are “not accurate.”</p>



<p>That said, while most aspects of this paper have withstood the test of time, a number of its key findings required revision, which we addressed through subsequent publications. In addition, multiple anomalies in the paper have come to light in the past several months, and the investigation has uncovered certain inconsistent experimental results prior to publication. It is important to emphasize that I informed the Panel that I was unaware of these new issues prior to publication, and the Panel found no evidence to suggest otherwise. The Panel also found that the approach of publishing follow-on papers was “within the boundaries of normal scientific practice,” but that it was “suboptimal” not to additionally retract or directly correct the paper.</p>



<p>I agree with the Panel that it is important to issue a robust correction in Nature both to address the recently discovered anomalies and to explicitly spell out the revisions to certain key findings in the paper that we presented in subsequent papers but that would not necessarily be apparent to all readers of the Nature paper. I intend to issue such a correction as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article that now bears an expression of concern, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03080">The netrin receptor UNC5B mediates guidance events controlling morphogenesis of the vascular system</a>,” appeared in 2004. It has been cited 402 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice stated that <em>Nature</em> was publishing the expression of concern:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>to alert the readership that image integrity issues have been raised with some of the data. A report to the Stanford University board concluded that this article reflects evidence of manipulation of research data. We have considered the issues and find that the far-left lanes of the top and bottom panels of Supplementary Figure 2E appear to be duplicated. Given the age of the article there is insufficient information to conclusively assess how the duplication occurred. However, the authors have provided contemporaneous replicates that confirm the validity of the data presented in Supplementary Figure 2E.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne agreed to the journal’s decision, according to the notice. In his July statement, he’d written:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Issues with several figures in this paper were raised last December, which is when I first learned of them. The Panel found no evidence that I knew nor should reasonably have known of these issues. Two of the figures that have been questioned were generated in my laboratory. At least one of them shows evidence of manipulation of research data. Although one of my coauthors located primary data that confirms the result presented in the figure, it nevertheless requires a thorough correction. I am already in touch with the journal about this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In December 2022, a user on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/467FA67858F959040F2EABE876A7B3#1">posted concerns</a> about the figure called out in the expression of concern.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-first-discovery-research-2023">Here are some astounding scientific firsts of 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>Science experienced many first-of-a-kind feats this year. These are the groundbreaking achievements that grabbed our attention.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cosmic web shake-up </h4>



<p>Glowing threads of gas, galaxies and dark matter provided the first tangible evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shock-waves-shaking-universe-first">shock waves permeate the cosmic web</a>, the large-scale structure of the universe (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 14</em>). Simulations had predicted that colliding threads generate shock waves, which catapult charged particles into the web’s magnetic fields and create a faint glow. That aura appeared in data from radio telescopes, confirming the shock waves exist. The glow also provides the first (if indirect) peek at the cosmic web’s magnetic fields.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hats off</h4>



<p>After more than 50 years of searching, mathematicians finally found <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematicians-discovered-einstein-tile">an einstein tile</a> (<em>ein Stein</em> is German for “one stone”). The shape, dubbed “the hat,” fits with its mirror image to create an infinite pattern that never repeats (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 7</em>). Soon after, researchers discovered a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-einstein-tile-math">“vampire” einstein</a>, a shape that doesn’t require its mirror image to create an infinite nonrepeating pattern (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 9</em>). Einstein tiles and their unique balance between order and disorder could spur new discoveries in materials science.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fleeting debut</h4>



<p>The first appearance of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oxygen-28-instability-surprise-physics">oxygen-28</a>, a superheavy form of the element that physicists created in a particle accelerator, was much briefer than researchers had expected (S<em>N: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 4</em>). The isotope decayed almost immediately after forming, despite its atomic nucleus having full outer shells of protons and neutrons — a property that is typically linked with extra stability. Oxygen-28’s instability hints that something may be wrong with our understanding of the strong nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">RNA retrieval</h4>



<p>Scientists isolated and decoded RNA from an extinct creature for the first time. The fragile molecules, which help ensure that cells follow their DNA instruction manuals, were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-decode-rna-extinct-animal-tasmanian">extracted from a preserved Tasmanian tiger</a> held in a museum (<em>SN: 11/4/23, p. 10</em>). Researchers hope that the feat will aid efforts to bring back the wolflike marsupial, which is named after its homeland and died out in 1936.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Surviving a deep freeze</h4>



<p>Adult corals can be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/adult-coral-frozen-survive-climate-change">safely flash-frozen and revived</a>, researchers demonstrated, raising hopes that cryopreservation could be useful in coral conservation (<em>SN: 9/23/23, p. 11</em>). The key to preventing ice crystals from forming and damaging tissues is to bathe corals in a rigid metal container filled with a dehydrating solution before plunging them in liquid nitrogen. Whatever water remains in the tissues solidifies so quickly that it cannot crystallize and expand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1440" height="810" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=1440%2C810&#038;ssl=1" alt="Two yellowish branches of a finger coral from the species Porites compressa are pictured." class="wp-image-3130783" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=800%2C450&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=1030%2C580&amp;ssl=1 1030w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/083023_no_coralfreeze_feat.jpg?resize=1380%2C776&amp;ssl=1 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130783"><em>Porites compressa</em>, a finger coral, gets its name for its blunt branches.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Neutrino cartography</h4>



<p>A new <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-new-view-milky-way-space">map of the Milky Way</a> is the first made without using light. Instead, cosmic cartographers used data from a detector in Antarctica and AI to chart nearly massless particles called neutrinos onto the galaxy’s plane. The resulting image (third image below; optical and gamma-ray versions shown for comparison) offered a rough idea of where the first known high-energy neutrinos to originate in the Milky Way were born (<em>SN: 8/12/23, p. 13</em>). With some refinement, the approach could pinpoint their birthplace and those of other amped-up ghostly particles.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Every letter counts</h4>



<p>This year marked the completion of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-human-pangenome-biology-dna-diversity">the pangenome</a>, an effort to catalog every single letter, or building block, in humankind’s genetic instruction manual (<em>SN: 6/3/23, p. 6</em>). The undertaking involved compiling and comparing nearly all the DNA of 47 people to get the most comprehensive snapshot yet of human genetic diversity. A few months later, researchers added the final piece: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dna-telomere-chromosomes-pangenome">the Y chromosome</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/23 &amp; 10/21/23, p. 7</em>). The pangenome could shed light on the molecular foundations of fertility, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and more.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Star eats planet</h4>



<p>Astronomers have long suspected that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-astrophysicists-star-eating-planet">stars swallow up planets</a>, but no one had ever caught a star in the act until this year (<em>SN: 6/3/23, p. 8</em>). About 10,000 light-years from Earth, the sunlike star engulfed an orbiting planet that was about 10 times as massive as Jupiter. Over several days, the star grew noticeably brighter and burped a bunch of gas, suggesting it engulfed a companion star. But the relatively small amount of energy released tipped off researchers that the star had actually eaten a planet.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3-antarctic-glaciers-rapid-loss-climate-change">3 Antarctic glaciers show rapidly accelerated ice loss from ocean warming</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong> — Several Antarctic glaciers are undergoing dramatic acceleration and ice loss. Hektoria Glacier, the worst affected, has quadrupled its sliding speed and lost 25 kilometers of ice off its front in just 16 months, scientists say.</p>



<p>The rapid retreat “is really unheard of,” says Mathieu Morlighem, a glaciologist at Dartmouth College who was not part of the team reporting these findings.</p>



<p>The collapse was triggered by unusually warm ocean temperatures, which caused sea ice to retreat. This allowed a series of large waves to hit a section of coastline that is normally shielded from them. “What we’re seeing here is an indication of what could happen elsewhere” in Antarctica, says Naomi Ochwat, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who presented the findings December 11 at the American Geophysical Union meeting.</p>





<p>Hektoria Glacier, Green Glacier, and Crane Glacier sit near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, which reaches up toward South America. The crescent moon–shaped bay, called the Larsen B Embayment, once seemed stable. As these glaciers oozed off the coastline, their ice used to merge into a floating slab around 200 meters thick. This slab, called the Larsen B Ice Shelf, was about the size of Rhode Island and filled the entire bay.</p>



<p>Having existed for over 10,000 years, this ice shelf buttressed and stabilized the glaciers flowing into it. But during a warm summer in 2002, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-cracked-heat-major-hunk-antarctic-ice-shelf-shatters-and-drifts-away">it suddenly fragmented</a> into thousands of skinny icebergs (<em>SN: 3/27/02</em>).</p>



<p>Hektoria, Green, and Crane glaciers — no longer contained by the ice shelf — &nbsp;began to flow into the ocean several times faster than they had before, shedding billions of tons of ice over the next decade.</p>



<p>Then starting in 2011, the hemorrhaging slowed down. The thin veneer of sea ice that forms over the bay each winter began to persist year round, preserved by a series of cold summers. This “landfast ice,” attached firmly to the coastline, grew five to 10 meters thick, stabilizing the glaciers. Their floating tongues gradually advanced back into the bay. But things changed abruptly in early 2022. On January 19 and 20, the landfast ice disintegrated into fragments, which drifted away.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3134274" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121423_df_glacier-retreat_jan16_inline.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="537" class="image-compare__image-before" /><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="3134273" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121423_df_glacier-retreat_jan26_inline.png?ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="537" class="image-compare__image-after" /></div><figcaption>Satellite images taken just 10 days apart reveal the dramatic breakup of sea ice in Antarctica&#8217;s Larsen B Embayment.

<p>Using data from ocean buoys farther north, Ochwat and colleagues determined that a series of powerful waves, higher than 1.5 meters, had swept in from the northeast — cracking apart the landfast ice. Those waves were highly unusual for this area.</p>



<p>The Southern Ocean, which encircles Antarctica, holds some of the world’s roughest waters. The Antarctic Peninsula extends up into this turbulent region, but its east side, where the Larsen B Embayment sits, rarely feels the waves. It is normally protected by several hundred kilometers of pack ice — floes of sea ice, pressed together by ocean currents — that dampen the waves, leaving the waters near Larsen as flat as a mirror.</p>



<p>In 2022, water temperatures near the surface of the Southern Ocean rose several tenths of a degree Celsius <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00961-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher than normal</a>, causing pack ice to shrink and peel away from the peninsula. This exposed the area to waves, which then broke up the landfast sea ice.</p>



<p>The glaciers accelerated as their floating tongues, no longer held in place, fragmented into bergs. Crane Glacier lost 11 kilometers of ice, nearly erasing its floating tongue; Green Glacier lost 18 kilometers, encompassing all of its floating ice.</p>



<p>Hektoria lost all 15 kilometers of its floating ice — followed by another 10 kilometers of ice that is normally more stable, because it rests on the seafloor. That “is faster than any tidewater glacier retreat that we know of,” Ochwat says.</p>





<p>The previous standout, Alaska’s Columbia Glacier, had lost 20 kilometers of ice in 30 years, records show. But Hektoria lost its 10 kilometers of nonfloating ice in just five months — including 2.5 kilometers that crumbled in a 3-day period.</p>



<p>All of this suggests that people trying to predict sea level rise need to consider sea ice, Morlighem says. Up until now, “its role in [glacier] dynamics has been completely ignored.”</p>



<p>Ochwat is waiting to see what will happen as the current Antarctic summer heats up between December and March. Hektoria and the other glaciers have been retreating only during summer months, when sea ice is absent; they pause during winter, when the surface of the bay freezes for a few months.</p>



<p>If Antarctic sea ice continues to shrink, as it has since 2022, it could spell trouble, says study coauthor Ted Scambos, a glaciologist also at UC Boulder. “You’re going to have a longer section of coastline where wave action can act on the front of ice shelves and glaciers,” potentially accelerating glacial retreat.</p>

<p>A psychologist in Australia has earned a pair of retractions after publishing several papers with international coauthors suspected of authorship fraud, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.drkellyallen.com/">Kelly-Ann Allen</a>, an associate professor at Monash University, in Clayton, and editor-in-chief of two <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=rdvp20">psychology</a> <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/jbhc/jbhc-overview.xml?language=en">journals</a>, declined to comment for this article.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1339783/full">retraction</a> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1285087/full">notices</a>, both in Frontiers journals, cite an investigation by the publisher confirming “a serious breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics.”</p>



<span id="more-128425"></span>



<p>Frontiers pulled “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.894316/full">Intolerance of uncertainty scale-12: psychometric properties of this construct among Iranian undergraduate students</a>” on November 27 and “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.866816/full">Psychometric assessment of the Persian translation of the interpersonal mindfulness scale with undergraduate students</a>” on September 4. The latter was one of more than three dozen papers the publisher has linked to “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/08/frontiers-retracts-nearly-40-papers-linked-to-authorship-for-sale/">the unethical practice of buying or selling authorship</a>,” as we reported at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The articles have been cited 21 times.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Nick Wise</a>, a scientific sleuth, told Retraction Watch he had reported the former paper to Frontiers in October 2022 “due to suspicions about authorship.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The cause of my suspicion was the diversity of nations and disciplines amongst the authors, and the presence of repeat offenders for buying authorship in Wanich Suksatan, Indrajit Patra and Supat Chupradit,” Wise said.</p>



<p>All three individuals have had papers pulled in the past over concerns about authorship, according to the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx">Retraction Watch database</a>. Those retractions happened after the two papers published by Frontiers were submitted.</p>



<p>Suksatan and Chupradit have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/thai/articles/c1vn0yqvgq1o">suspected of buying authorship</a> of research papers to boost their resumés, as have <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/10/19/the-incredible-collaborations-of-renaissance-men-and-women/">others of Allen’s coauthors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wise even found a Facebook post <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/3280679479CFC3AB3E59F6C3DCD2E2#4">advertising authorship for sale</a> for a paper that looked very similar to the article that was pulled on September 4. The ad was posted by Salim Kallel, about whom we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/13/after-a-sleuth-reveals-a-paper-with-authorships-advertised-for-sale-its-retracted/">written before</a> and whose <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100069291131516">Facebook profile</a> includes frequent “calls for coauthorship.”</p>



<p>“Wonderful opportunity to publish a paper in Scopus or Web of Science in collaboration with the authors from all over the world,” Kallel promised in one post on December 5.</p>



<p>Abbas Abdollahi of Alzahra University in Tehran, Iran, who is a corresponding author on the two retracted papers, did not respond to an email asking for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Allen has published multiple papers with Abdollahi. Starting in 2022, however, academics from several other countries – including Thailand, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia – started appearing as coauthors on Abdollahi and Allen’s papers, Wise said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He listed four such publications, in addition to those now retracted:</p>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12646-022-00641-2">Courage: A Potential Mediator of the Relationship Between Personality and Social Anxiety</a>.”</li>



<li>“<a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-022-00776-x">The compassionate love for humanity scale (CLS-H-SF): psychometric properties of the Persian version</a>.”</li>



<li>“<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306624X221110811">Psychometric Properties of the Reflective Function Questionnaire in Iranian Prisoners</a>.”</li>



<li>“<a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04470-5">Self-care behaviors mediates the relationship between resilience and quality of life in breast cancer patients</a>.”</li>
</ul>



<p>“I contacted Kelly-Ann Allen in January 2023 because I was surprised to see her name on a paper with Wanich Suksatan, Supat Chupradit and Indrajit Patra, given their history of being authors of works where authorship has been advertised for sale on Facebook,” Wise said. “She said that she’d done a lot of work for the paper and trusted Abbas Abdollahi whom she had worked with before.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Anastasia Long, head of communications at Frontiers, told us in an email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The retraction decision was a result of a thorough investigation by the Frontiers’ Research Integrity team. The concerns over ‘authorship for sale’ were flagged post-publication both directly to us by concerned readers, as well as via Pubpeer, a valuable source of community feedback, of the adverts for several of the publications in question. Subsequently, our Research Integrity and Auditing teams investigated dozens more papers spanning 24 journals, and looked at patterns in behavior, editorial assignment, peer review and citations. </p>



<p>For the two articles you mention, several authors were added post-acceptance with claims of their significant contribution to the research. The presence of adverts selling authorship, the lack of expertise of some authors with regards to the subject matter of the articles, and broad geographical diversity of the contributors – with lack of prior collaboration, were key points of the investigation. One author also contacted us to claim that their name had been added to the article without their consent. Taken together, the evidence confirmed a breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics, resulting in retractions. </p>



<p>Frontiers&#8217; priority is to protect the scientific record, while upholding the highest ethical standards and rigor, and we are confident in our decision. Moreover, to help prevent cases of “authorship-for-sale” among its research publications, Frontiers published <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/policies-and-publication-ethics#changes-in-authorship">a new author policy</a> and you can learn more about it in our <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/09/04/frontiers-implements-new-policy-to-counter-authorship-for-sale/">blog post</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/08/frontiers-retracts-nearly-40-papers-linked-to-authorship-for-sale/">reported earlier</a>, the new policy states the publisher will deny authorship changes requested after acceptance as a rule.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-mystery-illness-kennel-cough">Here are 5 questions about the mystery dog illness making news</a></h4>

              
                <p>In recent weeks, claims about a mysterious respiratory illness sickening dogs across the country have spooked pet owners.</p>



<p>Dogs with what veterinarians have dubbed “atypical kennel cough” show more persistent and severe symptoms than those caused by run-of-the-mill kennel cough: a coldlike condition caused by a grab bag of viruses and bacteria. Many ill dogs have failed or been slow to respond to existing treatments. Some have even died.</p>



<p>Efforts to pin down a culprit have so far yielded more questions than answers. That’s fed fears of a new contagion. When Michelle Hiskey’s dog Sheba fell ill, for instance, her friends and family members blew up her phone with texts, concerned about what some on social media branded “COVID for dogs.” Hiskey, a freelance writer in Decatur, Ga., is “not generally a worrier,” but the horror stories she heard did startle her, she says.</p>





<p>Experts, including those who had previously sounded alarm bells, now say there’s most likely a simple explanation behind the cases. Here’s what we know and what still remains unknown.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s different about this mystery dog illness?</h4>



<p>It’s not unusual for dogs to occasionally catch kennel cough, a chest infection that manifests most clearly in a honking cough, runny nose and sneezing. But beginning in late 2022 and surging the summer of 2023, more and more dogs seemed to be showing up to clinics, sicker than usual.</p>



<p>Cases of kennel cough are typically mild and resolve within a week or two. Dogs with atypical kennel cough can be feverish and fatigued on top of their other symptoms, and their symptoms can linger for several weeks. Taking antibiotics does not often lead to much improvement.</p>



<p>In some suspected cases, dogs have gone on to develop pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that in rare occasions can be deadly, says Mike Stepien, a spokesperson from the United States Department of Agricultural Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is aiding state laboratories with diagnostic testing.</p>



<p>For Sheba, who first began hacking and wheezing at the start of November, two rounds of the antibiotic doxycycline and temaril-p, an anti-inflammatory drug, have significantly reduced but not eliminated her symptoms. She needs to be symptom-free for seven days to be declared healthy, but she still hasn’t gone a full week without coughing. “I just keep starting the clock again,” Hiskey says.</p>



<p>It can be normal for dogs to respond poorly to treatment, says Colin Parrish, a virologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. No antiviral drugs exist to combat kennel cough, and antibiotics sometimes have middling efficacy.</p>



<p>The standard prescription from veterinarians is rest and time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How many cases are there?</h4>



<p>No one knows for sure. No national program tracks diseases in dogs, making the count unclear, but so far, several hundred cases have been reported in over 16 states, from Rhode Island to California.</p>





<p>Oregon’s Department of Agriculture has launched a formal investigation into suspected cases of atypical kennel cough, counting more than 200 since August. In most states, however, reports remain anecdotal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s causing dogs to get sick?</h4>



<p>Scientists and public health officials do not yet know what is causing atypical kennel cough, but many doubt the cases all have one cause.</p>



<p>The small number of cases and the sporadic transmission patterns point away from a singular, highly contagious pathogen, says Jane Sykes, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.</p>



<p>A mixture of pathogens could instead be to blame, experts now say. A new bacterium or virus could be among them, but it’s unlikely to be the only or main contributor.</p>



<p>Tests for known pathogens such as canine parainfluenza virus or <em>Bordetella bronchiseptica</em> have come up negative, but by the time the dogs make it to a clinic, they are likely to have stopped shedding the pathogen (or pathogens) responsible for their illness. The uptick in severe kennel cough may be due to a “perfect storm” of factors, Sykes and several others argue.</p>



<p>Dog ownership has increased recently. The fraction of American households with at least one dog grew from <a href="https://www.avma.org/news/pet-ownership-rate-stabilizes-spending-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 to 45 percent between 2016 and 2022</a>, largely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, more than 65 million families now have dogs. At the same time, rates of vaccination have dropped for a variety of reasons, experts suspect, making pets more susceptible to disease.</p>



<p>Now, as employees return to the office and families travel for the holidays, pet dogs may increasingly end up spending stints in kennels and doggy day cares. Pathogens of all kinds can spread easily in those group settings, creating a nasty soup that poorly timed or poorly executed swabs may miss. Hiskey suspects her dog caught a bug at the dog park.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are scientists doing to solve the mystery of this illness?</h4>



<p>Veterinary diagnostic laboratories in Oregon, New Hampshire and Colorado are currently examining swabs collected from dogs with atypical kennel cough, but they have not reached definitive conclusions.</p>





<p>Researchers from the University of New Hampshire in Durham have <a href="https://colsa.unh.edu/new-hampshire-veterinary-diagnostic-laboratory/canine-respiratory-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a previously unknown bacterium</a> in a majority of 70 samples collected from dogs stricken ill in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. But they have yet to grow the bacterium in the lab, or to <a href="https://colsa.unh.edu/new-hampshire-veterinary-diagnostic-laboratory/canine-respiratory-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test the idea that it’s a driver of disease</a>, a notice on the lab’s website says.</p>



<p>The UNH researchers could not detect the organism in tissue samples collected from dogs in 2018, long before the outbreak, but such a finding does not clarify the role the mystery bacterium plays — or does not play — in disease. The organism could be innocuous, or could worsen preexisting illness, rather than cause it.</p>



<p>The researchers are now examining more recent samples collected from Oregon, Colorado and other Midwestern states to see if they contain the bacterium, too.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What can dog owners do to protect their pets?</h4>



<p>Keeping pets up-to-date on their vaccinations can reduce the risk of kennel cough.</p>



<p>Limiting interactions with other dogs, particularly those that may be ill, can help as well. Outbreaks tend to cluster in dog kennels, day cares and parks — places where animals crowd together. There’s no reason to panic, experts say, or to dramatically alter plans. Small precautions should suffice.</p>



<p>If your dog does exhibit symptoms, particularly those that do not improve with time, it’s best to call your veterinarian.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/IMG_0880_Faroe_Islands-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong>Genetic population isolate </strong></p>
<p>Archaeological research suggests that the Faroe Islands were founded in two pre-Viking phases around 300-500 AD and 500-700 AD, before the Viking settlements in the 9th century.</p>
<p>This population is well-suited for genetic research because it was geographically isolated. Indeed, the current population of about 50,000 people is believed to descend from a low number of settlers, who thus had few opportunities to find a partner. This is called a bottleneck effect, which often leads to inbreeding from mating between close relatives.</p>
<p>SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are mutations of single DNA-bases, A, C, G, or T, at specific positions in the DNA sequence as compared with a reference genome. Each person has over 3 million SNPs, and these are of great interest in genetic research.</p>
<p>People have two copies of chromosomes, one from each parent. Therefore, we inherit two identical or two different copies of each SNP. The two copies, denoted genotypes, are called homozygotes if the copies are identical and heterozygotes if the copies are different.</p>
<p>SNP heterozygosity <em>H </em>is a measure of genetic diversity. It is the number of heterozygous genotypes divided by the total number of genotypes. High and low <em>H </em>means, respectively, a high and low genetic diversity. It is desirable to have high <em>H </em>because a low genetic diversity and inbreeding can increase the risk of genetic diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic diversity and inbreeding </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-023-09763-x">In this paper</a>, the whole genomes of a small sample of the population are analysed using bioinformatic methods. The results show that <em>H </em>is relatively high for individual samples because individuals have many private SNPs, likely of recent origin. On the contrary, <em>H </em>is low for the SNPs that are shared by the population and therefore are likely of older origin.</p>
<p>Long sequences of SNPs that mainly contain homozygous genotypes are called <em>ROHs </em>(runs of homozygosity). In the paper, <em>ROHs </em>are used to estimate the inbreeding in the Faroese population as compared to both modern and ancient European populations. The inbreeding of the Faroese population is high compared to European populations and population isolates. Thus, it has inbreeding which is more similar to ancient Europeans.</p>

<p><strong>Two methods to estimate relatedness </strong></p>
<p>To estimate the relatedness between individuals, two methods based on whole genomes were investigated. One of the methods (KING kinship) cannot distinguish between ancient and recent relatedness. Therefore, all the supposedly unrelated participants seemed very closely related as siblings or parent-offspring relationships. However, using a method based on <em>ROHs</em>, the author is able to show that the high relatedness is of ancient origin.</p>
<blockquote><p>In this study, the author discovered a bottlenecked and consanguineous population event and estimated it starting around 50-300 AD.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The bottleneck effect from the founding event </strong></p>
<p>Then a search for the bottleneck effect was carried out. An older genetic study of the Faroese population was unable to find such an effect. In this study, the author discovered a bottlenecked and consanguineous population event and estimated it starting around 50-300 AD.</p>
<p>The higher limit of this estimate agrees with the oldest archaeological findings from the Faroe Islands, while the lower limit suggests that the founding event may have occurred about 2-3 centuries earlier than previously believed based on archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>After the founding event, the bottleneck effect increased from about 300 AD to 600 AD, where it was the highest. Thereafter, the bottleneck effect slowly decreased, most likely from an increase in the population size from the arrival of new settlers.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison with the 1000 Genome Project </strong></p>
<p>Other results in this study were about ancestry and clustering (Multidimensional Scaling) as compared with the international <a href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/">1000 Genome Project,</a> where whole genomes from several different populations were studied.</p>
<p>The Faroese results about ancestry showed that the study participants descended from founders of mainly European ancestry (&gt;99% probability) and possibly some admixed American ancestry (&lt;1% probability).</p>
<p>The study participants that cluster closest together are genetically most similar. The Faroese participants clustered all close together and distinctively away from the other populations but closest to the European and British populations of the 1000 Genome Project. Finally, the study showed that the Faroese people have many rare SNP variants. Such mutations are of great interest for genetic research.</p>

                <p><em>Following the launch of </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/">PLOS Complex Systems</a><em> earlier this year, we sat down with Editor-in-Chief Hocine Cherifi to learn more about his vision for the journal and developments in the field</em> <em>he&rsquo;s keeping an eye on.</em> <br><br></p>

          <p><strong>What is your vision for </strong><strong><em>PLOS Complex Systems?</em></strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My vision for this journal is to create the richest community possible around emerging tools and techniques that will shape the future of our world. Complexity as a discipline exists with different meanings around the world and different overarching philosophies. With <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> I hope that we can facilitate these important conversations on what makes something &lsquo;complex&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;complicated&rsquo; across traditional disciplines and the network community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p></p>



<p><strong>The journal has a broad, transdisciplinary scope, why is this important?</strong></p>



<p>Complexity is a field that transcends traditional boundaries&ndash;it is not uncommon to see a researcher study economic, social, or natural complex systems at once. As such, the journal must be able to accommodate the broad range of interests many researchers in this space have. When we bring that all together, we can learn from each other. We want <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> to be a space where researchers can connect and share approaches that they might not have discovered otherwise.</p>



<p>It is also a field that is growing rapidly, and this means more and more scientists are starting to use complex systems analysis tools. The journal must be accessible to people who consider themselves a biologist or sociologist, and encourage the diversity of perspectives and expertise that they bring to the community.</p>



<p>In this, I would like to highlight our commitment to constructive peer review. Building the journal&rsquo;s editorial board was an intensive and intentional process, and I am very grateful for the time they have lent us so far, and will continue to invest in the journal. Their expertise is invaluable, and I am thrilled we can count on them to set the standard for the quality of research and discourse seen in <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em><em><sub>.</sub></em></p>



<p><strong>What developments are occurring in your field of expertise that excite you currently?</strong></p>



<p>The thing that excites me most is the growth of dedicated coursework and degree programs for complex systems and networks. This is recognition of the importance of complexity science by academia as a whole and I am excited to see how students in these programs think, as well as the problems they want to address. My hope is that these programs will embrace the need for collaboration and subject expertise as well as inspire curious students.</p>



<p><strong>How will Open Science play a key role in the journal achieving its vision and advancing the field?</strong></p>



<p>Open Science is inclusive, transparent, and flexible, making it the optimal way to communicate complex networks research from across a range of disciplines to all its possible audiences. Open Science also increases visibility and reusability, not just of the research article, but the underlying methods and data of the research itself, which creates an opportunity for a wider community to further test and build from these components<br><br>This is particularly vital to ensuring that the datasets and methodologies that researchers create and leverage are properly vetted. With the prevalence of machine learning models, we must be conscientious of the data we use and the risk of perpetuating inequalities that may be hidden in these tools.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cop28-fossil-fuels-climate-change">COP28 nations agreed to ‘transition’ from fossil fuels. That’s too slow, experts say</a></h4>

              
                <p>Days of contentious wrangling in Dubai at the United Nations’ 28th annual climate summit ended December 13 with a historic agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels and accelerate climate action over the next decade. The organization touted the agreement as a moment of global solidarity, marking “the beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era.</p>



<p>But the final agreement reached at COP28, signed by nearly 200 nations, did not include language that explicitly mandated phasing out fossil fuel energy, deeply frustrating many nations as well as climate scientists and activists.</p>





<p>The agreement is considered <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop28-agreement-signals-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the world’s first “global stocktake</a>,” an inventory of climate actions and progress made since the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">2015 Paris Agreement</a> to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>).</p>



<p>It acknowledges the conclusions of scientific research that greenhouse gas emissions will need to be cut by 43 percent by 2030 compared with 2019 levels, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. It then calls on nations to speed up climate actions before 2030 so as to reach global net zero by 2050 — in which greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere are balanced by their removal from the atmosphere. Among the actions called for are increasing global renewable energy generation, phasing down coal power and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.</p>



<p>But among many scientists gathered in San Francisco at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting to discuss climate change’s impacts to Earth’s atmosphere, polar regions, oceans and biosphere, the reaction to the language in the agreement was more frustrated than celebratory.</p>



<p>“The beginning of the end? I wish it was the middle of the end,” says climate scientist Luke Parsons of the Nature Conservancy, who is based in Durham, N.C. “But you have to start somewhere, I guess.”</p>



<p>It is a step forward, says Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “Saying it out loud, that we are aiming to phase out fossil fuels, is huge.”</p>



<p>It’s not a moment too soon: The globe is already experiencing many climate change–linked extreme weather events, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-12-months-hottest-record-climate">the hottest 12 months ever recorded</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/23</em>). Still, Scambos says, “it’s a tribute to the science and the negotiators that we can take this step now, before the disastrous global impacts truly get underway.” But, he added, “I fear that the pace [of future climate action] will … still be driven by impacts arriving at our collective doors.”</p>



<p>Other researchers had a grimmer take.</p>



<p>“It was weak sauce,” says climate scientist Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania. “What we really need is a commitment to phase out fossil fuels, on a very specific timeline: We’re going to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent this decade, bring them down to zero mid-century. Instead, they agreed to transition away from fossil fuels — the analogy that I use is, you’re diagnosed with diabetes, and you tell your doctor you’re going to transition away from doughnuts. That’s not going to cut it. It didn’t meet the moment.”</p>



<p>Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, called the agreement “deeply disappointing and misleading,” noting that it didn’t include any language specifically calling for phasing out fossil fuels. Furthermore, he says, “COP28 keeps entertaining the idea that 1.5 degrees Celsius may be achievable, but everyone is offtrack to meet that goal. [And] for ice sheets and glaciers, even 1.5 degrees is not sustainable.” &nbsp;There already are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">fears, for instance, that the melting of Greenland’s ice sheet can’t be stopped</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Even if the world stays close to that average temperature, “the ice sheets are going to be retreating,” says Rob DeConto, a glaciologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. “But you start getting out toward the end of the century, and all hell is going to break loose if we go much above 1.5. You’re talking about actually exceeding the limits of adaptation around so much of our coastlines.” &nbsp;</p>





<p>On December 12, the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service noted that the world has, in effect, <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/weve-lost-19-years-battle-against-global-warming-paris-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“lost” 19 years by delaying action to reduce fossil fuel emissions</a>. Back in 2015, climate projections suggested that Earth’s average temperature would reach the 1.5 degrees C threshold by the year 2045 — then 30 years away. Now, projections show that the planet may reach that benchmark by 2034, just 11 years in the future.</p>



<p>“We’ve got a shrinking window of opportunity,” Mann says. “And that window of opportunity will close if we don’t make dramatic and immediate reductions to our carbon emissions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-discoveries-2023-big-if-true">Here are some big-if-true scientific claims that made headlines in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>From ancient cannibalism to stars made of dark matter, 2023 delivered several scientific claims that could shake up their fields — if they shape up to be true.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Spark of life</h4>



<p>Early life on Earth may have gotten a boost from giant volcanic eruptions. A new look at debris from 10 eruptions millions of years ago suggests they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruption-nitrogen-lightning-life">contained a lot of nitrate that formed in the atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 6/3/23, p. 7</em>). The eruptions could have triggered fierce lightning that ripped apart molecular nitrogen, freeing nitrogen atoms to bond with other elements and form molecules useful to life — including nitrate. The same process may have happened billions of years ago, some scientists say, producing ingredients for early life. Scientists will need to account for the different chemical makeup of primordial Earth’s atmosphere to bolster that claim.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Butchered bone</h4>



<p>Purported tool marks on a 1.45-million-year-old fossilized leg offer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-hominids-stone-age-cannibalism">the oldest evidence of cannibalism among humans’ ancient relatives</a>, researchers contend (<em>SN: 8/12/23, p. 10</em>). The marks on the bone, found in Kenya, could have been made by some unidentified hominid using a stone tool to carve muscle away from the shin of another hominid. But a few bone nicks do not cannibal table scraps make, some paleoanthropologists say.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Overgrown galaxies</h4>



<p>A handful of galaxies from the very early universe are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-six-galaxies-old">up to 100 times as massive as expected</a>, data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope suggest (<em>SN: 3/25/23, p. 14</em>). The hefty galaxies not only challenge the idea that matter clumped together slowly over the universe’s lifetime, but also hint at some unknown way to fast-track galaxy formation. But the galaxies’ weights and distances must be confirmed with more detailed analyses of their light before astronomers rewrite cosmic history.</p>

<p>The thymus may not be inconsequential for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thymus-puberty-important-adults-cancer">adult health after all</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 7</em>). This immune system organ between the lungs is most active in childhood and withers with age, so it is often considered expendable in adulthood. In a study of more than 2,000 adults who had chest surgery, however, researchers reported that removing the thymus gland was associated with higher rates of death and of cancer within the next few years. Why thymus removal might be harmful remains unclear.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dead and buried?</h4>



<p>Honoring the dead may not be unique to big-brained hominids like <em>Homo sapiens</em> and Neandertals. <em>Homo naledi</em>, which lived around the same time as early <em>H. sapiens</em> but had an orange-sized brain, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-dug-cave-graves-carved-marks">intentionally buried bodies</a> in an underground South African cave, a group of researchers claims (<em>SN: 7/1/23, p. 6</em>). Other experts remain unconvinced, though. The supposedly buried bodies, which predate the earliest evidence of <em>H</em>. <em>sapiens</em> and Neandertal burials by 160,000 years, could have fallen through cave shafts or been washed by water into natural depressions in cave floors, skeptics say.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rocked to the core</h4>



<p>Separate studies both based on earthquake data are shaking up geologists’ concept of Earth’s heart. The solid inner core not only rotates but also appears to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-reverse-rotation">switch the direction of rotation</a> relative to the mantle and crust every few decades (<em>SN: 2/25/23, p. 7</em>). The inner core may also have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">a secret chamber</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 17</em>). Other data, however, hint that the inner core reverses every few years or does not rotate at all. And the supposed discovery of the innermost core hinges on a type of seismic wave that bounces around Earth’s interior, becoming weaker and more difficult to detect with every bounce. Thankfully, whatever is going on down there does not seem to endanger life on the surface.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dark matter stars</h4>



<p>The James Webb Space Telescope may have spotted stars made of dark matter — the unidentified stuff that makes up most matter in the cosmos (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 8</em>). So-called dark stars are so far hypothetical, but JWST <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-stars-dark-matter">observed three objects</a> giving off the kind of light expected from such stars. If they exist, dark stars could shed new light on star formation and the nature of dark matter. However, the pinpricks of light in JWST’s field of view could also come from normal stars, so astronomers will need more detailed data to tease out the objects’ true nature.&nbsp;</p>
