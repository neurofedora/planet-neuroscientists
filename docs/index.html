<p>Earlier this year, Marc Halushka, a pathologist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio,&nbsp; came across a review titled simply “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091674917315932">MicroRNA</a>,” an unusually short title in a big field. Looking deeper into the review, published in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology </em>in 2018, Halushka found it had been cited more than 2,000 times. He thought this number “shockingly high,” given the article’s brevity and content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(04)00045-5">Other</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(09)00008-7?cc=y&amp;mobileUi=0">older</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02871">reviews</a> on <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0804549105">microRNA</a> from leaders in the field have been cited far more often, some even tens of thousands of times. But when searching “microRNA” on Google Scholar, the review with that single term as its title is the first result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Halushka doesn’t think anything in the paper is wrong or out of date. But the citation was among those in a paper he was asked to review that he thought “was clearly a paper mill paper,” he told Retraction Watch. He suspects when people “who know nothing about microRNAs because they are just in the paper mill business” need to cite a review on the topic, they just use the top search result.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132825"></span>



<p>Such a scenario is a strong possibility. An analysis by David Robert Grimes, one of Retraction Watch’s first <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/27/meet-the-first-two-retraction-watch-sleuths-in-residence/">Sleuths in Residence</a>, found that of the 2,046 papers citing the “MicroRNA” review in Elsevier&#8217;s Scopus database, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/microRNA-citingpapers-Retracted-upload.pdf">18 of them</a> have been retracted. Many of the retraction notices describe recycled data and peer review concerns as reasons for the decision, which publishers often use to suggest paper mill activity. Six retractions came from Hindawi, an open-access publisher Wiley bought, then <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/06/wiley-to-stop-using-hindawi-name-amid-18-million-revenue-decline/">shut down</a>, after it became clear <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">paper mills</a> had <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">run amok in its journals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/12/authors-admit-they-published-the-paper-without-completely-studying-their-work/">covered the retraction</a> of one of the papers that cited the review. “The authors stated that they published the paper without completely studying their work,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The microRNA literature is a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/21/12058/6880717">hotspot for paper mill activity</a>, and researchers have quantified <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420092122">higher rates of retraction</a> for <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(24)00076-X">papers on microRNA</a> than related topics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marc Rothenberg, director of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio, and the corresponding author of the review, declined to comment for this story.&nbsp;He is an associate editor of the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Grimes also analyzed the journals in which papers citing the “MicroRNA” review appeared. Most citations – 52 – came from articles in the <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em>, an MDPI title. The journal with the next most papers citing the review, 39, was <em>Bioengineered</em>, a Taylor &amp; Francis title which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/08/web-of-science-clarivate-delist-bioengineered-paper-mill-cleanup/">lost its standing</a> in Clarivate’s Web of Science index earlier this year amid <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21655979.2025.2542668">struggles to purge</a> paper mill content from its pages. The journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21655979.2025.2525650">suspended new submissions</a> in July.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining journals in the top five titles citing the “MicroRNA” review are all from the open-access publisher Frontiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Grimes’ analysis of the affiliations of the authors citing the review, he found the 20 most frequent universities were all located in China. Just over 80 percent of the citations came from authors based at Chinese research centers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to the authors of 20 papers citing the review to ask why they had done so. Only one responded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We included it because it is a concise, widely-read overview of microRNA biology in the context of immune and allergic diseases, which we felt would be helpful as a background primer for readers less familiar with the field,” Bailin Niu, of Chongqing University, told us. He and his colleagues had cited it in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661825000210">review</a> of the role of microRNAs in liver damage from sepsis published earlier this year in <em>Pharmacological Research</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jennifer Byrne, director of biobanking for New South Wales Health in Australia and a paper mill researcher, told us entities churning out scientific papers for pay could have incorporated a citation to the review into a reusable template, but “it’s difficult to be sure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a citation to the review has been included in a template, the papers that cite it may have unexpected similarities, or there could be many papers citing the review in which “the citation seems unjustified,” she said.</p>



<p>Because the review is “quite technical,” citations would seem more relevant “when justifying experimental methods or discussing possible limitations of results,” Byrne said, not as a general overview of microRNA research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That said, if authors are simply opportunistically selecting this review as an accessible example of a miRNA review, we might also expect to see tangentially relevant citations, outside of any involvement of paper mills,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/09/what-is-the-impact-of-open-science-practice/">What is the impact of open science practice?</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a new study now available as a preprint on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20747">arXiv,</a> we explore the link between open science practices and citations for all publications with French authors over a 3-year period. The results of our analysis offer promising results with national importance: open science practices such as sharing data, code and preprints are linked to increased citations.</p>



<p>The study is co-authored by our own Director of Open Research Solutions, Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Open Research Manager, Lauren Cadwallader and Professor Giovanni Colavizza of the University of Copenhagen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our work to advance open science, we&rsquo;re committed to driving meaningful change by ensuring the solutions we design and promote are useful to the communities we serve. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/07/theres-more-to-research-than-citations-understanding-knowledge-sharing-practices-with-open-science-indicators/">Open Science Indicators</a> are one tool we&rsquo;ve developed to help us to measure trends and progress in open science behaviors, but we also take on <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">deeper investigations</a> to understand the needs, motivations, and <em>impact</em> of open science practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>France has a progressive national policy on open science and has been a leader in aspects of monitoring that policy. This made for a promising cohort to measure the effects of open science practices</p>



<p>The following announcement was published by the <a href="https://frenchopensciencemonitor.esr.gouv.fr/">The French Committee for Open Science</a> highlighting the importance of these findings to stakeholders in the region. Read the original post<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/for-the-first-time-on-a-scale-of-a-country-france-a-study-demonstrates-that-open-science-could-increase-the-chances-for-researchers-to-be-cited/"> here.</a></p>



<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For the first time on a scale of a country, France, a study demonstrates that Open Science could increase the chances for researchers to be cited</strong></h2>



<p><em>The authors chose to study France, a leading country in monitoring Open Science, and to use data from the French Open Science Monitor, that covers the entire country since 2018.</em></p>



<p>Public policies promoting open science aim to develop the circulation of knowledge across all levels of society. They seek to strengthen the international influence of academic research while promoting transparency, cumulative growth and reproducibility in research. By sharing research methods, materials and results, these policies encourage the wider dissemination of knowledge beyond the academic world to society, communities and the economic sector. These policies are implemented at the global (UNESCO), continental (European Union) and national (France) levels.</p>



<p>Measuring the impact of these open science policies is a major challenge in assessing the consequences of public policies and adapting future initiatives. Several studies have already established the impact in terms of citations for open science practices, although these studies often remain domain-specific.</p>



<p>For the first time, an international research team has conducted a comprehensive study covering an entire country and all disciplines. The authors, Giovanni Colavizza (Denmark), Lauren Cadwallader (United States) and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz (United States), chose to study France, a leading country in monitoring Open Science, and to use data from the French Open Science Monitor, that covers the entire country since 2018.</p>



<p>The study covers a considerable corpus of over 500,000 scientific articles. It reveals that each open science practice seems to be associated with an increase of the number of citations of the articles concerned. The results show that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An article published in open access is linked to 8.6% increase in citations compared to an article that is not open access.</li>



<li>An article sharing source code is linked to 13.5% increase in citations.</li>



<li>An article sharing data is linked to 14.3% increase in citations.</li>



<li>An article published as a preprint is linked to 19% increase in citations.</li>
</ul>



<p>These results vary considerably across disciplines and represent the average of diverse specific situations. For example, in medical research, data sharing is associated with a 34.9% increase in citations. In basic biology, publishing a preprint is associated with a 25.3% increase in citations. In the social sciences, sharing code related to a publication is associated with a 38% increase in citations.</p>



<p>This study does not close the book on open science research. The impact of open science needs to be assessed in many other fields, particularly beyond the academic world. However, it is a crucial first step and offers promising results regarding the academic impact of open science practices.</p>

<p>Starting around 2023, a curious trend took hold in papers on drug safety monitoring. The number of articles published on an individual drug and its link to specific adverse events went from a steady increase to a huge spike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data source in most of those articles was largely the same: The FDA Adverse Events Reporting System, or FAERS. In 2021, around 100 studies mining FAERS for drug safety signals were published. In 2024, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28%22case%2Fnon-case%22+OR+%22case-non-case%22+OR+%22case%2Fno-case%22+OR+%22Disproportionality%22+OR+%22Information+Component%22+OR+%22Reporting+Odds+Ratio%22+OR+%22Proportional+Reporting+Ratio%22+OR+%22multi-item+gamma+Poisson+shrinker%22+%29+AND+%28+%22FAERS%22%29&amp;sort=date">that number was 600</a>, with more than that already published this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two journals in particular published the bulk of these papers, <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em> and <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety</em>. In response to the flood, Frontiers started to require independent validation of studies drawing on public datasets. And <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>decided in late July to stop accepting submissions altogether that use the FAERS database for this particular type of study.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132828"></span>



<p>“By presenting mere statistical associations as ‘safety signals’, these publications can generate unjustified alarms with considerable impact on healthcare provider practices and patient behaviors,” Charles Khouri, a pharmacologist at Grenoble Alpes University Hospital in France, and colleagues <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17116885">wrote in a preprint</a> posted Sept. 14 that looks at the spike in pharmacovigilance studies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="496" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x496.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132830" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x496.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-300x145.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-768x372.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1536x744.png 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png 1704w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A bibliometric analysis of pharmacovigilance studies in PubMed, sorted by the adverse event repository used in the study, shows FAERS accounts for a large portion of the recent spike in studies. <br><em>Source: <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17116885">C. Khouri et al. 2025</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The work comes on the heels of sleuths identifying FAERS as one of several publicly available datasets being exploited by paper mills, pumping hundreds of often meaningless and sometimes misleading papers into the scientific literature.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">An open database,  <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers">FAERS</a> contains 31.8 million records voluntarily submitted to the FDA by healthcare professionals, patients and consumers on adverse events and medication errors related to drugs and biologics. While the database is useful flagging adverse events from newly approved drugs, it can be misused as a research tool.</p>



<p>“You can imagine in a large database with maybe millions of different drugs, millions of different adverse events, you can perform an infinite number of statistical analyses,” Khouri told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>FAERS is a voluntary reporting system, so “only an unknown proportion of all adverse events are reported,” Khouri said. And factors like a drug’s novelty or media attention can affect whether people report adverse events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That same selectivity and voluntary reporting structure affects the data in the <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html">Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System</a>, or VAERS, jointly managed by the FDA and CDC. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/15/rfk-jr-remarks-vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system-vaers-changes-indiana-maha/">vowed to overhaul VAERS</a>, even as those campaigning against the use of vaccines publish papers — often <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/19/paper-claiming-extensive-harms-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-be-retracted/">retracted</a> — using it. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-covid-vaccine-child-deaths-data-cdc-meeting-rcna230849">News outlets</a> have reported that Trump administration officials plan to present VAERS data later this week linking COVID-19 vaccines to at least 25 deaths in children who received the shots. As with FAERS data, raw reports in VAERS are unconfirmed, and any associations between an injury and a vaccine may be coincidental.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FAERS papers flooding the journals are a type of study called a disproportionality analysis, which can identify previously unknown side effects to drugs following their approval. “Maybe 60 to 70 percent of modifications in label information after the commercialization of drugs are coming from a pharmacovigilance database like FAERS,” Khouri said.</p>



<p>Khouri pointed to <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/34/6/1369/27208/Assessing-the-Association-of-Pioglitazone-Use-and">a disproportionality analysis</a> of a diabetes drug called pioglitazone that found a possible increased risk of bladder cancer. Further studies corroborated the risk and ultimately led to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-updated-fda-review-concludes-use-type-2-diabetes-medicine-pioglitazone">labeling changes</a> for the drug.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">From 2019 to 2022, <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>published single- to low double-digit numbers of these studies. That began to change in 2023 and exploded in 2024, when the journal published 174 disproportionality studies using FAERS, nearly 60 percent of the total papers it published that year – and as many papers as they had published in total in 2021.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<div class="flourish-embed flourish-table" data-src="visualisation/25146857"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25146857/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="table visualization" /></noscript></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>The number of disproportionality studies submitted to the journal “rose significantly,” a Taylor &amp; Francis spokesperson told us. “Even after we had put additional resource[s] in place to handle the journal’s pre-review assessments, this had become a challenging situation to manage,” the spokesperson said. “While disproportionality studies can make a useful contribution to the scholarly literature, such papers can include methodological problems, which led to the journal having a rejection rate of over 80%.”</p>



<p>In late July, Taylor &amp; Francis and the journal’s editor-in-chief, <a href="https://psychiatry.utoronto.ca/faculty/roger-mcintyre">Roger McIntyre</a>, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, decided “the journal will no longer consider unsolicited disproportionality studies using [FAERS] or similar spontaneous reporting databases,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ieds20/about-this-journal#aims-and-scope"> journal’s website now states</a>, “Such studies will only be considered when specifically invited by the journal&#8217;s editorial team.”</p>



<p>Two requests for interviews sent to McIntyre’s university email address were answered by Taylor &amp; Francis spokespeople. McIntyre, who is also the head of the Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology Unit at Toronto’s University Health Network, is a coauthor on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=AllField&amp;text1=FAERS&amp;field2=Contrib&amp;text2=mcintyre%2C+roger+s&amp;field3=AllField&amp;text3=disproportionality&amp;SeriesKey=ieds20&amp;SeriesKey=ieds20">five articles</a> in <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>that draw on data from FAERS. They include analyses of associations between <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2024.2361300">insomnia</a> drugs, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2024.2368827">ketamine</a> or <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2023.2295397">GLP-1 agonists</a> and suicide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August the journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/14740338.2024.2416243?needAccess=true">retracted a paper</a> based on FAERS for including a coauthor on the paper without his consent. “While no other disproportionality studies are currently under investigation by our Publishing Ethics &amp; Integrity team, we are conducting further checks on several articles in the journal,” the spokesperson said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><em>Frontiers in Pharmacology </em>also contributed to the flood of published studies drawing on FAERS. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28%28%22Frontiers+in+Pharmacology%22%5BJournal%5D%29+AND+%28%28%22case%2Fnon-case%22+OR+%22case-non-case%22+OR+%22case%2Fno-case%22+OR+%22Disproportionality%22+OR+%22Information+Component%22+OR+%22Reporting+Odds+Ratio%22+OR+%22Proportional+Reporting+Ratio%22+OR+%22multi-item+gamma+Poisson+shrinker%22+%29%29%29+AND+%28FAERS%29&amp;sort=date">The journal published</a> about 30 such studies in 2023 — and more than 120 in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2025, Frontiers introduced a policy across all of its journals requiring “independent external validation of all health-dataset studies,” Elena Vicario, head of research integrity at Frontiers, told us. The move followed a July 2024 policy requiring that validation for submissions using Mendelian randomization methods.  “The concern is not the use of FAERS itself but the risk of redundant analyses that add little new scientific understanding,” Vicario said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Frontiers in Pharmacology </em>has since updated its <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/about#about-scope">About page</a> to reinforce this policy, Vicario said. “Since July 2024, 739 FAERS submissions to <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology </em>have been rejected, with 9 published since the updating of the author guidelines in 2025.”</p>



<p>The bolus of newly published FAERS papers have some notable characteristics, Khouri has found, in collaboration with computer scientist and sleuth Cyril Labbé, also at Grenoble Alpes University, Emanuel Raschi from the University of Bologna, Alex Hlavaty from the University of Grenoble, and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, nearly 80 percent of these studies published in <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>between 2019 and 2025 are from authors affiliated with institutions in China. “Chinese authors were totally absent from the field before 2021,” Khouri said.</p>



<p>An analysis of the papers in <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety </em>revealed a few authors on multiple articles. At the top of the list is Bin Wu of Sichuan University in Chengdu, who has published <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28Wu%2C+Bin%5BAuthor%5D%29+AND+%28faers%29&amp;sort=date">27 disproportionality studies</a> based on FAERS, seven of which appear in <em>Expert Opinion on Drug Safety</em>. Li Chen, also of Sichuan University, has <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chen%2C+Li?startPage=&amp;SeriesKey=ieds20">six papers</a> in the journal, and Wei Liu of Zhengzhou University, is a coauthor on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Liu%2C+Wei?startPage=&amp;SeriesKey=ieds20">at least four</a> studies. Neither Wu, Chen or Liu responded to emailed requests for comment on their field of study, or particular interest in the FAERS database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the recent papers use multiple statistical methods for the disproportionality analysis, whereas researchers typically use only one method, because multiple tests are redundant. Other similar features across recent papers include a flow chart showing how data were selected, and a mirror plot showing “time to onset.” “We never saw that before,” Khouri said. “The information is quite useless to be twice plotted in the same figure.”</p>

Neither typically appears in pharmacovigilance studies.</figcaption></figure>



<p>And another shared feature of the recently published disproportionality analyses: “There is no research question,” Khouri said.</p>



<p>Many of the studies also reflect a lack of understanding of the drugs and conditions being described. As an example, Khouri pointed to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13533">a paper</a> finding a link between sildenafil and pulmonary hypertension as an adverse event — when in fact the drug is prescribed for that very condition.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Open databases like FAERS paired with the rise of generative AI have opened up a new era of automated paper generation by paper mills, posits Matt Spick, a lecturer in data analytics at the University of Surrey in England. In a July 9 preprint posted to <a href="http://medrxiv.org">MedrXiv.org</a>, he and colleagues recently identified five databases with anomalies in publishing rates that might indicate paper mill exploitation. Among them: FAERS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That analysis built on an earlier study Spick did that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/low-quality-papers-are-surging-exploiting-public-data-sets-and-ai">showed a rapid rise</a> in single-association studies published between 2021 and 2024 that drew on another open data source, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. While the analysis cannot attribute the increase to paper mills specifically, it offers a case study of a strategy paper mills may use, the authors wrote in a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003152">paper published</a> in May in<em> PLOS Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Once NHANES went online, as a paper mill, you were no longer being slowed down by your ability to acquire data, or copy images. You could download as much data as you wanted,” Spick told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The flood of papers coming out of these open databases, and FAERS in particular, can waste research dollars if investigators launch studies to validate the signals generated in these studies, Khouri said. And, importantly, these studies can also influence doctors and patients.&nbsp; “We know that when there are safety warnings disseminated in the literature, patients can stop the drugs,” he said. “Prescribers can be influenced by this kind of result, presenting a lot of adverse events for the drugs.”</p>



<p>Aside from the August retraction, only <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/9914931">one other paper</a> based on FAERS data has been <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/9842578">retracted</a>. The disproportionality analysis had appeared in <em>BioMed Research International </em>and was pulled as part of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">Wiley’s cleanup</a> of suspected paper mill activity and manipulated peer review in Hindawi journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That statistic wasn’t surprising to Khouri. “It&#8217;s very difficult to retract these articles for fraud, because there is no fraud,” he said. “The results are nonsense, there is p-hacking and high risk of false results. It&#8217;s useless papers, but they are not fake,” he said, quickly adding: “Probably.”</p>



<p>Khouri’s next steps are to dig further into patterns across these papers to see if they can identify common features. And Spick has been working on picking apart precisely how paper mills might use modern technology, including LLMs, to scrape open databases like FAERS and churn out papers at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It will be hard to force retractions for a lot of these, and then it becomes a whole philosophical thing for meta-scientists,” Spick said: “Should we allow all science to be published, even if it&#8217;s meaningless?”</p>

<p>I first became aware of the work of Drummond Rennie almost by accident: By borrowing his office. It was the summer of 1997, and as a rising fourth-year medical student, I was spending a month at <em>JAMA </em>as the co-editor-in-chief of its then-medical student section, Pulse. Rennie, who was deputy editor of the journal at the time, was mostly traveling, so the staff installed me in his office, overflowing with books and manuscripts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rennie, who <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/dr-drummond-rennie-memorial?id=59439985">died on September 12</a>, was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2RY3A_fLuY">towering</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/journalologists-use-scientific-methods-study-academic-publishing-their-work-improving">figure</a> in scientific publishing. Trained as a nephrologist, he joined the staff of the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in 1977, and later, <em>JAMA</em>, where he remained for decades. He was known for promoting improved standards in medical journals, and for organizing the first <a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/">Peer Review Congress</a>, held in 1989 and nine more times since, most recently earlier this month.</p>



<p>In 2013, we were just a few years into the work of Retraction Watch, and thought talking about what we’d learned so far at the Congress would be a good idea. We submitted an abstract outlining what we wanted to talk about, writing that we’d gather data by the time of the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132810"></span>



<p>That wasn’t going to work.</p>



<p>“We cannot go further unless we have some research in the form of data,” Rennie wrote to us in his characteristically sharp but highly constructive way. “The reviewers thought your abstract was pretty thin, and I agree. We know that you have the data and you have to think hard about what you are trying to say, remembering that the Peer Review Congresses were set up to present research, and not opinion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We ended up withdrawing the abstract because we didn’t have time to do the work that we agreed was necessary. But we also learned a lot, enough to be successful in being part of a few presentations in a later Congress. And we were always grateful when Rennie cited the work of Retraction Watch in calls for papers for the meeting.</p>



<p>Others will recount his work in other areas, but here, we wanted to share several passages of Rennie’s that illustrate his gift for a well-turned phrase in service of a sharp opinion or insight. Rest in peace, Drummond.</p>

<li><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/362902">Introducing the first Peer Review Congress</a>, <em>JAMA</em>, 1986:</li>
</ul>


<p style="padding-left: 40px;">“There seems to be no study too fragmented, no hypothesis too trivial, no literature citation too biased or too egotistical, no design too warped, no methodology too bungled, no presentation of results too inaccurate, too obscure, and too contradictory, no analysis too self-serving, no argument too circular, no conclusions too trifling or too unjustified, and no grammar and syntax too offensive for a paper to end up in print.”</p>

</ul>


<p style="padding-left: 40px;">“And it&#8217;s true that bringing in the peers does seem to make the process more democratic, though most editors would dislike the idea that they were not benign despots. But editors, most of whose working hours are spent oiling, balancing, and tuning the mechanisms of peer review, have a conflict of interest: symphonic conductors would probably be as much in favor of the retention of orchestras.”</p>


<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>On the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/403582">then-short history of federal U.S. agencies tasked with investigating scientific fraud</a>, writing with C. K. Gunsalus in <em>JAMA</em>, 1993:</li>
</ul>


<p style="padding-left: 40px;">“Scientists, however, seem to have been less able to accept the revelations than the general public, and a great deal less than members of Congress. Perhaps the difference can be explained by the fact that the Congress is composed largely of lawyers, who are not taught to trust easily. Our representatives correctly view themselves as custodians of the public purse and see plenty of evidence to counter the notion, seemingly prevalent among researchers, that scientific degrees endow their holders with the attributes of rectitude and honesty.”</p>

<li>On the <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-144-8-200604180-00123">lessons of the Eric Poehlman case</a>, writing with Harold Sox in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>, 2006:</li>
</ul>


<p style="padding-left: 40px;">“The ORI has neither the mandate nor the resources to lead the task of correcting a scientific literature polluted by fraudulent research. This responsibility lies with the community of scientists. When an ORI investigation ends with a finding of misconduct, the work is just beginning. Following the investigation, the community must identify all of a fraudulent author&#8217;s articles, publish retractions, and rid the literature of references to the fraudulent articles.”</p>

</ul>


<p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I arrived at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England Journal of Medicine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 1977, at the same time as its new Editor-in-Chief, Dr. Arnold Relman. It took 4 months before we met our first ethical issue. A physician wrote to point out that, on the same day that we had published an article to show that patients with chronic paranoid schizophrenia had low levels of monoamine oxidase in their platelets (Berger et al. 1978), another journal had published an article to show that levels in such patients were the same as in normals and other schizophrenics (Potkin et al. 1978). She also pointed out that though neither article referenced the other, they had two authors in common. When we challenged the authors, they justified their practice by asserting that it was not their custom to refer to unpublished work in a publication. (Wyatt and Murphy 1978). They, and no one else, had possessed information that completely undermined both their publications, so this disingenuous claim demonstrated at the very least a startling contempt for the process of publication. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">It was, for me at the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, the first of many. Adopting Jules Pfeiffer’s phrase, I came to call such academic tricks ‘‘little murders’’—not deserving to be hanging offenses, but destructive of the delicate web of trust between colleagues that keeps the whole enterprise functioning and afloat.”</p>


<ul class="wp-block-list">

Gunsalus in Retraction Watch, 2015:</li>
</ul>


<p style="padding-left: 40px;">“At a larger level, our question is this: if the coauthors cannot understand the data, how can the reader? Isn’t it the duty of those on the collaboration to understand it well enough to stand behind it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We don’t wish to suggest that it is easy to fulfill the obligations of a co-author or mentor. In reality, given the complexities of interpersonal relationships and the trust science requires, it can be difficult and daunting. Still, it’s the job.”</p>
